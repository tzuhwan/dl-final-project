      Primer.
      I #8217;ve
      tried
      sooo
      many,
      high
      end
      and
      drugstore
      and
      I #8217;ve
      come
      to
      the
      conclusion
      that
      it
      really
      doesn #8217;t
      make
      a
      difference
      in
      how
      my
      foundation
      looks,
      the
      longevity
      of
      it
      or
      the
      size
      of
      my
      pores.

      I
      bought
      the
      TF
      Gingerbread
      palette
      purely
      for
      the
      ridiculously
      cute
      packaging/smell
      knowing
      I
      don #8217;t
      really
      like
      TF
      shadows.
      I
      actually
      ended
      up
      loving
      the
      formula
      in
      it
      though!

      Matte
      orange
      or
      pink
      shadow
      in
      the

      Sometimes
      I #8217;ll
      switch
      it
      up
      and
      add
      a
      lid
      shade
      but
      I
      love
      the
      one
      shadow
      look

      it #8217;s

      I
      think
      it #8217;s
      fairly
      common
      to
      buy
      a
      product
      for
      the
      packaging,
      but
      has
      anyone
      bought
      a
      product
      for
      the
      name?
      I
      once
      bought
      a
      lipstick
      by
      Lorac
      because
      it
      was
      called
       #8220;Cat
      Lady #8221;
      (cause
      I #8217;m
      a
      total
      cat
      lady)
      and
      it
      was
      not
      a
      good
      lipstick.
      Haha.
      I
      didn #8217;t
      even
      really
      wear
      lipstick
      at
      the
      time
      but
      I
      loved
      the
      name
      so
      I
      bought
      it.

      Absolutely
      in
      love
      with
      this

      My

      I
      used
      a
      strong
      magnet
      to
      get
      the
      actual
      shades
      out
      (they #8217;re
      magnetic
      so
      there #8217;s
      no
      glue,
      super
      easy
      to
      do)
      and
      then
      I
      used
      a
      knife
      to
      get
      the
      shade
      separator
      plastic
      piece
      out.
      To
      give
      a
      visual,
      I
      put
      a
      knife
      in
      between
      the
      spot
      that
      I
      circled,
      [this
      space
      ](https://imgur.com/a/scTcGDR)
      and
      just
      popped
      it
      out
      (it
      doesn #8217;t
      matter
      if
      you
      break
      that
      part).
      Then
      I
      put
      a
      magnetic
      sheet
      on
      it
      and
      it #8217;s
      done!
      It #8217;s
      not
      going
      to
      be
      perfectly
      flat
      because
      there
      are
      things
      that
      stick
      out
      that
      I
      couldn #8217;t
      get
      off
      and
      wasn #8217;t
      going
      to
      attempt
      to,
      but
      you
      pretty
      much
      just
      can #8217;t
      put
      any
      shadows
      in
      the
      bottom
      of
      the
      palette
      or
      it
      won #8217;t
      close,
      it #8217;s
      not
      a
      big
      deal!
      It #8217;s
      a
      perfect
      travel
      palette
      cause
      it
      has
      a
      mirror.
      I #8217;m
      very
      happy
      with
      it

      Thank
      you!!
      I
      actually
      have
      tried
      dazzling
      on
      the
      lid
      with
      love
      in
      the
      crease
      and
      have
      loved
      just
      that
      recently
      but
      I
      didn #8217;t
      think
      to
      add
      wild
      child
      as
      a
      topper.
      Today
      I
      wanted
      something
      more
      light
      since
      I
      had
      to
      go
      to
      work
      so
      I
      did
      dreamer
      on
      the
      lid,
      love
      in
      the
      crease
      and
      wild
      child
      as
      a
      topper
      and
      I
      love
      how
      it
      turned
      out.
      I
      never
      really
      thought
      to
      use
      wild
      child
      as
      a
      topper,
      I
      always
      just
      wet
      my
      brush
      to
      build
      it
      up
      but
      it
      makes
      a
      really
      pretty
      topper!!

      haha.
      I
      actually
      did
      look
      up
      the
      prices
      cause
      I
      was
      curious
      and
      google
      said
      it
      ranges
      from
      $90-$120
      hr
      but
      that #8217;s
      for
      more
      than
      one
      mover
      and
      for
      ACTUALLY
      moving
      from
      one
      house
      to
      another.
      I
      asked
      him
      to
      HELP
      ME
      move
      shit
      across
      the
      room.

      The
      fact
      that
      he
      thought
      my
      mom
      would
      1.
      Side
      with

      Convince
      me

      MY
      Apple
      Watch
      that
      I
      received
      as

      Our
      other
      brother
      actually
      gave
      it
      to
      me
      as
      a
      gift
      ON
      MY
      BIRTHDAY.
      Was
      totally
      unexpected
      but
      much
      appreciated.
      When
      this
      brother
      had
      a
      birthday
      and
      didn #8217;t
      get
      an
      Apple
      Watch
      from
      him
      he
      made
      a
      scene
      lmaooo.
      Just
      more
      of
      an
      insight
      on
      how
      this
      brother
      is.
      My
      other
      brother
      and
      I
      don #8217;t
      get
      along
      with
      this
      brother
      because
      he
      acts
      like
      this

      many
      fucking
      stories
      about

      I
      could

      His

      I
      never
      said
      his
      math
      wasn #8217;t
      right.
      I
      said
      it
      wasn #8217;t
      valid
      because
      it #8217;s
      not
       #8220;moving
      labor #8221;
      so
      it
      wouldn #8217;t
      cost
      that
      much.
      PLUS
      the
      watch
      is
      worth
      way
      more
      than
      $50
      anyways.
