    <TEXT>I have a memory from about ten years ago, but what is weird is that my brother thinks it is his memory. Here is the story as I remember it: We were with our family floating on rafts down a lazy river when someone dropped a bag of chips in the water. I immediately got off of my raft and grabbed the bad so the chips wouldn #8217;t get ruined, but as I was going back to my raft the current pulled me under the water and I saw the rocks underneath it clearly, as if I could see underwater. I go to my raft and continued on the river. A few months later I was telling the story to my cousin and as I get into the part about seeing he rocks clearly underwater, my twin brother interrupts and says I #8217;m describing his memory. To this day we still don #8217;t know who actually  #8216;saved the chips #8217; and I guess we never will.</TEXT>
