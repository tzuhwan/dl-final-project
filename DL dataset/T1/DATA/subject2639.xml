      Confirming
      the
      first
      answer!
      Our
      camping
      isn't
      priced
      like
      a
      hotel
      per
      night;
      it's
      for
      the
      entirety
      of
      your
      stay,
      and
      you're
      welcome
      to
      stay
      from
      Wednesday
      through
      Monday
      morning
      following
      the
      race
      on
      Sunday.
      As
      long
      as
      you're
      within
      your
      spot,
      multiple
      tents
      with
      your
      vehicle
      are
      A-OK!
      GEICO
      Grounds
      Blue
      doesn't
      have
      a
      quiet
      time,
      so
      other
      campers
      aren't
      obligated
      to
      turn
      off
      music
      or
      their
      generators.
      It
      can
      get
      a
      little
      rowdy
      at
      night
      there
      as
      well.
      Blue
      is
      a
      great
      spot
      to
      camp
      because
      you're
      also
      close
      to
      Talladega
      and
      Eastaboga
      Blvd,
      which
      both
      get
      pretty
      fun,
      especially
      on
      Friday
      and
      Saturday
      nights
      -
      both
      with
      scheduled
      activities
      from
      us
      and
      then
      the
      parties
      our
      campers
      throw.
      For
      entry
      into
      the
      infield
      -
      our
      crossover
      Gate
      V9
      near
      Turn
      3
      is
      open
      24
      hours
      starting
      on
      Wednesday
      morning,
      with
      the
      exception
      of
      when
      there's
      on-track
      activity.
      You'll
      also
      be
      able
      to
      enter
      through
      the
      North
      Tunnel
      near
      Turn
      4
      since
      you
      won't
      be
      in
      an
      RV.
      So
      even
      if
      you
      get
      here
      a
      little
      later
      at
      night,
      you'll
      have
      no
      problem
      with
      entry.
      Shoot
      us
      a
      message
      if
      you
      have
      more
      questions!

      Hey!
      No
      full
      autograph
      sessions
      that
      we
      know
      of,
      but
      there
      will
      definitely
      be
      driver
      appearances
      in
      the
      Fan
      Zone
      at
      various
      displays.
      We're
      hoping
      to
      get
      a
      full
      list
      of
      finalized
      appearances
      with
      times
      and
      locations
      by
      today
      and
      tomorrow!
      As
      soon
      as
      we
      get
      them,
      we
      add
      them
      to
      our
      [weekend
      schedule](http://www.talladegasuperspeedway.com/Plan-Your-Visit/Weekend-Schedule.aspx).
      Hope
      that
      helps!
      Excited
      y'all
      will
      be

      He
      was
      just
      an
      incredible
      man
      and
      friend.
      We #8217;re
      blessed
      to
      have
      been
      able
      to
      know
      him
      for
      so
      long.
      He
      absolutely
      loved
       #8216;Dega
      and
      would
      do
      anything
      to
      help
      anyone.
      The
      tradition
      will
      continue;
      John
      Ray
      and
      his
      wonderful
      family
      own
      the
      truck,
      and
      his
      son
      Johnny
      is
      the
      one
      who
      drove
      it
      this
      April.
      We #8217;re
      so
      thankful
      Roger
      was
      able
      to
      be
      with
      us
      for
      so
      many
      special
      moments.
      His
      spirit
      will
      always
      be
      part
      of
      us.

      is
      from
      right
      down
      the
      road
      in
      Jacksonville,
      AL
      and
      grew
      up
      coming
      here.
      It's
      a
      special
      place
      for
      him
      and
      his
      family
      and
      friends.
      So
      awesome
      to
      bring
      it
      all
      back
      together
      full

      Just
      a
      note
      on
      garage
      admissions!
      Our
      [Talladega
      Garage
      Experience](https://www.talladegasuperspeedway.com/tge)
      is
      brand
      new
      -
      the
      grand
      opening
      is
      this
      October.
      It's
      part
      of
      our
      huge
      Transformation
      infield
      project.
      Fans
      can
      stay
      in
      that
      area
      or
      move
      up
      to
      the
      grandstands
      for
      the
      race.
      We
      always
      recommend
      sitting
      up
      high
      in
      the
      towers!

      We're
      still
      finalizing
      schedules,
      but
      it
      will
      most
      likely
      open
      at
      8
      AM
      on
      Sunday!
      Still
      TBD
      on
      the
      exact
      closing
      time
      (typically
      one
      hour
      post-race).
      There
      will
      be
      a
      couple
      of
      ways
      to
      access
      this
      area:
      1.
      Take
      the
      tram
      from
      the
      North
      Tunnel
      by
      Turn
      4
      into
      the
      infield
      to
      the
      Main
      Entry
      of
      the
      Talladega
      Garage
      Experience.
      This
      is
      also
      another
      way
      to
      exit
      after
      pre-race
      activities
      end
      and
      the
      grandstand
      crossover
      gates
      close.
      2.
      Enter
      through
      the
      grandstands
      (Gate
      EP4
      will
      be
      open
      the
      earliest)
      and
      head
      toward
      the
      track
      to
      the
      crossover
      gates,
      and
      walk
      across
      the
      track!
      There
      will
      be
      a
      chute
      that
      gets
      you
      from
      the
      track
      to
      the
      Main
      Entry
      of
      the
      Talladega
      Garage
      Experience.
      These
      admissions
      will
      allow
      you
      walk
      up
      and
      down
      pit
      road
      and
      also
      be
      at
      the
      start-finish
      line
      for
      Driver
      Introductions
      -
      just
      like
      our
      old
      pit
      passes!
      After
      Driver
      Introductions
      are
      complete,
      security
      will
      sweep
      that
      area,
      and
      you
      can
      either
      immediately
      head
      up
      into
      the
      grandstands
      to
      your
      seats
      via
      the
      crossover
      gates,
      or
      head
      back
      into
      the
      Talladega
      Garage
      Experience.
      To
      get
      back
      to
      the
      grandstands
      from
      there,
      you
      would
      take
      the
      tram
      back
      through
      the
      North
      Tunnel,
      or
      you
      could
      also
      utilize
      the
      Joyride
      golf
      cart
      service.
      With
      this
      new
      experience,
      fans
      are
      also
      welcome
      to
      be
      in
      Celebration
      Plaza
      within
      the
      TGE
      for
      Victory
      Lane.
      We're
      recommending
      leaving
      plenty
      of
      time
      (i.e.
      50-60
      laps
      to
      go)
      to
      get
      to
      the
      tram
      or
      a
      Joyride
      cart
      from
      your
      grandstand
      seats
      for
      that.

      We
      are
      VERY
      VERY
      VERY
      excited.
      This
      is
      to
      celebrate
      both
      our
      and
      RCR #8217;s
      50th
      anniversaries.
      The
      plan
      is
      to
      also
      have
      the
      car
      on
      display
      during
      pre-race
      on
      Sunday
      for
      photos.
      It #8217;s
      even
      more
      special
      since
      we #8217;re
      so
      tied
      to
      RCR #8217;s
      beginning.
      RC
      used
      the
      money
      he
      got
      from
      running
      in
      our
      first
      Cup
      race
      (lots
      of
      great
      stories
      with
      him
      getting
      that
      opportunity
      /
      the
      PDA
      boycott)
      to
      start
      his
      team.
      Also
      pretty
      sweet
      is
      that
      RC
      and
      our
      Chairman
      Grant
      Lynch
      have
      been
      great
      friends
      for
      more
      than
      30
      years.
      Can #8217;t
      wait
      to
      see
      that
      beauty
      back
      on
      track!

      Yes,
      it's
      a
      throwback
      to
      the
      70s
      and
      early
      80s!
      That
      main
      center
      backdrop
      slides,
      so
      the
      race
      winner
      will
      pull
      in
      vertically,
      then
      we'll
      slide
      it
      closed
      behind.

      We
      expect
      the
      peak
      time
      for
      autographs
      in
      the
      new
      Talladega
      Garage
      Experience
      to
      be
      around
      the
      Cup
      practices
      on
      Friday.
      Admissions
      for
      that
      new
      area
      replaced
      all
      pit
      passes.
      We're
      also
      finalizing
      the
      weekend
      Q amp;A
      schedule
      for
      the
      stage
      in
      Fr8Auctions
      Celebration
      Plaza
      behind
      Gatorade
      Victory
      Lane.
      There
      will
      also
      be
      appearances
      in
      the
      Midway
      throughout
      the
      weekend,
      and
      as
      soon
      as
      we
      have
      all
      those
      finalized
      times,
      we'll
      throw
      them
      on
      our
      schedule
      page
      -
      [www.talladegasuperspeedway.com/schedule](https://www.talladegasuperspeedway.com/schedule)
      As
      far
      as
      diecasts,
      we're
      not
      100%
      sure
      what
      will
      be
      available
      this
      weekend.
      But
      there
      should
      be
      some
      drivers
      venture
      out
      there
      at
      some
      points
      Saturday
      or
      Sunday!
