      I'm
      buying
      a
      new
      pc
      and
      I
      was
      wondering
      which
      one
      is
      better.
      I
      mostly
      play
      CS:GO
      and
      it
      needs
      more
      CPU
      than
      GPU.
      So
      i
      built
      2
      examples
      and
      I
      want
      to
      ask
      you
      which
      one
      would
      run
      better
      overall.
      Also
      i
      might
      do
      video
      editing
      and
      maybe
      stream
      in
      the
      future.
      Here
      is
      the
      AMD
      build
      https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Aranaar/saved/3vNbvK
      and
      the
      Intel+amd
      https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Aranaar/saved/rrtD3C
      .
      I
      would
      like
      to
      see
      your
      opinion
      and
      if
      can
      advise
      me
      to
      change
      something
      maybe.
      P.S
      I
      know
      that
      most
      of
      you
      will
      be
      Intel
      fanboys
      so
      I
      want
      a
      serious
      neutral
      opinion.
      :)

      That's
      exactly
      what
      I
      needed.
      And
      yes
      I'm
      planing
      to
      overclock.

      Hello,
      my
      birthday
      is
      next
      week
      and
      i
      have
      dreamed
      a
      lot
      about
      a
      guitar
      so
      i
      decided
      to
      buy
      one.
      This
      will
      be
      my
      first
      guitar
      and
      im
      not
      sure
      what
      to
      buy.
      I
      wanted
      an
      acoustic
      guitar
      and
      for
      now
      i'm
      liking
      3
      -
      SQUIER
      SA-105,
      Stagg
      SA30A
      and
      Stagg
      SA20ACE
      which
      is
      electric-acoustic.
      My
      question
      is
      do
      i
      need
      an
      electric-acoustic
      or
      just
      an
      acoustic
      and
      which
      one
      do
      you
      think
      will
      be
      better!
      Also
      the
      shapes
      are
      different
      and
      i
      have
      heard
      that
      the
      Dreadnought
      guitars
      are
      louder
      and
      i
      need
      more
      quiet
      one
      because
      i
      live
      in
      a
      flat
      with
      other
      people
      and
      i
      dont
      want
      to
      disturb
      them.
      If
      you
      have
      any
      other
      suggestions
      around
      that
      price
      range
      (80euro-100euro)
      share
      them.

      A
      lot
      of
      people
      like
      the
      squier
      actually
      i
      could't
      find
      much
      about
      the
      stagg
      though.
      In
      my
      country
      there
      arent
      many
      second
      hand
      stores.
      And
      I
      dont
      want
      to
      give
      more
      money
      because
      it
      will
      be
      my
      first
      one
      and
      i
      dont
      know
      if
      im
      going
      to
      stick
      with
      it.
      i
      think
      that
      i
      will
      get
      the
      Squier
      to
      learn
      how
      to
      play
      and
      in
      the
      future
      i
      might
      buy
      something
      with
      better
      quality.
      Thank
      you
      for
      the
      comment
      though.

      Thanks!
      I
      dont
      have
      much
      free
      time
      but
      i
      spend
      most
      of
      it
      playing
      the
      guitar.
      Maybe
      I
      should
      make
      a
      routine.

      The
      subtitles
      are
      shit.
      the
      first
      half
      of
      the
      movie
      there
      are
      no
      subtitles
      and
      when
      the
      movie
      is
      about
      to
      end
      the
      subtitles
      start.
      I
      tried
      to
      sync
      them
      manually
      but
      its
      hard
      have
      to
      spam
      shift+G
      for
      ages
      to
      get
      them
      right
      because
      they
      are
      1
      hour
      ahead
      of
      the
      movie.
      Good

      If
      they
      cant
      do
      the
      job
      done
      why
      are
      they
      even
      doing
      this?
      there
      are
      millions
      of
      sites
      that
      do
      their
      job
      better.
      Its
      not
      that
      hard
      to
      just
      sync
      the
      subs.
      There
      is
      no
      point
      in
      useing
      their
      shitty
      software
      when
      people
      can
      watch
      movies
      from
      other
      easier
      to
      use
      and
      better
      softwares
      and
      sites.
      Im
      pointing
      out
      their
      cons
      so
      they
      can
      fix
      them.

      So
      im
      16yo
      boy.
      My
      parents
      decided
      to
      rent
      a
      villa
      with
      their
      frinds
      to
      celebrate
      the
      new
      year.
      And
      they
      are
      all
      40+
      and
      I
      wanted
      to
      stay
      home
      and
      make
      my
      own
      plans.
      But
      my
      mother
      refused
      to
      let
      me
      stay
      home
      alone
      for
      new
      year.
      However
      my
      sister
      at
      my
      age
      was
      allowed
      to
      make
      parties
      and
      make
      her
      plans
      to
      celebrate
      christmas
      and
      new
      year
      with
      her
      friends.
      Im
      literally
      doing
      nothing
      here
      they
      are
      all
      old
      and
      i
      dont
      have
      anybody
      to
      talk
      with
      im
      just
      chatting
      on
      my
      phone
      non
      stop
      from
      2
      days
      because
      im
      just
      staying
      in
      my
      room
      and
      not
      getting
      out
      because
      i
      dont
      have
      anything
      else
      to
      do.
      I
      have
      no
      idea
      why
      they
      dont
      have
      faith
      in
      me
      they
      never
      gave
      me
      a
      chance
      to
      proof
      anything.
      Im
      not
      12
      anymore
      im
      old
      enought
      to
      celebrate
      with
      friends.
      Im
      like
      in
      jail
      just
      wasting
      my
      time
      doing
      nothing.
      People
      on
      my
      age
      go
      to
      clubs
      get
      drunk
      and
      smoke.
      And
      here
      i
      do
      none
      of
      that
      just
      want
      to
      spend
      the
      holidays
      being
      happy.
      They
      will
      always
      do
      something
      to
      fuck
      up
      my
      plans.
      I
      didnt
      even
      had
      chance
      to
      choose
      if
      i
      want
      to
      go
      or
      no.

      So
      there
      is
      this
      girl
      with
      which
      i
      had
      relationship
      but
      after
      we
      broke
      up
      we
      stayed
      friends.
      We
      are
      not
      so
      close
      anymore
      though
      but
      recently
      she
      started
      talking
      alot
      with
      me
      about
      life.
      Just
      for
      no
      reason
      started
      talking
      about
      her
      life
      and
      her
      friends
      and
      even
      started
      a
      topic
      about
      suicide.
      We
      are
      not
      very
      close
      and
      i
      didnt
      have
      much
      to
      say
      but
      she
      didn't
      stop
      talking
      like
      she
      hadnt
      talked
      with
      anybody
      in
      years
      even
      though
      she
      has
      bf
      and
      lots
      of
      friends.
      I
      have
      no
      idea
      whats
      happening
      in
      her
      life
      now.
      Should
      i
      be
      worried?
      Why
      did
      she
      chose
      me
      to
      talk
      with?
      does
      she
      want
      to
      get
      close
      with
      me
      again?
      Ive
      been
      cold
      with
      her
      since
      we
      broke
      up
      and
      now
      i
      dont
      know
      what
      to
      do
      because
      she
      just
      contacted
      me
      out
      of
      nowhere.

      For
      me
      its
      not
      that
      big
      of
      a
      deal.
      I
      have
      no
      IRL
      friends
      however
      i
      spend
      my
      time
      with
      people
      i
      met
      trough
      internet
      and
      thay
      are
      a
      lot
      better
      friends
      than
      anybody
      i
      knew
      IRL.
      But
      im
      introvert
      and
      im
      happy
      even
      when
      i
      dont
      communicate
      with
      people.

      Thanks
      for
      the
      response.
      You
      are
      totally
      right.
      I
      was
      thinking
      that
      they
      are
      so
      used
      to
      me
      not
      wanting
      anything
      so
      they
      take
      me
      for
      granted.
      Also
      i
      have
      never
      argued
      with
      them
      and
      accepted
      everything
      they
      tell
      me
      so
      maybe
      if
      i
      step
      my
      ground
      and
      tell
      them
      what
      i
      think
      and
      how
      i
      feel
      they
      will
      start
      to
      apriciate
      me
      more.

      It
      should
      be
      a
      bug
      because
      now
      i
      noticed
      that
      in
      the
      "ranks"
      section
      it
      gives
      me
      the
      right
      amount
      of
      pp
      but
      in
      the
      ingame
      pp
      it
      doesn't.

      Looking

      So
      I've
      been
      looking
      for
      some
      simple
      mmorpg
      with
      simple
      fighting
      mechanics
      by
      that
      i
      mean
      to
      have
      little
      spells
      and
      attacks
      and
      most
      of
      the
      fighting
      happens
      by
      click
      one
      button
      something
      like
      SoulWorker
      or
      Archblade.
      I
      would
      prefer
      to
      have
      combinations
      rather
      than
      spells.
      I've
      played
      SoulWorker
      but
      the
      only
      thing
      i
      like
      about
      it
      is
      its
      mechanics.
      There
      is
      one
      game
      KurtzPel
      thats
      coming
      out
      soon
      but
      i
      want
      to
      play
      something
      till
      they
      release
      it.
