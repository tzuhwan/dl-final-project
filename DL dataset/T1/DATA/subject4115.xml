      You

      your
      brains
      out
      at
      age
      30
      due

      You

      still

      on

      that

      Nobody

      you

      tree

      You
      blow
      your
      brains
      out
      at
      age
      30
      due
      to
      loneliness
      and
      lack
      of
      genuine
      human
      interaction
      in
      a
      shitty
      walk
      up
      apartment
      filled
      with
      roaches
      and
      drug
      addicts.
      You
      are
      buried
      in
      a
      no-name
      cemetery
      with
      a
      generic
      headstone
      by
      the
      state
      because
      literally
      0
      people
      give
      a
      fuck
      about
      you,
      except
      for
      that
      one
      internet
      friend
      that
      didn #8217;t
      even
      know
      your
      name
      but
      still
      made
      a
      facebook
      memorial
      for
      you
      on
      principle
      (lmao
      like
      he
      gives
      an
      actual
      fuck
      about
      you)
      that
      got
      3
      likes.
      Nobody
      remembers
      you
      and
      your
      family
      tree
      ends
      because
      you
      are
      literally
      too
      pathetic
      and
      unfuckable
      to
      even
      have
      some
      bastard
      out
      there
      in
      the
      world.

      You

      out
      at

      30

      Yikes,
      this
      comment
      section
      is
      a
      bit...reckless?..
      Oh
      well,
      I #8217;m
      glad
      you
      owed
      up
      to
      your
      mistakes
      and
      deleted
      the
      post.
      I
      do
      suggest
      taking
      a
      few
      days
      off
      from
      Reddit
      and
      letting
      this
      whole
      thing
      die
      down.
      The
      people
      here
      will
      find
      something
      new
      to
      complain
      about
      by
      the
      time
      you
      come
      back.

      I
      can #8217;t
      hold
      it
      in
      anymore.
      I
      want
      Norm
      to
      sit
      on
      my
      face
      and
      excrete
      every
      little
      bit
      of
      his
      juicy
      feces
      into
      my
      mouth.
      I
      bet
      his
      shit
      is
      chewy,
      yet
      still
      have
      hints
      of
      crunch
      from
      the
      bits
      of
      corn
      inside
      the
      turd.
      I
      imagine
      his
      dingleberrys
      have
      the
      taste
      of
      raw
      fish,
      corn
      bits
      and
      perhaps
      even
      lemming
      foreskin.
      Speaking
      of
      foreskin,
      if
      I
      were
      to
      peel
      Norm #8217;s
      foreskin
      back,
      would
      his
      cock
      look
      fresh
      and
      yummy,
      or
      stinky,
      sweaty,
      sticky,
      and
      moldy?
      I
      really
      hope
      it #8217;s
      the
      latter.
      God,
      going
      back
      to
      the
      topic
      of
      Norm
      sitting
      on
      my
      face,
      imagine
      when
      he
      finally
      runs
      out
      of
      crap
      to
      poo
      out
      and
      a
      fart
      bubble
      come
      out
      of
      his
      ass.
      I
      would
      love
      to
      pop
      that
      greasy
      fart
      bubble
      with
      my
      tongue
      like
      I
      pop
      the
      cysts
      off
      my
      face
      that
      god
      cursed
      me
      with
      because
      he
      hates
      me
      and
      letting
      the
      substances
      get
      all
      over
      my
      face.
      Then,
      just
      like
      my
      popped
      cysts,
      I #8217;ll
      slurp
      then
      all
      up
      and
      be
      nice
      and
      happy
      for
      the
      rest
      of
      the
      day

      Yeah
      your
      right.
      I
      fucking
      hate
      Bakugou.
      There #8217;s
      something
      about
      him
      that
      just
      never
      clicked
      with
      me
      like
      the
      others
      in
      the
      fandom
      have
      with
      him.
      And
      Mineta,
      I
      think
      he #8217;s
      just
      okay,
      I
      don #8217;t
      care
      for
      him
      that
      much,
      but
      he
      doesn #8217;t
      deserve
      all
      the
      hate
      he
      gets
      from
      the
      fandom.
      He #8217;s
      literally
      comic
      relief,
      and
      usually
      gets
      punished
      for
      his
      perverted
      actions.

      I #8217;m

      browsing

      I

      toxic.
      Fandom #8217;s
      have
      ruined
      a
      lot

      Five
      nights

      like
      the
      original

      Undertale
      (Good
      game,

      I
      don #8217;t
      enjoy
      it
      as
      much
      anymore)
      I
      think
      my
      hero
      academia
      is
      a
      pretty
      good
      show
      with
      an
      interesting
      story,
      mostly
      likable
      characters,
      and
      extremely
      well
      done
      animation.
      I #8217;m
      not
      going
      to
      let
      the
      Fandom
      ruin
      this
      good

      The
      justice
      system
      is
      way
      too
      lenient
      with
      women.
      They
      deserve
      the

      harsh

      that

      get
      when
      they

      Actually,
      I
      thought
      I
      reason
      he
      just
      snapped
      was
      because
      they
      were
      making
      fun
      of
      his
      height
      by
      offering
      him
      a
      mini
      bagel
      or
      some
      shit
      like
      that?
      I
      also
      heard
      he
      used
      to
      be
      bullied
      all
      the
      time
      because
      of
      his
      short
      height,
      and
      the
      employee
      teasing
      him
      was
      what
      pushed
      him
      over
      the
      edge.
      The
      sexist
      comments
      he
      made
      are
      undeniably
      trashy,
      but
      put
      yourself
      in
      this
      guys
      shoes
      for
      a
      minute:
      Your
      a
      5
      foot
      something
      guy
      who #8217;s
      been
      harassed
      all
      his
      life
      because
      of
      something
      he
      can #8217;t
      control,
      and
      when
      you
      finally
      are
      able
      to
      get
      wife,
      you
      end
      up
      getting
      divorced.
      He #8217;s
      likely
      still
      bitter
      about
      the
      divorce,
      and
      has
      gone
      back
      to
      believing
      that
      no
      one
      will
      ever
      love
      him.
      Like
      I
      said
      before,
      the
      sexist
      comments
      were
      wrong,
      but
      when
      you
      just
      stop
      and
      try
      to
      place
      yourself
      in
      his
      shoes
      for
      a
      minute,
      it
      makes
      a
      lot
      more
      sense
      why
      he
      snapped.

      Yeah,
      it #8217;s
      definitely
      true
      this
      guy
      needs
      therapy.
      I
      should
      have
      been
      more
      specific
      when
      I
      said
      that
      being
      offered
      a
      mini
      bagel
      is
      what
      pushed
      him
      over
      the
      edge.
      I
      thought
      they
      were
      offering
      it
      to
      him
      in
      a
      sort
      of
      teasing
      matter,
      not
      just
      because
      they
      were
      being
      offered
      normally
      or
      something
      like
      that.
      (Also
      correct
      me
      if
      I #8217;m
      wrong,
      but
      I
      read
      somewhere
      that
      the
      owner
      of
      this
      store
      started
      offering
      people
      free
      mini
      bagels
      after
      this
      incident.
      I
      really
      hope
      this
      isn #8217;t
      true,
      because
      that #8217;s
      kinda
      a
      dick
      move.)

      I
      cracked
      down
      and
      did
      a
      semi
      marathon
      of
      completing
      almost
      all
      the
      Oxide
      time
      trials.
      I
      have
      two
      CTR
      tracks
      left,
      and
      five
      CNK
      tracks
      left
      as
      well.
      Anyways,
      how
      was
      dragon
      mines
      for
      you?....
      Ah
      fuck
      it,
      I
      already
      know.
      It
      took
      me
      an
      hour
      and
      a
      half
      to
      just
      barely
      get
      by
      that
      fucking
      stupid
      trial.
      Dragon
      mines
      would
      be
      an
      ok
      track
      if
      it
      didn #8217;t
      have
      that
      stupid
      fucking
      turn..
      I
      know
      I
      sound
      butthurt,
      but
      I
      genuinely
      hate
      that
      track
      with
      all
      of
      the
      fibers
      in
      my
      body.

      Not
      OP,
      but
      I
      think
      the
      shortcut
      is
      still
      inconsistent.
      The
      only
      tip
      I
      can
      think
      of
      for
      you
      is
      to
      have
      a
      decent
      amount
      of
      speed
      when
      you
      jump
      off
      the
      ramp.

      I
      finally
      caved
      in
      and
      completed
      all
      of
      the
      Nitrous
      Oxide
      time
      trials.
      To
      be
      honest,
      People
      were
      right
      when
      they
      said
      that
      only
      1
      or
      two
      tracks
      were
      beyond
      frustrating.
      As
      long
      as
      your
      able
      to
      keep
      your
      boost
      up
      and
      your
      decent
      at
      drifting
      properly,
      you
      should
      be
      able
      to
      complete
      these
      time
      trials.
      (Also,
      I #8217;m
      never
      playing
      dragon
      mines
      again.
      Fuck
      that
      track.)

      I
      always
      thought
      that
      my
       #8220;foreskin #8221;
      looked
      really
      off.
      It
      barely
      looked
      like
      foreskin
      at
      all.
      It
      just
      seemed...
      small?
      It
      couldn #8217;t
      cover
      my
      dick
      all
      the
      way.
      I
      eventually
      got
      the
      courage
      to
      ask
      my
      mother
      if
      I
      was
      circumcised,
      and
      she
      said
      yes.
      I
      honestly
      have
      no
      idea
      how
      I
      feel
      about
      this.

      Imagine
      trying
      to
      get
      some
      of
      the
      eyelashes
      out
      with
      a
      tweezer.
      You
      stick
      the
      tweezers
      under
      your
      eye,
      slightly
      fumble,
      and
      end
      up
      slicing
      open
      the
      bottom
      of
      your
      eye.
      Blood
      is
      flooding
      out
      of
      your
      socket
      as
      your
      trying
      to
      pull
      the
      tweezers
      out,
      which
      only
      causes
      the
      wound
      to
      expand.
      After
      giving
      a
      big
      tug,
      you
      rip
      the
      tweezers
      out
      and
      your
      eye
      flies
      out
      of
      your
      socket
      and
      splats
      against
      your
      mirror.
      Blood
      and
      eyelashes
      end
      up
      pouring
      out
      of
      your
      socket,
      and
      you
      end
      licking
      the
      contents
      up
      like
      a
      dog.

      I
      can #8217;t
      hold
      it
      in
      anymore.
      I
      want
      Norm
      to
      sit
      on
      my
      face
      and
      excrete
      every
      little
      bit
      of
      his
      juicy
      feces
      into
      my
      mouth.
      I
      bet
      his
      shit
      is
      chewy,
      yet
      still
      have
      hints
      of
      crunch
      from
      the
      bits
      of
      corn
      inside
      the
      turd.
      I
      imagine
      his
      dingleberrys
      have
      the
      taste
      of
      raw
      fish,
      corn
      bits
      and
      perhaps
      even
      lemming
      foreskin.
      Speaking
      of
      foreskin,
      if
      I
      were
      to
      peel
      Norm #8217;s
      foreskin
      back,
      would
      his
      cock
      look
      fresh
      and
      yummy,
      or
      stinky,
      sweaty,
      sticky,
      and
      moldy?
      I
      really
      hope
      it #8217;s
      the
      latter.
      God,
      going
      back
      to
      the
      topic
      of
      Norm
      sitting
      on
      my
      face,
      imagine
      when
      he
      finally
      runs
      out
      of
      crap
      to
      poo
      out
      and
      a
      fart
      bubble
      come
      out
      of
      his
      ass.
      I
      would
      love
      to
      pop
      that
      greasy
      fart
      bubble
      with
      my
      tongue
      like
      I
      pop
      the
      cysts
      off
      my
      face
      that
      god
      cursed
      me
      with
      because
      he
      hates
      me
      and
      letting
      the
      substances
      get
      all
      over
      my
      face.
      Then,
      just
      like
      my
      popped
      cysts,
      I #8217;ll
      slurp
      then
      all
      up
      and
      be
      nice
      and
      happy
      for
      the
      rest
      of
      the
      day

      It #8217;s
      quite
      soggy
      alright,
      and
      it
      tastes

      Hey
      Redditor,
      someday
      in
      the
      near
      future
      you'll
      be
      not
      broke
      and
      want
      to
      gild
      somebody.
      I'd
      ask
      that
      instead
      of
      gilding
      them
      you
      shoot
      them
      a
      message
      and
      ask
      if
      there's
      a
      charity
      they'd
      like
      you
      to
      donate
      towards,
      or
      an
      Amazon
      wishlist
      or
      something.
      Gilding
      just
      pays
      into
      the
      ugliness
      of
      Reddit
      IMO.
      Have
      a
      nice
      day

      My
      Grandfather
      smoked
      his
      whole
      life.
      I
      was
      about
      10
      years
      old
      when
      my
      mother
      said
      to
      him,
      'If
      you
      ever
      want
      to
      see
      your
      grandchildren
      graduate,
      you
      have
      to
      stop
      immediately.'.
      Tears
      welled
      up
      in
      his
      eyes
      when
      he
      realized
      what
      exactly
      was
      at
      stake.
      He
      gave
      it
      up
      immediately.
      Three
      years
      later
      he
      died
      of
      lung
      cancer.
      It
      was
      really
      sad
      and
      destroyed
      me.
      My
      mother
      said
      to
      me-
      'Don't
      ever
      smoke.
      Please
      don't
      put
      your
      family
      through
      what
      your
      Grandfather
      put
      us
      through."
      I
      agreed.
      At
      28,
      I
      have
      never
      touched
      a
      cigarette.
      I
      must
      say,
      I
      feel
      a
      very
      slight
      sense
      of
      regret
      for
      never
      having
      done
      it,
      because
      your
      comment
      gave
      me
      cancer
      anyway.

      people,
      working
      out,
      and
      watching
      those
      motivational
      videos
      on
      YouTube.
      Soon
      enough,
      you
      can
      talk
      to
      people
      with
      ease,
      you
      have
      a
      beautiful
      girlfriend,
      and
      you
      can
      look
      at
      yourself
      in
      the
      mirror
      everyday,
      and
      not
      feel
      disgusted,
      but
      instead
      proud
      of
      yourself
      and
      what
      you
      have
      become.

       gt;!Damn,
      I
      already
      gotta
      reuse
      this
      copypasta?...
      Oh
      well.! lt;
      My
      Grandfather
      smoked
      his
      whole
      life.
      I
      was
      about
      10
      years
      old
      when
      my
      mother
      said
      to
      him,
      'If
      you
      ever
      want
      to
      see
      your
      grandchildren
      graduate,
      you
      have
      to
      stop
      immediately.'.
      Tears
      welled
      up
      in
      his
      eyes
      when
      he
      realized
      what
      exactly
      was
      at
      stake.
      He
      gave
      it
      up
      immediately.
      Three
      years
      later
      he
      died
      of
      lung
      cancer.
      It
      was
      really
      sad
      and
      destroyed
      me.
      My
      mother
      said
      to
      me-
      'Don't
      ever
      smoke.
      Please
      don't
      put
      your
      family
      through
      what
      your
      Grandfather
      put
      us
      through."
      I
      agreed.
      At
      28,
      I
      have
      never
      touched
      a
      cigarette.
      I
      must
      say,
      I
      feel
      a
      very
      slight
      sense
      of
      regret
      for
      never
      having
      done
      it,
      because
      your
      comment
      gave
      me
      cancer
      anyway.

      What
      the
      fuck
      did
      you
      just
      fucking
      say
      about
      me,
      you
      little
      bitch?
      I #8217;ll
      have
      you
      know
      I
      graduated
      top
      of
      my
      class
      in
      the
      Navy
      Seals,
      and
      I #8217;ve
      been
      involved
      in
      numerous
      secret
      raids
      on
      Al-Quaeda,
      and
      I
      have
      over
      300
      confirmed
      kills.
      I
      am
      trained
      in
      gorilla
      warfare
      and
      I #8217;m
      the
      top
      sniper
      in
      the
      entire
      US
      armed
      forces.
      You
      are
      nothing
      to
      me
      but
      just
      another
      target.
      I
      will
      wipe
      you
      the
      fuck
      out
      with
      precision
      the
      likes
      of
      which
      has
      never
      been
      seen
      before
      on
      this
      Earth,
      mark
      my
      fucking
      words.
      You
      think
      you
      can
      get
      away
      with
      saying
      that
      shit
      to
      me
      over
      the
      Internet?
      Think
      again,
      fucker.
      As
      we
      speak
      I
      am
      contacting
      my
      secret
      network
      of
      spies
      across
      the
      USA
      and
      your
      IP
      is
      being
      traced
      right
      now
      so
      you
      better
      prepare
      for
      the
      storm,
      maggot.
      The
      storm
      that
      wipes
      out
      the
      pathetic
      little
      thing
      you
      call
      your
      life.
      You #8217;re
      fucking
      dead,
      kid.
      I
      can
      be
      anywhere,
      anytime,
      and
      I
      can
      kill
      you
      in
      over
      seven
      hundred
      ways,
      and
      that #8217;s
      just
      with
      my
      bare
      hands.
      Not
      only
      am
      I
      extensively
      trained
      in
      unarmed
      combat,
      but
      I
      have
      access
      to
      the
      entire
      arsenal
      of
      the
      United
      States
      Marine
      Corps
      and
      I
      will
      use
      it
      to
      its
      full
      extent
      to
      wipe
      your
      miserable
      ass
      off
      the
      face
      of
      the
      continent,
      you
      little
      shit.
      If
      only
      you
      could
      have
      known
      what
      unholy
      retribution
      your
      little
       #8220;clever #8221;
      comment
      was
      about
      to
      bring
      down
      upon
      you,
      maybe
      you
      would
      have
      held
      your
      fucking
      tongue.
      But
      you
      couldn #8217;t,
      you
      didn #8217;t,
      and
      now
      you #8217;re
      paying
      the
      price,
      you
      goddamn
      idiot.
      I
      will
      shit
      fury
      all
      over
      you
      and
      you
      will
      drown
      in
      it.
      You #8217;re
      fucking
      dead,
      kiddo.

      The
      best
      way
      I
      can
      describe
      griefing
      is
      that
      it
      means
      to
      screw
      with
      other
      players
      and
      ruin
      the
      experience
      for
      them.
      An
      example
      of
      this
      might
      be
      if
      you
      were
      playing
      Minecraft
      or
      something
      like
      that,
      and
      you
      built
      a
      nice
      house.
      Then
      a
      random
      player
      comes
      along
      and
      uses
      TNT
      to
      blow
      the
      damn
      thing
      to
      smithereens.
      You #8217;ll
      likely
      end
      up
      getting
      pissed
      and
      quitting.
      That #8217;s
      the
      best
      way
      I
      can
      describe
      griefing.

      Imagine
      swimming
      through
      that
      hole
      and
      your
      halfway
      through
      it
      when
      it
      starts
      to
      collapse
      and
      you
      get
      trapped
      under
      the
      rubble
      and
      no
      matter
      how
      hard
      you
      try,
      you
      can #8217;t
      move
      at
      all,
      and
      as
      you
      begin
      to
      lose
      oxygen,
      you
      reflect
      back
      on
      your
      life
      and
      realize
      that
      you
      were
      alone
      and
      the
      only
      people
      that
      ever
      loved
      you
      were
      your
      parents,
      but
      that #8217;s
      okay
      because
      you
      loved
      them
      back,
      and
      you
      realize
      that
      the
      situation
      your
      in
      isn #8217;t
      that
      bad
      anymore
      because
      soon
      you #8217;ll
      finally
      get
      to
      be
      able
      to
      meet
      your
      parents,
      and
      as
      you
      finally
      give
      in
      and
      lose
      your
      consciousness,
      you
      smile
      because
      you
      know
      your
      parents
      are
      waiting
      for
      you
      on
      the
      other
      side
      of
      the
      rainbow
      bridge,
      and
      you #8217;ll
      be
      at
      peace
      with
      your
      loved
      ones
      for
      all
      eternity.

      My
      favorite
      character
      is
      N.
      Tropy(Digital),
      but
      I
      rarely
      use
      him
      online
      because
      players
      really
      get
      aggressive
      once
      they
      see
      the
      dreaded
      digital
      skin.
      Also
      because
      some
      people
      straight
      up
      leave
      as
      well,
      which
      is
      pretty
      annoying.
      So
      for
      online,
      I
      usually
      pick
      Penta
      Penguin
      with
      the
      samurai
      skin,
      cause
      he
      lookin
      kinda
      quirky
      in
      that
      outfit
      tho

      Ever
      since
      I
      was
      only
      9
      years
      old,
      I
      have
      had
      suicidal
      thoughts.
      I
      was
      constantly
      harassed
      by
      all
      of
      my
      peers,
      and
      told
      that
      if
      I
      offed
      myself
      right
      now,
      no
      one
      would
      give
      a
      fuck.
      No
      matter
      how
      hard
      I
      try
      to
      be
      happy,
      those
      thoughts
      creep
      up
      from
      the
      back
      of
      my
      mind,
      and
      hit
      me
      full
      force.
      There
      are
      certain
      days
      however,
      when
      I #8217;m
      just
      able
      to
      ignore
      the
      fact
      that
      my
      existence
      is
      worthless,
      and
      that
      I #8217;m
      eventually
      just
      gonna
      be
      another
      body
      buried
      six
      feet
      deep.
      My
      day
      was
      going
      unexpectedly
      well,
      and
      then
      I
      read
      your
      comment.
      Thanks
      to
      you,
      my
      mood
      has
      gone
      from
       #8220;fairly
      happy #8221;
      to
       #8220;consciousness
      is
      a
      void
      of
      suffering
      and
      despair. #8221;
      And
      it #8217;s
      also
      thanks
      to
      this
      comment,
      that
      I #8217;ll
      soon
      be
      found
      by
      a
      family
      member,
      hanging
      from
      the
      ceiling
      fan.
      I
      thank
      whoever
      posted
      this
      comment,
      because
      you
      have
      finally
      given
      me
      the
      courage
      to
      end
      my
      suffering
      :)

      Just
      because
      these
      people
      are
      good
      at
      drawing
      doesn #8217;t
      mean
      their
      gods
      at
      everything.
      They
      had
      to
      practice
      to
      become
      good
      at
      drawing,
      which
      means
      you
      too
      can
      draw
      like
      this
      if
      you
      put
      the
      effort
      into
      it.
      Come
      up
      with
      your
      own
      type
      of
      style,
      and
      maybe
      look
      at
      the
      other
      drawings
      as
      a
      sort
      of
      inspiration!
      Art
      is
      a
      wild
      beast,
      but
      once
      you
      tame
      her,
      she #8217;s
      sweet
      as
      honey.

      Rebecca
      Black's
      "Friday"
      is
      about
      the
      assassination
      of
      John
      F.
      Kennedy.
       #8220;7
      a.m.,
      waking
      up
      in
      the
      morning
      Got
      to
      be
      fresh
      got
      to
      go
      downstairs. #8221;
      JFK
      woke
      up
      at
      7
      am
      on
      Nov.
      22,
      1963.
      He
      had
      a
      long
      day
      of
      appearances
      ahead
      of
      him.
      The
      election
      was
      on
      the
      radar,
      and
      the
      administration
      wanted
      to
      maximize
      his
      exposure
      in
      Texas.
      Kennedy
      needed
      to
      be
       #8220;fresh #8221;;
      his
      visit
      was
      with
      the
      intent
      of
      smoothing
      tensions
      within
      the
      Democratic
      party
      there.
      He
      had
      to
       #8220;go
      downstairs, #8221;
      a
      reference
      to
      deplaning
      Air
      Force
      One
      at
      Dallas
      Love
      field.
       #8220;Seeing
      everything,
      the
      time
      is
      going
      Ticking
      on
      and
      on,
      everybody #8217;s
      rushing #8221;
      The
      day
      passed
      quickly,
      and
      from
      the
      viewpoint,
      so
      does
      life.
       #8220;everybody #8217;s
      rushing #8221;
      is
      another
      clever
      line.
      JFK #8217;s
      motorcade
      made
      two
      unplanned
      stops
      along
      their

      Got

      Which

      Friday.
      Got
      to
      get
      down
      on
      Friday #8221;
      Friday,
      November
      22nd
      was
      the
      day
      that
      Lee
      Harvey
      Oswald
      murdered
      JFK.
      When
      he
      opened
      fire,
      the
      first
      shot
      missed.
      A
      warning
      from
      the
      secret
      service
      agent
      in
      the
      car
      to
       #8220;get
      down! #8221;
      wasn #8217;t
      heeded
      in
      time;
      the
      second
      shot
      struck
      JFK
      in
      the
      back
      before
      the
      final
      bullet
      hit
      his
      head.
      Additionally,
      in
      the
      music
      video,
      Black
      sits
      in
      the
      back
      of
      a
      convertible...in
      the
      same
      position
      that
      JFK
      took
      that
      day
      in
      his.
      Do
      you
      think
      it #8217;s
      a
      coincidence?

      You

      you
      win
      a

      your
      on
      the

      that

      would
      play?
      It
      sounds
      so
      weird.
      It #8217;s
      such
      a

      is
      just
      one
      second
      and
      they
      just
      keep
      looping
      it.
      I

      I #8217;m

      blow
      my
      brains
      out
      at

      30

      As
      ridiculous
      as
      this
      sounds,
      I #8217;m
      currently
      attempting
      to
      become
      a
      rapper
      right
      now.
      I #8217;m
      in
      love
      with
      the
      genre
      of
      hip
      hop,
      and
      I
      want
      to
      take
      a
      chance
      and
      see
      if
      I
      can
      prove
      myself
      worthy
      enough
      to
      get
      behind
      the
      mic.
      Anyways,
      now
      that
      my
      semi
      biography
      is
      over,
      has
      anybody
      considered
      pursuing
      fame
      before?
      Like
      say
      becoming
      a
      youtuber,
      author,
      etc...
      get
      what
      I #8217;m
      saying?
      We
      apparently
      only
      got
      one
      life,
      so
      I #8217;m
      trying
      my
      best
      to
      make
      my
      dream
      come
      true.

      I
      honestly
      got
      no
      idea
      what
      I
      wanna
      do
      with
      my
      life
      if
      this
      doesn #8217;t
      work
      out.
      I
      might
      try
      becoming
      a
      twitch
      streamer,
      but
      if
      that
      doesn #8217;t
      work
      out
      as
      well,
      then
      I #8217;ll
      probably
      just
      work
      a
      9
      to
      5
      job.
      If
      even
      that
      fails
      as
      well,
      then
      I #8217;ll
      probably
      just
      kill
      myself.

      my

      It

      Like,
      I #8217;m
      still

      so
      I #8217;m

      Sorry
      if
      I
      might
      of
      scared
      ya
      a
      bit.
      I
      think
      I
      got
      this
      rap
      shit
      worked
      out.
      It #8217;s
      just,
      my
      voice.
      It
      sounds
      weird.
      Like,
      I #8217;m
      still
      going
      through
      puberty
      and
      shit,
      and
      it
      sounds
      fairly
      deep,
      but
      i
      definitely
      know
      it
      sounds
      kinda
      off.
      Really
      hoping
      it
      changes
      into
      something
      I
      can
      work
      with.

      So

      is
       #8220;kidding? #8221;
      or
      K

      out
      and
      feed
      you
      to

      Sharks
      have
      a
      K
      in
      it.
      "K"?
      Are
      you
      fucking
      kidding
      me?
      I
      spent
      a
      decent
      portion
      of
      my
      life
      writing
      all
      of
      that
      and
      your
      response
      to
      me
      is
      "K"?
      Are
      you
      so
      mentally
      handicapped
      that
      the
      only
      letter
      you
      can
      comprehend
      is
      "K"
      -
      or
      are
      you
      just
      some
      fucking
      asshole
      who
      thinks
      that
      with
      such
      a
      short
      response,
      he
      can
      make
      a
      statement
      about
      how
      meaningless
      what
      was
      written
      was?
      Well,
      I'll
      have
      you
      know
      that
      what
      I
      wrote
      was
      NOT
      meaningless,
      in
      fact,
      I
      even
      had
      my
      written
      work
      proof-read
      by
      several
      professors
      of
      literature.
      Don't
      believe
      me?
      I
      doubt
      you
      would,
      and
      your
      response
      to
      this
      will
      probably
      be
      "K"
      once
      again.
      Do
      I
      give
      a
      fuck?
      No,
      does
      it
      look
      like
      I
      give
      even
      the
      slightest
      fuck
      about
      a
      single
      letter?
      I
      bet
      you
      took
      the
      time
      to
      type
      that
      one
      letter
      too,
      I
      bet
      you
      sat
      there
      and
      chuckled
      to
      yourself
      for
      20
      hearty
      seconds
      before
      pressing
      "send".
      You're
      so
      fucking
      pathetic.
      I'm
      honestly
      considering
      directing
      you
      to
      a
      psychiatrist,
      but
      I'm
      simply
      far
      too
      nice
      to
      do
      something
      like
      that.
      You,
      however,
      will
      go
      out
      of
      your
      way
      to
      make
      a
      fool
      out
      of
      someone
      by
      responding
      to
      a
      well-thought-out,
      intelligent,
      or
      humorous
      statement
      that
      probably
      took
      longer
      to
      write
      than
      you
      can
      last
      in
      bed
      with
      a
      chimpanzee.
      What
      do
      I
      have
      to
      say
      to
      you?
      Absolutely
      nothing.
      I
      couldn't
      be
      bothered
      to
      respond
      to
      such
      a
      worthless
      attempt
      at
      a
      response.
      Do
      you
      want
      "K"
      on
      your
      gravestone?
      Do
      you
      want
      people
      to
      remember
      you
      as
      the
      asshat
      who
      one
      day
      decided
      to
      respond
      to
      someone
      with
      a
      single
      letter?
      "Hey,
      look,
      everybody!
      It's
      that
      "K"
      guy!"
      That's
      who
      you
      are.
      You're
      going
      to
      be
      known
      as
      the
      "K"
      guy.
      How
      does
      it
      feel?
      Do
      you
      feel
      happy?
      Quite
      honestly,
      I
      don't
      care,
      which
      is
      why
      I'm
      not
      even
      going
      to
      respond
      to
      you.
      Goodbye,
      and
      good
      luck
      with
      your
      future
      as
      that
      guy
      who
      said
      "K".

      It

      vinegar,
      and

      K?
      K
      what?
      The
      letter
      before
      L?
      The
      letter
      after
      J?
      Did
      you
      know
      that
      in
      JK
      the
      K
      stands
      for
       #8220;kidding? #8221;
      So
      your
      reply
      is
       #8220;kidding? #8221;
      or
      K
      as
      in
      Potassium?
      Do
      you
      need
      some
      Special
      K
      for
      breakfast?
      K
      as

      Can

      you
      out
      and
      feed
      you
      to

      Sharks
      have
      a
      K
      in
      it.
      "K"?
      Are
      you
      fucking
      kidding
      me?
      I
      spent
      a
      decent
      portion
      of
      my
      life
      writing
      all
      of
      that
      and
      your
      response
      to
      me
      is
      "K"?
      Are
      you
      so
      mentally
      handicapped
      that
      the
      only
      letter
      you
      can
      comprehend
      is
      "K"
      -
      or
      are
      you
      just
      some
      fucking
      asshole
      who
      thinks
      that
      with
      such
      a
      short
      response,
      he
      can
      make
      a
      statement
      about
      how
      meaningless
      what
      was
      written
      was?
      Well,
      I'll
      have
      you
      know
      that
      what
      I
      wrote
      was
      NOT
      meaningless,
      in
      fact,
      I
      even
      had
      my
      written
      work
      proof-read
      by
      several
      professors
      of
      literature.
      Don't
      believe
      me?
      I
      doubt
      you
      would,
      and
      your
      response
      to
      this
      will
      probably
      be
      "K"
      once
      again.
      Do
      I
      give
      a
      fuck?
      No,
      does
      it
      look
      like
      I
      give
      even
      the
      slightest
      fuck
      about
      a
      single
      letter?
      I
      bet
      you
      took
      the
      time
      to
      type
      that
      one
      letter
      too,
      I
      bet
      you
      sat
      there
      and
      chuckled
      to
      yourself
      for
      20
      hearty
      seconds
      before
      pressing
      "send".
      You're
      so
      fucking
      pathetic.
      I'm
      honestly
      considering
      directing
      you
      to
      a
      psychiatrist,
      but
      I'm
      simply
      far
      too
      nice
      to
      do
      something
      like
      that.
      You,
      however,
      will
      go
      out
      of
      your
      way

      That's

      You're
      going
      to
      be

      Alright
      listen
      up
      motherfucker,
      and
      get

      we're
      gonna
      be
      here
      a

      Do

      you
      can
      just
      get
      away
      with
      "k"
      as

      What
      if
      someone
      did
      that
      to
      you,
      huh?
      Do

      Making

      get
      a
      fuckin'
      one

      response
      of
      the
      tenth
      letter

      you
      think

      funny,
      jackass?
      Do
      you
      want
      your
      crush
      to
      respond
      back
      with
      "k"
      after
      you
      spill
      your
      feelings
      out
      like
      this?
      (Take
      me
      back,
      Emma.)
      Huh?
      What
      if
      I
      did
      it
      to
      you?
      k.
      Did
      you
      fuckin'
      like
      that?
      What,
      did
      you
      just
      jizz
      in
      your
      pants
      because
      someone
      disregarded

      writing
      this
      ENTIRE

      just
      makes
      me
      feel
      fucking
      rejected
      just
      like
      my
      ex.
      (Take
      me
      back,
      Roxanne.)
      k.
      What're
      you,
      fuckin'
      gay?
      Can
      I
      have
      a
      response
      that
      actually
      MEANS
      something
      instead
      of
      just
      shitfacing
      our
      "conversation"
      with
      the
      spam
      of
      "k?"
      Now
      occasionally
      with
      questions
      or
      something
      it's
      reasonable,
      but
      doing
      it
      to
      any
      fucking
      response
      they
      say.
      "We're
      having
      a
      nuclear
      crisis,
      you
      have
      fifteen
      minutes
      to
      evacuate."
      You're
      the
      type
      of
      person
      that
      would
      fuckin'
      say
      "k"
      to
      that,
      you
      limp
      dick
      hypocrite.
      You
      think
      you
      can
      get
      away
      with
      this,
      right?
      You
      think
      it's
      SOOOOOO
      funny
      to
      do
      this
      shit,
      but
      I
      can
      guarantee
      that
      you'll
      be
      taken
      out
      back
      and
      shot
      soon.
      You're
      fucking
      dead,
      "k"iddo.

      Take
      what
      I #8217;m
      saying
      with
      a
      grain
      of
      salt,
      because
      I
      literally
      got
      this
      information
      from
      another
      post
      on
      this
      subreddit.
      If
      this
      is
      true,
      then
      I
      honestly
      don #8217;t
      believe
      we #8217;re
      gonna
      make
      it.
      We
      all
      say
      we #8217;re
      gonna
      change
      for
      the
      better,
      and
      we
      actually
      do
      try
      that
      for
      one
      day,
      but
      then
      what
      do
      ya
      know,
      we
      go
      back
      to
      our
      dirty
      habits
      the
      next
      day.
      I
      think
      for
      once,
      Stephen
      hawking
      might
      have
      been
      wrong.
      We
      don #8217;t
      have
      100
      years
      left
      to
      evacuate
      the
      planet.
      We
      actually
      may
      have
      less
      time
      then
      we
      thought.
      I
      never
      thought
      it
      would
      come
      to
      this,
      but
      if
      earth
      is
      really
      fucked
      in
      18
      months,
      then
      I
      honestly
      won #8217;t
      be
      that
      surprised.
      We
      were
      warned
      for
      so
      long,
      and
      we
      barely
      even
      gave
      a
      sliver
      of
      a
      fuck.
      Now
      it #8217;s
      come
      back
      to
      bite
      us
      in
      the
      ass.

      but
      I
      felt
      like
      flexing
      my
      copy
      of
       #8220;Raiders
      of
      the
      lost
      ark #8221;
      that
      still
      hasn #8217;t
      been
      unwrapped.

      That #8217;s
      what
      I
      plan
      to
      do.
      I #8217;m
      never
      unwrapping
      this
      beauty.
      Thank

      Did
      9/11
      happen
      in
      the
      cars
      universe?
      the
      thing
      I
      really
      like
      about
      Planes
      is
      that
      we
      learn
      that
      WWII
      happened
      in
      the
      cars
      universe.
      Which
      means
      there
      was
      a
      Cars
      Hitler,
      a
      Cars
      Holocaust,
      a
      Cars
      Pacific
      War,
      a
      Cars
      D-Day,
      a
      Cars
      nuking
      of
      Hiroshima
      and
      Nagasaki,
      a
      Cars
      Rape
      of
      Nanking,
      a
      Cars
      Battle
      of
      Iwo
      Jima...
      This
      leads
      to
      so
      many
      important
      questions,
      like:
      were
      the
      Cars
      Little
      Boy
      and
      Fat
      Man
      nukes
      sentient?
      Was
      it
      a
      suicide
      mission?
      Are
      ALL
      Cars
      nuclear
      weapons
      sentient?
      Did
      Tsar
      Bomba
      have
      a
      personality?
      What
      kind
      of
      car
      was
      Car
      Hitler?
      A
      VW?
      A
      forklift?
      Was
      there
      a
      Cars
      9/11?
      Where
      the
      planes
      hijacked,
      or
      were
      the
      planes
      themselves
      radicalized?
      I
      could

      The

      the

      So
      your
      reply
      is
       #8220;kidding? #8221;
      or
      K

      Potassium?
      Do
      you
      need
      some
      Special
      K
      for
      breakfast?
      K

      you
      out

      feed
      you

      Sharks
      have
      a
      K
      in
      it.
      "K"?
      Are
      you
      fucking
      kidding
      me?
      I
      spent
      a
      decent
      portion
      of
      my
      life
      writing
      all
      of
      that
      and
      your
      response
      to
      me
      is
      "K"?
      Are
      you
      so
      mentally
      handicapped
      that
      the
      only
      letter
      you
      can
      comprehend
      is
      "K"
      -
      or
      are
      you
      just
      some
      fucking
      asshole
      who
      thinks
      that
      with
      such
      a
      short
      response,
      he
      can
      make
      a
      statement
      about
      how
      meaningless
      what
      was
      written
      was?
      Well,
      I'll
      have
      you
      know
      that
      what
      I
      wrote
      was
      NOT
      meaningless,
      in
      fact,
      I
      even
      had
      my
      written
      work
      proof-read
      by
      several
      professors
      of
      literature.
      Don't
      believe
      me?
      I
      doubt
      you
      would,
      and
      your
      response
      to
      this
      will
      probably
      be
      "K"
      once
      again.
      Do
      I
      give
      a
      fuck?
      No,
      does
      it
      look
      like
      I
      give
      even
      the
      slightest
      fuck
      about
      a
      single
      letter?
      I
      bet
      you
      took
      the
      time
      to
      type
      that
      one
      letter
      too,
      I
      bet
      you
      sat
      there
      and
      chuckled
      to
      yourself
      for
      20
      hearty
      seconds
      before
      pressing
      "send".
      You're
      so
      fucking
      pathetic.
      I'm
      honestly
      considering
      directing
      you
      to
      a
      psychiatrist,
      but
      I'm
      simply
      far
      too
      nice
      to
      do
      something
      like
      that.
      You,
      however,
      will
      go
      out
      of
      your
      way
      to
      make
      a
      fool
      out
      of
      someone
      by
      responding
      to
      a
      well-thought-out,
      intelligent,
      or
      humorous
      statement
      that
      probably
      took
      longer
      to
      write
      than
      you
      can
      last
      in
      bed
      with
      a
      chimpanzee.
      What
      do
      I
      have
      to
      say
      to
      you?
      Absolutely
      nothing.
      I
      couldn't
      be
      bothered
      to
      respond
      to
      such
      a
      worthless
      attempt
      at
      a
      response.
      Do
      you
      want
      "K"
      on
      your
      gravestone?
      Do
      you
      want
      people
      to
      remember
      you
      as
      the
      asshat
      who
      one
      day
      decided
      to
      respond
      to
      someone
      with
      a
      single
      letter?
      "Hey,
      look,
      everybody!
      It's
      that
      "K"
      guy!"
      That's
      who
      you
      are.
      You're
      going
      to
      be
      known
      as
      the
      "K"
      guy.
      How
      does
      it
      feel?
      Do
      you
      feel
      happy?
      Quite
      honestly,
      I
      don't
      care,
      which
      is
      why
      I'm
      not
      even
      going
      to
      respond
      to
      you.
      Goodbye,
      and
      good
      luck
      with
      your
      future
      as
      that
      guy
      who
      said
      "K".

      This
      is
      what
      my
      uncle
      did
      to
      me
      after
      he
      came
      up
      my
      ass
      and
      he
      decided
      to
      try
      to
      get
      the
      cum
      out
      because
      he
      wanted
      a
      snack,
      so
      I
      held
      the
      cum
      in
      my
      ass
      to
      warm
      it
      up
      for
      him,
      while
      he
      tried
      to
      fish
      it
      out
      with
      his
      tongue.

      You

      about
      me
      and
      if
      I
      were
      to
      off
      myself
      right,
      nobody
      would
      be
      upset.
      My
      classmates
      would
      pretend
      that
      they
      gave
      a
      fuck
      about
      me
      for
      1
      or
      2
      days
      just
      to
      get
      cheap
      clout
      on
      Instagram
      or
      snapchat,
      my
      parents
      will
      inevitably
      move
      on,
      and
      my
       #8220;friends #8221;
      will
      probably
      end
      up
      forgetting
      about
      me.
      I #8217;ll
      just
      be
      another
      person
      buried
      six
      feet
      deep.
      If
      anything,
      I #8217;ll
      have
      more
      of
      a
      use
      dead
      then
      I
      ever
      had
      alive,
      because
      my
      body
      will
      eventually
      decompose
      and
      become
      one
      with
      the
      earth.
      The
      fact
      I
      haven #8217;t
      killed
      myself
      yet
      is
      truly
      astonishing,
      and
      I #8217;m
      hopefully
      gonna
      end
      up
      dead
      before
      25,
      so
      that
      way
      I
      can
      stop
      having
      nightmares
      about
      what
      lies
      beyond
      death,
      and
      finally
      have
      my
      well
      deserved
      permanent
      sleep.
      Anyways,
      how #8217;s
      your
      day
      going

      I
      was
      at
      shoprite
      and
      just
      finished,
      well,
      shopping
      and
      I
      was
      at
      the
      check
      out
      line.
      So
      this
      woman
      in
      front
      of
      me
      finishes
      up
      checking
      out
      her
      things
      and
      as
      shes
      leaving,
      I
      notice
      something
      on
      the
      floor.
      It #8217;s
      a
      can
      of
      bumble
      bee
      tuna.
      The
      first
      thing
      my
      mind
      goes
      to
      is
      that
      the
      woman
      dropped
      it
      and
      I
      decide
      to
      tell
      her
      if
      this
      can
      of
      tuna
      is
      hers.
      I
      pick
      it
      up,
      and
      then
      just
      froze.
      I
      tried
      getting
      her
      attention,
      but
      she
      just
      continued
      walking
      away.
      I
      didn #8217;t
      know
      what
      to
      do.
      I
      was
      just
      awkwardly
      standing
      there
      holding
      a
      can
      of
      tuna.
      Eventually,
      I
      just
      gave
      up
      and
      put
      the
      tuna
      on
      a
      different
      register.
      I
      felt
      like
      such
      an
      asshole
      leaving,
      knowing
      that
      this
      woman
      likely
      bought
      that
      tuna
      and
      left
      the
      store
      without
      it,
      all
      because
      of
      my
      stupid
      ass
      being
      unable
      to
      speak
      up
      a
      bit
      louder,
      or
      ya
      know,
      just
      walk
      towards
      her.

      Mine
      is
      when
      Steve
      raped
      the
      Burpinator,
      because
      it
      reminds
      me
      of
      when
      my
      uncle
      led
      me
      into
      his
      closet
      and
      raped
      me.
      He
      held
      his
      hand
      over
      my
      mouth
      to
      muffle
      my
      screams
      of
      pain,
      and
      warned
      me
      if
      I
      ever
      told
      anyone
      what
      he
      did,
      he
      would
      kill
      me
      in
      my
      sleep.
      I #8217;ve
      never
      told
      anyone
      what
      happened
      to
      me
      on
      that
      fateful
      night,
      because
      one
      time
      in
      9th
      grade,
      I
      finally
      decided
      to
      tell
      the
      school
      counselor
      about
      what
      happened
      to
      me,
      and
      she
      laughed
      at
      me,
      and
      told
      me
      that
      men
      can #8217;t
      be
      raped.
      She
      said
      I
      was
      lying
      and
      only
      looking
      for
      attention,
      and
      told
      me
      she
      would
      notify
      the
      principal
      if
      I
      didn #8217;t
      leave.
      Of
      course,
      this
      was
      high
      school,
      and
      someone
      somehow
      figured
      out
      my
      secret
      and
      I
      quickly
      became
      the
      laughing
      stock.
      They
      called
      me
      weak,
      a
      sissy,
      and
      a
      faggot.
      Even
      worse,
      my
      mother
      soon
      found
      about
      this
      and
      she
      laughed
      in
      my
      face.
      She
      called
      me
      a
      pathetic
      weak
      willed
      person.
      At
      this
      point
      I
      can #8217;t
      do
      this
      anymore.
      This
      was
      all
      years
      ago,
      and
      yet
      the
      pain
      still
      haunts
      me.
      On
      August
      10th,
      I
      plan
      to
      finally
      end
      it
      all.
      No
      more
      pain,
      No
      more
      suffering,
      but
      most
      importantly,
      No
      more
      holding
      down
      everyone.
      I #8217;m
      finally
      going
      to
      give
      everyone
      what
      they
      want.
      I
      won #8217;t
      be
      writing
      a
      suicide
      note,
      because
      no
      one
      gives
      a
      fuck
      about
      me
      anyway,
      and
      I #8217;ll
      probably
      just
      be
      buried
      in
      a
      generic
      cemetery,
      and
      just
      be
      seen
      as
      another
      person
      buried
      6
      feet
      deep.
      So
      overall,
      this
      story
      was
      pretty
      good,
      but
      not
      as
      good
      as
      the
      original
      stinky
      steve
      trilogy.
      Im
      really
      interested
      in
      seeing
      what
      the
      author
      is
      gonna
      do
      with
      the
      5th
      book
      though.

      It #8217;s
      funny,
      because
      people
      hate

      the

      Edit:
      Never
      fucking
      mind.
      They
      added
      a
      menu

      Yeah,
      to
      be

      I
      don #8217;t
      care

      much
      about
      the

      As

      they
      don #8217;t
      affect
      how
      you

      get
      wumpa
      coins,
      then
      I #8217;m
      just
      ok
      with
      them.
      I
      would

      it
      if
      they

      His
      name
      is
      Mac.
      My
      mother
      got
      him
      a
      few
      years
      ago
      along
      with
      a
      different
      cat
      named
      Mina.
      I
      recall
      one
      time
      when
      he
      was
      still
      a
      kitten
      that
      my
      mother
      moved
      the
      litter
      box
      a
      few
      away
      from
      its
      original
      place.
      He
      ended
      up
      shitting
      right
      next
      to
      it.
      Asides
      from
      that,
      both
      of
      them
      are
      good
      cats.

      Nah.
      I #8217;ve
      already
      come
      to
      accept
      the
      fact
      that
      I #8217;m
      ugly.
      Everyone
      else
      around
      me
      has
      perfect
      skin,
      hair,
      and
      weight,
      while
      I #8217;m
      disgusting,
      have
      hair
      that
      I
      don #8217;t
      bother
      to
      comb,
      and
      feel
      overweight.
      The
      only
      thing
      I
      wanna
      do
      with
      my
      life
      is
      rapping,
      and
      yet
      my
      white
      ass
      is
      too
      lazy
      to
      actually
      try
      writing
      shit
      down.
      I
      also
      fucking
      really
      do
      not
      like
      my
      voice.
      Like
      i
      wish
      it
      was
      slightly
      more
      deeper.
      Due
      to
      my
      luck,
      I #8217;m
      probably
      just
      gonna
      work
      as
      a
      fast
      food
      worker
      for
      the
      rest
      of
      my
      life
      while
      everyone
      else
      around
      me
      gets
      successful
      careers
      and
      live
      in
      fancy
      houses,
      and
      I #8217;ll
      probably
      struggle
      to
      pay
      the
      rent
      on
      my
      shitty
      apartment,
      and
      go
      to
      sleep
      at
      night
      without
      being
      able
      to
      cuddle
      with
      anyone.
      The
      only
      reason
      people
      always
      say
      that
      bullies
      always
      end
      up
      failing
      in
      life
      is
      because
      they
      don #8217;t
      want
      you
      to
      snap
      and
      become
      this
      weeks
      school
      shooter.
      I #8217;m
      probably
      gonna
      barely
      graduate,
      or
      drop
      out,
      and
      just
      hope
      that
      this
      rap
      shit
      works
      out.

      The
      sub
      is
      definitely
      at
      its
      best
      on
      the
      weekends.
      During
      the
      week,
      it #8217;s
      mostly
      just
      reposts
      from
      other
      meme
      subreddits(like
      goddamn,
      at
      least
      give
      credit
      to
      the
      original)
      with
      a
      few
      gems
      sprinkled
      in
      here
      and
      there.
      On
      the
      weekends,
      this
      place
      feels
      more
      like
      a
      teenage
      subreddit.
      Like
      we
      got
      stories
      of
      sticking
      our
      dicks
      in
      shampoo
      bottles
      and
      fucking
      ropes,
      and
      sure,
      most
      of
      the
      stories
      are
      fake,
      but
      there
      still
      entertaining
      to
      read.
      I
      wish
      there
      was
      a
      subreddit
      that
      was
      basically
      this
      sub
      but
      it #8217;s
      just
      all
      text
      posts.
      That
      would
      be
      great.
       gt;!Heh
      I
      might
      be
      hinting
      at
      something....
      not
      saying
      I #8217;m
      gonna
      create
      it
      myself,
      but
      if
      someone
      does
      create
      it,
      then
      can
      I
      be
      a
      mod?
      I
      did
      come
      up
      with
      the
      idea
      after
      all...! lt;

      this

      I

      really
      get
      too
      much
      incel
      vibes

      He

      OP,
      I
      haven #8217;t
      been

      the

      I
      can
      really
      say
      is
      that
      you
      need
      to
      break
      out
      of
      your
      comfort
      zone.
      This
      is
      coming
      from
      someone
      who
      isn #8217;t
      really
      that
      social
      though,
      but
      I
      hear
      that
      all
      the

      Mods
      introduced
      a
      new
      rule
      where
      essentially,
      shitposts
      are
      banned
      because
      there
      not
      relatable
      or
      something
      like
      that.
      They
      want
      us
      to
      post
      more
      relatable
      content
      on
      here,
      but
      the
      problem
      is
      that
      all
      of
      us
      are
      different.
      We
      all
      have
      different
      interests
      and
      hobbies.
      The
      only
      thing
      we
      all
      do
      that #8217;s
      relatable
      to
      everyone
      is
      go
      to
      school,
      but
      even
      then,
      some
      of
      us
      are
      homeschooled.
      That #8217;s
      why
      everyone
      is
      going
      around
      making
      jokes
      about
      how
      certain
      shit
      isn #8217;t
      relatable,
      and
      are
      saying
      not
      to
      post
      anything
      on
      Monday
      as
      a
      form
      of
      protesting.
      I
      just
      want
      this
      to
      die
      over
      really
      quick
      because
      text
      post
      weekends
      are
      my
      favorite
      part
      of
      this
      sub,
      and
      this
      week
      got
      fucked
      all
      thanks
      to
      the
      mods.

      Yeah,
      I
      think
      I #8217;m
      gonna
      take
      a
      break
      from
      this
      sub
      for
      a
      few
      days.
      This
      whole
      fiasco
      should
      blow
      over
      by
      the
      time
      I
      come
      back.

      I #8217;m
      remembering
      this
      off
      the
      top
      of
      my
      head,
      but
      I
      think
      it
      was
      a
      post
      where
      some
      user
      called
      out
      there
      father
      for
      being
      abusive,
      they
      ended
      up
      getting
      exposed
      as
      a
      karma
      whore,
      and
      then
      they
      deleted
      the
      post
      and
      their
      account.

      Some
      people
      are
      willing
      to
      stoop
      very
      low
      for
      some
      imaginary
      points.
      This
      sub
      is
      semi
      notorious
      for
      being
      fairly
      easy
      to
      farm
      karma
      from.
      Just
      repost
      something
      from
      dank
      memes
      or
      make
      up
      a
      story
      on
      text
      post
      weekends,
      and
      you #8217;ll
      probably
      get
      a
      couple
      updoots.

      Well,
      because
      from
      what
      I #8217;ve
      seen,
      y #8217;all
      are
      acting
      ridiculous.
      Y #8217;all
      are
      calling
      the
      mods
      gay
      without
      irony,
      made
      posts
      about
      crusading
      and
      not
      posting
      on
      monday(which
      obviously
      didn #8217;t
      work
      out),
      and
      basically,
      are
      taking
      this
      whole
      thing
      a
      little
      too
      seriously.
      I
      do
      think
      the
      mods
      ideas
      about
      completely
      banning
      shitposts
      are
      stupid,
      but
      I
      still
      think
      there
      should
      be
      a
      day
      where
      shitposts
      shouldn #8217;t
      be
      allowed
      on
      here.
      I
      love
      shitposts
      as
      much
      as
      all
      of
      you
      do,
      but
      too
      much
      shitposts
      can
      bore
      any
      person
      eventually.

      Welcome
      to
      the
      MHA
      fandom,
      where
      all
      the
      characters
      are
      gay
      or
      lesbian,
      You
      can #8217;t
      like
      Mineta
      or
      Endeavor
      without
      being
      called
      a
       #8220;pervert #8221;
      or
      a
       #8220;child
      abuse
      supporter #8221;,
      and
      best
      of
      all,
      the
      fanfiction.
      The
      fucking
      fanfiction
      where
      Midoriya
      fucks
      all
      the
      women
      in
      the
      world,
      the
      fanfiction
      where
      Bakugou
      essentially
      rapes
      Ochako
      and
      ends
      up
      getting
      a
      slap
      on
      the
      wrist,
      and
      best
      of
      all,
      the
      fanfiction
      where
      Mineta
      is
      abused
      for
      literally
      just...
      existing.
      The
      fandom
      ruined
      this
      show
      for
      me.
      I
      still
      think
      the
      show
      is
      pretty
      decent,
      but
      I
      think
      the
      4th
      season
      is
      gonna
      be
      the
      last
      one
      I
      watch
      and
      then
      I #8217;m
      done.
      If
      you
      haven #8217;t
      already,
      stay
      the
      fuck
      away
      from
      the
      fandom.
      Don #8217;t
      even
      touch
      it
      with
      a
      10
      foot
      pole.
      Just
      fucking
      watch
      the
      show
      and
      pretend
      the
      fandom
      doesn #8217;t
      exist.
      (Also,
      if
      this
      wasn #8217;t
      obvious
      enough,
      stay
      away
      from
      the
      fanfiction.
      There
      are
      some
      fucked
      up
      stories
      that
      I
      ended
      up
      reading
      for
      shits
      and
      giggles.
      It #8217;s
      hilarious
      that
      people
      hate
      mineta
      for
      being
      perverted,
      yet
      the
      shit
      some
      of
      these
      people
      write
      is
      apparently
      a
      ok.)

      Sorry,
      this
      fandom
      just
      fucking
      infuriates
      me.

      don #8217;t
      a

      and
      just...
      fuck
      em
      up.
      Like
      of
      course,
      there
      are
      some
      good
      things
      that
      come
      out
      of
      fandoms,
      but
      a
      lot
      of
      bad
      shit
      comes
      out
      as
      well.
      (Also,
      wanted
      to
      mention
      that
      there #8217;s
      an
      entire
      subreddit
      dedicated
      to
      porn
      of
      MHA
      characters,
      and
      yet
      Mineta
      is
      still
      a
      perverted
      and
      disgusting
      character
      apparently.
      Fucking

      I
      should
      be
      a
      bit
      more
      specific
      about
      how
      I
      use
      Twitter.
      While
      nowadays
      I
      use
      it
      rarely,
      I
      admittedly
      was
      semi
      addicted
      to
      it
      a
      while
      ago.
      I
      was
      also
      a
      much
      bigger
      MHA
      fan
      back
      then,
      and
      not
      only
      used
      twitter
      but
      also
      just
      normal
      search
      browsers.
      I
      started
      browsing
      deep
      through
      the
      fandom,
      curious
      to
      what
      I
      would
      find,
      and
      frankly,
      I
      regret
      doing
      that.

      Well
      after
      all
      of
      those
      yrs
      of
      Tom
      trying
      to
      catch
      jerry
      jerry
      decides
      that
      enough
      is
      enough
      he
      won #8217;t
      play
      around
      anymore
      and
      that
      he
      has
      to
      put
      a
      stop
      to
      this.
      Jerry
      drugs
      toms
      milk
      and
      Tom
      falls
      asleep.
      Jerry
      waits
      for
      Tom
      to
      wake
      up
      bc
      he
      wants
      to
      see
      the
      look
      of
      shock,
      and
      fear
      on
      toms
      face
      when
      Tom
      realizes
      the
      situation
      he #8217;s
      in.
      Tom
      ever
      defiant
      tries
      his
      best
      to
      break
      free
      from
      his
      bonds,
      but
      after
      struggling
      for
      10
      minutes
      he
      realizes
      that
      it #8217;s
      futile
      so
      he
      glares
      at
      jerry
      with
      as
      much
      hatred
      as
      he
      can
      muster
      up.
      Jerry
      was
      getting
      turned
      on
      by
      Tom #8217;s
      defiance
      and
      it
      was
      showing
      by
      Jerry #8217;s
      massive
      boner
      good
      lord
      it #8217;s
      bigger
      than
      it
      was
      supposed
      to
      be
      for
      a
      mouse.
      Jerry
      would
      have
      fun
      breaking
      Tom #8217;s
      mind
      and
      body,
      Jerry
      could
      already
      hear
      Tom #8217;s
      screams
      and
      he
      was
      dripping
      with
      pre-cum.
      Jerry
      couldn #8217;t
      wait
      to
      force
      his
      cock
      up
      Tom #8217;s
      tight
      ass
      as
      he
      was
      about
      to
      insert
      his
      way
      into
      Tom
      he
      told
      Tom
      that
      for
      so
      long
      he #8217;s
      wanted
      to
      make
      Tom
      his
      little
      play
      thing
      and
      now
      that
      he
      has
      the
      chance
      he #8217;s
      going
      to
      use
      Tom
      until
      he #8217;s
      bored
      or
      until
      he
      has
      dumped
      all
      of
      his
      cum
      into
      Tom #8217;s
      ass.
      For
      the
      first
      time
      in
      Tom #8217;s
      life
      he
      was
      afraid #8230;afraid.
      It
      doesn #8217;t
      matter
      how
      many
      times
      jerry
      has
      duped
      him
      or
      tricked
      him
      this
      was
      too
      far
      and
      he
      hoped
      that
      Jerry
      was
      just
      playing
      but
      seeing
      Jerry #8217;s
      massive
      boner
      made
      him
      lose
      hope.
      Jerry
      was
      so
      turned
      on
      by
      Tom #8217;s
      face
      of
      despair
      that
      he
      couldn #8217;t
      hold
      it
      in
      and
      he
      busted
      a
      nut
      all
      over
      Tom #8217;s
      back.
      Jerry
      was
      enraged
      that
      he
      had
      done
      that
      and
      angry
      at
      Tom
      for
      making
      that
      face
      that
      turned
      him
      on
      so
      much.
      He
      lowered
      himself
      to
      Tom
      and
      whispered
      into
      his
      ear
       #8220;for
      making
      me
      do
      that
      I #8217;ll
      make
      sure
      that
      I #8217;ll
      cum
      inside
      of
      you
      so
      much
      that
      when
      I #8217;m
      finished
      all
      I
      would
      have
      to
      do
      is
      push
      on
      your
      stomach
      and
      my
      semen
      will
      come
      out #8221;.
      By
      this
      point
      Tom
      was
      screaming
      at
      the
      top
      of
      his
      lungs
      hoping
      that
      someone
      would
      help
      him
      and
      Tom #8217;s
      screaming
      was
      making
      Jerry #8217;s
      boner
      harder
      so
      Jerry
      forced
      himself
      into
      Tom.
      Tom
      has
      started
      crying
      turning
      on
      Jerry
      even
      more
      Jerry
      was
      enjoying
      this
      so
      much
      he #8217;s
      never
      had
      this
      much
      pleasure
       #8220;oh
      my
      god
      Tom
      your
      ass
      is
      so
      tight,
      fuck
      I #8217;m
      going
      to
      cum #8221;
      Jerry
      released
      his
      cum
      into
      Tom #8217;s
      ass
      and
      Tom
      just
      whimpered
      Jerry
      was
      in
      a
      trance,
      he
      was
      addicted,
      and
      he
      had
      to
      have
      more.
      He
      forced
      his
      cock
      into
      Tom #8217;s
      ass
      again
      but
      he
      couldn #8217;t
      last
      for
      more
      than
      a
      couple
      minutes.
      Tom #8217;s
      cries
      of
      pain
      only
      fueling
      Jerry #8217;s
      addiction.
       #8220;StOP
      pLeaSe #8221;
      Tom
      screamed
      at
      Jerry
       #8220;Oh
      fuck
      I
      love
      it
      when
      you
      scream
      it
      turns
      me
      on
      so
      much
      Tom #8221;
      Jerry
      released
      another
      load
      into
      Tom
      anus
      Jerry
      couldn #8217;t
      stop
      he
      just
      couldn #8217;t
      Tom #8217;s
      tight
      ass
      was
      so
      addicting
      that
      it
      wasn #8217;t
      until
      2
      weeks
      had
      past
      that
      Jerry
      had
      finished
      releasing
      all
      of
      his
      cum
      into
      Tom #8217;s
      ass,
      but
      this
      wasn #8217;t
      the
      end
      for
      Tom
      he
      was
      Jerry #8217;s
      until
      the
      day
      he
      died
      Also
      hide
      behind
      cover
      to
      recover
      your
      boner
      bc
      if
      you
      take
      too
      much
      damage
      your
      boner
      will
      die
      and
      you #8217;ll
      have
      to
      respawn

      I

      time
      I
      covered
      my
      dick
      raw
      in

      syrup
      just
      so
      ants

      Honestly,
      I
      don #8217;t
      get
      what #8217;s
      wrong
      with
      acne.
      I
      mean,
      I
      guess
      it
      doesn #8217;t
      look
      that
      appealing,
      but
      other
      then
      that,
      it #8217;s
      perfectly
      fine.
      Whenever
      I
      get
      hungry,
      I
      pop
      a
      zit
      off
      my
      face
      and
      eat
      the
      contents
      that
      pour
      out.
      It
      tastes
      yummy,
      sort
      of
      warm,
      a
      bit
      sour,
      but
      very
      nice.
      I
      usually
      eat
      a
      good
      amount
      of
      cysts
      everyday.
      Both
      in
      public
      and
      private.
      I
      do
      get
      a
      lot
      of
      bad
      looks
      in
      public
      but
      I
      don #8217;t
      give
      a
      fuck.
      I
      don #8217;t
      give
      a
      fuck
      about
      the
      fact
      that
      I #8217;m
      ugly
      and
      underdeveloped
      compared
      to
      everyone
      else.
      I
      don #8217;t

      the
      fact
      that
      I #8217;m
      going
      to
      die
      alone
      and
      no
      one
      will
      even
      bat
      a
      fucking
      eye
      and
      the
      world
      will
      just
      go
      on.
      I
      don #8217;t
      care
      that
      not
      even
      my
      parents
      will
      give
      a
      fuck
      about
      my
      death,
      and
      if
      anything,
      will
      probably
      be
      glad
      that
      I #8217;m
      dead,
      seeing
      how
      much
      of
      a
      fucking
      disappointment
      I
      am
      in
      their
      eyes.
      I
      also
      don #8217;t
      give
      a
      fuck
      about
      how
      I #8217;ve
      had
      literally
      no
      friends
      throughout
      my
      pathetic
      life,
      and
      everyone
      made
      fun
      of
      me
      calling
      me
      a
      ugly
      fucking
      useless
      shit
      eating
      cunt.
      FINE

      FUCKING
      WIN.
      IM
      FUCKING
      DONE
      WITH
      LIFE.

      FACT
      THAT
      I
      HAVEN #8217;T
      FUCKING
      OFFED
      MYSELF
      YET
      IS
      TRULY
      ASTOUNDING.
      WELL
      GUESS
      WHAT.
      IM
      FINALLY
      ABOUT
      TO
      GIVE
      YOU
      ALL
      WHAT
      YOU
      FUCKING
      WANT.
      AUGUST
      20TH
      WILL
      BE
      THE
      DAY
      I
      SHALL
      TRAVEL
      TO

      Please
      hug
      your
      parents.
      That #8217;s
      all
      I
      want
      you
      to
      do.
      Tell
      them
      you
      love
      them,
      and
      that
      your
      glad
      you
      have
      them
      in
      your
      life.
      Or
      if
      you
      might
      not
      have
      that
      good
      of
      a
      relationship
      with
      your
      parents,
      then
      hug
      a
      close
      friend.
      Tell
      them
      how
      much
      they
      mean
      to
      you.
      And
      hell,
      if
      you
      don #8217;t
      have
      any
      of
      those,
      then
      hug
      yourself.
      Tell
      yourself
      that
      your
      a
      great
      person,
      that
      your
      the
      sperm
      that
      deserved
      to
      win
      the
      race.
      It
      might
      not
      seem
      like
      it
      now,
      but
      you
      do
      have
      a
      place
      on
      the
      earth,
      whether
      it
      be
      a
      minor
      or
      a
      big
      one.
      Just
      remember
      to
      spend
      as
      much
      time
      as
      you
      can
      with
      your
      loved
      ones,
      because
      like
      all
      people,
      they
      soon
      will
      drift
      away,
      and
      you
      will
      be
      left
      to
      your
      own
      devices.

      TLDR:
      You
      have
      meaning
      in
      your
      life,
      and
      you

      interact
      with
      your
      loved
      and
      closed
      ones
      as
      much
      as
      you
      can
      before
      you
      have
      to
      inevitably
      leave
      them.

      I
      already
      have
      rocket
      league.
      Stopped
      playing
      it
      a
      while
      ago
      cause
      I
      got
      kinda
      bored
      of
      it.
      Gonna
      see
      if
      this
      post
      gets
      anymore
      replies
      just
      in
      case
      but
      everyone
      seems
      to
      be
      leaning
      more
      towards

      I
      honestly
      for
      the
      life
      of
      me
      can #8217;t
      remember.
      I
      think
      it #8217;s
      been
      over
      a
      year
      since
      I
      last
      played
      rocket
      league
      and
      I
      have
      no
      interest
      in
      coming
      back.

      Sunday
       #128467;
      was
      warm
       #127964;
      and
      sunny
       #9728; #65039;,
      just #128076;
      how
       #129300;
      I
      always
       #128340;
      fantasized #9786; #65039;
      it
      would
      be
      when
       #9200;
      I
      finally
      went
      through
      with
      it.
      I
      stared
      walking
       #127939; #8205; #9792; #65039; #127939; #8205; #9792; #65039;
      to
      the
      dumpster #128465;
      again,
      I
      think
       #129300; #129300; #129300;
      about
      2pm,
      and
      I
      was
      really
      excited #128513; #128513;
      and
      nervous
       #128543; #128543;.
      I
      felt
      butterflies
       #129419;
      in
      my
      tummy #129314;,
      just
      anticipating
       #128563;
      what
       #128517;
      I
      was
      about
      to
      do.
      The
      dumpster #128465;
      is
       #127542;
      in
      the
      alley
      behind #128527;
      a
      restaurant
       #127869; #127869;
      near
      my
      house
       #127968; #127968; #127968;.
      It
      gets
      emptied
      on
       #128283; #128283;
      Tuesdays,
      so
      by
      Sunday #128467;
      it's
      pretty
      stinky #129314; #129326;
      and
      there
      are
      flies #129439;
      buzzing
      around.
      Which
      means #129300;
      there
      are
      things
      rotting #129314;
      inside
      there
      and
      that's
      just #128076;
      perfect #128076;
      for
      me.
      A
      few #129488;
      times #9200;
      in
      the
      past #128368;
      I
      climbed
      into
      that
      dumpster #128465;
      and
      masturbated #128555; #129308; #127814; #128166;.
      Nothing
       #127514; #127514; #127514;
      too
      intense #129397;.
      Most #129488;
      I'd
      ever
      done
      was
      take
      off #128527;
      my
      pants #128086;
      and
      hump
       #128042; #128042;
      against
      the
      dirty #129314;
      garbage
       #128465; #128465;
      bags.
      And
      one
      1 #65039; #8419;1 #65039; #8419;
      time
       #8986;
      I
      laid
      there
      with
      my
      legs #129461;spread,
      watching
       #128064;
      the
      flies
       #129439;
      land
      on
       #128283;
      me.
      So
      anyway #128521;,
      I
      walked #128694; #8205; #9794; #65039;
      down
       #11015; #11015;
      the
      alley #127961;
      to
      the
      dumpster #128465;,
      and
      as
      usual #129488; #9757; #65039;
      I
      made
      sure #128548;
      nobody #128683;
      was
      around,
      just
       #128076;
      to
      be
      extra
      careful.
      You
      have
       #127542; #127542; #127542;
      to
      go
      behind #128527;
      a
      tall
      wooden #127794;
      fence
      to
      even
      see
       #128065; #128065; #128065;
      the
      dumpster #128465;,
      and
      the
      restaurant
       #127869; #127869;
      is
       #127542;
      closed #128683;
      on
       #128283;
      Sunday
       #128467;
      anyway,
      so
      I
      knew
       #129300;
      I
      wouldn't
      be
      noticed #128064;.
      But
      this
       #11014;
      time
       #8986;
      there's
      no
       #128547;
      way
       #8597; #65039; #8597; #65039;
      I
      want
       #128523;
      to
      be
      disturbed.
      I
      climbed
      up
       #9757;
      and
      over
      the
      side
      and
      onto
      my
      hands
       #129330; #129330;
      and
      knees
       #129461; #129461;
      into
      the
      mass
      of
      plastic
      garbage
       #128465;
      bags
      and
      other
      miscellaneous
      rubbish
       #128465; #128465;.
      The
      bags
      felt
      warm
       #127964; #127964;
      from
      the
      sun
       #128261; #128261; #128261;.
      The
      smell
       #128067; #128067;
      in
      there
      was
      extremely
      foul,
      much
      worse
      than
      usual,
      and
      I
      knew
       #129300;
      it
      was
      because
      of
      my
      rotting
      meat
       #129363; #129363;.
      I
      sat
      and
      tried
      to
      get
       #127568; #127568; #127568;
      myself
      to
      relax
       #127866; #127866;
      for
      a
      few
      minutes.
      There
      was
      no
       #128547; #128547; #128547;
      reason
      to
      hurry.
      When
       #9200;
      I
      was
      ready,
      I
      calmly
      took
      off
      my
      sandals
       #128097;
      ,
      my
      jeans
       #128086; #128086; #128086;,
      and
      my
      panties
       #128089;.
      Both
       #9996; #65039;
      pairs.
      I
      was
      wearing
      two
       #9996; #9996; #9996;
      pairs
      of
      tight #128555;
      panties #128089;
      with
      a
      bunch
      of
      my
      panty #128089;
      liners
      in
      the
      crotch #127814;,
      which
      keeps
      anything
      in
      my
      vagina #129361;
      from
      coming
      out
       #127950; #127949;
      when
       #9200;
      I
      move #128694; #8205; #9794; #65039;around.
      But
       #9757; #65039; #129488;
      I
      was
      going
      "all
      the
      way
       #8597; #65039; #8597; #65039;"
      this
       #11014;
      time
       #8986; #8986;,
      so
      I
      went
      ahead
      and
      got
      completely
      naked #128521;.
      That
      was
      a
      weird
       #128533; #128533;
      feeling,
      being
      totally
      nude #128521;
      inside
      the
      dumpster #128465;.
      It
      seemed
      very
      erotic #128553; #10084; #65039;
      to
      me.
      The
      sun
       #128261;
      felt
      warm
       #127964; #127964; #127964;
      on
       #128283;
      my
      skin,
      especially
      my
      boobs,
      which
      pretty
      much
      never
       #10060;
      see
       #128065; #128065;
      the
      sun
       #128261; #128261; #128261;.
      I
      took
      a
      pair
       #128107; #128107;
      of
      rubber
      kitchen
       #127855; #127855;
      gloves
       #129508;
      out
       #127950; #127949;
      of
      my
      pants
       #128086;
      pocket
      and
      put
      them
      on
       #128283;.
      There
      was
      no
       #128547;
      way
       #8597; #65039; #8597; #65039;
      I
      could
      bring
      myself
      to
      actually
      touch #128073;
      a
      maggot
       #128027;
      with
      my
      bare
      hands
       #129330;.
      Lying
      with
      my
      back
       #11013; #65039; #11013; #65039;
      against
      the
      side
      of
      the
      dumpster #128465;,
      I
      fingered #128073;
      my
      pussy
       #128049;.
      I
      was
      really
      wet
       #128166;
      already.
      I
      knew
       #129300;
      I
      would
      be.
      The
      sensation #128553;
      of
      the
      rubber
      glove
       #129508;
      against
      my
      clit
       #129361;
      felt
      unusual. #129300;,
      and
      I
      kind
      of #129335; #8205; #9792; #65039;
      liked
      it.
      I
      did
      that #128073; #129361;
      for
      a
      little
      while,
      just
      thinking
       #129300; #129300; #129300;
      about
      what
       #128517;
      I
      was
      about
      to
      do,
      while
      staring
       #128064;
      at
      the
      smaller
      garbage
       #128465; #128465; #128465;
      bag
       #127890; #127890; #127890;
      in
      the
      far
      corner
      of
      the
      dumpster
       #128465;
      where
       #129335;
      I'd
      left
       #128072; #128072;
      it
      yesterday.
      I
      still
      felt
      the
      butterflies
       #129419;
      in
      my
      tummy
       #129314;.
      I
      kept
      thinking
       #129300; #129300; #129300;
      to
      myself
      that
      I
      can't
      wimp
       #129299;
      out
       #127950; #127949;,
      that
      I
      had
       #128545;
      to
      go
      through
      with
      this
       #11014;.
      I
      wished
       #128079;
      for
      a
      moment
      that
      someone
      else #128118;
      was
      there
      to
      force
      me
       #128555;
      to
      do
      it,
      but
      decided
       #9757; #65039; #129488;
      that
      it
      was
      somehow
       #129335; #8205; #9792; #65039;
      much
      more
       #10133; #10133; #10133;
      sick
       #128547;
      and
      depraved
       #128545;
      to
      do
      it
      to
      myself
      willingly.
      And
      I
      thought #129300;,
      yeah
       #128588;,
      that's
      me #129322;.
      That's
      what
       #128517;
      I
      want
       #128523;.
      I
      deserve
      this
       #11014;.
      And
      so
      I
      knew
       #129300;
      it
      was
      time
       #8986; #8986;
      to
      do
      it
      I
      got
      back
       #11013; #65039; #11013; #65039; #11013; #65039;
      on
       #128283;
      my
      hands
       #129330; #129330;
      and
      knees #129461;and
      crawled
      to
      the
      other
      side
      of
      the
      dumpster #128465;.
      I
      sat
      down
       #11015; #11015;
      next
       #9197; #9197;
      to
      my
      garbage
       #128465; #128465;
      bag
       #127890; #127890;,
      gently
      picked
      it
      up
       #9757; #9757;
      and
      placed
      it
      in
      front
      of
      me.
      The
      terrible
      smell
       #128067;
      was
      already
      stronger #9994;.
      Carefully,
      I
      tore
       #9995;
      the
      bag
       #127890; #127890;
      open
       #128080; #128080;.
      And
      there
      they
      were.
      There
      had
      to
      be
       #128563;
      thousands
       #128175;
      of
      maggots #128027;,
      kind
      of
      beige-yellow
       #127804; #127804; #127804;
      with
      little
      black
       #128053;
      spots
       #129426; #129426; #129426;
      on
       #128283; #128283;
      them,
      all
      writhing #129396;
      in
      a
      large
      mass.
      I
      couldn't
      even
      see
       #128065;
      the
      rotting
       #129314;
      meat
       #129363; #129363;
      underneath
      them.
      Dozens
      more
       #10133; #10133;
      maggots
       #128027;
      clung
      to
      the
      inside
      of
      the
      black #128053;
      plastic,
      which
      was
      coated
       #129509;
      with
      a
      thick #127825;
      light
       #127875; #127875;-brown
       #128052;
      slime.
      It
      was
      such
      a
      repulsive #129326;
      sight
       #128294; #128294;
      I
      thought
       #128173;
      I
      was
      going
      to
      throw
      up
       #129326; #9757; #9757;
      right
       #128073;
      there.
      But
       #9757; #65039; #129488;
      I
      didn't.
      I
      took
      a
      few
      minutes
       #9200;
      to
      get
       #127568; #127568;
      control
       #128250;
      of
      myself,
      fingering #128070;
      my
      clit
       #129361;
      while
      staring
       #128064;
      at
      the
      maggots
       #128027;,
      trying
      to
      work
       #128188;
      up
       #9757; #9757; #9757;
      the
      courage
      to
      continue
       #9193; #9193;.
      I
      scooped
      up
       #9757;
      some
      of
      the
      slime
       #128166;
      on
       #128283; #128283; #128283;
      my
      gloved
       #129508;
      finger
       #128133; #128133;
      and
      brought
      it
      to
      my
      nose
       #128067;.
      I
      knew
       #129300;
      what
       #128517;
      it
      was
      from
      the
      reading
       #128214;
      I'd
      done
      before.
      It
      was
      digestive #129314;
      juices
       #129380;
      from
      the
      maggots
       #128027;,
      full
       #127541; #127541;
      of
      bacteria
       #129440;.
      And
      it
      smelled #128134; #8205; #9794; #65039;
      just
      horrible #129326; #129324;.
      I
      thought
       #128173;
      to
      myself,
      that's
      what
       #128517;
      I'm
      going
      to
      smell
       #128067; #128067;
      like
       #128516; #128516; #128516;.
      That's
      the
      stench
       #129314;
      that's
      going
      to
      come
       #128166;
      from
      my
      vagina
       #129361;.
      I
      want
       #128523;
      that,
      I
      thought #128173;,
      spreading
      my
      legs #129461;wide
      apart.
      I
      dragged
      my
      slimy #128166;
      finger
       #128133; #128133;
      between
      my
      pussy
       #128049;
      lips
       #128068;.
      My
      clit #129361;
      felt
      like
       #128516; #128516; #128516;
      a
      hard
       #127814;
      little
      pebble
      beneath
      the
      slime.
      I
      didn't
      want
       #128523;
      to
      cum
      right
       #128073; #128073; #128073;
      then,
      though,
      and
      I
      was
      still
      right
       #128073; #128073;
      on
       #128283; #128283;
      the
      edge
      of
      gagging,
      too.
      But
      I
      knew
       #129300;
      there
      was
      no
       #128547; #128547;
      turning
      back
       #11013; #65039; #11013; #65039; #11013; #65039;
      now,
      so
      I
      let
      my
      fingers
       #9994;
      lightly
      touch
      the
      top
       #128316; #128316; #128316;
      of
      the
      maggot
       #128027;
      mass.
      The
      maggots
      felt
      like
       #128516; #128516;
      nothing
       #127514; #127514; #127514;
      I'd
      experienced
      before.
      They
      seemed
      to
      have
       #127542; #127542;
      such
      energy
       #128267;,
      totally
      different
      from
      picking
      up
       #9757; #9757;
      an
      earthworm
       #128027;
      or
      something.
      And
      they
      felt
      so
      alive #128113; #8205; #9794; #65039;.
      I
      was
      fascinated
       #128563;
      and
      nauseated #129314;at
      the
      same
      time
       #8986;.
      Sinking
      my
      fingers
       #9994;
      into
      the
      mass,
      I
      felt
      the
      solid
       #129406;
      meat
       #129363; #129363;
      beneath.
      Gently
      breaking
      it
      apart,
      I
      could
      see
       #128065; #128065;
      that
      the
      meat
       #129363; #129363;
      had
      turned
      gray
       #127764; #127764; #127764;
      except #129488;
      for
      the
      very #128076;
      center
      which
      was
      still
      pink
       #128582;,
      and
      that
      the
      maggots
       #128027;
      had
      penetrated #128553;
      into
      it
      but
      not #9757; #65039; #129488;
      too
      deeply
      yet.
      There
      was
      still
      plenty
      of
      food
       #128031; #128031;
      for
      my
      filthy
       #129314;
      little
      babies #128118;.
      I
      broke
       #129335; #8205; #9794; #65039;
      off
      a
      small
      chunk
      of
      meat
       #129363; #129363; #129363;
      that
      was
      covered
      on
       #128283; #128283;
      one
      1 #65039; #8419;1 #65039; #8419;
      side
      with
      maggots
      and
      held
      it
      for
      a
      moment
      while
      I
      fought
      back
       #11013; #65039;
      another
      urge
      to
      vomit
       #129314; #129314;.
      It
      was
      finally
      time
       #8986; #8986;,
      I
      thought #128173;.
      I
      leaned
      forward
       #9197; #9197; #9197;,
      and
      holding
       #9994;
      my
      pussy
       #128049;
      lips
       #128068; #128068; #128068;
      apart
      with
      one
      1 #65039; #8419;
      hand
       #128077; #128077; #128077;,
      I
      gritted
      my
      teeth
       #128556; #128556; #128556;
      and
      pushed
      the
      maggot
       #128027;-covered
      chunk
      of
      meat
       #129363; #129363;
      into
      my
      vagina #129361;.
      And
      then #129488;,
      totally
      without
      expecting
      it #128563;,
      I
      had
      an
      orgasm #128553; #127814; #128166;.
      A
      quick #9889; #65039;,
      sharp
       #128481;
      one
      1 #65039; #8419;1 #65039; #8419;
      that
      only
      made
      me
      want
       #128523;
      more
       #10133; #10133;.
      And
      more
       #10133; #10133; #10133;
      was
      coming.
      I
      broke
       #129335; #8205; #9794; #65039;
      off
      another
      small
      chunk
      of
      meat
       #129363; #129363;,
      along
      with
       #129488;
      another
      part
      of
      the
      maggot
       #128027;
      mass
      and
      pushed #129308;
      it
      inside
      me.
      This
       #11014;
      one
      1 #65039; #8419;1 #65039; #8419;
      had
      more
       #10133; #10133;
      maggots
       #128027;
      on
       #128283; #128283;
      it,
      and
      I
      stopped
       #128683;
      for
      a
      moment #9757; #65039; #129488;
      to
      see
       #128065; #128065; #128065;
      if
      I
      could
      feel #9757; #65039;
      them
      inside
      me #128539;.
      I
      wasn't
      sure #129300;
      I
      could,
      but
      it
      didn't
      matter #128548;.
      I
      wanted
       #9888;
      them
      all.
      I
      needed #129488;
      to
      take
      them
      all #9994;
      inside
      me.
      With
      that
      thought
       #128173;
      ,
      I
      went
      sort
      of
      wild
       #128059; #128059;.
      I
      started
      pushing
       #129308;
      bigger
      chunks
      of
      meat
       #129363; #129363; #129363;
      and
      maggots
       #128027;,
      and
      even
      handfuls
       #129330;
      of
      just
      maggots
       #128027;
      into
      me,
      over
      and
      over #129396;.
      I
      was
      practically
      hyperventilating #128563; #128555;,
      too.
      I
      wasn't
      thinking
       #129300; #129300;
      at
      all
      about
      the
      noise
       #128266; #128266;
      I
      must
      have
       #127542; #127542;
      been
      making.
      But
      now
       #129488;
      I
      could
      definitely #9757; #65039;feel
      the
      maggots
       #128027;
      squirming
      inside
      my
      vagina #129361;.
      Just
      the
      idea
       #128161; #128161;
      of
      it
      made
      me
      cum
       #128166;
      again.
      Finally #129397;,
      once
      I
      had
      crammed #129308;
      all
      of
      the
      rotten #129314;
      meat
       #129363;,
      and
      all
      of
      the
      maggots #128027;
      I
      could
      inside
      me,
      I
      felt
      so
      filthy #129314;,
      so
      disgusting #129326; #129297;,
      like
       #128516; #128516; #128516;
      I'd
      turned
      myself #128545;
      into
      some
      low #129324;,
      depraved #129397;
      sort
      of
      beast #129425;.
      And
      that
      made
      me #129396;
      so
      incredibly
      hot #128293;
       #128517; #128517;,
      together #128104; #8205; #128103;
      with
      the
      constant
      movement #128694; #8205; #9794; #65039;
      of
      the
      maggots #128027;
      inside
      me.
      But
      it
      was
      time
       #8986;
      to
      go.
      Holding #9994;
      my
      hand
       #128077; #128077;
      over
      my
      crotch #129361;,
      I
      slowly
      crawled
      back
       #11013; #65039; #11013; #65039;
      to
      my
      clothes
       #128087; #128087; #128087;
      and
      managed
      to
      get
       #127568; #127568;
      dressed
      again
      without
      anything
      coming
      out
       #127950; #127949;.
      I
      put
      the
      gloves
       #129508; #129508;
      back
       #11013; #65039; #11013; #65039; #11013; #65039;
      into
      my
      pocket #128086;and
      climbed
      out
       #127950; #127949;
      of
      the
      dumpster #128465;.
      And
      right
       #128073; #128073;
      then
      I
      could
      hold
      back
       #11013; #65039;
      the
      revulsion #129297;
      of
      what
       #128517;
      I'd
      just
      done
      no
       #128547; #128547;
      longer.
      Holding #9994;
      myself
      up
       #9757;
      against
      the
      side
      of
      the
      dumpster #128465;,
      I
      threw
      up #129326; #129297;
       #9757; #9757;.
      Ever
      vomited #129326;
      while
      you
      were
      horny #129396;?
      It's
      weird
       #128533;.
      Walking
       #127939; #8205; #9792; #65039; #127939; #8205; #9792; #65039; #127939; #8205; #9792; #65039;
      home
       #128106; #128106; #128106;
      down
       #11015; #11015;
      the
      alley,
      I
      felt
      like
       #128516;
      I
      was
      in
      a
      daze #128539;.
      I
      kept
      asking #129300;
      myself
      how
       #129300;
      I
      could
      have
       #127542; #127542; #127542;
      done
      this
       #11014;
      to
      myself,
      but
      then #129488;
      asking
      why
       #129300;
      I'd
      waited
      so
      long #128527;.
      I
      had
      to
      walk #128694; #8205; #9792; #65039;slowly
      to
      make
      sure #129488;
      nothing
       #127514; #127514;
      got
      squeezed
      out
       #127950; #127949;
      of
      my
      vagina #129361;,
      but
      also
      to
      keep
      from
      cumming #128166;
      again.
      I
      found
      myself
      amazed #128561;at
      the
      whole
      thing,
      that
      I'd
      stuffed
       #129369;
      the
      most
      intimate
      part
      of
      myself
      with
      these
      things
      that
      were
      too
      disgusting
      to
      even
      touch
      without
      gloves
       #129508; #129508; #129508;.
      And
      that
      I
      was
      totally
      getting
      off
      on
       #128283; #128283; #128283;
      it.
      Once
      I
      was
      home
       #128106; #128106; #128106;,
      I
      locked
      myself
      in
      my
      bedroom,
      took
      off
      my
      clothes
       #128087; #128087;,
      except
      for
      my
      double-panties,
      and
      got
      into
      bed
       #128716; #128716;.
      I
      closed
      my
      eyes
       #129321;
      and
      just
      let
      myself
      feel
      the
      maggots #128027;
      squirming
      inside
      me.
      For
      a
      while
      I
      tried
      to
      watch
       #128065; #128065; #128065;
      TV
       #128250; #128250; #128250;,
      but
      I
      could
      really
      pay
       #128184;
      attention
      to
      it.
      The
      maggots #128027;
      were
      too
      wonderfully
      distracting.
      I
      skipped
      dinner
       #127869;.
      Later
      on
       #128283; #128283;,
      when
       #9200;
      I
      really
      had
      to
      pee,
      I
      did
      it
      by
      taking
      down
       #11015; #11015;
      my
      panties
      and
      holding
      my
      hand
       #128077; #128077;
      over
      my
      crotch,
      wearing
      the
      rubber
      gloves
       #129508; #129508;,
      of
      course.
      The
      next
       #9197; #9197; #9197;
      morning
       #127774; #127774; #127774;
      I
      called
      off
      of
      work
       #128188;
      after
      being
      awake
      most
      of
      the
      night
       #128564; #128564;.
      I
      mainly
      stayed
      naked
      in
      my
      bed
       #128716;
      all
      day
      masturbating,
      barely
      getting
      up
       #9757; #9757;
      for
      anything.
      I
      wanted
       #9888;
      to
      do
      nothing
       #127514;
      but
      let
      my
      nauseating
      little
      babies
      grow
      inside
      my
      pussy
       #128049;.
      Pretty
      early
       #128336; #128336; #128336;,
      though,
      I
      realized
      the
      smell
       #128067; #128067; #128067;
      was
      getting
      really
      horrible.
      I
      opened
      the
      window.
      I
      also
      wet
       #128166;
      a
      bath
       #128704;
      towel
      and
      stuffed
       #129369; #129369;
      it
      under
      my
      bedroom
      door
       #128273; #128273; #128273;.
      I
      didn't
      want
       #128523;
      my
      parents
       #128106;
      to
      get
       #127568; #127568; #127568;
      suspicious.
      A
      little
      later
      on
       #128283; #128283;
      I
      realized
      that
      I
      didn't
      need
      the
      panties
      to
      hold
      the
      maggots #128027;
      and
      the
      meat
       #129363; #129363;
      inside
      me.
      The
      mass
      pretty
      much
      stayed
      in
      place
       #127942;
      as
      long
      as
      I
      laid
      kind
      of
      still.
      I
      thought
      hey
       #128075;,
      I
      guess
      that
      means
      I'm
      infested,
      which
      made
      me
      cum #128166;
      again.
      I
      was
      always
       #128340;
      right
       #128073; #128073;
      on
       #128283; #128283;
      the
      edge
      of
      orgasm #128166;,
      and
      it
      didn't
      take
      much
      to
      go
      over
      the
      edge.
      I
      also
      noticed
      that
      the
      maggots #128027; #128027;
      seemed
      to
      be
      more
       #10133; #10133; #10133;
      active
      if
      I
      kept
      my
      legs
      apart
      and
      realized
      that
      they
      probably
      needed
      to
      breathe.
      So
      that's
      how
       #129300;
      I
      stayed
      a
      lot
      of
      the
      time
       #8986; #8986;.
      I
      did
      get
       #127568; #127568; #127568;
      up
       #9757; #9757;
      and
      read
       #128715; #128715;
      my
      email
       #127972;
      and
      posted
      an
      update
      on
       #128283; #128283;
      my
      web
      page
      but
      I
      couldn't
      seem
      to
      think
       #129300; #129300; #129300;
      clearly
      enough
      to
      write
       #9997; #9997; #9997;
      much.
      Then
      I
      had
      to
      pee
      again,
      but
      I
      just
      didn't
      want
       #128523;
      to
      get
       #127568;
      up
       #9757;.
      So
      I
      just
      peed
      in
      the
      bed
       #128716; #128716;.
      It
      made
      me
      cum #128166;.
      I
      just
      wanted
       #9888;
      to
      keep
      feeling
      the
      maggots #128027;
      moving
       #128230; #128230; #128230;.
      And
      they
      were.
      They
      seemed
      even
      stronger,
      in
      anything.
      I
      was
      totally
      in
      heaven
       #128519; #128519;
      with
      it.
      I
      didn't
      eat
       #127869; #127869;
      at
      all,
      either.
      I
      heard
      my
      parents
       #128106; #128106;
      come
      home
       #128106; #128106;
      from
      work
       #128188; #128188; #128188;.
      During
      the
      evening
       #127765; #127765;
      my
      mom
       #128106; #128106;
      said
      hello
       #128075;
      through
      the
      door
       #128273;
      and
      wondered
      why
       #129300;
      I
      was
      staying
      in
      my
      room
      like
       #128516; #128516;
      a
      hermit.
      I
      said
      I
      was
      reading
      a
      novel #128214;
      all
      the
      way
       #8597; #65039;
      through
      at
      once,
      which
      I
      actually
      do
      sometimes.
      She
      left
       #128072; #128072; #128072;
      me
      alone.
      I
      hoped
      she
      didn't
      smell
       #128067; #128067; #128067;
      anything.
      I
      surfed
      the
      Web
      for
      a
      while
      that
      night
       #128564; #128564; #128564;
      and
      looked
      at
      porn.
      I
      came
      a
      few
      more
       #10133; #10133; #10133;
      times.
      I
      decided
      to
      go
      ahead
      and
      take
      a
      shit
       #128169;
      in
      my
      bed
       #128716;,
      right
       #128073; #128073;
      where
       #129335;
      I
      was.
      That
      just
      made
      me
      more
       #10133; #10133;
      turned
      on
       #128283; #128283;
      and
      I
      ended
      up
       #9757; #9757; #9757;
      smearing
      some
      of
      my
      shit
       #128169;
      over
      my
      thighs
      and
      my
      pussy
       #128049;
      and
      cumming #128166;
      again.
      I
      noticed
      that
      the
      maggots #128027;
      started
      coming
      out
       #127950; #127949;
      a
      bit.
      Maybe
      they
      liked
      the
      shit
       #128169;.
      A
      couple
       #128112; #128112; #128112;
      tmes
      one
      1 #65039; #8419;1 #65039; #8419;
      would
      creep
      up
       #9757; #9757;
      on
       #128283; #128283;
      my
      belly.
      I'd
      just
      flick
      it
      back
       #11013; #65039; #11013; #65039;
      down
       #11015; #11015;
      between
      my
      legs.
      I
      was
      getting
      tired
       #128553;
      at
      that
      point
       #127535;.
      It
      really
      was
      time
       #8986; #8986;
      to
      sleep
       #127765;
      and
      my
      vagina
      was
      throbbing
      and
      kind
      of
      sore
      from
      all
      of
      the
      attention.
      But
      I
      was
      most
      worried
       #128543; #128543; #128543;
      about
      making
      sure
      my
      maggots #128027;
      could
      breathe
      while
      I
      was
      sleeping
       #128564; #128564;.
      Somehow,
      I
      managed
      to
      find
       #128269;
      the
      energy
       #128267; #128267;
      to
      place
       #127942;
      a
      chair
      on
       #128283;
      either
      side
      of
      my
      bed
       #128716; #128716;
      and
      use
      sheets
      to
      tie
      my
      ankles
      to
      them.
      That
      would
      keep
      my
      legs
      apart
      during
      the
      night
       #128564; #128564; #128564;.
      I
      pulled
      the
      blankets
      over
      myself
      and
      dozed
      off
      lying
      in
      my
      piss
      and
      shit
       #128169;.
      For
      the
      most
      part
      I
      slept
      through
      the
      night
       #128564; #128564; #128564;,
      but
      I
      kept
      waking
      up
       #9757; #9757;
      sweating,
      with
      my
      vagina
      throbbing
      worse.
      I
      knew
       #129300;
      I
      was
      getting
      a
      bad
       #128201; #128201; #128201;
      infection
      from
      this
       #11014;,
      but
      I
      didn't
      care.
      I
      was
      not
      thinking
       #129300;
      right
       #128073;.
      I
      could
      also
      feel
      maggots #128027;
      crawling
      all
      over
      me.
      I
      guess
      I
      decided
      I
      liked
      that
      and
      I'd
      play
       #127933; #127933;
      with
      my
      clit
      until
      I
      came #128166;
      again.
      I
      don't
      know
       #129300;
      if
      I
      realized
      at
      the
      time
       #8986; #8986;
      that
      I
      wasn't
      wearing
      the
      rubber
      gloves
       #129508; #129508; #129508;
      anymore.
      I'd
      fall
       #127809; #127809;
      back
       #11013; #65039; #11013; #65039;
      to
      sleep
       #127765; #127765; #127765;
      and
      wake
       #9200;
      up
       #9757; #9757;
      again
      later
      with
      little
      phrases
      running
       #127939; #8205; #9792; #65039; #127939; #8205; #9792; #65039;
      through
      my
      head
       #128134; #128134; #128134;.
      Other
      girls
       #128105; #128105; #128105;
      have
       #127542; #127542; #127542;
      babies
      but
      I
      give
      birth
      to
      decay
      and
      filth,
      I'd
      keep
      thinking
       #129300; #129300; #129300;
      to
      myself.
      Or
      I'd
      say
       #128483;
      I'm
      probably
      ruining
      my
      womb
      and
      I
      don't
      care,
      I
      want
       #128523;
      to
      be
      ruined.
      I
      know
       #129300;
      I
      must
      have
       #127542;
      been
      hallucinating
      from
      the
      infection.
      I
      was
      hoping
      the
      maggots #128027;
      had
      given
      up
       #9757;
      on
       #128283; #128283;
      the
      rotten
      meat
       #129363; #129363; #129363;
      and
      were
      eating
      my
      vagina
      instead.
      My
      fingers
       #9994; #9994;
      were
      buried
      inside
      my
      vagina,
      with
      my
      fingertips
      against
      part
      of
      the
      meat
       #129363; #129363;.
      Whenever
      I
      pressed
      on
       #128283; #128283;
      it,
      the
      maggots #128027; #128027;
      would
      squirm
      faster
      and
      I'd
      climax #128166;
      again.
      I
      could
      do
      it
      over
      and
      over
      and
      keep
      cumming #128166; #129397;.
      Finally
      it
      was
      Tuesday
      morning
       #127774; #127774; #127774;
      and
      sunlight #9728; #65039;made
      me
      wake
       #9200; #9200;
      up
       #9757;.
      I
      knew
       #129300;
      I
      was
      really,
      really
      sick
       #128547; #128547;
      at
      that
      point
       #127535; #127535; #127535;.
      I
      felt
      weak
      and
      dizzy
       #128565;,
      I
      knew
       #129300;
      I
      had
      a
      fever
       #129298; #129298;,
      and
      now
      my
      whole
      lower
      belly
      was
      sore
      and
      throbbing.
      Despite
      all
      that
      I
      was
      still
      horny #129397;and
      I
      was
      still
      right
       #128073;
      on
       #128283;
      the
      edge
      of
      cumming #128166;.
      And
      then
      for
      some
      reason,
      all
      I
      wanted
       #9888;
      to
      do
      was
      see
       #128065;
      my
      maggots #128027;.
      I
      pulled
      the
      blankets
      aside
      and
      saw
      that
      I
      really
      did
      have
       #127542; #127542; #127542;
      maggots #128166;
      crawling
      all
      over
      my
      body.
      I
      was
      so
      whacked
      out
       #127950; #127949;
      I
      loved
      it.
      But
      I
      also
      saw
      that
      I
      had
      a
      rash
      spreading
      over
      my
      tummy
      and
      my
      thighs,
      and
      I
      was
      soaked
      with
      sweat
       #128517;.
      And
      then
      suddenly
      I
      needed
      to
      see
       #128065; #128065;
      what
       #128517;
      it
      looked
      like
       #128516;
      between
      my
      legs.
      I
      sat
      up
       #9757;
      a
      little,
      picked
      up
       #9757;
      the
      hand
       #128077; #128077;
      mirror
      I
      have
       #127542; #127542; #127542;
      on
       #128283; #128283;
      the
      table
      next
       #9197; #9197;
      to
      my
      bed
       #128716;,
      and
      held
      it
      between
      my
      thighs.
      My
      pussy
       #128049;
      was
      totally
      gaped
      wide
      open
       #128080; #128080; #128080;.
      I'd
      never
       #10060;
      seen
      it
      like
       #128516;
      that
      before.
      It
      reminded
      me
      of
      a
      mouth
       #128068; #128068;
      in
      a
      sick
       #128547;,
      gagging
      expression.
      My
      inner
      lips
       #128068; #128068; #128068;
      were
      swollen
      and
      dark
       #128294; #128294; #128294;
      purple,
      almost
      black,
      while
      my
      outer
      lips
       #128068; #128068; #128068;
      were
      cherry
      red
       #128121; #128121;
      and
      I
      was
      losing
       #127987;
      a
      layer
      of
      dead
       #128128; #128128;
      skin,
      like
       #128516; #128516;
      a
      sunburn.
      A
      stream
      of
      the
      light
       #127875; #127875;
      brown
       #128052; #128052;
      slime
      was
      oozing
      from
      inside
      my
      vagina
      and
      down
       #11015; #11015;
      my
      butt
      crack
      onto
      the
      shitty #128169;
      mattress.
      Although
      I
      could
      still
      feel
      a
      large
      mass
      of
      maggots #128027;
      and
      rotten
      meat
       #129363;
      inside
      me,
      there
      were
      maggots #128027; #128027;
      everywhere
      between
      my
      legs #129461;.
      Hundreds
      of
      them.
      And
      then
       #9757; #65039; #129488;
      I
      saw
      my
      fingers
       #129330;
      on
       #128283; #128283;
      my
      pussy
       #128049;.
      They
      plunged
      deep
       #128553; #128166;
      into
      my
      vagina
       #129361;
      and
      dragged
      out
       #127950; #127949;
      a
      wad
      of
      slime
       #128166;
      and
      maggots
       #128027;,
      which
      I
      pressed
       #128073;
      hard #129396;
      against
      my
      clit #127814;.
      I
      remember
      having
      a
      huge
      orgasm
       #128166;
      right
       #128073; #128073;
      then,
      and
      I
      must
      have
       #127542;
      passed
      out
       #127950; #127949;.
      I
      think
       #129300;
      I
      was
      sobbing #128557;too,
      but
      I'm
      not #129488;
      sure.
      That's
      all
      I
      remember #128173;until
      I
      woke
      up
       #9757; #9757; #9757;
      in
      the
      hospital
       #128657;.

      You
      know,
      I

      be
      completely
      different
      back
      in
      its
      earliest
      days.
      Like
      it
      wasn #8217;t
      an
      unquarantined
      [r/braincels](https://www.reddit.com/r/BrianCels/),
      and
      was
      mostly
      just
      men
      who
      were,
      well
      going
      their
      own

      didn #8217;t
      need
      a

      to
      feel
      satisfied
      in
      life
      or
      something
      like
      that.

      I
      remember
      when
      everyone
      there
      harassed
      the
      mods
      because
      they
      tried
      to
      ban
      shitposts
      in
      an
      attempt
      to
      fix
      up
      the
      subreddit.
      It
      didn #8217;t
      even
      matter
      anyway
      because
      the
      mods
      barely
      enforce
      the
      rules.
      The
      only
      time
      that
      sub
      is
      good
      is
      on
      the
      weekend,
      when
      only
      text
      posts
      are
      allowed.
      Every
      other
      day
      is
      basically
      browsing
      through
      shitty
      memes
      while
      finding
      an
      occasional
      gem.

      Why
      the
      fuck
      is
      that
      even
      still
      a
      thing.
      I #8217;m
      just
      gonna
      be
      blunt
      and
      say
      that
      although
      Minecraft
      is
      a
      very
      good
      game,
      it #8217;s
      not
      a
      masterpiece
      like
      a
      lot
      of
      people
      make
      it
      out
      to
      be.
      I #8217;ve
      gotten
      sick
      of
      the
      amount
      of
      people
      worshipping
      Minecraft
      on
      here.
      We
      get
      it
      already.
      Minecraft
      is
      the
      best
      game,
      and
      fortnite
      is
      the
      video
      game
      equivalent
      to
      the
      holocaust.
      I
      wish
      that
      meme
      would
      just
      fucking
      die
      already.

      Most
      of
      these
      fucking
      comments
      depress
      me.
      Why
      must
      i
      be
      the
      odd
      one
      out?
      How

      no
      one
      ever
      picks
      me
      for

      If
      nobody
      likes
      me,
      then
      why
      do
      I

      Why
      the
      fuck
      was

      Why
      the
      fuck
      do
      I
      continue
      going
      on?
      There #8217;s
      few
      reasons
      for
      living,
      yet
      so
      many
      reasons
      to
      die.

      Gather
      around,
      the
      Renaissance
      man
      has
      finally
      appeared
      And
      I'm
      astonishing
      rap
      characters
      are
      cause
      of
      the
      tears
      Quasimodo
      and
      the
      quotables
      excrete
      from
      my
      mouth
      And
      no
      doubt,
      we
      rubbed
      you
      wrong
      and
      rubbin
      you
      out
      To
      try
      to
      tackle
      such
      a
      problem
      is
      a
      foolish
      goal
      And
      when
      the
      opposition's
      Abstract,
      bless
      your
      soul
      There
      are
      degrees
      of
      MCs
      but
      none
      on
      the
      level
      Of
      the
      other
      vocalist,
      precious
      like
      metal
      Makin
      all
      my
      rounds
      through
      the
      towns
      like
      physician
      I
      be
      curing
      impure
      emcees,
      plagued
      with
      disease
      So
      take
      a
      spoonful
      of
      Poet
      Penicillin
      and
      Sit
      back
      and
      listen
      to
      your
      man
      as
      I
      fill
      it
      in
      the
      Renaissance..
      [Hook]
      R-r-rap,
      Renaissance...
      This
      is
      the
      Renaissance..
      This
      is
      the

      [Verse
      2]
      So
      here
      we
      go,
      now
      It
      is
      the
      Midnight
      Marauder
      on
      the
      scene
      Geographically
      earthed
      in
      a
      place
      called
      Queens
      I
      was
      formed
      with
      my
      principles,
      way
      I
      displayed
      How
      I
      used
      to
      MC
      where
      all
      the
      other
      kids
      played
      Cause
      I
      was
      way
      too
      ill,
      so
      I
      would
      hone
      my
      skill
      And
      go
      out
      in
      the
      park
      and
      let
      my
      chemicals
      spill
      Right
      there,
      on
      Farmers
      Boulevard,
      I
      made
      my
      mark
      Two
      dudes,
      niggas
      would
      dip
      from
      us,
      me,
      and
      NARCS
      And
      then
      my,
      legend
      would
      grow
      on
      the
      A-train
      line
      Where
      brothers
      would
      gather
      to
      see
      me
      blowin
      nicks
      and
      dimes
      It
      was
      me,
      Big,
      Pete,
      Tanya,
      and
      Sir
      Ibu
      And
      the
      heat
      of
      the
      cipher,
      I
      was
      not
      libel
      From
      all
      the
      casualties
      of
      the
      dutty
      MCs
      I
      split
      the
      train
      car
      like
      Moses
      did
      the
      Red

      The
      only
      reason
      people
      say
      that
      bullies
      will
      amount
      to
      nothing
      and
      you
      will
      grow
      up
      to
      live
      a
      better
      life
      than
      them
      is
      because
      they
      don #8217;t
      want
      you
      to
      become
      this
      week #8217;s
      school
      shooter.
      Unless
      you
      actually
      work
      hard,
      and
      get
      a
      job
      you
      mostly
      enjoy
      working
      on
      that
      also
      pays
      well,
      your
      bully
      is
      more
      likely
      to
      have
      a
      better
      life
      than
      you.

      Honestly,
      I
      don #8217;t
      get
      what #8217;s
      wrong
      with
      acne.
      I
      mean,
      I
      guess
      it
      doesn #8217;t
      look
      that
      appealing,
      but
      other
      then
      that,
      it #8217;s
      perfectly
      fine.
      Whenever
      I
      get
      hungry,
      I
      pop
      a
      zit
      off
      my
      face
      and
      eat
      the
      contents
      that
      pour
      out.
      It
      tastes
      yummy,
      sort
      of
      warm,
      a
      bit
      sour,
      but
      very
      nice.
      I
      usually
      eat
      a
      good
      amount
      of
      cysts
      everyday.
      Both
      in
      public
      and
      private.
      I

      of
      bad
      looks
      in

      but
      I
      don #8217;t

      I

      fuck
      about
      the
      fact

      ugly
      and
      underdeveloped
      compared
      to
      everyone
      else.
      I
      don #8217;t
      give
      a
      fuck
      about
      the
      fact
      that
      I #8217;m
      going
      to
      die
      alone
      and
      no
      one
      will
      even
      bat
      a
      fucking
      eye
      and
      the
      world
      will
      just
      go
      on.
      I
      don #8217;t
      care
      that
      not
      even
      my
      parents
      will
      give
      a

      about
      my
      death,
      and
      if
      anything,
      will
      probably
      be
      glad
      that
      I #8217;m
      dead,
      seeing
      how
      much
      of
      a
      fucking
      disappointment
      I
      am
      in
      their
      eyes.
      I
      also
      don #8217;t
      give
      a
      fuck
      about
      how
      I #8217;ve
      had
      literally
      no
      friends
      throughout
      my
      pathetic
      life,
      and
      everyone
      made
      fun
      of
      me
      calling
      me
      a
      ugly
      fucking
      useless
      shit
      eating
      cunt.
      FINE

      WELL

      ABOUT
      TO
      GIVE
      YOU
      ALL
      WHAT

      THE

      I
      SHALL

      good,
      but
      the

      quite

      slowed
      paced

      You
      blow
      your
      brains
      out
      at
      age
      30
      due
      to
      loneliness
      and
      lack
      of
      genuine
      human
      interaction
      in
      a
      shitty
      walk
      up
      apartment
      filled
      with
      roaches
      and
      drug
      addicts.
      You
      are
      buried
      in
      a
      no-name
      cemetery
      with
      a
      generic
      headstone
      by
      the
      state
      because
      literally
      0
      people
      give
      a
      fuck
      about
      you,
      except
      for
      that
      one
      internet
      friend
      that
      didn #8217;t
      even
      know
      your
      name
      but
      still
      made
      a
      facebook
      memorial
      for
      you
      on
      principle
      (lmao
      like
      he
      gives
      an
      actual
      fuck
      about
      you)
      that

      Nobody
      remembers
      you
      and
      your

      tree

      you
      are
      literally
      too
      pathetic
      and
      unfuckable
      to
      even
      have
      some
      bastard
      out
      there
      in

      Sunday
       #128467;
      was
      warm
       #127964;
      and
      sunny
       #9728; #65039;,
      just #128076;
      how
       #129300;
      I
      always
       #128340;
      fantasized #9786; #65039;
      it
      would
      be
      when
       #9200;
      I
      finally
      went
      through
      with
      it.
      I
      stared
      walking
       #127939; #8205; #9792; #65039; #127939; #8205; #9792; #65039;
      to
      the
      dumpster #128465;
      again,
      I
      think
       #129300; #129300; #129300;
      about
      2pm,
      and
      I
      was
      really
      excited #128513; #128513;
      and
      nervous
       #128543; #128543;.
      I
      felt
      butterflies
       #129419;
      in
      my
      tummy #129314;,
      just
      anticipating
       #128563;
      what
       #128517;
      I
      was
      about
      to
      do.
      The
      dumpster #128465;
      is
       #127542;
      in
      the
      alley
      behind #128527;
      a
      restaurant
       #127869; #127869;
      near
      my
      house
       #127968; #127968; #127968;.
      It
      gets
      emptied
      on
       #128283; #128283;
      Tuesdays,
      so
      by
      Sunday #128467;
      it's
      pretty
      stinky #129314; #129326;
      and
      there
      are
      flies #129439;
      buzzing
      around.
      Which
      means #129300;
      there
      are
      things
      rotting #129314;
      inside
      there
      and
      that's
      just #128076;
      perfect #128076;
      for
      me.
      A
      few #129488;
      times #9200;
      in
      the
      past #128368;
      I
      climbed
      into
      that
      dumpster #128465;
      and
      masturbated #128555; #129308; #127814; #128166;.
      Nothing
       #127514; #127514; #127514;
      too
      intense #129397;.
      Most #129488;
      I'd
      ever
      done
      was
      take
      off #128527;
      my
      pants #128086;
      and
      hump
       #128042; #128042;
      against
      the
      dirty #129314;
      garbage
       #128465; #128465;
      bags.
      And
      one
      1 #65039; #8419;1 #65039; #8419;
      time
       #8986;
      I
      laid
      there
      with
      my
      legs #129461;spread,
      watching
       #128064;
      the
      flies
       #129439;
      land
      on
       #128283;
      me.
      So
      anyway #128521;,
      I
      walked #128694; #8205; #9794; #65039;
      down
       #11015; #11015;
      the
      alley #127961;
      to
      the
      dumpster #128465;,
      and
      as
      usual #129488; #9757; #65039;
      I
      made
      sure #128548;
      nobody #128683;
      was
      around,
      just
       #128076;
      to
      be
      extra
      careful.
      You
      have
       #127542; #127542; #127542;
      to
      go
      behind #128527;
      a
      tall
      wooden #127794;
      fence
      to
      even
      see
       #128065; #128065; #128065;
      the
      dumpster #128465;,
      and
      the
      restaurant
       #127869; #127869;
      is
       #127542;
      closed #128683;
      on
       #128283;
      Sunday
       #128467;
      anyway,
      so
      I
      knew
       #129300;
      I
      wouldn't
      be
      noticed #128064;.
      But
      this
       #11014;
      time
       #8986;
      there's
      no
       #128547;
      way
       #8597; #65039; #8597; #65039;
      I
      want
       #128523;
      to
      be
      disturbed.
      I
      climbed
      up
       #9757;
      and
      over
      the
      side
      and
      onto
      my
      hands
       #129330; #129330;
      and
      knees
       #129461; #129461;
      into
      the
      mass
      of
      plastic
      garbage
       #128465;
      bags
      and
      other
      miscellaneous
      rubbish
       #128465; #128465;.
      The
      bags
      felt
      warm
       #127964; #127964;
      from
      the
      sun
       #128261; #128261; #128261;.
      The
      smell
       #128067; #128067;
      in
      there
      was
      extremely
      foul,
      much
      worse
      than
      usual,
      and
      I
      knew
       #129300;
      it
      was
      because
      of
      my
      rotting
      meat
       #129363; #129363;.
      I
      sat
      and
      tried
      to
      get
       #127568; #127568; #127568;
      myself
      to
      relax
       #127866; #127866;
      for
      a
      few
      minutes.
      There
      was
      no
       #128547; #128547; #128547;
      reason
      to
      hurry.
      When
       #9200;
      I
      was
      ready,
      I
      calmly
      took
      off
      my
      sandals
       #128097;
      ,
      my
      jeans
       #128086; #128086; #128086;,
      and
      my
      panties
       #128089;.
      Both
       #9996; #65039;
      pairs.
      I
      was
      wearing
      two
       #9996; #9996; #9996;
      pairs
      of
      tight #128555;
      panties #128089;
      with
      a
      bunch
      of
      my
      panty #128089;
      liners
      in
      the
      crotch #127814;,
      which
      keeps
      anything
      in
      my
      vagina #129361;
      from
      coming
      out
       #127950; #127949;
      when
       #9200;
      I
      move #128694; #8205; #9794; #65039;around.
      But
       #9757; #65039; #129488;
      I
      was
      going
      "all
      the
      way
       #8597; #65039; #8597; #65039;"
      this
       #11014;
      time
       #8986; #8986;,
      so
      I
      went
      ahead
      and
      got
      completely
      naked #128521;.
      That
      was
      a
      weird
       #128533; #128533;
      feeling,
      being
      totally
      nude #128521;
      inside
      the
      dumpster #128465;.
      It
      seemed
      very
      erotic #128553; #10084; #65039;
      to
      me.
      The
      sun
       #128261;
      felt
      warm
       #127964; #127964; #127964;
      on
       #128283;
      my
      skin,
      especially
      my
      boobs,
      which
      pretty
      much
      never
       #10060;
      see
       #128065; #128065;
      the
      sun
       #128261; #128261; #128261;.
      I
      took
      a
      pair
       #128107; #128107;
      of
      rubber
      kitchen
       #127855; #127855;
      gloves
       #129508;
      out
       #127950; #127949;
      of
      my
      pants
       #128086;
      pocket
      and
      put
      them
      on
       #128283;.
      There
      was
      no
       #128547;
      way
       #8597; #65039; #8597; #65039;
      I
      could
      bring
      myself
      to
      actually
      touch #128073;
      a
      maggot
       #128027;
      with
      my
      bare
      hands
       #129330;.
      Lying
      with
      my
      back
       #11013; #65039; #11013; #65039;
      against
      the
      side
      of
      the
      dumpster #128465;,
      I
      fingered #128073;
      my
      pussy
       #128049;.
      I
      was
      really
      wet
       #128166;
      already.
      I
      knew
       #129300;
      I
      would
      be.
      The
      sensation #128553;
      of
      the
      rubber
      glove
       #129508;
      against
      my
      clit
       #129361;
      felt
      unusual. #129300;,
      and
      I
      kind
      of #129335; #8205; #9792; #65039;
      liked
      it.
      I
      did
      that #128073; #129361;
      for
      a
      little
      while,
      just
      thinking
       #129300; #129300; #129300;
      about
      what
       #128517;
      I
      was
      about
      to
      do,
      while
      staring
       #128064;
      at
      the
      smaller
      garbage
       #128465; #128465; #128465;
      bag
       #127890; #127890; #127890;
      in
      the
      far
      corner
      of
      the
      dumpster
       #128465;
      where
       #129335;
      I'd
      left
       #128072; #128072;
      it
      yesterday.
      I
      still
      felt
      the
      butterflies
       #129419;
      in
      my
      tummy
       #129314;.
      I
      kept
      thinking
       #129300; #129300; #129300;
      to
      myself
      that
      I
      can't
      wimp
       #129299;
      out
       #127950; #127949;,
      that
      I
      had
       #128545;
      to
      go
      through
      with
      this
       #11014;.
      I
      wished
       #128079;
      for
      a
      moment
      that
      someone
      else #128118;
      was
      there
      to
      force
      me
       #128555;
      to
      do
      it,
      but
      decided
       #9757; #65039; #129488;
      that
      it
      was
      somehow
       #129335; #8205; #9792; #65039;
      much
      more
       #10133; #10133; #10133;
      sick
       #128547;
      and
      depraved
       #128545;
      to
      do
      it
      to
      myself
      willingly.
      And
      I
      thought #129300;,
      yeah
       #128588;,
      that's
      me #129322;.
      That's
      what
       #128517;
      I
      want
       #128523;.
      I
      deserve
      this
       #11014;.
      And
      so
      I
      knew
       #129300;
      it
      was
      time
       #8986; #8986;
      to
      do
      it
      I
      got
      back
       #11013; #65039; #11013; #65039; #11013; #65039;
      on
       #128283;
      my
      hands
       #129330; #129330;
      and
      knees #129461;and
      crawled
      to
      the
      other
      side
      of
      the
      dumpster #128465;.
      I
      sat
      down
       #11015; #11015;
      next
       #9197; #9197;
      to
      my
      garbage
       #128465; #128465;
      bag
       #127890; #127890;,
      gently
      picked
      it
      up
       #9757; #9757;
      and
      placed
      it
      in
      front
      of
      me.
      The
      terrible
      smell
       #128067;
      was
      already
      stronger #9994;.
      Carefully,
      I
      tore
       #9995;
      the
      bag
       #127890; #127890;
      open
       #128080; #128080;.
      And
      there
      they
      were.
      There
      had
      to
      be
       #128563;
      thousands
       #128175;
      of
      maggots #128027;,
      kind
      of
      beige-yellow
       #127804; #127804; #127804;
      with
      little
      black
       #128053;
      spots
       #129426; #129426; #129426;
      on
       #128283; #128283;
      them,
      all
      writhing #129396;
      in
      a
      large
      mass.
      I
      couldn't
      even
      see
       #128065;
      the
      rotting
       #129314;
      meat
       #129363; #129363;
      underneath
      them.
      Dozens
      more
       #10133; #10133;
      maggots
       #128027;
      clung
      to
      the
      inside
      of
      the
      black #128053;
      plastic,
      which
      was
      coated
       #129509;
      with
      a
      thick #127825;
      light
       #127875; #127875;-brown
       #128052;
      slime.
      It
      was
      such
      a
      repulsive #129326;
      sight
       #128294; #128294;
      I
      thought
       #128173;
      I
      was
      going
      to
      throw
      up
       #129326; #9757; #9757;
      right
       #128073;
      there.
      But
       #9757; #65039; #129488;
      I
      didn't.
      I
      took
      a
      few
      minutes
       #9200;
      to
      get
       #127568; #127568;
      control
       #128250;
      of
      myself,
      fingering #128070;
      my
      clit
       #129361;
      while
      staring
       #128064;
      at
      the
      maggots
       #128027;,
      trying
      to
      work
       #128188;
      up
       #9757; #9757; #9757;
      the
      courage
      to
      continue
       #9193; #9193;.
      I
      scooped
      up
       #9757;
      some
      of
      the
      slime
       #128166;
      on
       #128283; #128283; #128283;
      my
      gloved
       #129508;
      finger
       #128133; #128133;
      and
      brought
      it
      to
      my
      nose
       #128067;.
      I
      knew
       #129300;
      what
       #128517;
      it
      was
      from
      the
      reading
       #128214;
      I'd
      done
      before.
      It
      was
      digestive #129314;
      juices
       #129380;
      from
      the
      maggots
       #128027;,
      full
       #127541; #127541;
      of
      bacteria
       #129440;.
      And
      it
      smelled #128134; #8205; #9794; #65039;
      just
      horrible #129326; #129324;.
      I
      thought
       #128173;
      to
      myself,
      that's
      what
       #128517;
      I'm
      going
      to
      smell
       #128067; #128067;
      like
       #128516; #128516; #128516;.
      That's
      the
      stench
       #129314;
      that's
      going
      to
      come
       #128166;
      from
      my
      vagina
       #129361;.
      I
      want
       #128523;
      that,
      I
      thought #128173;,
      spreading
      my
      legs #129461;wide
      apart.
      I
      dragged
      my
      slimy #128166;
      finger
       #128133; #128133;
      between
      my
      pussy
       #128049;
      lips
       #128068;.
      My
      clit #129361;
      felt
      like
       #128516; #128516; #128516;
      a
      hard
       #127814;
      little
      pebble
      beneath
      the
      slime.
      I
      didn't
      want
       #128523;
      to
      cum
      right
       #128073; #128073; #128073;
      then,
      though,
      and
      I
      was
      still
      right
       #128073; #128073;
      on
       #128283; #128283;
      the
      edge
      of
      gagging,
      too.
      But
      I
      knew
       #129300;
      there
      was
      no
       #128547; #128547;
      turning
      back
       #11013; #65039; #11013; #65039; #11013; #65039;
      now,
      so
      I
      let
      my
      fingers
       #9994;
      lightly
      touch
      the
      top
       #128316; #128316; #128316;
      of
      the
      maggot
       #128027;
      mass.
      The
      maggots
      felt
      like
       #128516; #128516;
      nothing
       #127514; #127514; #127514;
      I'd
      experienced
      before.
      They
      seemed
      to
      have
       #127542; #127542;
      such
      energy
       #128267;,
      totally
      different
      from
      picking
      up
       #9757; #9757;
      an
      earthworm
       #128027;
      or
      something.
      And
      they
      felt
      so
      alive #128113; #8205; #9794; #65039;.
      I
      was
      fascinated
       #128563;
      and
      nauseated #129314;at
      the
      same
      time
       #8986;.
      Sinking
      my
      fingers
       #9994;
      into
      the
      mass,
      I
      felt
      the
      solid
       #129406;
      meat
       #129363; #129363;
      beneath.
      Gently
      breaking
      it
      apart,
      I
      could
      see
       #128065; #128065;
      that
      the
      meat
       #129363; #129363;
      had
      turned
      gray
       #127764; #127764; #127764;
      except #129488;
      for
      the
      very #128076;
      center
      which
      was
      still
      pink
       #128582;,
      and
      that
      the
      maggots
       #128027;
      had
      penetrated #128553;
      into
      it
      but
      not #9757; #65039; #129488;
      too
      deeply
      yet.
      There
      was
      still
      plenty
      of
      food
       #128031; #128031;
      for
      my
      filthy
       #129314;
      little
      babies #128118;.
      I
      broke
       #129335; #8205; #9794; #65039;
      off
      a
      small
      chunk
      of
      meat
       #129363; #129363; #129363;
      that
      was
      covered
      on
       #128283; #128283;
      one
      1 #65039; #8419;1 #65039; #8419;
      side
      with
      maggots
      and
      held
      it
      for
      a
      moment
      while
      I
      fought
      back
       #11013; #65039;
      another
      urge
      to
      vomit
       #129314; #129314;.
      It
      was
      finally
      time
       #8986; #8986;,
      I
      thought #128173;.
      I
      leaned
      forward
       #9197; #9197; #9197;,
      and
      holding
       #9994;
      my
      pussy
       #128049;
      lips
       #128068; #128068; #128068;
      apart
      with
      one
      1 #65039; #8419;
      hand
       #128077; #128077; #128077;,
      I
      gritted
      my
      teeth
       #128556; #128556; #128556;
      and
      pushed
      the
      maggot
       #128027;-covered
      chunk
      of
      meat
       #129363; #129363;
      into
      my
      vagina #129361;.
      And
      then #129488;,
      totally
      without
      expecting
      it #128563;,
      I
      had
      an
      orgasm #128553; #127814; #128166;.
      A
      quick #9889; #65039;,
      sharp
       #128481;
      one
      1 #65039; #8419;1 #65039; #8419;
      that
      only
      made
      me
      want
       #128523;
      more
       #10133; #10133;.
      And
      more
       #10133; #10133; #10133;
      was
      coming.
      I
      broke
       #129335; #8205; #9794; #65039;
      off
      another
      small
      chunk
      of
      meat
       #129363; #129363;,
      along
      with
       #129488;
      another
      part
      of
      the
      maggot
       #128027;
      mass
      and
      pushed #129308;
      it
      inside
      me.
      This
       #11014;
      one
      1 #65039; #8419;1 #65039; #8419;
      had
      more
       #10133; #10133;
      maggots
       #128027;
      on
       #128283; #128283;
      it,
      and
      I
      stopped
       #128683;
      for
      a
      moment #9757; #65039; #129488;
      to
      see
       #128065; #128065; #128065;
      if
      I
      could
      feel #9757; #65039;
      them
      inside
      me #128539;.
      I
      wasn't
      sure #129300;
      I
      could,
      but
      it
      didn't
      matter #128548;.
      I
      wanted
       #9888;
      them
      all.
      I
      needed #129488;
      to
      take
      them
      all #9994;
      inside
      me.
      With
      that
      thought
       #128173;
      ,
      I
      went
      sort
      of
      wild
       #128059; #128059;.
      I
      started
      pushing
       #129308;
      bigger
      chunks
      of
      meat
       #129363; #129363; #129363;
      and
      maggots
       #128027;,
      and
      even
      handfuls
       #129330;
      of
      just
      maggots
       #128027;
      into
      me,
      over
      and
      over #129396;.
      I
      was
      practically
      hyperventilating #128563; #128555;,
      too.
      I
      wasn't
      thinking
       #129300; #129300;
      at
      all
      about
      the
      noise
       #128266; #128266;
      I
      must
      have
       #127542; #127542;
      been
      making.
      But
      now
       #129488;
      I
      could
      definitely #9757; #65039;feel
      the
      maggots
       #128027;
      squirming
      inside
      my
      vagina #129361;.
      Just
      the
      idea
       #128161; #128161;
      of
      it
      made
      me
      cum
       #128166;
      again.
      Finally #129397;,
      once
      I
      had
      crammed #129308;
      all
      of
      the
      rotten #129314;
      meat
       #129363;,
      and
      all
      of
      the
      maggots #128027;
      I
      could
      inside
      me,
      I
      felt
      so
      filthy #129314;,
      so
      disgusting #129326; #129297;,
      like
       #128516; #128516; #128516;
      I'd
      turned
      myself #128545;
      into
      some
      low #129324;,
      depraved #129397;
      sort
      of
      beast #129425;.
      And
      that
      made
      me #129396;
      so
      incredibly
      hot #128293;
       #128517; #128517;,
      together #128104; #8205; #128103;
      with
      the
      constant
      movement #128694; #8205; #9794; #65039;
      of
      the
      maggots #128027;
      inside
      me.
      But
      it
      was
      time
       #8986;
      to
      go.
      Holding #9994;
      my
      hand
       #128077; #128077;
      over
      my
      crotch #129361;,
      I
      slowly
      crawled
      back
       #11013; #65039; #11013; #65039;
      to
      my
      clothes
       #128087; #128087; #128087;
      and
      managed
      to
      get
       #127568; #127568;
      dressed
      again
      without
      anything
      coming
      out
       #127950; #127949;.
      I
      put
      the
      gloves
       #129508; #129508;
      back
       #11013; #65039; #11013; #65039; #11013; #65039;
      into
      my
      pocket #128086;and
      climbed
      out
       #127950; #127949;
      of
      the
      dumpster #128465;.
      And
      right
       #128073; #128073;
      then
      I
      could
      hold
      back
       #11013; #65039;
      the
      revulsion #129297;
      of
      what
       #128517;
      I'd
      just
      done
      no
       #128547; #128547;
      longer.
      Holding #9994;
      myself
      up
       #9757;
      against
      the
      side
      of
      the
      dumpster #128465;,
      I
      threw
      up #129326; #129297;
       #9757; #9757;.
      Ever
      vomited #129326;
      while
      you
      were
      horny #129396;?
      It's
      weird
       #128533;.
      Walking
       #127939; #8205; #9792; #65039; #127939; #8205; #9792; #65039; #127939; #8205; #9792; #65039;
      home
       #128106; #128106; #128106;
      down
       #11015; #11015;
      the
      alley,
      I
      felt
      like
       #128516;
      I
      was
      in
      a
      daze #128539;.
      I
      kept
      asking #129300;
      myself
      how
       #129300;
      I
      could
      have
       #127542; #127542; #127542;
      done
      this
       #11014;
      to
      myself,
      but
      then #129488;
      asking
      why
       #129300;
      I'd
      waited
      so
      long #128527;.
      I
      had
      to
      walk #128694; #8205; #9792; #65039;slowly
      to
      make
      sure #129488;
      nothing
       #127514; #127514;
      got
      squeezed
      out
       #127950; #127949;
      of
      my
      vagina #129361;,
      but
      also
      to
      keep
      from
      cumming #128166;
      again.
      I
      found
      myself
      amazed #128561;at
      the
      whole
      thing,
      that
      I'd
      stuffed
       #129369;
      the
      most
      intimate
      part
      of
      myself
      with
      these
      things
      that
      were
      too
      disgusting
      to
      even
      touch
      without
      gloves
       #129508; #129508; #129508;.
      And
      that
      I
      was
      totally
      getting
      off
      on
       #128283; #128283; #128283;
      it.
      Once
      I
      was
      home
       #128106; #128106; #128106;,
      I
      locked
      myself
      in
      my
      bedroom,
      took
      off
      my
      clothes
       #128087; #128087;,
      except
      for
      my
      double-panties,
      and
      got
      into
      bed
       #128716; #128716;.
      I
      closed
      my
      eyes
       #129321;
      and
      just
      let
      myself
      feel
      the
      maggots #128027;
      squirming
      inside
      me.
      For
      a
      while
      I
      tried
      to
      watch
       #128065; #128065; #128065;
      TV
       #128250; #128250; #128250;,
      but
      I
      could
      really
      pay
       #128184;
      attention
      to
      it.
      The
      maggots #128027;
      were
      too
      wonderfully
      distracting.
      I
      skipped
      dinner
       #127869;.
      Later
      on
       #128283; #128283;,
      when
       #9200;
      I
      really
      had
      to
      pee,
      I
      did
      it
      by
      taking
      down
       #11015; #11015;
      my
      panties
      and
      holding
      my
      hand
       #128077; #128077;
      over
      my
      crotch,
      wearing
      the
      rubber
      gloves
       #129508; #129508;,
      of
      course.
      The
      next
       #9197; #9197; #9197;
      morning
       #127774; #127774; #127774;
      I
      called
      off
      of
      work
       #128188;
      after
      being
      awake
      most
      of
      the
      night
       #128564; #128564;.
      I
      mainly
      stayed
      naked
      in
      my
      bed
       #128716;
      all
      day
      masturbating,
      barely
      getting
      up
       #9757; #9757;
      for
      anything.
      I
      wanted
       #9888;

      aren #8217;t
      even
      allowed
      on

      that
      doesn #8217;t
      matter

      defensive

      the

      others
      are
      defending
      her
      is
      just

      sweet

      It
      was
      eventually
      found
      out
      he
      had
      a
      drug
      addiction.
      He
      had
      been
      snorting
      up
      large
      amounts
      of
      his

      cocaine
      supply
      before
      he
      went
      to
      school
      each
      day,
      which
      resulted
      in
      his
      strange
      and
      erratic
      behavior.
      He
      also
      did
      small
      amounts
      of
      weed
      and
      possibly
      LSD
      as
      well.
      After
      being
      found
      out,
      he
      ran
      home,
      managed
      to
      get
      into
      his
      fathers
      gun
      safe,
      and
      then
      blasted
      his
      mother
      and
      sister
      into
      smithereens,
      then
      pulled
      the
      trigger
      on
      himself.
      The
      father
      ended
      up
      being
      taken
      away
      by
      the
      police,
      and
      is
      still
      in
      jail
      at
      the
      time
      of
      this
      writing.
      I
      heard
      that
      he
      actually
      offed
      himself
      in
      his
      cell
      about
      3
      months
      ago
      however,
      and
      I
      wouldn #8217;t
      be
      too
      surprised
      if
      he
      did.
      It #8217;s
      a
      shame
      what
      happened,
      because
      some
      odd
      behaviors
      aside,
      he
      was
      actually
      pretty
      smart
      and
      nice.
      I
      wish
      I
      could #8217;ve
      helped
      him.
      I
      wish
      I
      could
      have
      saved
      him.
      But
      I
      couldn #8217;t,
      and
      I
      will
      continue
      to
      go
      on
      with
      my
      life.

      Fast
      paced?
      That #8217;s
      odd.
      When
      I
      played
      Minecraft
      for
      the
      first
      time
      in
      a
      while,
      I
      thought
      it
      was
      a
      bit
      too
      slow
      paced.
      I
      don #8217;t
      have
      anything
      wrong
      with
      those
      types
      of
      games,
      but
      there
      was
      something
      about
      Minecraft
      that
      didn #8217;t
      click
      with
      me
      like
      it
      once
      did.

      originally
      gonna
      make
      her
      a
      mute
      character
      but
      ended
      up
      changing
      their
      minds
      and
      made
      her
      voiced
      in
      the
      sequels.
      Or
      just
      like
      with
      the
      case
      of
      N.
      Brio,
      they
      probably
      couldn #8217;t
      find
      a
      voice
      actor
      for
      her
      in
      time.

      You
      know
      I
      never
      understood
      that
      phrase.
      Your
      saying
      that
      suicide
      is
      a
      permanent
      solution
      to
      a
      temporary
      situation...
      why
      don #8217;t
      I
      just
      commit
      suicide
      then?
      I #8217;ll
      never
      have
      to
      deal
      with
      that
      situation
      ever
      again
      if
      I
      go
      through
      with
      it.
      Your
      basically
      encouraging
      me
      to
      end
      it
      all.

      Eh,
      to
      be
      fair,
      im
      a
      huge
      ass
      hip
      hop
      head,
      and
      Tyler
      is
      pretty
      popular
      at
      the
      moment
      in
      that
      community.
      Will
      on
      the
      other
      hand
      is
      really
      only
      known
      for
      having
      some
      pretty
      shitty
      pop
      songs,
      which
      is
      a
      shame
      because
      he
      used
      to
      be
      pretty
      decent.
      Like
      you
      got
      the
      BEP #8217;s
      first
      album,
      which
      is
      pretty
      okay
      in
      my
      books,
      but
      the
      rest
      after
      that
      is
      crap.
      And
      will #8217;s
      solo
      career
      was
      actually
      ok
      as
      well
      for
      a
      while.
      His
      first
      album,
      [Lost
      Change](https://open.spotify.com/album/6tVfhrLqf1dY0vwnkvUDNc?nd=1)
      was
      a
      pretty
      experimental
      album
      that
      had
      some
      stinkers,
      but
      also
      had
      some
      pretty
      good
      shit
      on
      there,
      like
      [Ev
      Rebahdee](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=AJCXqH9UlNU),
      and
      [Money](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mS92idkMovA amp;list=OLAK5uy_kTFiTfKYIGnDEmRpwDi50F0gdf_O-lUsU amp;index=7 amp;t=0s).
      His
      second
      album,
      [Must
      B
      21](https://open.spotify.com/album/0DWJ4RMTGfPaAod0wAoFIA?nd=1)
      was
      far
      less
      experimental
      and
      had
      more
      straightforward
      bangers,
      and
      I
      both
      like
      and
      dislike
      it
      for
      that
      reason.
      Will
      himself
      also
      barely
      appears
      on
      the
      album,
      which
      is
      a
      positive
      considering
      he
      isn #8217;t
      really
      that
      much
      of
      a
      good
      lyricist
      to
      be
      honest.
      I
      haven #8217;t
      listened
      to
      everything
      else
      after
      that,
      but
      I
      do
      recommend
      checking
      out
      those
      albums.
      It #8217;s
      a
      shame
      he
      sold
      out,
      he
      should
      have
      just
      taken
      the
      L
      and
      disbanded
      the
      BEP,
      but
      of
      course,
      he
      had
      to
      sell
      the
      fuck
      out,
      and
      I
      lost
      all
      the
      respect
      I
      had
      for
      him.

      continue

      Considering
      that
      the
      school #8217;s
      population
      did
      a
      huge

      that
      bitch
      when
      they

      out
      she
      was
      lying,
      I #8217;m
      pretty
      sure
      that

      was
      able
      to

      his
      reputation
      cleaned
      up.

      leave

      tonight
      because

      shit.
      This

      the
      perfect
      time
      to
      leave
      since

      is
      starting
      for
      me

      The #160;Tiananmen
      Square
      protests,
      commonly
      known
      in #160;mainland
      China #160;as
      the #160;June
      Fourth
      Incident #160;(Chinese: #160; #20845; #22235; #20107; #20214;, #160;li #249;s #236;
      sh #236;ji #224;n),
      were
      student-led #160;demonstrations #160;held
      in #160;Tiananmen
      Square #160;in #160;Beijing #160;during
      1989.
      The

      inspired
      by
      the
      Beijing
      protests
      is

      m #237;ny #249;n).
      The
      protests
      started
      on
      15
      April
      and
      were
      forcibly
      suppressed
      on
      4
      June
      when
      the
      government
      declared #160;martial
      law #160;and
      sent
      the
      military
      to
      occupy
      central
      parts
      of
      Beijing.
      In
      what
      became
      known
      as

      The
      TV
      signal
      finally
      goes
      out,
      the
      apocalypse
      is
      in
      full
      effect.
      I
      pear
      out
      my
      shut
      window
      blinds
      to
      see
      what's
      going
      on
      outside.
      The
      ray
      of
      light
      temporarily
      blinds
      me
      before
      I
      see
      the
      carnage
      outside.
      Some
      normie
      hipster
      chad's
      getting
      his
      brain
      ripped
      out
      by
      a
      zombie
      as
      he
      pleads
      for
      mercy.
      Guess
      all
      that
      weight
      training
      was
      for
      naught
       #128526;
      A
      horde
      starts
      gathering
      outside
      my
      bedroom
      door,
      yet
      the
      hardened
      pile
      of
      doritoes
      and
      monster
      packaging
      provides
      a
      natural
      barricade
      that
      buys
      me
      time
      to
      prepare.
      I
      hear
      my
      mom's
      cries
      of
      pain
      from
      down
      the
      hallway.
      Fucking
      bitch,
      that's
      what
      you
      get
      for
      not
      bringing
      me
      my
      tendies.
      I
      look
      around
      the
      room
      for
      something
      to
      defend
      myself
      with.
      My
      trusty
      7-fold
      katana
      hangs
      on
      the
      wall,
      begging
      to
      be
      used
      by
      its
      master.
      I
      grab
      it
      off
      the
      wall
      and
      ready
      my
      stance.
      Heh,
      all
      those
      normies
      at
      school
      telling
      me
      playing
      games
      wouldn't
      help
      me
      in
      life,
      yet
      i'll
      be
      the
      only
      one
      to
      survive.
      In
      this
      new
      world,
      I
      am
      the
      alpha
      predator.
      The
      barricade
      begins
      to
      shift
      as
      the
      zombies
      start
      slowly
      moving
      their
      way
      into
      my
      room.
      I
      fold
      a
      greasy
      strand
      of
      hair
      away
      from
      my
      eyes
      and
      behind
      my
      ear.
      I
      struggle
      to
      stand
      up,
      having
      not
      needed
      to
      for
      weeks,
      and
      prepare
      to
      defend
      my
      honor.
      As
      the
      first
      beast
      breaks
      past
      the
      door
      and
      bolts
      towards
      me,
      I
      lunge
      forward
      ready
      to
      strike.
      Just
      then
      however,
      I
      slip
      on
      a
      discarded
      tissue
      and
      fall
      straight
      to
      the
      floor.
      The
      impact
      causes
      my
      Mikasa
      figure
      to
      fall
      from
      its
      shelf
      onto
      my
      face.
      As
      I
      try
      to
      remove
      it,
      the
      horde
      leaps
      full
      force
      onto
      me
      and
      thrashes
      at
      my
      skin.
      As
      the
      life
      drains
      from
      me
      and
      I
      near
      my
      unjust
      end,
      I
      have
      only
      the
      strength
      to
      utter
      2
      more
      words
      'Fucking
      society'

      I #8217;m
      talking
      about
      posts
      where
      someone
      claims
      that
      a
      person
      close
      to
      them,
      such
      as
      a
      parent
      or
      friend,
      has
      died.
      Most,
      if.
      It
      all
      of
      these
      stories
      are
      fake,
      and
      have
      been
      exposed
      by
      other
      users.
      There
      recently
      was
      a
      post
      on
      here
      where
      a
      user #8217;s
      mother
      supposedly
      died
      in
      her
      sleep.
      I
      believe
      this
      is
      false,
      but
      if
      it
      is
      true,
      then
      my
      condolences
      go
      to
      you
      OP.
      Now
      back
      onto
      my
      main
      topic,
      this
      just
      isn #8217;t
      the
      right
      sub
      to
      post
      this
      type
      of
      content.
      I #8217;m
      not
      saying
      serious
      posts
      should
      be
      banned
      from
      here,
      but
      it #8217;s
      just
      odd
      how
      some
      people
      are
      willing
      to
      post
      about
      their
      loved
      ones
      death
      a
      day
      after
      it
      happened,
      right?
      It
      just
      comes
      off
      as
      very
      karma
      whory,
      and
      extremely
      disrespectful,
      because
      your
      willing
      to
      make
      up
      stories
      about
      that
      type
      of
      rather
      serious
      content
      for
      some
      imaginary
      internet
      arrows
      and
      maybe
      some
      medals.
      If
      your
      looking
      to
      mourn,
      go
      post
      on
      [r/depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/)
      which
      is
      a
      sub
      I
      think
      is
      better
      suited
      for
      content
      like
      that.
      TLDR:
      Stop
      making
      up
      shitty
      pity
      stories,
      and
      if
      they #8217;re
      real,
      then
      this
      isn #8217;t

      SPONGEBOB,
      ME
      LAD,
      YOU
      HAVE
      TOO
      MANY
      ORIFICES
      FER
      YER
      OWN
      GOOD.
      YER
      GETTIN'
      A
      PROMOTION!"
      said
      Mr.
      Krabs
      as
      his
      hard
      red
      carapaced
      cock
      jabbed
      into
      the
      back
      of
      Spongebob's
      head.
      "I
      feel
      like
      I'm
      absorbing
      some
      weird
      fluid,"
      spluttered
      Spongebob
      as
      Krabs'
      nasty
      crustaceo-jizz
      poured
      from
      his
      mouth,
      nose
      and
      eyes.
      "NOW
      EARN
      YOUR
      KEEP,
      LANDLUBBER,"
      said
      Krabs
      as
      he
      grabbed
      Spongebob
      by
      his
      jizz-soaked
      trousers
      and
      began
      using
      him
      to
      clean
      the
      floor.
      "Oh
      Mr.
      Krabs,
      I-"
      "CALL
      ME
      MASTER
      YE
      BITCH"
      Krabs
      stepped
      down
      hard
      in
      Spongebob
      and
      a
      puddle
      of
      his
      own
      jizz
      began
      spreading
      radially
      on
      the
      floor
      of
      the
      Krusty
      Krab.
      "Hurgghbglbgblblgbl."
      "CHOKE
      ON
      IT,
      YE
      INVERTEBRATE,
      OR
      I
      CAN'T
      GET
      HARRRRRRD.
      THESE
      CLAWS
      AREN'T
      JUST
      GOOD
      FER
      MATIN #8230;OH,
      WAIT,
      YES
      THEY
      ARE,"
      said
      Krabs
      as
      he
      caressed
      his
      eleventh
      leg.
      The
      jizz
      began
      floating
      up
      toward
      the
      ceiling
      as
      Krabs
      brandished
      his
      seven-inch
      red
      masthead.
      You
      have
      to
      realize
      this
      is
      to
      scale,
      so
      it
      was
      about
      twice
      his
      body
      size.
      Anyway,
      Squidward
      burst
      into
      the
      room
      wearing
      only
      a
      gimp
      suit
      and
      a
      tutu.
      "TAKE
      ME
      MASTER,
      I
      NEED
      TO
      BE
      HUMILIATED,"
      he
      said,
      as
      his
      four-millimeter
      calamari
      poked
      limply
      from
      the
      tight
      leather.
      "TAKE
      THIS,
      THEN,"
      said
      Krabs
      as
      he
      jabbed
      one
      of
      his
      prehensile
      eyestalks
      up
      Squidward's
      stankhole.
      Squidward
      moaned,
      rubbing
      himself
      gently
      with
      5
      of
      his
      tentacles.
      "I
      CAN
      SEE
      YOU
      DON'T
      TAKE
      CARE
      OF
      YOUR
      HOLE
      VERY
      OFTEN,"
      said
      Krabs.
      Patrick
      burst
      into
      the
      room
      wearing
      nothing
      but
      a
      smile
      and
      brandishing
      a
      towel.
      "DID
      SOMEBODY
      CALL
      THE
      HOLE
      DOCTOR?"
      "Are
      you
      a
      real
      doctor?"
      asked
      Spoogebob.
      "I
      went
      to
      community
      college,"
      said
      Patrick
      as
      he
      forcibly
      yanked
      out
      Krabs'
      eyestalk
      and
      shoved
      it
      in
      his
      gay
      fat
      mouth.
      "Hold
      this
      open,
      will
      ya?"
      said
      Patrick
      as
      he
      ripped
      off
      Spongebob's
      erect
      penis
      and
      used
      it
      to
      jam
      Squidward's
      hole
      open.
      It
      immediately
      grew
      back
      but
      smaller
      and
      wetter.
      "Hmm...
      there's
      a
      lot
      of
      SHIT
      in
      here,"
      said
      Patrick.
      "How
      much
      fiber
      is
      in
      Krabby
      Patties
      anyway?"
      "YE
      WOULDN'T
      BELIEVE,"
      said
      Krabs,
      as
      a
      gigantic
      turd
      stretched
      his
      red
      asshole
      until
      it
      tore.
      "I
      NEED
      AN
      ENEMA,"
      said
      Patrick.
      "OH
      WAIT
      WE'RE
      UNDERWATER."
      Patrick
      nibbled
      gently
      at
      the
      tip
      of
      Krabs'
      eyestalk
      as
      he
      released
      it
      from
      his
      mouth.
      He
      wiped
      eye
      fluid
      from
      the
      corner
      of
      his
      mouth
      and
      put
      Squidward's
      zippered
      lips
      to
      his
      own.
      "ON
      THE
      COUNT
      OF
      THREE"
      said
      Patrick.
      "ONE #8230;
      TWO #8230;
      OH
      FUCK
      IT
      HNRRRRRRGGUUUUUUUUUUUUUUH!"
      Patrick
      blew
      Squidward
      like
      a
      trumpet.
      All
      8
      of
      his
      tentacles
      went
      rigid
      and
      his
      squidjuice
      spilled
      out
      from
      the
      dick
      hole
      in
      his
      suit.
      The
      immense
      force
      started
      to
      blow
      crusty
      chunks
      of
      shit
      out
      of
      Squidward's
      ass.
      "I
      must
      keep
      the
      Krusty
      Krab
      clean!"
      yelled
      Spoogebob
      as
      he
      rushed
      over
      and
      opened
      his
      mouth.
      Spongebob
      recognized
      bits
      of
      the
      Krabby
      Patty
      formula
      in
      his
      mouth
      as
      Squidward's
      acrid
      shit
      coated
      his
      tongue
      and
      teeth.
      "SWALLOW,
      YE
      LANDLUBBER,"
      said
      Krabs,
      poking
      his
      dick
      at
      Spongebob's
      lips.
      "HMRGGRGHRGUHF,"
      said
      Spongebob,
      shaking
      his
      head.
      He
      wanted
      to
      savor
      it,
      but
      Krabs
      had
      other
      plans.
      Krabs
      got
      up
      on
      his
      desk
      and
      flexed.
      "GET
      READY"
      he
      yelled
      as
      he
      jumped
      down
      on
      Spongebob
      with
      a
      stone
      cold
      stunner.
      Blood,
      semen
      and
      shit
      sprayed
      powerfully
      from
      every
      one
      of
      Spongebob's
      holes.
      The
      force
      of
      the
      explosion
      tore
      both
      of
      his
      legs
      off.
      The
      assorted
      fluids
      and
      solids
      coated
      the
      walls
      of
      Krabs'
      office.
      "YE
      GOT
      THAT
      SHIT
      ALL
      OVER
      ME
      FIRST
      DOLLAR,"
      screeched
      Krabs.
      "AND
      YOU
      KNOW
      THERE'S
      ONLY
      ONE
      WAY
      TO
      CLEAN
      IT!"
      Squidward,
      Patrick
      and
      Spongebob
      all
      begged
      at
      Krabs'
      knees,
      pleading
      to
      be
      the
      ones
      who
      got
      to
      lick
      the
      moist
      brown
      dollar.
      "THE
      FIRST
      ONES
      WHO
      CAN
      FIND
      SANDY
      AND
      SUCK
      OFF
      HER
      FUTA
      COCK
      GET
      TO
      LICK
      THE
      DOLLAR,"
      decreed
      Krabs,
      stowing
      the
      dollar
      in
      his
      ass
      for
      safekeeping.
      The
      three
      homos
      scrambled
      out
      of
      the
      room
      and
      towards
      the
      treedome.
      ONE
      HOUR
      LATER
      Spongebob,
      Patrick
      and
      Squidward
      approached
      the
      door
      of
      Sandy's
      tree
      house,
      not
      so
      much
      as
      an
      undergarment
      between
      them,
      and
      knocked
      politely
      on
      the
      door.
      Sandy
      didn't
      respond,
      so
      Patrick
      broke
      down
      the
      door
      with
      his
      erect,
      barrel-like
      member.
      "SANDY,"
      they
      screamed,
      not
      caring
      about
      the
      lack
      of
      water.
      "SAAAAAANDY!"
      Patrick
      picked
      up
      some
      mud
      and
      smeared
      it
      on
      his
      face.
      "I'M
      DIRTY
      DAN,"
      he
      growled.
      "I
      hope
      Dirty
      Dan
      likes
      getting
      RAMMED
      UP
      THE
      ASS,"
      yelled
      Spongebob,
      as
      he
      thrust
      his
      supple
      yellow
      cattle
      prod
      into
      Patrick's
      chasmal
      pink
      rear.
      Patrick
      groaned
      in
      pleasure.
      "Who
      you
      callin'
      pinhead?"
      "SHUT
      THE
      FUCK
      UP!
      DIRTY
      DAN
      DOESN'T
      TALK,"
      screamed
      Spongebob
      as
      he
      climaxed.
      Patrick
      scooped
      out
      some
      of
      Spongebob's
      cum
      from
      his
      cavernous
      brown
      crevice
      and
      smeared
      it
      into
      Squidward's
      eyes.
      "YOU'RE
      DIRTY
      DAN!"
      "UNGHHHH,
      IT
      HURTS
      SO
      GOOD!"
      Squidward
      smeared
      the
      semen
      into
      his
      eyes
      until
      they
      bled.
      Blood
      and
      semen
      gushed
      down
      his
      face.
      "THIS
      REMINDS
      ME
      OF
      THAILAND,"
      said
      Spongebob
      pensively,
      puffing
      on
      his
      pipe,
      which
      he
      fashioned
      out
      of
      one
      of
      his
      older
      penises.
      Squidward
      enjoyed
      what
      remained
      of
      Spongebob's
      cum
      as
      Spongebob
      rode
      the
      tip
      of
      Patrick's
      voluminous
      horsehitch
      into
      Sandy's
      room.
      She
      was
      sleeping,
      but
      she
      looked
      like
      she
      had
      put
      on
      weight.
      Her
      futa
      cock
      was
      fully
      erect.
      "LET'S
      RAPE
      HER,"
      suggested
      Patrick,
      peeling
      Spongebob
      off
      his
      penis
      and
      throwing
      him
      violently
      against
      the
      wall.
      "Wait
      Patrick,
      don't
      you
      know
      ANYTHING
      about
      squirrels?"
      cautioned
      Spongebob,
      ripping
      off
      his
      damaged
      member
      and
      growing
      a
      new
      one.
      He
      placed
      the
      damaged
      one
      on
      a
      necklace
      he
      was
      keeping.
      "I
      KNOW
      THEY'RE
      EXCELLENT
      TARGETS
      FOR
      RAPE,
      ESPECIALLY
      WHILE
      THEY'RE
      SLEEPING,"
      said
      Patrick
      as
      he
      jammed
      his
      holiday
      yule
      log
      into
      Sandy's
      ear.
      She
      was
      fast
      asleep
      and
      didn't
      seem
      to
      notice,
      but
      her
      cock
      twitched.
      "It's
      called
      HIBERNATION,
      Patrick.
      Squirrels
      stuff
      valuable
      treasures
      into
      their
      vaginas
      and
      then
      go
      to
      sleep
      for
      six
      months."
      "TREASURE?
      I
      WANT
      TREASURE"
      roared
      Patrick
      as
      he
      dove
      head-first
      into
      Sandy's
      gaping
      pussy.
      "UHH,
      I'M
      STUCK.
      WHERE'S
      THE
      TREASURE?"
      "GO...DEEPER!"
      grunted
      Spongebob,
      giving
      Patrick
      a
      good
      shove.
      "I
      CAN'T.
      I'M
      TOO
      FAT,"
      he
      replied.
      "I'M
      REALLY
      HORNY
      THOUGH."
      Spongebob
      chuckled.
      His
      plan
      had
      worked.
      Patrick
      was
      incapacitated
      and
      he
      was
      free
      to
      suck
      off
      Sandy's
      futa
      cock
      while
      she
      slept.
      "SPONGEBOB?
      SPONGEBOB,
      WHAT
      ARE
      YOU
      DOING
      OUT
      THERE?"
      Patrick's
      muffled
      voice
      rang
      out
      from
      somewhere
      nearby,
      but
      Spongebob
      was
      enjoying
      Sandy's
      hard,
      flexible
      prick
      in
      his
      mouth.
      Sandy
      rolled
      over
      and
      her
      dick
      went
      through
      the
      side
      of
      Spongebob's
      mouth
      and
      out
      one
      of
      his
      ear
      holes.
      "COME
      ON,
      DAMMIT,
      WHY
      WON'T
      YOU
      CUM?"
      muttered
      Spongebob
      as
      he
      moved
      himself
      sensually
      up
      and
      down
      the
      length
      of
      Sandy's
      anaconda.
      At
      last,
      the
      sleeping
      squirrel
      climaxed,
      shooting
      hot
      greasy
      cum
      from
      Spongebob's
      ear.
      He
      pocketed
      some
      of
      it
      because
      he
      knew
      Krabs
      would
      require
      proof,
      probably
      while
      raping
      him
      violently.
      "MMMRH?
      WHO
      SUCKED
      ME
      OFF?"
      murred
      Sandy
      as
      she
      rubbed
      her
      eyes.
      "SPONGEBOB,
      YOU
      CHEATER!"
      yelled
      Patrick,
      his
      voice
      muffled
      by
      the
      squirrel's
      vaginal
      wall.
      Spongebob
      ran
      as
      fast
      as
      his
      gay
      little
      legs
      would
      carry
      him
      out
      of
      Sandy's
      room.
      Squidward
      was
      attempting
      to
      fuck
      a
      tree.

      I #8217;m
      willing
      to
      bet
      that
      Peni
      didn #8217;t
      even
      consent
      with
      her
      father
      when
      she
      lost
      her
      virginity.
      Just
      look
      at
      her
      eyes,
      her
      tear
      filled,
      soulless
      eyes...
      I
      bet
      he
      dragged
      her
      into
      his
      room
      and
      fucking
      just
      went
      at
      her.
      Fucking
      just
      tore
      off
      her
      clothes
      and
      porked
      her
      right
      on
      the
      floor.
      I
      can
      imagine
      her
      screaming,
      and
      her
      father
      just
      holding
      his
      hand
      over
      her
      mouth,
      telling
      her
      to
      shut
      the
      fuck
      up
      and
      accept
      what #8217;s
      happening
      to
      her.
      Then
      when
      he
      finally
      cums
      into
      her,
      he
      just
      leaves
      her
      to
      cry
      on
      the
      floor
      while
      he
      gets
      back
      to
      whatever
      the
      fuck
      he
      was
      doing.
      God,
      I
      wish
      I
      was
      Peni #8217;s
      father.
      I
      would
      fucking
      screw
      her
      anytime
      I
      got
      the
      opportunity
      to
      do.
      I
      mean,
      just
      look
      at
      her.
      I
      swear
      I #8217;m
      not
      a
      pedophile,
      but
      there #8217;s
      something
      about
      Peni
      that
      just
      screams
       #8220;Sexy. #8221;
      Her
      short
      black
      hair,
      her
      schoolgirl
      outfit,
      her
      anime
      aesthetic..
      everything
      about
      her
      perfect.
      Her
      comic
      counterpart
      is
      even
      better.
      She
      looks
      a
      bit
      more
      older,
      has
      breasts,
      and
      I
      don #8217;t
      feel
      as
      ashamed
      to
      jack
      off
      to
      her
      as
      I
      do
      with
      movie
      Peni.
      You
      know,
      I
      fucking
      regret
      watching
       #8220;Into
      The
      Spider
      Verse. #8221;
      Ever
      since
      I #8217;ve
      watched
      that
      fucking
      movie,
      I #8217;ve
      done
      nothing
      but
      masturbate
      to
      Peni
      Parker
      and
      piss
      and
      shit
      on
      the
      floor
      since
      I
      literally
      cannot
      stand
      up
      due
      to
      how
      obese
      I
      am.
      I
      have
      piles
      of
      dung
      on
      my
      carpet
      and
      there #8217;s
      mold
      growing
      all
      over
      my
      walls
      as
      well.
      I
      keep
      calling
      for
      my
      mommy
      to
      change
      my
      adult
      diaper,
      but
      she
      still
      has
      yet
      to
      respond.
      I #8217;m
      afraid
      she
      might
      have
      moved
      out
      and
      left
      me
      to
      die
      here.
      Why
      would
      she
      do
      that?
      Why
      would
      she
      let
      me
      die
      a
      slow
      and
      painful
      death?
      Death
      is
      so
      scary,
      yet
      so
      natural.
      I
      don #8217;t
      want
      to
      die
      yet.
      Please,
      I #8217;m
      still
      so
      young.
      I
      promise
      I #8217;ll
      get
      better,
      mommy
      if
      you
      see
      this
      message,
      please
      get
      me
      out
      of
      here.
      I
      don #8217;t
      want
      to
      starve
      mommy.
      I
      promise
      I #8217;ll
      improve
      myself.
      Mommy
      please

      I
      feel
      that
      man.
      Everyday,
      I
      try
      my
      best
      to
      suppress
      the
      fact
      I #8217;m
      a
      complete
      fucking
      failure
      who #8217;s
      completely
      wasted
      his
      potential
      by
      sitting
      his
      ass
      behind
      a
      computer
      all
      the
      time,
      and
      that
      I #8217;m
      now
      forced
      to
      live
      with
      the
      knowledge
      that
      I #8217;m
      going
      to
      die
      an
      old
      bitter
      man

      knows
      he
      could
      have
      done
      something
      great
      with
      his
      life,
      but
      instead
      let
      peer
      pressure
      get
      to
      him
      and
      became
      a
      9
      to
      5
      worker
      drone
      instead.

      Honestly
      though,
      if
      you
      haven #8217;t
      listened
      to
      The
      Roots,
      you
      should
      listen
      to
      one
      of
      their
      albums
      right
      now.
      Their
      probably
      the
      most
      consistent
      hip
      hop
      group
      to
      stick
      around.
      They #8217;ve
      never
      had
      an
      album
      that
      was
      average.
      Their
       #8220;worst #8221;
      album(The
      Tipping
      Point)
      was
      still
      pretty
      damn
      good
      in
      my
      opinion.
      You
      can
      start
      anywhere
      with
      them,
      although
      I
      recommend
      finding
      their
      debut
      album,
      Organix
      on
      YouTube
      and
      listen
      to
      that
      first,
      then
      move
      on
      to
      the
      albums
      on
      Spotify
      and
      listen
      to
      them
      in
      order.
      Just
      hearing
      how
      they
      evolved
      over
      the
      years
      was
      fucking
      great
      to
      hear.

      There
      was
      a
      time
      I
      used
      to
      love
      Minecraft,
      but
      I
      tried
      replaying
      it
      about
      a
      month
      or
      two
      ago,
      and
      I
      couldn #8217;t
      really
      get
      into
      it
      like
      I
      did
      when
      I
      was
      younger.
      It #8217;s
      a
      bit
      too
      slow
      paced
      for
      my
      liking.
      I
      don #8217;t
      have
      anything
      wrong
      with
      those
      types
      of
      games
      usually,
      but
      there #8217;s
      something
      about
      Minecraft
      that
      doesn #8217;t
      click
      with
      me
      anymore.

      Yeah,
      I
      never
      understood
      why
      he
      was
      that
      popular
      anyways,
      asides
      from
      having
      a
      stupid
      fucking
      username.
      What
      made
      it
      so
      special
      anyways?
      Was
      it
      because
      it
      had
       #8220;Nigga #8221;
      in
      it?
      I #8217;m
      definitely
      glad
      he #8217;s
      gone
      from
      Reddit.

      Yeah,
      and
      if
      he
      was
      ugly,
      everyone
      would
      be
      screaming
      about
      much
      of
      a
      monster
      he
      was,
      and
      that
      he
      deserves
      the
      death
      penalty.

      Oh
      fuck
      off
      with
      that
       #8220;you #8217;ll
      eventually
      get
      a
      girlfriend #8221;
      bullshit.
      Life
      isn #8217;t
      a
      fucking
      fairytale
      you
      know,
      not
      all
      of
      us
      are
      meant
      to
      find
      love.
      People
      like
      me
      are
      destined
      to
      work
      shitty
      9-5
      jobs
      for
      the
      rest
      of
      their
      lives
      to
      until
      they
      finally
      either
      collapse
      from
      exhaustion
      or
      blast
      themselves
      in
      their
      roach
      filled
      apartment.
      I
      fucking
      despise
      my
      life
      so
      fucking
      much.
      I #8217;ve
      never
      even
      felt
      the
      pleasure
      of
      holding
      a
      fucking
      girls
      hand.
      All
      they #8217;ve
      done
      is
      point
      and
      laugh
      at
      me,
      and
      call
      me
      an
      ugly
      greasy
      neckbeard.
      Meanwhile,
      Cory
      basically
      fucking
      slaps
      these
      girls
      around
      like
      fucking
      basketballs,
      and
      yet
      always
      manages
      to
      slam
      dunk
      their
      fishy
      cunts
      in
      the
      bed.
      I #8217;ve
      fucking
      had
      enough
      of
      this
      clown
      world.
      I #8217;ve
      spent
      years
      rotting
      away
      in
      my
      moldy
      apartment,
      fucking
      slamming
      my
      head
      against
      the
      wall
      hoping
      that
      my
      fucking
      brain
      pops
      out.
      I #8217;ve
      come
      to
      accept
      the
      fact
      that
      no
      one
      will
      love
      me,
      and
      that
      I #8217;m
      probably
      gonna
      be
      buried
      in
      a
      generic
      no
      name
      cemetery
      and
      be
      immediately
      forgotten
      about.
      I
      don #8217;t
      fucking
      care
      anymore.
      I
      just
      want
      relief
      from
      this
      clown
      world.
      I
      want
      freedom,
      and
      yet
      god
      continues
      to
      torment
      me.

      A
      reminder
      that
      people
      who
      spent
      money
      to
      travel
      to
      Nevada
      and
      stand
      around
      in
      a
      barren
      wasteland
      awkwardly
      for
      a
      few
      hours
      could
      have
      spent
      that
      money
      on
      charity,
      or
      could
      have
      bought
      something
      nice
      for
      themselves
      with
      the
      money
      they
      saved
      up,
      like
      maybe
      a
      new
      game,
      or
      hell,
      they
      could
      have
      given
      that
      money
      to
      the
      poor,
      any
      little
      amount
      helps
      after
      all.
      Welcome
      to
      Clown
      world,
      where
      we
      value
      memes
      over
      actually
      helping
      the
      environment.
      And
      we
      wonder
      why
      the
      world
      is
      slowly
      dying.

      For
      some
      reason,
      every
      time
      I
      post
      on
      there,
      it
      doesn #8217;t
      even
      show
      up.
      Apparently
      the
      mods
      from
      what
      I
      know
      have
      to
      manually
      see
      your
      post
      and
      upload
      it
      themselves.
      Does
      anyone
      know
      what
      time
      I
      should
      post

      so
      I
      got
      a
      better
      chance
      of
      it
      actually
      getting

      I

      like
      alcohol-ics
      My
      freshman
      year
      I
      was
      going
      through
      hella
      problems
      'Til
      I,
      built
      up
      the
      nerve
      to
      drop
      my
      ass
      up
      out
      of
      college
      My
      teacher
      said
      I'se
      a
      loser,
      I
      told
      her
      "Why
      don't
      you
      kill
      me?"
      I
      give
      a
      fuck
      if
      you
      fail
      me,
      I'm
      gonna
      fol-low
      my
      heart
      And
      if
      you
      follow
      the
      charts,
      or
      the
      plaques
      or
      the
      stacks
      You
      ain't
      gotta
      guess
      who's
      back,
      you
      see
      I'm
      so
      Chi
      that
      you
      thought
      I
      was
      bashful
      But
      this
      bastard's
      flow
      will
      bash
      your
      skull
      And
      I
      will,
      cut
      your
      girl
      like
      Pastor
      Tro'
      And
      I
      don't,
      usually
      smoke,
      but
      pass
      the
      'dro

      From
      what
      little
      I
      know
      of
      him,
      he #8217;s
      some
      guy
      who
      moderates
      hundreds
      of
      subreddits,
      has
      the
      most
      karma
      I #8217;ve
      seen
      from
      a
      user,
      and
      might
      be
      a
      pedophile.
      I #8217;m
      not
      too
      sure
      on
      the
      last
      one,
      someone
      just
      told
      me
      he
      was,
      so
      I #8217;m
      just
      taking
      it
      with
      a
      grain
      of
      salt.
      Also,
      he #8217;s
      a
      pretty
      huge
      dick
      from
      what
      I #8217;ve
      seen
      and
      heard
      of.

      I

      why
      everyone

      still
      calling

      a
      raid
      at
      this
      point.
      No
      one
      from
      my
      knowledge
      even
      bothered
      to
      actually
      run

      just
      fucking
      around
      standing
      awkwardly
      in
      front
      of
      it.
      So
      overall,
      this
      whole
       #8220;raid #8221;
      was
      a
      huge
      waste
      of
      time
      and
      money,
      and
      proves
      how
      stupid
      people
      are
      capable
      of
      being.

      can #8217;t
      really
      do
      much
      except
      say
      sorry
      for
      your
      loss.
      I
      just
      didn #8217;t
      believe
      you
      initially
      because
      most
      of
      these
       #8220;my
      friend
      died
      give
      me
      karma
      lol #8221;
      posts
      are
      fake,
      which
      is
      one
      of
      the
      many
      reasons
      why
      I
      left
      this
      shithole
      sub.
      But
      I
      think
      this
      is
      one
      of
      the
      few
      real
      posts
      of
      this
      type
      on
      here.
      I
      hope
      you #8217;ll
      get
      better
      soon
      man.

      This
      wasn #8217;t
      on
      4chan,
      but
      I
      saw
      a
      video
      of
      a
      rat
      getting
      tortured
      one
      time.
      I
      don #8217;t
      remember
      much
      of
      it,
      I
      think
      it
      was
      a
      compilation
      of
      rat
      torture,
      because
      it
      showed
      a
      rat
      getting
      its
      head
      crushed,
      then
      it
      cut
      to
      showing
      a
      different
      rat
      getting
      torn
      in
      half.
      I
      understand
      not
      a
      lot
      of
      people
      like
      rats,
      I
      sure
      as
      hell
      hate
      them
      too,
      but
      it #8217;s
      messed
      up
      to
      see
      how
      many
      people
      are
      so
      casual
      with
      watching
      animals
      get
      tortured
      to
      death.

      For
      me,
      I
      prefer
      the
      first
      Hotline
      Miami.
      It #8217;s
      weird
      too,
      because
      I
      think
      the
      second
      game
      is
      better
      in
      almost
      every
      department.
      Music,
      The
      Story(Once
      you
      understand
      it),
      hell
      its
      even
      arguably
      better
      graphically
      in
      a
      way.
      The
      only
      reason
      I
      prefer
      the
      first
      game
      is
      because
      of
      the
      level
      design.
      That #8217;s
      literally
      the
      only
      thing
      holding
      the
      2nd
      game
      back
      from
      being
      superior
      to
      the
      1st,
      and
      it
      pisses
      me
      off.
      The
      second
      games
      levels
      were
      way
      too
      big
      to
      in
      comparison
      to
      the
      first
      games
      smaller
      levels,
      which
      meant
      that
      a
      lot
      of
      the
      deaths
      you
      experienced
      felt
      more
      cheap,
      because
      you
      were
      getting
      shot
      offscreen
      and
      shit.
      Ah
      well,
      at
      least
      we
      got
      the
      level
      editor,
      which
      I
      barely
      understand
      but
      it
      was
      still
      pretty
      cool
      to
      see
      what
      other
      players
      could
      come
      up
      with.

      try

      they
      end
      up
      snapping

      barrage

      This
      is
      exactly
      what
      I
      had
      to
      deal
      with
      about
      one
      or
      two
      days
      ago.
      These
      types
      of
      players
      are
      so
      fucking
      annoying.

      Imagine
      how
      their
      parents
      must
      feel.
      I
      mean
      think
      about
      it,
      they
      spent
      years
      nursing,
      teaching,
      and
      loving
      their
      kid.
      They
      had
      to
      work
      hard
      to
      make
      sure
      he
      would
      grow
      up
      in
      a
      safe
      home,
      and
      then
      years
      later,
      they
      see
      their
      son
      has
      become
      a
      degenerate
      who
      can #8217;t
      properly
      socialize
      with
      anyone,
      likely
      smells
      like
      shit
      and
      works
      a
      terrible
      9
      to
      5
      job,
      and
      treats
      fictional
      characters
      like
      their
      real.
      It
      sucks
      man,
      it #8217;s
      just
      fucking
      depressing.

      In
      hindsight,
      probably
      not.
      But
      I
      can #8217;t
      see
      this
      man
      getting
      any

      a

      low
      paying
