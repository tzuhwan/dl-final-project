      Ketogenic
      A-1
      sauce.
      Ok,
      not
      exactly
      A1.
      But
      I
      love
      that
      stuff.
      So
      I
      mixed
      it
      on
      about
      a
      5/1
      sour
      cream/A1
      ratio
      and
      added
      some
      Montreal
      seasoning.
      It
      definitely
      does
      the
      trick.

      I
      never
      experienced
      any
      of
      the
      above
      before,
      but
      I've
      been
      keto-ing
      for
      about
      2
      months
      now
      and
      recently
      suffered
      a
      gallstone
      attack
      (horrible
      BTW).
      And
      some
      superficial
      reading
      of
      causes
      of
      those
      things
      all
      indicate
      that
      diets
      high
      in
      fat
      can
      cause/exacerbate
      them.

      I
      have
      been
      having
      to
      go
      an
      inordinate
      amount
      (volume
      not
      frequency)
      lately,
      mostly
      at
      night.
      It's
      gotten
      to
      the
      point
      that
      even
      when
      I
      go
      before
      I
      go
      to
      bed,
      then
      get
      up
      out
      of
      bed
      (after
      reading
      for
      an
      hour
      or
      so...)
      and
      go
      drain
      the
      lizard
      again,
      which
      I
      never
      did
      in
      the
      past,
      I
      still
      piss
      like
      a
      race
      horse
      in
      the
      morning.
      Some
      days
      I
      am
      waking
      up
      a
      little
      earlier
      than
      normal
      because
      my
      bladder
      feels
      like
      it's
      going
      to
      burst.
      I
      haven't
      changed
      my
      hydratory
      habits.
      Started
      keto
      approx
      2
      months
      ago.
      This
      has
      been
      going
      on
      for
      a
      couple
      weeks.
      I
      don't
      feel
      dehydrated
      and
      my
      showers
      are
      clear,
      not
      golden.
      Anyone
      have
      any
      suggestions
      as
      to
      what
      may
      be
      going
      on...besides
      me
      sleep
      drinking?

      I've
      read
      that
      this
      is
      pretty
      typical
      when
      you're
      in
      a
      ketogenic
      state...and
      can
      testify
      to
      the
      veracity
      of
      that.
      Anyone
      have
      tips
      to
      counteract?
      Are
      there
      any
      TRULY
      carb
      free
      mints
      that
      actually
      help?
      Is
      there
      something
      I
      should
      be
      drinking/taking?
      I
      am
      on
      outside
      sales.
      I'm
      going
      to
      lose
      money
      if
      I
      can't
      hold

      spewing
      mouth

      But
      not
      all
      calories
      are
      the
      same.
      I
      recently
      hit
      the
      weight
      I
      was
      1
      year
      ago
      (started
      keto
      2
      1/2
      months
      ago...have
      lost
      the
      40
      lbs
      I
      gained
      over
      the
      past
      year).
      My
      physical
      activity
      level
      has
      remained
      constant...no
      "exercise",
      I'm
      just
      relatively
      active.
      Anyway,
      today
      I
      started
      putting
      on
      the
      shorts
      that
      I
      bought
      for
      this
      time
      last
      year.
      I
      had
      bought
      them
      last
      year
      because
      I
      had
      gotten
      too
      fat
      for
      my
      shorts
      from
      the
      previous
      year
      (again).
      Well,
      to
      make
      a
      short
      story
      long,
      I
      need
      to
      go
      buy
      new
      shorts
      again
      this
      year.
      Because
      last
      years
      fat
      man
      shorts
      are
      falling
      down,
      even
      though
      I'm
      the
      exact
      same
      weight
      I
      was
      last
      year.
      Our
      (my)
      bodies
      definitely
      use
      different
      "types"
      of
      calories
      differently.
      Or
      the
      calories
      are
      a
      minor
      factor.
      Or
      whatever.
      My
      dead
      man
      walking
      gut
      is
      disappearing.

      I
      just
      realized
      my
      midwestern
      farmer
      grandpa
      (deceased)
      who
      lived
      to
      a
      healthy
      94,
      basically
      ate
      "keto"
      his
      whole
      life.
      He
      used
      to
      put
      butter
      on
      every
      slab
      of
      meat
      that
      he
      ate
      (and
      there
      was
      a
      slab
      at
      every
      dinner)
      and
      usually
      had
      that
      with
      a
      side
      of
      vegetables
      (there
      were
      mashed
      potatoes
      once
      in
      a
      while,
      but
      the
      ratio
      of
      potato
      to
      butter
      and
      heavy
      cream
      was
      about
      1:3).
      Eggs
      fried
      in
      butter
      or
      bacon
      grease
      practically
      every
      day
      of
      his
      life.
      Fruit
      was
      only
      occasionally,
      and
      usually
      just
      berries
      from
      the
      yard.
      Snacks
      consisted
      of
      nuts
      that
      he
      would
      shell,
      then
      lick
      and
      dip
      in
      a
      plate
      of
      salt
      or
      maybe
      some
      radishes
      and
      more
      salt.
      Dessert
      was
      an
      occasional
      (and
      I
      mean
      occasional)
      cookie
      that
      he
      would
      put
      some
      butter
      on
      (thought
      it
      was
      weird
      until
      he
      had
      me
      try
      it)
      or
      a
      scoop
      of
      full
      fat
      ice
      cream.
      He
      didn't
      drink
      alcohol...beverages
      were
      water,
      fresh
      (I
      guess
      you'd
      call
      it
      "raw"
      now)
      milk,
      or
      some
      sun
      tea.
      He
      drove
      himself
      to
      California
      from
      Iowa
      when
      he
      was
      90.
      He
      was
      still
      doing
      the
      Sunday
      crossword
      until
      he
      passed.
      Never
      had
      a
      heart
      attack
      or
      diabetes.
      Was
      never
      overweight.
      Had
      all
      of
      his
      original
      teeth.
      Only
      wore
      reading
      glasses.

      Just
      4
      months
      ago
      I
      was
      still
      able
      to
      convince
      myself
      that
      I
      wasn't
      morbidly
      obese.
      Sure,
      I
      was
      big
      (5'10"
      275).
      But
      I
      "carried
      it
      well"
      and
      I
      looked
      30-40lbs
      lighter
      than
      that.
      However,
      my
      wife
      had
      stopped
      telling
      me
      I
      wasn't
      big.
      In
      fact
      she
      was
      beginning
      to
      beg
      me
      to
      get
      healthy.
      But
      I
      had
      built
      up
      a
      persona
      of
      myself
      that
      I
      still
      felt
      invincible
      and
      that
      I
      could
      do
      what
      I
      wanted
      health
      wise,
      like
      I
      could
      for
      so
      much
      of
      my
      life
      (former
      hard
      working
      hard
      playing
      captain
      badass
      athlete).
      Now,
      45
      pounds
      lost
      later,
      things
      have
      reversed.
      My
      body
      image
      has
      become
      realistic
      again.
      I
      realize
      that
      the
      50
      additional
      pounds
      that
      I
      am
      still
      carrying
      now
      compared
      to
      when
      I
      was
      playing
      3
      soccer
      matches
      a
      week,
      running
      trails
      for
      miles
      just
      for
      something
      to
      do,
      throwing
      weights
      around
      that
      I
      would
      get
      a
      hernia
      just
      looking
      at
      now,
      are
      actually
      there.
      It's
      not
      an
      illusion.
      Sucking
      in
      my
      gut
      in
      when
      looking
      in
      the
      mirror
      to
      coddle
      my
      ego
      is
      pointless.
      Still
      Feeling
      the
      strain
      in
      my
      knees
      (albeit
      much
      less
      than
      45
      pounds
      ago)
      when
      going
      up
      stairs
      is
      a
      symptom
      of
      my
      weight,
      not
      due
      to
      an
      old
      sports
      injury
      (only
      had
      a
      minor
      one
      in
      one
      knee,
      not
      both)like
      I
      kept
      convincing
      myself.
      I
      am
      living
      in
      reality
      now.
      And
      it
      feels
      amazing.
      *side
      note...my
      wife
      was
      thinking
      I
      look
      "skinny"
      now.
      Like
      I
      was
      fine
      where
      I
      was.
      And
      then
      I
      showed
      her
      our
      wedding
      photo
      from
      12
      years
      ago
      (this
      Sunday!)
      when
      I
      was
      a
      soft
      200
      and
      she
      gasped.
      And
      then
      I
      showed
      her
      a
      couple
      shirtless
      photos
      of
      me
      a
      few
      years
      before
      that
      when
      I
      was
      a
      rock
      hard
      180.
      She
      told
      me
      to
      get
      my
      fat
      ass
      to
      the
      gym
      so
      she
      could
      get
      some
      of
      that.
      I
      love
      her.

      I
      avoided
      trying
      cauliflower
      rice
      because,
      well,
      I
      (used
      to)
      hate
      cauliflower.
      Smelled
      and
      tasted
      like
      feet.
      However,
      even
      then,
      I
      could
      stomach
      it
      if
      it
      was
      breaded
      and
      deep
      fried.
      Because,
      well,
      breaded
      and
      deep
      fried.
      However,
      today
      I
      had
      thrown
      some
      country
      style
      ribs
      in
      the
      crockpot
      with
      some
      beef
      broth
      and
      mushrooms....nothing
      exotic,
      but
      tasty.
      And
      I
      wanted
      something
      to
      go
      with
      it.
      Some
      comfort
      food.
      Busted
      out
      the
      bag
      of
      cauliflower
      rice
      that
      had
      been
      staring
      me
      in
      the
      eye
      every
      time
      I
      opened
      the
      freezer
      for
      the
      past
      month.
      Fried/steamed
      it
      up
      with
      some
      clarified
      butter
      (Trader
      Joe's
      if
      you're
      looking....great
      for
      searing
      steaks
      with)
      and
      salt.
      Plated
      the
      pork
      and
      shrooms
      and
      poured
      some
      crockpot
      juice
      over
      everything.
      Amazing.
      Delicious.
      Making
      it
      again
      tomorrow.
      Not
      sure
      if
      I
      would've
      liked
      it
      if
      I
      had
      tried
      it
      2
      months

      (been
      ketoing
      for
      3

      months)
      But
      I'm
      pretty
      sure
      my
      tastebuds
      have
      changed
      dramatically.

      All
      right...here's
      the
      deal.
      I
      know
      that
      losing
      belly
      fat
      can
      add
      to
      the
      length
      of
      your
      lizard.
      But
      I'm
      talking
      about
      something
      else.
      Even
      in
      my
      pre-fat
      guy
      days
      when
      my
      purple
      helmeted
      soldier
      stood
      at
      full
      attention
      I
      had
      nothing
      to
      hang
      my
      head
      about.
      In
      fact,
      I
      was
      (am)
      above
      average.
      But
      I
      was
      always
      a
      grower,
      not
      a
      shower.
      As
      in,
      when
      at
      ease
      it
      looked
      like
      an
      turtle
      dove
      egg
      in
      a
      nest.
      Now,
      after
      dropping
      60
      pounds
      from
      tier
      one
      fat
      guy
      days
      (but
      still
      being
      bigger
      than
      I
      was
      referring
      to
      earlier...215
      to
      190)
      I
      have
      recently
      become
      much
      more
      of
      a
      shower
      when
      I'm
      not
      on
      red
      alert.
      No
      more
      egg
      in
      a
      nest.
      More
      like
      a
      baby
      elephant
      looking
      through
      some
      bushes.
      Not
      sure
      why
      any
      of
      this
      would
      be.
      Maybe
      I
      just
      have
      rivers
      of
      testosterone
      surging
      through
      me
      and
      I'm
      walking
      around
      at
      half
      mast
      all
      the
      time.
      I
      dunno.
      But
      it's
      impressive.
      Anyway...anybody
      else?

      Went
      in
      for
      a
      physical
      and
      a
      couple
      other
      things.
      The
      nurse
      checking
      me
      in
      asked
      me
      to
      step
      on
      the
      scale
      and
      read
      the
      number
      to
      her.
      I
      did,
      hopped
      off,
      and
      sat
      down.
      Then
      I
      proceeded
      to
      watch
      her
      input
      data
      on
      her
      computer
      until
      she
      came
      to
      what
      was
      obviously
      my
      weight
      at
      my
      last
      visit
      6
      months
      ago.
      She
      did
      a
      double
      take
      then
      looked
      back
      at
      the
      scale
      and
      hit
      the
      button
      (it
      was
      digital)
      to
      confirm
      the
      number
      I
      had
      read
      to
      her.
      She
      let
      out
      a
      low
      whistle
      and
      said..."wow...you've
      lost
      some
      weight!"
      I
      had
      the
      biggest
      sh#t
      eating
      grin
      on
      my
      face
      you've
      ever
      seen
      when
      I
      said
      ,
      "yeah...a
      bit.
      Still
      have
      a
      little
      way
      to
      go."
      Down
      60
      pounds
      (started
      keto
      about
      4
      1/2
      mos
      ago).
      Blood
      pressure
      (118/68)
      and
      heart
      rate
      (60)
      both
      looking
      good.
      Blood
      drawn
      and
      awaiting
      test
      results
      that
      I'm
      fairly
      confident
      in.
      I'm
      a
      lazy
      keto-er.
      But
      I
      haven't
      cheated
      (more
      than
      literally
      one
      French
      fry
      a
      couple
      times)
      at
      all.
      I
      don't
      measure
      or
      track.
      I
      eat
      meat,
      veggies,
      cheese,
      nuts
      basically
      in
      that
      order
      of
      magnitude.
      I
      drink
      water,
      sparkling
      water,
      coffee,
      and
      have
      recently
      added
      in
      some
      0
      carb
      sport
      drinks.
      I
      occasionally
      have
      a
      few
      bites
      of
      halo
      top
      or
      a
      quest
      bar.
      I
      don't
      "work
      out"
      per
      se,
      by
      as
      my
      weight
      has
      come
      off
      I
      have
      become
      progressively
      more
      active.
      Work
      like
      a
      paid
      laborer
      doing
      yard
      work
      on
      the
      weekends
      for
      4-6
      hours
      a
      day.
      Practice
      soccer
      juggling
      with
      my
      daughter
      30-60
      mins
      at
      a
      time
      a
      few
      times
      a
      week.
      And
      all
      around
      just
      move
      more.
      I
      feel
      reborn.
      I'm
      lady
      killer
      good
      looking
      again,
      I
      have
      energy
      I
      haven't
      had
      in
      10
      years,
      I
      sleep
      like
      I'm
      drugged,
      I
      can
      actually
      play
      with
      my
      kids
      (in
      fact
      I'm
      considering
      working
      my
      way
      up
      to
      actually
      playing
      soccer
      again...think
      I
      could
      do
      it
      now,
      but
      I
      need
      some
      endurance
      training),
      my
      sack
      time
      has
      gotten
      better
      for
      both
      the
      wife
      and
      I.
      Life
      is
      good
      and
      getting
      better.

      He
      was
      just
      on
      the
      Joe

      podcast.
      He
      said

      he
      eats
      a
      whole

      it
      kicks

      seemed

      Rogan
      said
      they
      didn't
      affect
      him
      that
      way.
      They
      don't
      seem
      to
      bother

      then
      again

      they

      Just

      Curious
      as
      to
      your
      opinions
      on
      this.
      Our
      league
      does
      a
      snake
      draft...sort
      of.
      We
      randomize
      it
      every
      two
      rounds.
      So
      rds
      1/2
      you
      may
      have
      2/23.
      And
      then
      rds
      3/4
      you
      may
      have
      30/42
      and
      then
      change
      again
      randomly
      for
      5/6
      and
      so
      on.
      Thought
      behind
      it
      being
      that
      you
      don #8217;t
      stuck
      in
      a
      bad
      spot
      or
      gain
      advantage
      just
      by
      position.
      We
      like
      it
      but
      wanted
      to
      see
      if
      anyone
      else
      does
      it
      that
      way
      and/or
      what
      you
      thought?

      That

      thought.
      We
      like

       #8220;regular #8221;
      style
      draft
      but
      a
      typical
      snake
      just
      seemed
      to
      lock
      you
      into
      position.
      This
      forces
      everyone
      to
      juke
      and
      jive.
      It
      also
      makes
      for
      more
      draft
      day
      positional

      We

      at
      the
      mention
      of
      Lee.
      But
      they
      all
      clapped
      and
      cheered
      at
      the
      point
      of
      the
      story,
      which
      was
      obviously
      about
      Grant.
      Okay,
      William
      McKinley,
      has
      not
      been
      properly
      recognized
      What
      he
      did
      in
      terms
      of
      trade
      In
      terms
      of
      war,
      but
      in
      terms
      of
      trade,
      and
      I
      hate
      to
      say
      it
      in
      terms
      of
      being
      smart
      and
      tariffs.
      William
      McKinley
      has
      not
      been
      properly
      recognized,
      but
      maybe
      someday.
      He
      will
      It
      also
      gave
      you
      A
      general
      Who
      was
      incredible.
      He
      drank
      a
      little
      bit
      too
      much.
      You
      know
      what
      I'm
      talking
      about.
      So
      Robert
      Lee
      was
      a
      great
      general
      and
      Abraham
      Lincoln
      developed
      a
      phobia.
      He
      couldn't
      beat
      Robert
      Lee.
      He
      was
      going
      crazy.
      I
      don't
      know
      of
      you
      know
      this,
      but
      Robert
      Lee
      was
      winning
      battle
      after
      battle
      after
      battle
      and
      Abraham
      Lincoln
      came
      army
      said
      I
      can't
      beat
      Robert
      Eily
      and
      he
      had
      all
      of
      these
      generals...They
      looked
      great,
      They
      were
      the
      top
      of
      their
      class
      at
      West
      Point.
      They
      were
      the
      greatest
      people,
      There's
      only
      one
      problem,
      They
      didn't
      know
      how
      to
      hell
      to
      win
      they
      didn't
      know
      how
      to
      fight
      They
      didn't
      know
      how,
      and
      one
      day
      It
      was
      looking
      really
      bad
      and
      Lincoln
      just
      said...you
      hardly
      knew
      his
      name
      and
      they
      said
      don't
      take
      him..
      He's
      got
      a
      drinking
      problem
      and
      Lincoln
      said
      I
      don't
      care
      what
      problem
      he
      has,
      you
      guys
      aren't
      winning...
      and
      his
      name
      was
      Grant,
      General
      Grant.
      and
      he
      went
      in
      and
      he
      knocked
      the
      hell
      out
      of
      everyone,
      and
      you
      know
      the
      story.
      They
      said
      to
      Lincoln.
      You
      cant
      use
      him
      any
      more
      He's
      An
      alcoholic
      and
      Lincoln
      said
      I
      don't
      care.
      If
      he's
      an
      alcoholic
      frankly
      Give
      me
      six
      or
      seven
      more,
      just
      like
      that
      he
      started
      to
      win.
      Grant
      really.
      Did
      he
      have
      a
      serious
      problem,
      a
      serious
      drinking
      problem,
      But
      man
      was
      he
      a
      good
      general
      and
      he's
      finally
      being
      recognized
      as
      a
      great
      general,
      But
      Lincoln
      had
      Almost
      developed
      a
      phobia
      because
      he
      was
      having
      a
      hard
      time
      With
      A
      true
      great
      fighter
      and
      a
      great
      general
      Robert
      Lee,
      But
      Grant
      figured
      it
      out
      and
      Grant
      is
      a
      great
      general
      and
      Grant
      came
      from
      right
      here
      Says:
      Ohio
      is
      the
      state
      that
      gave
      us
      the
      Wright
      brothers.

      Good
      explanation
      of
      how
      garnering
      more
      votes
      in
      a
      national
      election
      that
      is
      based
      upon
      an
      electoral
      system
      provides
      correlation
      for
      a
      midterm
      election
      that
      will
      be
      won
      on
      a
      a
      local
      level.
      It
      is
      much
      more
      apparent
      after
      reading
      your
      witty
      response.

      That
      wasn #8217;t
      a
      pickpocket.
      Those
      were
      obviously
      two
      secret
      agents.
      The
      first
      had
      an
      instantaneous
      mirroring
      device
      that
      only
      works
      upon
      contact
      in
      his
      pocket,
      downloaded
      the
      secret
      codes,
      with
      the
      seated
      agent
      tossing
      it
      back
      once
      complete.
      I
      remember
      we
      ran
      the
      same
      caper
      in
      Prague
      back
      in
       #8216;09
      but
      we
      had
      to
      switch
      out
      the
      track
      balls
      on
      the
      targets
      blackberry
      pearl.

      My
      favorite
      breakfast.
      I
      order
      it
      practically
      every
      time
      I
      go
      out
      for
      breakfast
      even
      though
      I
      know
      I
      will
      be
      disappointed
      80%

      the

      rather

      Top
      20%
      is
      considered
      rich?
      To
      be
      in
      the
      top
      20%
      of
      income
      earners
      in
      the
      US
      you
      only
      need
      to
      make
      a
      bit
      more
      than
      $70k.
      Hell,
      the
      top
      10%
      barely
      clear
      $100k.
      If
      you
      consider
      either
      of
      those
      rich,
      you
      may
      want
      to
      consider
      setting
      your
      goals
      a
      little
      higher.
      And
      what
      is
      a
       #8220;fair
      share #8221;?
      The
      income
      tax
      system
      is
      already
      progressive...that
      top
      20%
      already
      hands
      over
      a
      higher
      percentage
      of
      their
      income
      to
      the
      government.
      How
      much
      more
      of
      their
      income
      do
      you
      feel
      should
      be
      confiscated
      in
      order
      for
      it
      to
      be
       #8220;fair #8221;?
      The
      top
      25%
      pay
      approximately
      87%
      of
      all
      income
      tax
      while
      earning
      only
      68%
      of
      the
      income...the
      top
      10%
      pay
      70%
      while
      only
      earning
      47%.
      And
      those
      greedy
      1%ers
      pay
      40%
      of
      all
      income
      taxes
      while
      earning
      20%
      of
      income.
      What
      is
      your
      version
      of
      fair?
      You #8217;re
      correct...the
      16th
      amendment
      allows
      for
      income
      tax.
      My
      question
      to
      you
      was
      meant
      to
      ask
      you
      to
      provide
      a
      reason
      why
      you
      felt
      a
      specific
      number
      suddenly
      made
      someone
      rich,
      and
      further,
      why
      you
      feel
      they
      should
      be
      forced
      to
      forego
      the
      fruits
      of
      their
      labor
      at
      some
      metric
      you
      deem
       #8220;fair #8221;?

      You
      said
      you
      were
      for
      raising
      taxes
      on
      the
      wealthy.
      You
      were
      then
      asked
      to
      define
      wealthy.
      You
      said
      the
      top
      20%.
      Which,
      to
      me
      at
      least,
      seems
      way
      off
      the
      mark.
      To
      me,
      a
      large
      portion
      of
      that
      group
      is
      solidly
      middle
      class.
      And
      I
      said
      nothing
      of
      lowering
      taxes
      on
      the
       #8220;wealthy #8221;...I
      just
      asked
      what
      you
      thought
      a
       #8220;fair
      share #8221;
      should
      be
      for
      those
      wealthy
      people?
      If
      they
      are
      contributing
      twice
      as
      much
      in
      terms
      of
      taxes
      compared
      their
       #8220;share #8221;
      of
      income,
      is
      that
      not
      enough?
      If
      the
      bottom
      44%
      of
      earners
      do
      not
      pay
      any
      federal
      taxes,
      is
      0
      still
      too
      much?
      Do
      you
      feel
      the
      government
      having
      control
      of
      more
      of
      the
      income
      of
      people
      who
      make
      $100k
      is
      going
      to
      enrich
      the
      lives
      and
      provide
      noticeably
      more
      opportunity
      for
      those
      who
      pay
      $0
      currently
      to
      thrive?
      And
      how
      much
      more?

      before
      it #8217;s
      clear

      Maybe

      pay
      into

      Yep...I

      promised
      amounts
      actually

      have
      no

      of
      paying

      that
      they
      have
      promised.
      Illinois,
      for
      example,
      owes
      billlllllllions
      in
      guaranteed
      pension
      payments
      and
      doesn #8217;t
      have
      a

      because
      they
      haven #8217;t
      funded
      it
      properly
      along

      Who
      said
      anything
      about
      separating
      migrant
      children?
      I
      said
      caging...which
      also
      occurred
      under
      the
      Obama
      administration.
      (The
      separation
      started
      occurring
      as
      the
      zero
      tolerance
      policy
      went
      into
      effect
      regarding
      the
      Flores
      decision...2015).
      Further...there
      is
      little
      to
      no
      way
      of
      determining
      someone #8217;s
      criminal
      history
      that
      has
      crossed
      the
      border...illegally...from
      another
      country.
      And
      it
      was
      pretty
      apparent
      that
      your
      ire
      was
      directed
      at
      this
      administration
      with
      little
      to
      no
      regard
      for
      the
      actions
      of
      the
      previous.

      Advocated?
      Not
      really.
      He
      mentioned
      it
      once
      in
      a
      letter
      to
      James
      Madison,
      but
      he
      never
      once
      pushed
      the
      idea
      while
      actually
      in
      the
      federal
      government.
      It #8217;s
      one
      of
      those
      things
      that
      are
      thrown
      around
      like
      his
       #8220;tree
      of
      liberty #8221;
      quote
      that
      are
      nice
      snippets
      but
      don #8217;t
      actually
      provide
      full
      context.
      And
      besides...at
      17
      in
      240
      years
      we
      are
      ahead
      of
      pace.

      Using

      once

      so
      is...advocating.

      a

      however
      is
      a
      bit
      more
      nuanced
      than
      that.
      But
      then,
      you
      surely
      understand
      that

      You
      are
      basing
      it
      on
      your

       #8220;Regular #8221;
      is
      a
      subjective
      term.
      It
      could
      mean
      once
      every
      century.
      Or
      every

      Or
      once
      every
      14
      years
      based
      on
      average.
      In

      you
      just
      remove
      yourself
      from

      pressed
      to
      say
      that
      Jefferson
       #8220;advocated #8221;
      for
      what
      you
      say.
      I #8217;m
      not
      attacking
      you,
      which
      can
      be
      difficult
      to
      discern
      online.
      But,
      truly...try
      to
      look
      at
      it
      objectively.
      He
      didn #8217;t.
      He
      sent
      the
      equivalent
      of
      a
      text
      about
      it
      and
      then..:nothing
      further.
      Ever.
      In
      a
      lifetime
      of
      being
      a
      leader
      of
      a
      historically
      seismic
      movement.
      If
      you
      believe
      that
      is
       #8220;advocacy #8221;,
      from
      one
      of
      history #8217;s
      most
      influential
      thought
      leaders...well
      I
      guess
      there
      isn #8217;t
      really
      any
      room
      for
      even
      the
      most
      basic
      nuance
      in
      your
      world
      and
      thus
      no
      need
      for
      further
      discussion.

      The
      rights
      of
      every
      man
      woman
      and
      child
      have
      always
       #8220;existed #8221;...they
      have,
      however,
      been
      denied
      to
      most
      of
      humanity
      in
      most
      of
      the
      world
      for
      most
      of
      history.
      You
      can
      conflate
      what
      I
      said
      to
      some
      level
      of
       #8220;taking
      them
      for
      granted #8221;
      if
      you
      want,
      but
      you #8217;d
      be
      wrong.
      The
      fact
      that
      I
      said
      they
      were
      free
      means
      I
      believe
      that
      you,
      me,
      and
      everyone
      was
      born
      with
      those
      same
      rights.
      Can
      they
      be
      denied?
      Yes.
      Have
      entire
      generations
      sacrificed
      to
      retain
      them?
      Yes.
      But
      that
      does
      not
      change
      the
      fact
      that
      you
      already
      have
      them.
      Apparently
      you
      think
      those
      rights
      are
      only
      granted
      to
      people
      through
      an
      act
      of
      government.
      I
      don #8217;t.
      In
      fact,
      because
      I
      feel
      quite
      the
      opposite,
      my
      gratitude
      for
      those
      that
      risk
      everything
      to
      enable
      others
      to
      retain
      their
      natural
      born
      rights
      as
      a
      human
      is
      very
      deeply
      felt.

      That #8217;s
      not
      a
      loophole.
      That
      is
      how
      the
      law
      is
      structured.
      The
       #8220;ruling
      majority #8221;
      is
      surely
      just
      as
      aware
      of
      the
      reciprocity
      agreement
      that
      they
      allowed
      to
      be
      entered
      into
      law.
      If
      not...well
      than
      that
      is
      the
      sign
      of
      an
      incompetent
      ruling
      majority.
      Maybe
      they
      should
      be
      voted
      out.
      And
      I
      didn #8217;t
      miss
      the
      listing
      of
      your
      criminal
      fathers
      health
      concerns.
      I
      merely
      viewed
      them
      as
      a
      reason
      he
      should
      have
      access
      to
      the
      ability
      to
      defend
      himself
      rather
      than
      as
      a
      reason
      to
      deny
      him
      that
      ability.
      I
      guess
      it
      would
      just
      be
      better
      that
      he
      remains
      feebly
      defenseless.

      So,
      again...not
      a
      loophole.
      Unless
      you
      think
      the
      governor
      isn #8217;t
      aware
      of
      how
      the
      agreements
      work?
      And
      I
      guess
      I #8217;m
      not
      understanding
      about
      your
      father...why,
      if
      he
      is
      so
      feeble,
      would
      he
      be
      killed
      if
      he
      has
      a
      gun?
      Would
      this
      non
      existent
      mugger
      suddenly
      become
      a
      murderer
      because
      your
      father
      dropped
      his
      gun?
      Weird.
      If
      there
      are
      more
      murderers
      than
      muggers
      walking
      around
      in
      that
      town
      I
      would
      definitely
      want
      to
      at
      least
      give
      an
      incapacitated
      old
      man
      a
      chance
      rather
      than
      leaving
      him
      to
      the
      wolves.

      So
      if,
      as
      according
      to
      you,
      the
      factories
      were

       #8220;below
      minimum
      wage #8221;...why
      would
      they
      suddenly
      start
      shipping
      jobs
      if
      you
       #8220;raised

      rate #8221;?
      Wouldn #8217;t
      they
      just
      continue
      to
      break
      the

      You

      I
      don #8217;t
      understand
      your
      desire
      to
      do
      so.
      Why
      not
      fight
      for
      a
      competitive
      global
      position
      that
      isn #8217;t
      based

      Many
