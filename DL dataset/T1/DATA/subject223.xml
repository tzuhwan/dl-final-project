      How
      are
      people
      transgender?
      Isn #8217;t
      gender
      defined
      by
      society
      and
      it
      isn #8217;t
      really
      a
      thing
      like
      how
      can
      you
      think
      you
      are
      the
      opposite
      sex...
      we
      can
      all
      do
      the
      same
      things
      except
      we
      have
      different
      reproductive
      parts
      so
      can
      only
      reproduce
      with
      the
      opposite
      sex.
      I
      don #8217;t
      mean
      to
      be
      offensive
      if
      I
      am.

      I
      used
      to
      be
      ridiculously
      shy
      like
      I
      would
      hide
      behind
      my
      parents
      when
      meeting
      people
      etc.
      I
      think
      I
      was
      this
      shy
      because
      I
      never
      had
      to
      talk
      to
      people
      due
      to
      having
      3
      older
      brothers
      to
      talk
      to
      but
      as
      I
      got
      older
      they
      left
      home
      so
      I
      had
      to
      become
      less
      shy
      and
      I
      also
      had
      a
      very
      outgoing
      friend
      who
      made
      me
      less
      shy.
      I
      guess
      also
      being
      naturally
      talented
      at
      things
      helped
      too
      because
      I
      could
      do
      things
      rather
      than
      speak
      to
      break
      the
      ice.
      Now
      most
      people
      describe
      me
      as
      a
      loud
      outgoing
      person-
      the
      complete
      opposite
      to
      what
      I
      was

      Okay,
      but
      girls
      can
      take
      off
      their
      shirts
      it #8217;s
      only
      a
      societal
      thing
      that
      stops
      us.
      Surely
      he
      just
      thinks
      he
      fits
      closer

      I
      agree
      but
      some
      people
      cut
      on
      their
      arms
      and
      then
      cover

      by

      Wow!
      Thank
      you
      that
      was
      really
      helpful.
      I
      had
      no
      idea
      people
      born
      without
      limbs
      could
      experience
      phantom
      limb
      syndrome
      I
      always
      thought
      it
      was
      just
      people
      who
      lost
      a
      limb
      in
      an
      accident
      or
      illness.
      Thanks
      again!

      time
      on
      me

      helping

      shaving
      their

      My
      parents
      got
      divorced
      last
      December
      and
      I
      stay
      half
      with
      mum
      half
      with
      dad.
      Tbh
      I
      think
      it #8217;s
      better
      because
      I
      didn #8217;t
      like
      them
      arguing
      all
      the
      time
      and
      now
      I
      have
      2
      houses
      and
      if
      I
      fall
      out
      with
      my
      mum
      I
      can
      stay
      with
      dad
      or
      even
      if
      mum
      says
      I
      can #8217;t
      do
      something
      I
      can
      ask
      dad
      or
      vice
      versa.
      There
      are
      hard
      bits
      like
      when
      your
      parents
      start
      being
      rude
      about
      the
      other
      behind
      their
      back
      but
      you
      have
      to
      tell
      them
      they
      can #8217;t
      do
      that
      in
      front
      of
      you
      because
      it #8217;s
      not
      fair
      on
      you.
      I #8217;m
      sure
      you
      will
      be
      fine,
      good
      luck!

      Saliva
      contains
      the
      amylase
      enzyme
      which
      digests
      starch
      so
      if
      you
      just
      put
      food
      in
      your
      mouth
      or
      lick
      it
      and
      then
      spit
      it
      out
      you
      will
      only
      get
      calories
      from
      starch
      which
      will
      be
      few
      as
      also
      not
      all
      starch
      will
      be
      digested
      in
      the
      mouth.
      +
      you
      will
      only
      get
      the
      calories
      if
      that
      saliva
      is
      swallowed.
      If
      you
      are
      concerned
      about
      how
      many
      calories
      you
      are
      eating,
      however,
      you
      should
      seek
      help
      because
      you
      probably
      have
      an
      eating
      disorder
      and
      they
      suck
      so
      please
      tell
      someone
      you
      trust.

      If

      then
      the

      decreases.
      This

      because
      everyone
      will
      have

      this

      I
      stoped
      learning
      history
      3
      years
      ago
      but
      I
      believe
      the
      german
      money
      crisis
      occurred
      as
      the
      government
      printed
      a
      lot
      more
      money
      and
      so
      prices
      rose
      rapidly.
      In
      order
      to
      buy
      even
      a
      loaf
      of
      bread
      people
      would
      have
      to
      carry
      hundreds
      of
      notes
      as
      the
      money
      became
      worth
      so
      little.
      This
      meant
      people
      would
      have
      to
      bring
      their
      money
      to
      shops
      in
      wheelbarrows
      and
      children
      even
      played
      with
      money
      as
      it
      was
      worth
      so
      little,
      less
      than
      toys!

      we
      play
      within
      an
      area
      which
      gets

       #8216;fish

      of
      water #8217;
      they
      become
       #8216;on #8217;.
      Additionally
      we
      have
      painted
      a
      pair
      of
      Google #8217;s
      black
      to
      avoid
      anyone
      cheating
      but
      placing
      leaves
      in
      the
      goggles
      works
      too.

      tell

      Well
      no,
      humans
      can
      travel
      the
      world,
      eat
      when
      they
      want
      etc.
      Dogs
      can
      only
      eat
      when
      fed,
      go
      on
      walks
      when
      walked.
      They
      certainly
      cannot
      do
      what
      the
      want

      I
      didn #8217;t
      actually
      bite
      them
      I
      would
      slide

      I
      agree,
      it
      is
      odd
      he
      wanted
      to
      go
      on
      the
      show
      considering
      he
      doesn #8217;t
      seem
      to
      like
      the
      spotlight
      which
      is
      what
      you
      get
      it
      you
      go
      on
      love
      island
      because
      you
      get
      famous.
      Having
      said
      that,
      though,
      now
      he
      is
      on
      the
      show
      I
      don #8217;t
      want
      him
      to
      be
      treated
      badly
      because
      he
      is
      a
      human
      too
      and
      I
      thought
      it
      was
      just
      rude
      when
      Hayley
      didn #8217;t
      kiss
      him
      since
      she
      would
      have
      kissed
      anyone
      else
      and
      knew
      he
      was
      not
      feeling
      very
      happy
      after
      no
      one
      having
      stepped
      forward
      for
      him
      the
      day
      before.
      Basically,
      I
      want
      him
      off
      the
      show
      but
      not
      first
      because
      he
      is
      a
      better
      human
      than
      most
      of

      Honestly,
      I
      think
      it
      would
      depend
      on
      them.
      They
      could
      rock
      being
      called
      crocodile
      and
      everyone
      would
      love
      them
      or
      if
      they
      were
      shy
      they
      could
      be
      bullied,
      but
      if
      someone
      is
      going
      to
      be
      bullied
      there
      will
      always
      be
      a
      reason
      a
      bully
      will
      find
      and
      honestly
      I
      would

      to

      Wtf
      is
      wrong
      with
      you?
      People
      who
      have
      been
      raped
      will
      see
      this.
      It #8217;s
      just
      rude,
      disrespectful
      and
      damaging.
      I
      have
      no
      idea
      what #8217;s
      wrong
      with
      your
      life
      but
      go
      fix
      that
      before
      asking
      ridiculous
      questions
      you
      know

      When
      you
      are
      dehydrated
      your
      body
      releases
      ADH
      which
      causes
      more
      water
      to
      re-enter
      the
      blood
      rather
      than
      leave
      in
      your
      pee.
      So
      yes
      when
      you
      are
      more
      hydrated
      you
      have
      more
      water
      in
      your
      pee
      so
      urea
      and
      other
      bits
      will
      be
      more
      dilute
      and
      so
      it
      will
      taste
      less
      strong
      and
      be
      better
      for

      Was
      kayaking
      in
      Indonesia
      and
      I
      saw
      a
      huge
      wage
      coming
      and
      the
      kayak
      was
      horizontal
      to
      the
      wave
      and
      I
      couldn #8217;t
      turn
      it
      fast
      enough
      so
      I
      knew
      I
      had
      to
      get
      off
      the
      kayak.
      Obviously,
      me
      being
      me,
      jumped
      off
      on
      the
      beach
      side
      so
      when
      the
      wave
      picked
      up
      the
      kayak
      it
      took
      me
      too
      and
      the
      next
      thing
      I
      knew
      my
      head
      was
      in
      sand
      and
      someone
      was
      removing
      a
      kayak
      from
      on
      top
      of
      me
      and
      telling
      me
      I
      had
      been
      unconscious
      for
      2ish
      minutes.
      I
      had
      to
      go
      to
      hospital
      because
      of
      the
      water

      Also,
      I
      don #8217;t
      know
      about
      everyone
      who
      self
      harms
      but
      when
      I
      did
      I
      had
      urges
      to
      do
      it
      which
      could
      consume
      my
      thought
      processes
      for
      hours
      and
      would
      tire
      me
      out
      trying
      to
      fight
      because
      I
      didn #8217;t
      want
      to
      self
      harm
      it
      was
      just
      something
      my
      brain
      told
      me
      to
      do.
      So
      I
      guess
      that #8217;s
      bad
      for
      your
      health
      too
      because
      you
      are
      preoccupied
      thinking
      about
      it

      Yeah
      but
      superficial
      is
      a
      word
      and
      so
      it #8217;s
      very
      specific
      and
      is
      not
      too
      likely
      to
      come
      up
      in
      conversations
      but
      brexit.
      BREXIT!
      The
      thing
      all
      the
      news
      channels
      have
      talked
      about,
      what
      the
      uk
      population
      voted
      for
      (I
      believe
      she
      is
      a
      uk
      citizen
      able
      to
      vote)
      how
      could
      no
      one
      have
      brought
      it
      up
      in

      Gender
      dysphoria
      is
      like
      body
      dysmorphia
      in
      many
      ways
      I
      think.
      Someone
      with
      body
      dysmorphia
      isn #8217;t
      fat
      but
      they
      think
      they
      are
      and
      as
      a
      result
      will
      starve
      themselves.
      As
      this
      is
      dangerous
      because
      they
      may
      die,
      we
      don #8217;t
      allow
      this
      as
      a
      society
      and
      these
      people
      need
      to
      be
      treated,
      yet
      in
      most
      cases
      they
      will
      never
      lose
      their
      body
      dysmorphia.
      They
      will
      always
      think
      they
      are
      fat
      but
      will
      learn
      that
      they
      have
      to
      trust
      those
      around
      them
      and
      live
      in
      their
      body
      which
      they
      perceive
      to
      be
      fat.
      Gender
      dysphoria
      is
      the
      same.
      Let #8217;s
      take
      a
      biological
      female
      who
      wants
      to
      be
      a
      male.
      They
      see
      themselves
      as
      a
      male
      in
      the
      same
      way
      someone
      with
      gender
      dysphoria
      sees
      themselves
      as
      fat,
      but
      because
      it
      is
      safe
      to
      do
      so
      we
      allow
      them
      to
      transition.
      Gender
      dysphoria
      is
      a
      mental
      illness
      which
      is
      why
      it #8217;s
      hard
      for
      those
      without
      it
      to
      understand
      like
      it #8217;s
      hard
      for
      us
      to
      understand
      why
      someone
      with
      body
      dysmorphia
      can
      see
      themselves
      as
      fat
      when
      bones
      are
      clearly
      visible.

      It
      portrays
      an
      element
      of
      confusion
      or
      not
      knowing.
      It
      doesn #8217;t
      work
      on
      its
      own
      in
      most
      cases
      there
      must
      be
      a
      sentence
      before
      hand,
      but
      it #8217;s
      used
      to
      say
      this
      is
      what
      I
      think
      although
      I #8217;m
      not
      certain,
      do
      you
      think
      it #8217;s
      right?
      In
      your
      example
      the
      person
      believes
      that
      the
      bleach
      is
      what
      caused
      the
      problem
      but
      is
      unsure
      and
      open
      for
      other
      people
      to
      correct
      them.
      Additionally,
      I
      think
      it
      stems
      from
      other
      languages
      where
      instead
      of
      rearranging
      the
      word
      order
      you
      can
      just
      raise
      your
      voice
      at
      the
      end
      of
      a
      sentence
      to
      make
      it
      a
      question
      eg,
      to
      say
       #8216;do
      you
      have
      an
      apple #8217;
      in
      French
      one
      can
      say:
       #8216;vous
      avez
      une
      pomme? #8217;
      Which
      literally
      means
       #8216;you
      have
      an
      apple? #8217;
      Exactly
      how
      some
      people
      use
      it
      in
      English

      I
      disagree.
      I
      think
      neither
      of
      them
      should
      be
      kissing
      Megan
      to
      try
      get
      her
      to
      choose
      them
      because
      if
      they
      are
      really
      looking
      for
      love
      and
      a
      long
      term
      relationship
      they
      need
      to
      know
      each
      other
      better
      first.
      If
      it
      were
      them
      looking
      for
      a
      3
      week
      long
      romance
      then
      fair
      enough
      Alex
      should
      have
      gone
      for
      it
      but
      Alex
      wants
      a
      long
      term
      relationship
      and
      kissing
      is
      not

      not

      It
      is
      totally
      not
      normal.
      A
      normal
      person
      might
      ask
      you
      why
      you
      are
      alone
      or
      how
      are
      you?
      Or
      something
      basic
      like
      that
      not
      have
      a
      full
      in
      depth
      conversation.
      That #8217;s
      just
      weird.
      I #8217;m
      quite
      a
      paranoid
      person
      especially
      when
      it
      comes
      to
      kidnapping
      or
      rape
      and
      if
      I
      were
      in
      that
      situation
      I
      would
      have
      immediately
      left.
      Tried
      to
      take
      a
      pic
      of
      the
      person
      without
      them
      noticing
      and
      gone
      to
      find
      a
      responsible
      looking
      adult
      (probably
      a
      mother
      with
      kids)
      and
      then
      called
      the
      police
      non
      emergency
      line
      and
      given
      them
      the
      pic.
      However,
      in
      a
      well
      lit
      place
      like
      a
      shopping
      centre
      no
      one
      can
      do
      anything
      to
      you
      because
      if
      you
      just
      shout
      for
      help
      someone
      will
      come
      so
      you
      were
      safe.
      Just
      make
      sure
      never
      to
      give
      someone
      contact
      details
      or
      leave
      a
      safe
      place
      with
      someone
      you
      don #8217;t

      spoken
      to
      Niall
      or
      anyone
      in
      his
      family.
      All
      they
      know
      is
      the
      two
      statements
      ITV
      have
      released
      one
      saying
      he
      left
      for
      personal
      reasons
      and
      one
      saying
      he
      left
      for
      health
      reasons.
      Health
      reasons
      does,
      of
      course,
      suggest
      he
      may
      have
      been
      struggling
      with
      his
      mental
      health.
      That
      being
      said,
      the
      article
      writer
      has
      no
      right
      to
      say
      it
      is
      because
      of
      his
      ears.
      Just
      because
      he
      struggled
      with
      that
      in
      the
      past
      doesn #8217;t
      mean
      that
      is
      the
      only
      thing
      or
      the
      thing
      causing
      him
      to
      leave
      love
      island.
      In
      terms
      of
      the
      stigma
      with
      men #8217;s
      mental
      health
      I
      agree
      that
      the
      contestants
      on
      the
      show
      do
      internalise
      their
      feelings
      rather
      than
      showing
      them
      to
      the
      group,
      which
      can
      lead
      to
      mental
      health
      issues,
      but
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      that
      is
      just
      the
      men
      at
      all.
      When
      Georgia
      was
      asked
      how
      she
      felt
      about
      Niall
      going
      on
      a
      date
      she
      said
      she
      was
      fine
      or
      something
      and
      then
      to
      the
      camera
      in
      the
      beach
      but
      she
      said
       #8220;fuming,
      absolutely
      fuming.
      No
      one
      takes
      my
      man
      away #8221;
      which
      is
      the
      same
      internalising
      the
      boys
      have
      done.
      I
      am
      not
      denying
      the
      stigma
      around
      men #8217;s
      mental
      health
      but
      I
      believe
      it
      is
      a
      stigma
      around
      mental
      health.
      Not
      just
      around
      men #8217;s

      First
      of
      all
      you
      need
      to
      realise
      this
      is
      correlation,
      which
      does
      not
      necessarily
      mean
      causation,
      but
      here
      are
      my
      theories:
      Golfers
      are
      much
      more
      sedentary.
      They
      like
      a
      nice
      slow
      game
      and
      are
      most
      likely
      not
      adrenaline
      junkies.
      Committing
      crime
      is
      associated
      with
      those
      who
      love
      adrenaline
      rushes.
      Many
      crimes
      require
      people
      who
      are
      physically
      able
      and
      quick
      on
      their
      feet
      in
      order
      to
      run
      away.
      This
      is
      a
      talent
      most
      basketball
      players
      will
      have
      but
      not
      most
      golfers

      In
      England
      buses
      are
      not
      allowed
      on
      fast
      roads
      like
      motorways
      and
      so
      any
      collision
      will
      be
      out
      a
      lower
      speed
      thus
      reducing
      impact.
      Additionally
      buses
      have
      a
      higher
      mass
      than
      most
      other
      cars
      and
      thus
      they
      feel
      a
      smaller
      force
      when
      involved
      in
      collisions.
      The
      third
      reason
      is
      just
      that
      if
      buses
      needed
      seatbelts
      everyone
      would
      have
      to
      sit
      down
      so
      less
      people
      could
      fit
      on
      the
      bus
      which
      means
      they
      would
      need
      more
      buses
      and
      also
      when
      you
      reach
      your
      stop
      you
      would
      have
      to
      undo
      your
      seatbelt
      then
      get
      off
      the
      bus

      My
      friend #8217;s
      twin
      sister
      (aged
      15)
      died
      two
      weeks
      ago
      of
      a
      rare
      disease
      and
      she
      copes
      mainly
      through
      the
      support
      of
      everyone
      else.
      Of
      course
      she
      died
      in
      a
      different
      way
      and
      before
      the
      final
      operation
      which
      she
      was
      unlikely
      to
      survive
      (and
      unfortunately
      didn #8217;t)
      everyone
      did
      say
      their
      goodbyes
      so
      it
      is
      different.
      She
      says
      being
      unable
      to
      call
      herself
      a
      twin
      or
      able
      to
      say
      she
      is
      a
      twin
      but
      her
      twin
      is
      no
      longer
      here
      is
      the
      hardest
      thing
      because
      being
      a
      twin
      is
      special
      and
      separated
      you
      from
      the
      crowd.
      She
      keeps
      a
      diary
      sort
      of
      thing
      where
      she
      writes
      down
      how
      she
      feels
      which
      helps
      her
      cope
      too.
      Additionally,
      I
      was
      a
      twin
      but
      my
      twin
      had
      a
      still
      birth
      so
      I
      never
      knew
      until
      I
      was
      about
      6yo
      but
      since
      then
      I
      have
      always
      felt
      partially
      responsible
      because
      I
      must
      have
      killed
      her
      in
      the
      womb
      or
      something
      but
      you
      need
      to
      learn
      it #8217;s
      not
      your
      fault
      and
      it
      will
      take
      time
      but
      you
      will
      be
      able
      to
      move
      on.
      I
      hope
      you
      are
      okay
      and
      good
      luck!

      I
      really
      respect
      him
      for
      coming
      out
      with
      that
      but
      I
      don #8217;t
      entirely
      see
      why
      it
      caused
      him
      to
      leave
      the
      villa.
      Yes
      it
      makes
      social
      interactions
      harder
      but
      that #8217;s
      what
      he
      would
      have
      had
      all
      his
      life
      and
      so
      he
      would
      have
      known
      that.
      I #8217;m
      not
      very
      well
      informed
      about
      Asperger

      I
      used
      to
      shower
      every
      other
      day
      or
      even
      leave
      it
      2
      days
      before
      showering
      on
      the
      third
      day.
      Every
      time
      I
      showered
      I
      washed
      my
      hair.
      I
      mainly
      didn #8217;t
      shower
      often
      as
      I
      was
      too
      busy
      or
      because
      I
      HATE
      morning
      showers
      so
      if
      I
      get
      back
      late
      I
      won #8217;t
      shower
      because
      I
      need
      to
      sleep.
      My
      friends
      and
      brother
      told
      me
      it
      was
      gross
      not
      to
      shower
      everyday
      and
      so
      I
      have
      started
      showering
      everyday
      missing
      normally
      1
      day
      a
      week,
      but
      I
      leave
      the
      house
      everyday.
      If
      I
      am
      not
      going
      to
      leave
      the
      house
      I
      won #8217;t
      shower
      the
      night
      before.

      She
      started
      mixing
      with
      a
      bad
      circle.
      Taking
      drugs,
      getting
      drunk
      out
      of
      her
      mind
      whilst
      also
      treating
      all
      her
      real
      friends
      disrespectfully.
      I
      didn #8217;t
      want
      to
      follow
      her
      down
      that
      path.
      In
      retrospect
      we
      were
      completely
      different
      people
      and
      would
      have
      stoped
      being
      friends
      one
      day.

      Surely,
      if
      people
      were
      kicked
      off
      that
      would
      have
      happened
      today
      and
      they
      can #8217;t
      go
      on
      a
      plane
      until
      after
      the
      episode
      has
      aired
      otherwise
      people
      can
      see
      them
      and
      reveal
      to
      the
      public.
      Therefore
      they
      wouldn #8217;t
      be
      there
      for
      aftersun.
      In
      which
      case
      there
      is
      no
      reason
      for
      it
      to
      be
      tonight.
      I
      think
      they
      will
      end
      it
      on
      a
      cliff
      hanger
      of
      a
      recoupling.

      I #8217;m
      not
      too
      sure
      either
      but
      I
      think
      it #8217;s
      something
      like
      you
      can
      feel
      strongly
      like
      a
      gender
      or
      less
      strongly
      and
      so
      that
      creates
      a
      spectrum.
      For
      me,
      female,
      I
      don #8217;t
      have
      much
      concept
      of
      gender.
      I
      am
      female
      and
      have
      always
      been
      female
      but
      I
      wouldn #8217;t
      mind
      being
      male
      and
      don #8217;t
      feel
      a
      strong
      sense
      of
      attatchment
      to
      being
      female
      and
      thus
      are
      on
      a
      different
      end
      of
      the
      spectrum
      to
      someone
      who
      is
      also
      female
      but
      feels
      they
      could
      not
      be
      male
      and
      feels
      strongly
      female.

      I
      played
       #8216;don #8217;t
      touch
      the
      floor #8217;
      same
      game
      but
      I
      guess
      me
      and
      my
      bro
      weren #8217;t
      very
      good
      at
      thinking
      of
      names.
      As
      to
      why
      it #8217;s
      played,
      I
      think
      me
      and
      my
      bro
      would
      play
      it
      when
      we
      start
      playing
      catch
      and
      then
      someone
      doesn #8217;t
      catch
      the
      ball
      so
      it
      is
      elsewhere
      in
      the
      room.
      We
      are
      lazy
      and
      so
      don #8217;t
      walk
      and
      pick
      it
      up.
      Instead
      we
      throw
      things
      at
      it
      hoping
      it
      comes
      back
      if
      not
      we
      would
      slide
      on
      our
      chairs
      or
      something
      else
      to
      get
      it
      but
      avoid
      touching
      the
      floor.
      It #8217;s
      like
      avoiding
      door
      handles,
      it #8217;s
      inevitable
      we
      will
      all
      do
      it
      one
      day

      Being
      slim
      isn #8217;t
      what
      is
      good
      for
      you.
      It #8217;s
      eating
      a
      balanced
      diet
      and
      having
      nothing
      in
      excess
      which
      results
      in
      one
      being
      slim.
      One
      can
      be
      slim
      and
      still
      eat
       #8216;unhealthy
      foods #8217;
      and
      that
      is
      not
      healthy
      as
      they
      will
      still
      have
      high
      cholesterol
      and
      other
      problems.
      Additionally,
      being
      slim
      through
      diet
      and
      exercise
      is
      what
      is
      good
      for
      you.
      Being
      slim
      because
      you
      take
      pills
      or
      whatever
      IS
      NOT
      GOOD
      FOR
      YOU.
      My
      brother #8217;s
      friend
      died
      from
      a
      weight
      loss
      pill
      and
      obviously
      that
      wouldn #8217;t
      be
      the
      ones
      they
      advertise
      but
      that #8217;s
      against
      the
      point.
      Bringing
      to
      light
      that
      these
      exist
      is
      the
      problem.
      One
      of
      my
      best
      friends
      has
      an
      eating
      disorder.
      She
      is
      slim.
      She
      is
      NOT
      healthy.
      Also
      health
      isn #8217;t
      only
      physical,
      I
      always
      the
      think
      the
      best
      test
      of
      one #8217;s
      health
      is
      if
      they
      are
      happy.
      Mental
      health
      is
      important
      too
      :)

      Please
      read
      all
      of
      this.
      You
      are
      correct,
      we
      are
      an
      obese
      nation,
      but
      do
      you
      know
      why
      obesity
      is
      a
      problem?
      The
      physical
      size
      of
      an
      obese
      person
      is
      not
      the
      problem.
      The
      problem
      is
      that
      they
      have
      high
      cholesterol,
      low
      self
      esteem
      (of
      course
      not
      in
      all
      cases)
      and
      other
      health
      problems.
      I
      agree
      to
      some
      extent
      that
      extra
      weight
      may
      be
      problematic
      but
      that
      is
      not
      the
      main
      issue.
      Weight
      loss
      pills
      don #8217;t
      make
      anyone
      any
      more
      healthy.
      They
      do
      not
      reduce
      cholesterol
      levels,
      in
      fact
      in
      most
      cases
      they
      increase
      them
      as
      weight
      loss
      pills
      leave
      people
      feeling
      more
      hungry
      causing
      more
      eating.
      Despite
      what
      you
      may
      think
      immediately,
      weight
      loss
      pills
      also
      do
      not
      improve
      self
      esteem.
      Once
      comments
      start
      rolling
      in
      saying
      how
      good
      you
      look
      now
      people
      tend
      to
      become
      more
      self
      conscious
      as
      people
      are
      focussing
      on
      their
      appearance
      more.
      Additionally,
      people
      think
      appearance
      is
      more
      important
      than
      their
      true
      self.
      If
      we
      want
      to
      reduce
      the
      obesity
      rates
      why
      not
      start
      advertising
      a
      fitness
      class
      or
      a
      healthy
      alternative
      snack
      idea
      not
      something
      that
      is
      unhealthy,
      unnecessary
      and
      overall
      bad.
      My
      brother #8217;s
      friend
      died
      from
      a
      weight
      loss
      pill
      and
      it
      was
      adverts
      like
      these
      that
      told
      him
      they
      exist
      and
      he
      should
      take
      them.
      He
      wasn #8217;t
      obese
      or
      even
      remotely
      fat,
      we
      must
      remember
      everyone
      watches
      the
      same
      adverts.
      My
      friend
      has
      an
      eating
      disorder
      and
      stays
      3
      nights
      a
      week
      in
      a
      clinic.
      They
      all
      watch
      love
      island
      and
      have
      discussions
      about
      it
      in
      therapy
      but
      they
      can #8217;t
      watch
      the
      adverts
      because
      imagine
      what
      that
      could
      do
      to
      them!
      Think
      about
      all
      viewers
      before
      advertising!
      Also
      don #8217;t
      make
      comments
      that
      are
      over
      generalised.

      Personally,
      I
      believe
      that
      since
      sexuality
      is
      fluid
      we
      are
      born
      asexual
      since
      we
      have
      no
      sexual
      desires
      to
      anyone.
      If
      you
      start
      feeling
      sexual
      attraction
      to
      anyone
      then
      you
      are
      no
      longer
      asexual.
      As
      to
      how
      you
      know
      if
      you
      have
      sexual
      attraction
      to
      someone,
      I
      guess
      you
      never
      really
      know
      because
      it #8217;s
      different
      for
      everyone
      and
      a
      strange
      concept
      to
      get
      your
      head
      around.

      Omg
      you
      made
      me
      cry.
      My
      parents
      married
      but
      were
      never
      really
      in
      love
      either.
      They
      started
      arguing
      4
      or
      5
      years
      ago,
      quite
      aggressively.
      No
      one
      ever
      took
      the
      anger
      out
      on
      us
      kids
      but
      they
      would
      shout
      st
      dinner
      and
      I
      always
      just
      said
      why
      don #8217;t
      you
      get
      a
      divorce
      then.
      In
      December
      they
      sat
      us
      (the
      kids)
      down
      and
      said
      they
      were
      getting
      divorced.
      I
      was
      sad
      at
      first
      in
      a
      weird
      way
      coz
      I
      needed
      it
      but
      I
      love
      my
      two
      parents
      separately
      now
      and
      I
      love
      them
      so
      much
      more

      Let
      her
      know
      you #8217;ve
      noticed
      them.
      Tell
      her
      you
      care-
      that
      is
      the
      most
      important
      thing.
      Personally,
      I
      wouldn #8217;t
      phone
      the
      parents
      especially
      if
      you
      have
      been
      told
      they
      don #8217;t
      believe
      in
      therapy
      because
      the
      child
      may
      not
      want
      them
      knowing
      and
      in
      some
      cases
      it
      might
      be
      better
      if
      they
      don #8217;t
      know.
      Try
      get
      the
      child
      to
      open
      up
      to
      you
      and
      talk
      things
      out.
      I
      self
      harmed
      from
      the
      age
      of
      about
      13-15
      and
      age
      14
      one
      of
      my
      teachers
      saw
      my
      cuts
      and
      asked
      if
      I
      was
      okay
      I
      said
      yeah
      because
      I
      didn #8217;t
      want
      to
      talk
      about
      it
      or
      couldn #8217;t
      talk
      about
      it
      because
      this
      was
      during
      a
      lesson
      (not
      obviously
      to
      everyone
      else
      but
      I
      still
      couldn #8217;t
      say
      stuff).
      When
      I
      got
      home
      I
      found
      out
      he
      had
      called
      my
      mum.
      It
      pissed
      me
      off
      at
      first
      because
      part
      of
      the
      reason
      I
      self
      harmed
      was
      because
      of
      my
      parents
      divorce
      so
      I
      can #8217;t
      really
      say
      that
      to
      my
      mum
      but
      I
      convinced
      my
      mum
      that
      it #8217;s
      okay
      and
      I
      talk
      to
      my
      friends
      about
      it.
      After
      it
      had
      died
      down
      I
      realised
      that
      teacher
      cared
      and
      now
      I
      am
      so
      thankful
      to
      him
      for
      showing
      me
      that.
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      he
      did
      the
      right
      thing
      but
      at
      least
      I
      knew
      someone
      cared.

      Commenting
      because
      I
      have
      the
      same
      problem.
      My
      parents
      wanted
      a
      girl
      and
      after
      3
      boys
      they
      got
      me.
      They
      divorced
      late
      last
      year.
      I
      am
      fine
      with
      my
      dad
      but
      when
      my
      mum
      talks
      to
      me
      I

      don #8217;t

      Once
      they
      were
      off
      they
      felt
      slimy
      and
      my
      teeth
      looked
      weird
      because
      i
      wasn #8217;t
      used
      to
      it.
      Now
      they
      look
      awesome
      and
      I #8217;m

      I
      had

      The

      may
      be
      innocent
      people
      but
      there
      will
      be
      very
      few
      and
      so
      yes
      I
      feel
      bad
      for
      them
      but
      equally
      when
      they
      get
      out
      they
      may
      develop
      mental
      health
      problems
      from
      havin
      been
      locked
      up
      making
      them
      a
      burden
      to
      society...
      I #8217;m
      pretty
      sure
      I
      sound
      like
      the
      most
      horrible
      person
      ever
      but
      this
      is
      what
      I
      would
      do
      in
      this
      situation

      Are
      you
      talking
      about
      how
      many
      calories
      by

      that

      In
      a
      german
      lesson
      I
      interrupted
      the
      teacher
      when
      he
      was
      talking
      to
      the
      class.
      At
      the
      end
      of
      the
      lesson
      he
      told
      me
      to
      stay
      behind.
      Instead
      of
      telling
      me
      off
      the
      way
      normal
      teachers
      do
      he
      said
      that
      I
      had
      so
      much
      potential
      and
      understood
      why
      I
      called
      out
      but
      that
      I
      shouldn #8217;t
      do
      it.
      Similarly
      with
      my
      physics
      teacher
      she
      kept
      me
      after
      class
      and
      said
      I
      know
      the
      only
      reason
      you
      are
      always
      talking
      is
      because
      you
      find
      it
      easy
      and
      I
      don #8217;t
      mind
      you
      talking
      because
      I
      know
      you
      understand
      but
      you
      can #8217;t
      talk
      to
      yourself
      and
      I
      can #8217;t
      afford
      for
      you
      to
      distract
      another
      pupil.
      Both
      teachers
      made
      me
      feel
      clever
      which
      led
      me
      to
      like
      them
      and
      so
      I
      behaved
      better

      she

      Thank
      you,
      there
      is
      nothing
      wrong
      with
      your
      English
      as
      far
      as
      I
      can
      tell.
      I
      know
      all
      these
      games
      but
      I
      play
      them
      different
      and
      in
      the
      werewolf
      one
      we
      have
      different
      people
      than
      the
      haunter
      and
      little
      girl
      although
      I
      do
      like
      the
      idea
      of
      those.
      It
      is
      more
      when
      it
      is
      just
      me
      and
      one
      friend
      that
      I
      struggle
      with
      though
      to
      be
      honest

      Random
      stuff,
      like
      what
      happened
      during
      the
      day
      of
      stuff
      about
      tv
      shows
      and
      other
      random
      stuff
      but
      what
      I
      like
      about
      school
      is
      there
      are
      restraints
      so
      you
      can #8217;t
      talk
      forever
      because
      you
      have
      a
      lesson
      to
      go
      to
      and
      you
      always
      have
      an
      excuse
      if
      you
      feel
      awkward
      and
      want
      to
      leave
      a
      conversation.
      Also
      at
      school
      we
      (my
      friends
      and
      I)
      always
      have
      a

      eg
      eat
      lunch
      or
      see
      mr
      X
      or
      something
      and
      I
      prefer
      that
      for
      some
      reason

      I

      No,
      because
      I
      don #8217;t
      just
      want
      to
      be
      given
      5
      million
      dollars
      on
      a

      I

      I
      had

      and
      I

      of
      being
      sent
      to
      prison
      for
      5
      years
      is
      worth
      it
      at
      all,
      since
      that
      would
      damage
      mental
      health
      and
      I
      don #8217;t
      know
      the
      rules
      since
      this
      is
      hypothetical
      but
      would
      leave
      you
      with
      a
      criminal
      record
      making
      it
      very
      difficult
      to
      get
      a
      job.
      Rolling
      2-5
      is
      irrelevant
      and
      so
      I
      can #8217;t
      be
      bothered
      to
      roll
      a
      dice

      nothing

      I
      was
      going
      to

      that.
      I
      go

      is

      on

      courts
      with

      and
      well

      My
      twin
      sister
      was
      still
      born
      so
      I
      get
      where
      you
      are
      coming
      from.
      I

      stay

      your
      twin
      died
      but

      guess
      since
      you

      them
      it
      must
      be

      and
      our

      gave

      to
      us
      and
      we

      live
      our
      lives
      as
      best
      we

      Thank
      you
      for
      the
      advice!
      I
      do
      find
      it
      slightly
      easier
      in
      winter
      because
      it
      is
      less
      hot
      so
      I
      can
      go
      rock
      climbing
      and
      shopping
      without
      getting
      all
      hot
      and
      sticky
      which
      I
      absolutely
      hate!
      I
      have
      gone
      on
      a
      few
      dog
      walks
      with
      my
      friends
      because
      we
      all
      have
      dogs
      and
      I
      find
      that
      nice
      because
      I
      know
      that
      afterwards
      we
      need
      to
      go
      to
      our
      separate
      houses
      since
      we
      can #8217;t
      hang
      out
      with
      dogs
      all
      day.
      The
      other
      thing
      is,
      for
      example
      yesterday
      my
      friend
      came
      over
      and
      we
      went
      swimming
      in
      my
      pool
      and
      that
      was
      fine
      but
      then
      afterwards
      we
      kind
      of
      ran
      out
      of
      things
      to
      do
      and
      I
      felt
      like
      if
      I
      were
      her
      I
      would
      have
      said
      oh
      my
      mum
      said
      I
      need
      to
      be
      home
      by
      6
      or
      something
      but
      she
      didn #8217;t
      do
      we
      just
      talked
      about
      nonsense
      and
      played
      on
      our
      phones
      but
      idk
      I
      want
      to
      know
      stuff
      to
      do
      in
      that
      situation

      We
      will
      never
      evolve
      very
      fast
      due
      to
      our
      medical
      technology
      being
      so
      advanced
      that
      natural
      selection
      doesn #8217;t
      really
      apply
      (the
      theory
      that
      species
      adapt
      as
      those
      that
      survive
      longer
      produce
      more
      offspring
      passing
      on
      their
      beneficial
      allele/genes).
      This
      makes
      it
      hard
      for
      us
      to
      evolve
      as
      in
      the
      past
      those
      with
      allergies
      would
      have
      died
      and
      not
      passed
      on
      those
      genes
      but
      now
      they
      will.
      Having
      said
      that,
      potentially
      we
      could
      become
      more
      attractive
      as
      that
      makes
      it
      easier
      to
      find
      a
      mate
      and
      diseases
      that
      kill
      people
      before
      they
      reproduce
      are
      always
      becoming
      decreasingly
      likely,
      however
      they
      mutate
      and
      people
      can
      be
      carriers
      without
      showing
      the
      characteristic

      This
      happened
      to
      my
      brother.
      If
      you
      have
      the
      receipt
      of
      buying
      the
      bike
      (which
      you
      should
      have
      kept)
      you
      can
      go
      with
      the
      receipt
      and
      cut
      the
      lock.
      If
      you
      do
      not
      have
      the
      receipt
      you
      have
      no
      proof
      of
      owning
      the
      bike

      Why
      are
      you
      only
      asking
      ladies?
      I
      think
      euthanasia
      should
      be
      legal
      as
      long
      as
      the
      person
      is
      in
      a
      position
      where
      their
      health
      has
      not
      deteriorated
      so
      much
      that
      they
      may
      not
      be
      able
      to
      give
      consent.
      Having
      said
      that,
      for
      mental
      health
      reasons
      in
      teens
      especially
      they
      should
      not
      just
      be
      allowed
      to
      die
      as
      it
      can
      be
      quite
      spur
      of
      the
      moment.
      Someone
      who
      feels
      suicidal
      but
      has
      nothing
      physically
      wrong
      with
      them
      which
      causes
      pain
      should
      have
      to
      apply
      to
      be
      euthanised
      and
      then
      once
      a
      week
      for
      12
      months
      say
      that
      they
      still
      want
      to
      be
      euthanised.
      If
      they
      do
      that
      they
      can
      because
      they #8217;ve
      wanted
      it
      for
      so
      long
      that
      it #8217;s
      no
      longer
      spur
      of
      the
      moment.
      Obviously
      during
      this
      period
      of
      time
      they
      should
      also
      receive
      therapy.
      Would
      I
      do
      it?
      As
      in
      help
      someone
      die?
      No,
      because
      that
      would
      be
      illeagal

      Personally,
      I #8217;m
      team
      Georgia
      because
      yes
      she
      shouldn #8217;t
      have
      kissed
      jack
      on
      the
      date,
      but
      she
      felt
      s
      connection
      and
      was
      being
      true
      to
      herself.
      The
      fact
      that
      he
      didn #8217;t
      want
      to
      kiss
      her
      I
      honestly
      don #8217;t
      think
      she
      noticed
      so
      she
      doesn #8217;t
      think
      she #8217;s
      lying.
      At
      this
      point
      everyone
      hates
      her
      and
      as
      far
      as
      she
      knows
      it #8217;s
      for
      no
      reason.
      Feeling
      frustrated
      and
      angry
      she
      said
      an
      inappropriate
      comment
      to
      jack:
       #8221;dry
      your
      eyes
      mate #8221;
      but
      that
      is
      far
      less
      bad
      a
      comment
      than
      what
      Laura
      said
      to
      Megan
      and
      Ellie
      said
      to
      Georgia.
      I
      have
      also
      not

      fan
      of

      start.
      I
      have
      always
      felt
      that
      she
      moans
      too
      much
      and
      thinks
      everything
      is
      about
      her,
      eg
      her
      screaming
      out
       #8220;in
      the
      f***ing
      victim
      here #8221;
      after
      having
      said
       #8220;can
      everyone
      just
      stop
      playing
      the
      victim #8221;.
      In
      conclusion
      they
      are
      both
      in
      the
      wrong
      and
      neither
      have
      done
      anything
      wrong
      on
      purpose
      but
      i
      feel
      that
      where
      Laura
      was
      given
      the
      chance
      to
      settle
      things
      (when
      she
      and
      gee
      made
      up)
      she
      went
      and
      undid
      everything
      (going
      nuts
      at
      the
      spa)
      and
      I
      think
      that
      shows
      that
      she
      is
      not
      loyal
      (I
      don #8217;t
      think
      gee
      is
      either
      by
      the
      way
      but
      Laura
      can #8217;t
      use
      that
      as
      an
      argument
      when
      she
      is
      no
      better)

      that
      bad.
      My
      parents
      got
      divorced
      almost
      7
      months
      ago
      and
      it
      really
      isn #8217;t
      terrible.
      I
      get
      two
      houses
      which
      is
      super
      useful
      as
      they
      are
      in
      different
      places
      so
      if
      I #8217;m
      out
      late
      I
      can
      go
      to
      whichever
      one
      is
      closer
      and
      also
      if
      my
      mum
      says
      I
      can #8217;t
      do
      something
      I
      just
      ask
      my
      dad

      I
      would
      first
      talk
      to
      my
      dogs
      and
      have
      a
      nice
      chat
      and
      then
      go
      to
      my
      riding
      stable
      and
      ask
      the
      horses
      how
      they
      feel
      about
      us
      riding
      them.
      Then
      I
      would
      head
      to
      farms
      and
      talk
      to
      the
      cows,
      pigs,
      sheep
      and
      other
      animals
      that
      I
      have
      eaten
      in
      the
      past
      and
      tell
      them
      I #8217;m
      sorry
      and
      that
      I
      will
      fight
      for
      their

      This
      was
      a
      very
      good
      explanation.
      I
      didn #8217;t
      know
      what
      one
      is
      and
      now
      I
      think
      I
      am
      one.
      I
      don #8217;t
      use
      twitter
      and
      would
      never
      write
      a
      comment
      like
      the
      eg

      It #8217;s
      a

      used

      a

      love
      Georgia

      hate
      Laura
      and
      some
      others.
      They

      French
      since
      I

      now

      it
      would
      have
      been
      cooler
      to
      know
      them
      earlier
      and
      would
      have
      made
      me
      more
      fluent.
      Take
      me
      to
      gymnastics
      lessons
      and
      make
      me
      socialise
      more
      rather
      than
      only
      talking

      You
      should
      write
      down
      your
      feelings
      in
      a
      diary
      of
      some
      kind.
      I
      find
      it
      really
      helps
      relax
      when
      you

      write

      you

      focus

      it
      with
      a
      friend
      or
      someone
      you

      tell

      how
      you
      feel
      it
      might
      help.
      I
      hope
      you #8217;re
      okay
      and
      feel
      free
      to

      In
      year
      7
      at
      school
      in
      biology
      we
      were
      learning
      reproduction
      and
      one
      of
      my
      friends
      said
      to
      me
       #8220;do
      you
      dare
      me
      to
      ask
      if
      a
      black
      person
      and
      a
      white
      person
      having
      sex
      makes
      a
      zebra? #8221;
      I
      thought
      it
      was
      hilarious
      and
      told
      him
      too.

      Speaking
      from
      my
      experience
      as
      an
      ex-self
      harmer
      all
      you
      need
      to
      do
      is
      show
      you
      care
      but
      don #8217;t
      tell
      anyone
      else
      you
      know.
      The
      girl
      (I
      assume
      if
      she #8217;s
      like
      me)
      doesn #8217;t
      want
      anyone
      knowing
      but
      now
      you
      know
      you
      can
      write
      her
      a
      note
      but
      make
      sure
      no
      one
      sees
      it
      and
      just
      write
      something
      like
       #8220;hey
      I
      saw
      your
      cuts,
      I
      haven #8217;t
      told
      anyone
      don #8217;t
      worry.
      I
      hope
      you #8217;re
      okay
      and
      I #8217;m
      here
      for
      you
      if
      you
      ever
      need
      to
      talk #8221;
      .
      The
      most
      important
      thing
      is
      to
      show
      you
      care.
      One
      of
      my
      teachers
      saw
      my
      cuts
      and
      did
      a
      similar
      thing
      to
      this
      and
      that
      really
      helped
      me
      on
      my
      way
      to
      recovery.
      Thank
      you
      for
      wanting
      to
      help
      her
      :)

      Personally
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      you
      should
      say
      you
      understand
      how
      she
      feels
      because
      unless
      you
      have
      suffered
      the
      same,
      you
      don #8217;t.
      To
      the
      person
      it
      makes
      them
      feel
      like
      what

      It #8217;s

      cry
      every
      day
      for
      a
      period
      of
      time.
      After

      cry
      for

      it

      Depends
      how
      good
      you
      want
      to
      be.
      If
      you
      want
      to
      be
      able
      to
      pass
      grade
      8
      and
      have
      a
      fair
      amount
      of
      talent
      it
      will
      take
      at
      least
      4
      years
      but
      if
      you
      just
      want
      to
      be
      good
      enough
      to
      play
      a
      nice
      tune
      it
      will
      take
      not
      long
      at
      all.
      It
      also
      depends
      how
      often
      you
      practice,
      how
      hard
      you
      try.
      There
      are
      too
      many
      variables
      for
      me
      to
      answer
      this
      question

      From
      my
      experience,
      those
      type
      of
      people
      (especially
      those
      who
      change
      depending
      on
      who
      they
      are
      with)
      are
      manipulative
      because
      they
      cause
      you
      to
      like
      them
      so
      easily
      and
      then
      they
      turn
      abusive
      and
      EVIL

      Do
      something
      like
      this:
      you
      probably
      have
      something
      really
      valuable
      in
      your
      house
      that
      your
      parents
      would
      kill
      you
      if
      it #8217;s
      broken,
      let #8217;s
      say
      it #8217;s
      a
      vase,
      go
      up
      to
      your
      parents
      and
      say
       #8220;mum,
      dad,
      I
      broke
      something
      and
      I
      don #8217;t
      really
      know
      how
      to
      tell
      you.
      You
      know
      that
      vase
      in
      the
      dining
      room?...
      that #8217;s
      fine
      but
      I
      broke
      my
      laptop
      screen
      and
      it
      needs
      replacing. #8221;
      This
      method
      works
      because
      it
      lets
      your
      parents
      consider
      how
      bad
      the
      situation
      could
      have
      been
      but
      it #8217;s
      not
      and
      it
      also
      often
      gets
      a
      laugh
      when
      they
      realise
      their
      favourite
      ornament
      isn #8217;t
      broken

      I
      think
      children
      should
      dress
      as
      girls
      and
      boys
      as
      we
      do
      traditionally
      but
      if
      the
      girl
      wants
      to
      wear
      more
      typically
      boy
      things
      they
      can
      and
      same
      with
      the
      boy
      except
      I
      would
      discourage
      them
      wearing
      a
      dress
      or
      skirt
      because
      they
      will
      have
      trouble
      socialising.
      For
      toys
      I
      think
      the
      children
      should
      choose
      completely
      because
      studies
      have
      shown
      that
      girls
      are
      often
      worse
      at
      maths
      and
      science
      because
      they
      don #8217;t
      play
      games
      with
      problem
      solving
      or
      do
      science
      experiments,
      however
      they
      are
      better
      at
      languages
      because
      they
      are
      always
      talking
      when
      playing
      mums
      and
      dads
      and
      stuff.
      For
      those
      reasons
      I
      would
      let
      my
      kids
      choose
      what
      to
      play
      with

      I
      went
      on
      2
      runs
      (semi-forced)
      and
      loved
      the

      of
      achievement
      knowing
      I
      had
      done
      it
      and
      so
      I
      carried
      on
      running.
      Also,
      I
      got
      a
      fitness
      tracker
      watch
      which

      When
      I
      was
      13/14
      we
      had
      a
      climbing
      frame
      and
      a
      trampoline
      close(ish)
      to
      each
      other
      and
      we
      used
      to
      jump
      from
      the
      climbing
      frame
      onto
      the
      trampoline.
      My
      brother
      had
      about
      6
      friends
      round
      and
      we
      were
      all
      doing
      it.
      The
      person
      who
      was
      going
      to
      jump
      before
      me
      said
      to
      me
       #8220;what
      happens
      if
      you
      don #8217;t
      make
      it? #8221;
      I
      repied
       #8220;they
      would
      have
      to
      be
      retarded.
      It #8217;s
      so
      easy! #8221;
      Next
      thing
      I
      know
      it #8217;s
      my
      turn
      and
      there #8217;s
      7
      boys
      on
      the
      trampoline
      so
      I
      try
      to
      land
      as
      close
      to
      the
      edge
      of
      the
      trampoline
      as
      possible
      and
      end
      up
      missing
      the
      trampoline
      completely
      hitting
      my
      jaw
      and
      arm
      on
      the
      metal
      bar
      around
      the
      edge
      causing
      a
      dislocated
      jaw
      and
      broken
      arm!

      it,
      it #8217;s
      so
      surreal.
      All
      of
      a
      sudden
      I
      weigh
      nothing
      and
      then
      I
      hear
      the
      chaos
      around
      me

      open

      Probably
      when
      I
      cycled
      home
      and
      heard
      the
      noise
      like
      an
      animal
      was
      hurt
      so
      I
      went
      off
      exploring
      to
      see
      if
      I
      could
      find
      one.
      Couldn #8217;t
      find
      an
      animal
      so
      went
      back
      to
      the
      road
      and
      as
      I
      get
      back
      on
      my
      bike
      a
      car
      slows
      down
      and
      opens
      it #8217;s
      window
      and
      in
      the
      car
      is
      my
      tutor
      and
      my
      maths
      teacher
      and
      they
      say
      are
      you
      okay
      and
      I #8217;m
      like
      yeah
      and
      they #8217;ve
      thought
      I #8217;m

      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      the
      liking
      all
      Dani #8217;s
      pictures
      was
      true.
      They
      were
      liked
      after
      he
      went
      into
      hiding
      so
      presumably
      by
      the
      person/people
      looking
      after
      his
      account
      whilst
      he #8217;s
      gone.
      Also,
      who
      believes
      everything
      they
      read
      especially
      on
      the
      mirror
      or
      the
      sun!
      Saying
      jack
      dragged
      the
      duvet
      outside
      to
      sleep
      rather
      than
      putting
      pillows
      between
      him
      is
      irrelevant.
      I
      would
      do
      the
      same
      as
      him
      but
      also
      why
      is
      it
      relevant
      whether
      he
      dragged
      the
      duvet
      or
      put
      pillows.
      He
      just
      took
      one
      step
      further
      to
      avoid
      being
      seen
      in
      a
      bed
      with
      someone
      other
      than
      Dani.
      Imagine
      if
      they
      had
      done
      the
      postcard
      like
      they
      did
      last
      time
      and
      had
      a
      pic
      of
      him
      in
      bed
      with
      someone
      else.
      He
      wouldn #8217;t
      want
      to
      make
      Dani
      feel
      that

      Probably
      is
      burglary.
      On
      my
      street
      there
      was
      a
      burglary
      and
      on
      the

      one
      could
      see
      people
      leaving
      the
      lights
      off
      but

      Do
      not

      it
      isn #8217;t
      good
      for
      you
      mentally.
      You
      should
      tell
      your
      mum
      or
      if
      you

      you
      can
      tell
      your
      teacher
      or
      dad
      or
      you

      and
      ask
      them
      to
      come
      with
      you
      when
      you
      tell
      someone.
      In
      order
      to
      bring
      it
      up
      you
      could
      either
      just
      start
      saying
      it
      straight
      away
      or
      you
      could
      tell
      it
      in
      a
      text
      or
      a
      letter
      as
      sometimes
      that
      helps.
      Good
      luck!

      I
      live
      in
      the
      UK
      and
      everyone
      I
      know
      except
      people
      with
      perfect
      teeth
      has
      had
      braces.
      I
      had
      mine
      for
      4
      years.
      Some
      people
      even
      get
      them
      when
      their
      teeth
      are
      so
      almost
      straight
      and
      so
      they
      only
      have
      them
      for
      6
      months.
      Maybe
      the
      children
      you
      are
      watching
      on
      documentaries
      are
      younger
      than
      the
      age
      of
      braces
      which
      is
      usually
      between
      12
      and
      18.

      You
      need
      to
      organise
      to
      go
      somewhere
      which
      will
      have
      other
      people.
      You
      could
      go
      on
      a
      holiday
      for
      singles
      where
      people
      mix
      and
      stuff
      or
      you
      could
      do
      something
      like
      a
      tennis
      academy,
      join
      a
      cycling
      group
      or
      anything
      really
      with
      other
      people
      and
      book
      it.
      Once
      you #8217;ve
      booked
      it
      you
      will
      feel
      compelled
      to
      turn
      up
      as
      you #8217;ve
      paid.
      When
      you #8217;re
      there
      you
      don #8217;t
      need
      to
      initiate
      a
      conversation
      if
      you
      don #8217;t
      feel
      comfortable,
      someone
      will
      talk
      to
      you
      or
      if
      they
      don #8217;t
      then
      go
      again
      until
      either
      you
      gain
      the
      confidence
      to
      talk
      to
      them
      or
      they
      talk
      to
      you.
      Doing
      something
      like
      a
      sport
      is
      really
      useful
      as
      well
      because
      it
      gives
      you
      a
      common
      interest
      and
      something
      to
      talk
      about

      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      it #8217;s
      too
      weird.
      When
      I
      was
      11
      (so
      a
      bit
      younger)
      I
      went

      Be
      strict,
      but
      fair.
      Be
      relatable
      to
      the
      students,
      tell
      them
      s
      bit
      of
      background
      about
      you,
      or
      if
      the
      right
      situation
      arises,
      say
      what
      you
      would
      have
      done
      when
      you
      were
      a
      student
      in
      that
      situation
      if
      it #8217;s
      funny.
      Don #8217;t
      just
      start
      picking
      on
      people,
      if
      someone
      doesn #8217;t
      offer
      any
      answers,
      at
      the
      end
      of
      the
      lesson
      say
      to
      them
       #8216;next
      lesson
      if
      you
      don #8217;t
      start

      answers
      I #8217;m
      going
      to
      have
      to
      start
      picking
      on
      you #8217;
      then
      follow
      through,
      it #8217;s
      much
      more
      fair.

      Make
      your
      students
      feel
      good
      by
      going
      above
      and
      beyond.
      For
      example,
      my
      physics
      teacher
      wrote
      a
      note
      in
      my
      book
      saying
       #8220;you
      are
      right
      up
      at
      the
      top
      of
      the
      class.
      It #8217;s
      very
      impressive!
      I
      hope
      you
      keep
      doing
      physics
      for
      a
      level
      and
      beyond... #8221;
      I
      didn #8217;t
      end
      up
      doing
      physics
      a
      level
      but
      her
      comment
      put
      me
      on
      a
      high
      for
      about
      a
      week.
      Also,
      if
      you
      see
      a
      student
      is
      upset
      go
      up
      to
      them
      without
      the
      rest
      of
      the
      class
      noticing
      and
      ask
      them
      if
      they
      are
      okay.
      They
      will
      probably
      just
      say
      yes
      and
      some
      may
      get
      annoyed
      but
      it
      tells
      them
      you
      care
      and
      that
      they
      can
      talk
      to
      you

      From
      my
      personal
      experience,
      I
      would
      say
      you
      should
      cut
      anyone
      out
      your
      life
      if
      you
      think
      you
      should
      and
      then
      6
      months
      later
      you
      still
      think
      you
      should.
      Even
      if
      it #8217;s
      just
      you
      maybe
      should,
      if
      it
      has
      been
      6
      months
      since
      you
      started
      thinking
      this
      then
      you
      need
      to
      cut
      them
      out.
      I
      had
      a
      friend
      who
      after
      3
      years
      of
      abusing
      my
      trust
      and
      our
      friendship
      I
      cut
      out
      my
      life
      and
      that
      was
      the
      best
      decision
      I
      ever
      made!

      I
      had
      this
      at
      school
      but
      the
      problem
      is
      everyone
      knows
      it #8217;s
      not
      a
      serious
      subject
      and
      they
      won #8217;t
      be
      tested
      on
      it
      and
      so
      they
      don #8217;t
      pay
      attention.
      I
      think
      that #8217;s
      why
      they
      don #8217;t
      have

      Yeah,
      i
      struggled
      with
      that
      for
      a
      while.
      For
      me
      it
      was
      a
      slow
      process.
      I
      was
      never
      encouraging
      the
      friendship
      or
      putting
      in
      anything
      positive.
      I
      replied
      to
      messages
      in
      a
      simple
      and
      bland
      way.
      I
      offered
      NO
      favours
      and
      said
      no
      to
      everything
      I
      didn #8217;t
      want
      to
      do.
      It
      has
      to
      be
      a
      slow
      process
      to
      allow
      them
      to
      find
      new
      friends
      and
      to
      have
      a
      different
      social
      circle.
      I
      would
      think
      of
      it
      like
      weening
      them
      off
      you.
      Stop
      doing
      certain
      things
      with
      them
      and
      limit
      exposure
      to
      them.
      Take
      longer
      to
      reply.
      You
      will
      feel
      horrible
      but
      you
      need
      to
      remember
      it #8217;s
      what #8217;s
      best
      for
      you
      and
      your
      mental
      health.

      I
      don #8217;t
      do
      it
      anymore
      but
      I
      have
      scars
      and
      I
      didn #8217;t
      want
      you
      to
      see
      them
      before
      I
      explained.
      I #8217;m
      okay
      now
      and
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      I
      will
      cut
      myself
      again.
      I #8217;m
      going
      to
      start
      wearing
      shorts
      from
      now
      on,
      I
      hope
      that #8217;s
      okay
