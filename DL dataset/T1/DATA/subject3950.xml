      I'm
      not
      a
      shield
      main,
      but
      even
      I
      sometimes
      have
      problems
      with
      timing
      because
      of
      delays.
      It's
      a
      great
      update.

      This
      might
      be
      actually
      doable
      for
      the
      developers
      actually.
      The
      only
      trouble
      would
      be
      with
      bosses
      using
      other
      bosses
      attacks
      cause
      every
      attack
      must
      have
      a
      sprite
      for
      the
      enemy.
      And
      so
      it
      would
      require
      some
      work
      for
      devs
      to
      make
      these
      possible.
      Also
      for
      such
      chamber,
      how
      about
      making
      enemies
      that
      would
      change
      over
      time?
      Like,
      you
      see
      a
      normal
      zombie
      that
      behaves
      like
      zombie,
      but
      suddenly
      it
      changes
      into
      a
      bomber.
      I
      think
      it
      might
      fit
      in
      it.

      Game
      blocks
      achievements
      for
      some
      stuff
      in
      custom
      mode
      and
      doesn't
      in
      some
      cases
      for
      a
      reason.
      In
      my
      opinion,
      it's
      not
      considered
      cheating
      or
      something
      as
      long
      as
      game
      is
      telling
      you
      that
      it's
      not.
      Since
      otherwise
      you'd
      be
      able
      to
      get
      the
      same
      run
      but
      you'd
      just
      need
      to
      restart
      over
      and
      over
      again
      forever.
      So,
      use
      custom
      mode
      of
      you
      want
      to
      make
      any
      progression
      really.
      I
      stopped
      using
      normal
      mode
      as
      soon
      as
      I
      got
      that
      it
      doesn't
      blocks
      achievements.
      So,
      yeah.

      I
      don't
      think
      they're
      3d
      models
      since
      left
      and
      right
      animations
      are
      the
      same,
      despite
      the
      fact
      that
      sprites
      have
      clear
      differences
      between
      left
      and
      right.
      You
      can
      easily
      see
      it
      on
      beheaded.
      Take
      any
      skin
      that
      has
      a
      visible
      one
      shoulder
      element
      (like
      concierge
      outfit)
      and
      take
      a
      look
      at
      left
      and
      right
      positions.
      If
      it
      would
      be
      a
      3d
      model,
      animations
      wouldn't
      be
      mirrored
      like
      that.

      I
      have
      found
      several
      bugs/interesting
      moments
      while
      playing
      on
      my
      switch,
      but
      don't
      know
      if
      they
      were
      noticed
      or
      fixed
      yet.
      Teleporters
      (the
      ones
      that
      let
      you
      out
      of
      secret
      areas)
      can
      sometimes
      spawn
      with
      only
      one
      tile
      wall
      separating
      them
      from
      another
      area,
      which
      causes
      a
      bug
      of
      being
      able
      to
      use
      it
      behind
      that
      wall.
      If
      you
      run
      fast
      to
      purple
      teleporter
      (the
      monolith
      ones,
      that
      require
      a
      rune
      to
      use)
      and
      manage
      to
      fall
      a
      tile
      off,
      beheaded
      will
      start
      slow
      walking
      animation,
      walking
      into
      a
      wall,
      and
      after
      a
      while
      teleport
      to
      the
      teleporter
      and
      use
      it.
      It
      can
      happen
      if
      so
      teleporter
      was
      generated
      near
      a
      one
      tile
      step.
      I
      saw
      once
      a
      Cannibal
      making
      a
      jump
      towards
      beheaded,
      but
      slowly
      moving,
      stuck
      in
      that
      animation
      instead
      because
      of
      being
      hit
      by
      fire.
      Lancerators
      spin
      attack
      can
      be
      weird.
      Sometimes
      they
      go
      forwards
      only
      a
      little
      and
      just
      stop,
      sometimes
      they
      don't
      bounce
      from
      walls
      and
      stop
      instead,
      they
      fall
      of
      edges
      if
      there's
      a
      platform
      in
      there
      (the
      one
      that
      lets
      you
      fall
      down
      through
      it).
      Shield's
      (from
      teleporters,
      rampart,
      etc)
      inner
      circle
      is
      moving
      faster
      than
      player
      when
      doing
      downwards
      smash
      attack,
      but
      outer
      part
      doesn't.
      Also
      several
      suggestions:
      Finding
      random
      items
      and
      not
      taking
      them
      with
      you
      cause
      them
      to
      be
      added
      to
      item
      poll
      in
      custom
      mode
      if
      you
      touch
      them.
      I
      think
      they
      should
      be
      added
      only
      if
      you
      take
      them
      with
      you
      for
      next
      the
      next
      floor.
      Assassin's
      dagger
      doesn't
      inflict
      critical
      damage
      to
      the
      Giant's
      eye
      even
      if
      you
      used
      Phaser
      on
      it.
      I
      don't
      think
      this
      is
      really
      fair.
      Hope
      my
      little
      feedback
      will
      help
      in
      any
      way.
      Waiting
      for
      "Who's
      the
      boss?"
      update
      release.

      My
      favorite
      tactic
      build
      for
      now
      is
      Frantic
      sword,
      Ice
      bow,
      Death
      orb
      and
      Wave
      of
      denial.
      Wave
      of
      denial
      is
      in
      here
      mostly
      because
      it's
      my
      favorite
      power
      that
      I
      just
      simply
      can't
      play
      without.
      It
      always
      saves
      my
      butt,
      gives
      free
      kills
      for
      enemies
      standing
      on
      edges
      and
      one
      click
      deflector
      of
      most
      projectiles/attacks/enemies/etc.
      Good
      luck
      with
      your
      game!

      Custom
      mode
      is
      simple
      goodbye
      to
      failed
      runs
      just
      because
      of
      rng.
      It
      makes
      you
      able
      to
      use
      only
      stuff
      of
      your
      choice,
      so
      you
      will
      always
      have
      good
      gear
      and
      won't
      die
      because
      you
      couldn't
      find
      anything
      useful
      for
      last
      three
      floors.
      Using
      normal
      mode
      is
      mostly
      just
      stretching
      the
      time
      if
      you
      want
      to
      make
      progress.

      It's
      not
      if
      you're
      going
      for
      melee.
      It
      has
      small
      damage,
      but
      freezing
      an
      enemy
      really
      helps
      to
      run
      towards
      it
      and
      kill
      it
      fast.
      I
      would
      say
      it's
      good
      for
      freezing
      but
      not
      the
      best
      for
      damaging.

      When
      I
      was
      thinking
      how
      final
      splatfest
      will
      affect
      next
      game,
      I
      remembered
      final
      splatfest
      of
      Splatoon
      1,
      Callie
      vs
      Marie.
      In
      Splatoon
      2
      one
      of
      them
      got
      kidnapped
      and
      other
      one
      didn't.
      Could
      this
      mean
      that
      chaos
      vs
      order
      won't
      mean
      that
      giant
      change
      in
      story
      of
      Splatoon?
      Could
      it
      mean
      that
      it
      will
      only
      affect
      what
      side
      will
      we
      be
      playing
      as?
      Like,
      there's
      new
      rulers
      in
      Inkopolis
      (chaotic
      or
      super
      controlling)
      and
      we
      would
      have
      to
      fight
      against
      them
      or
      something
      like
      that.
      I
      don't
      know.
      But
      all
      what
      I
      can
      hope
      for
      is
      that
      Splatoons
      story
      won't
      be
      affected
      too
      gradually
      by
      final
      splatfest.
      And
      I
      hope
      they'll
      think
      about
      some
      new
      boss
      instead
      of
      pure
      Octavio.

      The
      best
      part
      of
      this
      post
      is
      "making
      game
      more
      accessible
      for
      casual
      players".
      Cause
      near
      end
      of
      the
      game
      two
      hits
      can
      easily
      kill
      you,
      if
      not
      one.
      A
      little
      tip:
      experiment
      with
      gear
      setups
      to
      find
      best
      one
      for
      you
      and
      use
      custom
      mode
      when
      you'll
      unlock
      it.
      Good
      luck
      with
      your
      adventure!

      I

      Still
      using

      It's

      that
      the
      Boy's
      axe
      is
      going

      This
      is
      the
      first
      time
      I
      have
      ever
      seen
      anyone
      trying
      to
      learn
      to
      not
      hate
      someone
      for
      something
      harmless
      (or
      basically
      being
      racist).
      No,
      really.
      I
      can't
      believe
      there
      are
      actually
      people
      who
      ever
      try

      of

      I
      don't
      like
      them
      and
      that's
      it".
      Hope
      you'll
      learn
      how
      to
      simply
      not
      pay
      any
      attention
      to
      such
      stuff
      cause
      it
      doesn't

      someone
      has

      Some
      options
      in
      custom
      mode
      block
      you
      from
      getting
      achievements.
      But
      game
      is
      still
      letting
      you
      to
      absorb
      BSC
      even
      with
      blocked
      achievements.
      So,
      is
      there
      any
      way
      to
      get
      the
      achievement
      of
      absorbing
      BSC
      after
      you
      absorb
      them
      with
      blocked
      achievements,
      or,
      if
      you
      do
      so,
      it's
      screwed?

      I
      would
      actually
      recommend
      then
      first
      playing
      with
      easier
      options
      to
      simply
      get
      used
      to
      challenge
      and
      not
      hop
      right
      in.
      Like,
      train
      with
      flask
      recharges,
      or
      smaller
      curses,
      or
      whatever
      and
      then
      go
      for
      real
      difficulty.

      Personally,
      I
      would
      recommend
      going
      through
      hero
      campaign
      (single
      player
      mode)
      before
      getting
      started
      with
      online
      matches.
      It
      will
      teach
      you
      how
      to
      maneuver,
      plan
      in
      specific
      situations
      and
      what
      type
      of
      weapon
      to
      try
      out
      first.
      Also
      I
      would
      recommend
      getting
      octo
      expansion
      since
      it's
      incredible.
      Edit:
      also
      would
      recommend
      to
      get
      Nintendo
      switch
      online
      app
      for
      rotations
      monitoring
      and
      alternative
      gear.

      First

      I'm
      new

      my
      apologies
      for
      trashy
      post
      and
      stupid
      questions.
      I
      just
      wanted
      to
      ask
      if
      scratching
      your
      skin
      with
      sharp
      object
      (intentionally)
      counts
      as
      self
      harm
      if
      you
      don't
      cut.
      What
      do
      you
      think?
