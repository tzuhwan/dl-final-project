      You're
      putting
      words
      in
      my
      mouth.
      The
      kid
      is
      obviously
      guilty
      but
      he
      had
      had
      his
      day
      in
      court
      already.
      You
      calling
      for
      street
      justice
      is
      not
      only
      immature
      its
      illegal.

      Have
      you
      never
      been
      through
      a
      KYC
      process?
      The
      first
      thing
      an
      actual
      security
      researcher
      would
      notice
      about
      the
      process
      is
      that
      your
      providing
      someone
      with
      everything
      they
      would
      need
      to
      open
      up
      multiple
      bank
      accounts
      in
      your
      name.
      I
      thought
      this
      was
      blatantly
      obvious
      to
      anyone
      but
      I
      guess
      not.
      If
      you
      feel
      comfortable
      with
      it,
      post
      a
      picture
      of
      you
      smiling
      holding
      up
      your
      driver's
      license
      on
      reddit.
      See
      how
      long
      it
      takes
      for
      fraudulent
      activity
      to
      happen.
      To
      be
      clear
      this
      goes
      for
      KYC
      anywhere,
      not
      just
      coinbase.
      Gemini
      is
      far
      worse,
      requiring
      you
      to
      give
      social
      security
      also

      This
      is
      public
      information,
      I'm
      not
      sure
      why
      there
      is
      any
      doubt
      in
      your
      mind.
      The
      bigger
      scam
      is
      our
      buying
      power
      is
      being
      robbed
      to
      bail
      out
      the
      repo
      market
      (banks
      again)

      Yeah
      but
      these
      people
      in
      the
      comments
      only
      go
      after
      low
      hanging
      fruit.

      I
      agree,
      70%
      is
      way
      too
      high.
      The
      tax
      brackets
      haven't
      changed
      all
      that
      much
      to
      compensate
      for
      the
      massive
      devaluation
      of
      the
      dollar
      nor
      have
      wages
      went
      up
      either.
