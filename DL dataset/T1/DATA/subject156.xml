      Having
      breasts.
      When
      my
      friends
      and
      I
      were
      little,
      we
      were
      super
      hyped
      about
      having
      breasts.
      Wish
      I
      was
      flat,
      lol

      I
      am
      from
      Czech
      Republic
      and
      I
      honestly
      don't
      like
      Czech
      food
      in
      general.
      It's
      often
      meat
      (I'm
      vegetarian)
      and
      too
      salty
      or
      too
      sweet
      or
      very
      oily.
      The
      thing
      I
      hate
      the
      most
      isn't
      that
      typical
      but
      we
      do
      that
      a
      lot
      -
      fried
      cheese.
      I
      really
      just
      taste
      salt
      and
      oil.
      The
      way
      we
      do
      steaks
      is
      something
      I
      could
      talk
      about
      as
      well.
      But
      other
      Czechs
      love
      it.

      My
      PE
      teacher
      at
      my
      old
      school.
      She
      didn't
      really
      give
      a
      fucc
      about
      our
      health,
      I
      had
      some
      problems
      with
      my
      spine
      and
      shouldn't
      do
      gymnastics
      -
      sure
      I
      got
      some
      serious
      lessons
      to
      become
      a
      professional
      or
      what.
      She
      also
      didn't
      let
      girls
      have
      a
      rest
      if
      they
      were
      on
      they
      period.
      There
      was
      one
      girl
      with
      serious
      cramps,
      she
      was
      suffering
      just
      sitting
      in
      the
      class
      and
      she
      was
      almost
      fainting,
      but
      the
      nice
      teacher
      wouldn't
      let
      her
      take
      a
      seat,
      she
      would
      rather
      have
      a
      kid
      faint
      in
      the
      middle
      of
      a
      push-up.
      Her
      excuse
      was
      that
      she
      never
      felt
      any
      pain,
      so
      if
      anybody
      felt
      anything
      worse
      than
      a
      discomfort,
      she
      told
      them
      they
      are
      faking.
      She
      also
      didn't
      have
      problems
      insulting
      us
      for
      our
      appearance
      or
      physical
      abilities
      or
      people
      we
      were
      friends
      with
      and
      she
      compared
      us
      to
      our
      sporty
      classmates.
      Nobody
      really
      cared
      about
      her,
      because
      ,,she
      was
      just
      leading
      lazy
      kids
      to
      sports."
      She
      is
      the
      reason
      I
      changed
      school,
      I
      was
      her
      main
      target
      for
      my
      chubby
      body,
      short
      height
      and
      my
      introversion.
      I
      sometimes
      have
      something
      like
      anxiety
      attack
      to
      think
      about
      her
      and
      I
      have
      a
      hard
      time
      facing
      anybody
      I
      was
      in
      a
      class
      with.
      Sports
      never
      were
      my
      thing
      but
      after
      this
      experience,
      I
      feel
      like
      a
      piece
      of
      garbage.

      Mental
      problems
      and
      illnesses.
      I
      don't
      think
      ill
      people
      should
      have
      the
      name
      of
      their
      illness
      tattooed
      on
      their
      forehead,
      I
      just
      think
      people
      often
      know
      only
      about
      stereotypes
      (like,
      schizophrenic
      necessarily
      has
      to
      be
      violent)
      and
      a
      lot
      of
      people
      won't
      go
      to
      a
      therapy
      because
      they
      think
      they
      would
      be
      judged.
      Basically
      -
      I
      wish
      people
      saw
      mental
      illnesses
      as
      they
      truly
      are
      and
      not
      as
      a
      taboo.

      boring
      Billie
      Eilish,
      she
      is
      talented,
      but
      I
      feel
      like
      most
      of
      her
      songs
      are
      written
      to
      be
      deep
      but
      they
      actually
      aren't.
      I
      just
      think
      she
      needs
      some
      time
      to
      really
      become
      good
      artist,
      the
      pressure
      is
      probably
      too
      much
      for
      her,
      she
      seems
      scared.
      She
      has
      a
      big
      potential,
      I
      think
      her
      fame
      at
      this
      age
      might
      just
      mess
      it
      up.
      Also,
      her
      fanbase
      is
      something
      I
      can't
      stand
      up

      Partying,
      being
      in
      a
      big
      group
      of
      people,
      going
      out
      and
      doing

      everyday,

      feel

      had
      to
      throw
      up...
      Socializing
      is
      a
      good
      thing,
      but
      not
      for

      The
      extroverted
      people
      who
      disrespect
      introverts
      are
      the

      It's

      us

      When
      I
      like
      the
      job
      I'm
      doing,
      I
      get
      really
      focused
      and
      nothing
      can
      distract
      me
      until
      I'm
      done.
      I
      don't
      work
      very
      fast,
      but
      the
      result
      is
      high
      in
      quality
      and
      I'm
      pretty
      proud
      of
      that.
      I
      am
      also
      very
      open
      about
      many
      stuff
      that
      are
      taboo
      for
      other
      people,for
      example
      menstruation.
      Few
      of
      my
      friends
      said
      they
      aren't
      ashamed
      of
      it
      and
      don't
      worry
      to
      ask
      for
      a
      tampon
      anymore
      because
      I
      helped
      them
      open
      about
      it.

      Not
      much
      good.
      A
      lot
      of
      anxiety
      attack,
      people
      tell
      me
      I'm
      paranoid
      and
      I
      often
      see
      things
      that
      apper
      to
      not
      exist.
      I
      would
      love
      to
      go
      to
      a
      therapist
      but
      my
      mom
      thinks
      psychologist
      are
      useless
      and
      all
      you
      get
      from
      a
      therapy
      are
      999999
      illnesses
      you
      didn't
      even
      know
      about
      and
      bunch
      of
      pills
      instead
      of
      solving
      problem.
      Searching
      a
      mental
      help
      is
      one
      of
      the
      things
      I'm
      gonna
      do
      once
      I
      turn
      18
      or
      get
      out
      of
      my
      house.

      My
      girlfriend
      helped
      me
      a
      lot,
      but
      I
      never
      got
      out
      of
      it.
      I
      cut
      myself
      for
      the
      last
      time
      about
      3
      weeks
      ago
      but
      I
      wasn't
      far
      from
      doing
      that
      again
      recently.
      I
      usually
      do
      that
      when
      I
      have
      anxiety
      attack
      and
      I
      don't
      remember
      doing
      that,
      I
      just
      have
      and
      feel
      the
      scar.
      My
      friends
      let
      me
      try
      mariuana
      to
      control
      my
      attacks
      and
      it
      helped
      a
      lot.
      Fuck
      people
      who
      smoke
      just
      for
      fun
      or
      bcs
      it's
      cool
      or
      what,
      but
      it
      can
      be
      used
      as
      a
      cure
      if
      you
      don't
      smoke
      too
      much
      and
      know
      well
      your
      dealer.
      I
      hope
      I
      can
      control
      my
      attacks
      without
      mariuana
      as
      soon
      as
      possible
      and
      100%
      stop
      cutting
      and
      beating
      myself.

      I
      like
      autumn,
      bcs
      it's
      cold
      but
      not
      too
      much,
      the
      trees
      look
      pretty
      and
      it
      feels
      nice
      to
      have
      a
      warm
      soup,
      tea
      or
      chocolate
      milk.
      Reading
      books
      and
      drawing
      also
      feels
      different
      during
      this
      season.
      The
      days
      ate
      getting
      shorter
      so
      I
      like
      to
      light
      some
      candles
      instead
      of
      turning
      on
      the
      light.
      I
      also
      love
      wearing
      thick
      jumpers
      and
      hoodies
      or
      wearing
      fluffy
      socks.
      Winter
      is
      also
      great,
      but
      it's
      too
      cold
      and
      the
      snow
      is
      pretty
      but
      I
      don't
      like
      walking
      in
      it.

      I
      usually
      put
      my

      close
      enough

      hear
      it
      but
      far
      enough
      so
      I

      to

      to

      I

      I
      became
      vegan
      and
      I
      had
      to
      check
      what
      I'm
      eating.
      When
      I
      found
      out
      what
      I
      was
      putting
      inside
      of
      my
      body,
      I
      started
      to
      care
      more
      about
      eating
      healthy.
      I
      stopped
      being
      vegan
      about
      8
      months
      ago
      and
      I'm
      only
      vegetarian,
      but
      I
      still
      care
      about
      the
      food
      I'm
      eating.
      I
      don't
      have
      ideal
      figure
      but
      I
      feel
      healthy
      and
      I
      don't
      weigh
      as
      much
      as
      I
      did
      before.
      You
      don't
      need
      to
      go
      to
      a
      diet,
      just
      don't
      eat
      shit
      and
      chemicals
      and
      find
      a
      way
      to
      enjoy
      exercising.

      I
      would
      give
      up
      touch,
      taste
      and
      hearing.
      I
      love
      food
      but
      I
      enjoy
      the
      smell
      more
      than
      taste
      and
      I
      love
      how
      my
      gf
      smells,
      I
      think
      I
      would
      survive
      without
      touch
      and
      I
      love
      silence
      a
      lot.

      I
      stopped
      eating
      meat
      because
      I
      told
      myself
      this.
      I
      would

      meat
      in
      my
      mouth

      It
      was
      my
      5th
      birthday
      and
      I
      made
      some
      friends,
      so
      I
      invited
      them
      thinking
      they
      would
      wish
      me
      nice
      birthday
      and
      celebrate
      with
      me.
      Most
      of
      them
      didn't
      even
      talk
      with
      me,
      they
      just
      went
      into
      my
      room,
      took
      out
      my
      toys
      and
      played
      with
      them.
      If
      anybody
      talked
      to
      me,
      it
      was
      Why
      didn't
      you
      invite
      ____?
      Why
      do
      you
      only
      have
      one
      cake?
      and
      other
      shit.
      I
      tried
      to
      join
      the
      kids
      playing
      but
      nobody
      wanted
      to
      play
      with
      me,
      so
      I
      just
      went
      into
      my
      room
      and
      read
      and
      waited
      for
      kids
      to
      leave.
      Nobody
      really
      cleaned
      anything,
      some
      of
      my
      toys
      were
      broken
      and
      food
      was
      all
      over
      the
      floor.
      They
      ate
      almost
      everything,
      I
      didn't
      even
      taste
      my
      own
      cake.
      It
      was
      a
      breaking
      point
      for
      my
      anxiety,
      I
      didn't
      have
      a
      birthday
      party
      since
      then
      and
      I
      have
      hard
      time
      trusting
      people.
      I
      was
      a
      happy
      energetic
      kid
      before
      but
      I
      turned
      cold,
      anxious
      and
      I
      had
      a
      first
      experience
      with
      self
      harming
      about
      a
      week
      about
      the
      party
      -
      I
      bit
      myslef
      or
      beat
      myself.
      It
      literally
      destroyed
      my
      personality.

      She

      she
      is

      her
      mother
      treats

      as
      a

      I
      think
      early
      teen
      age,
      because
      you
      get
      first
      acne,
      hair,
      menstruation
      (if
      you
      are
      a
      girl,
      of
      course),
      it
      all
      is
      new
      and
      hormones
      go
      crazy
      and
      you
      have
      to
      deal
      with
      it.
      Then
      18-25
      bscause
      of
      stress
      at
      school,
      getting
      job,
      looking
      for
      your
      future
      husband/wife,
      people
      expect
      you
      to
      grow
      up
      from
      a
      teen
      to
      a
      mature
      adult.
      Then
      70+
      because
      of
      the
      health
      problems,
      losing
      your
      friends
      and
      partner,
      loneliness
      etc

      Good
      manners
      and
      not
      talking
      too
      much.
      Just
      say
      what's
      on
      your
      mind,
      then
      shut
      up.
      I
      am
      very
      formal
      when
      I
      meet
      new
      people,
      I
      usually
      need
      to
      know
      a
      person
      for
      over
      2
      years
      before
      I
      open
      up
      with
      them,
      so
      I
      like
      when
      they
      take
      everything
      slow
      and
      don't
      try
      to
      have
      a
      personal
      talk
      with
      me.
      That's
      why
      I
      don't
      have
      friends,

      a

      sat
      next

      I
      feel
      like
      religions
      have
      no
      place
      in
      this
      century.
      It
      has
      done
      its
      job
      explaining
      what
      people
      didn't
      understand
      before,
      now
      we
      have
      science
      and
      facts.
      There
      is
      no
      god
      and
      never
      was,
      no
      Satan,
      no
      hell,
      no
      heaven...
      The
      only
      things
      we
      have
      from
      religinos
      nowadays
      are
      fights,
      hate
      and
      wasted
      time.
      Believing
      is
      one
      thing,
      but
      spending
      time
      in
      churches
      or
      doing
      some
      rituals
      is
      a
      wasted
      time.
      The
      stupidest
      thing
      about
      that
      are
      parents
      forcing
      their
      children
      to
      be
      brainwashed.
      Believe
      whatever
      you
      want,
      but
      think
      about
      your
      time
      and
      don't
      use
      your
      god
      to
      explain
      or
      suppress
      things.

      Thanks.
      People
      should
      learn
      facts
      instead
      of
      wasting
      time
      sitting
      in
      the
      church
      thinking
      some
      kind
      of
      entity
      would
      make
      their
      wishes
      come
      true
      and
      make
      them
      happy.
      Not
      much
      different
      from
      little
      kids
      believing
      in
      Santa
      Claus,
      fairies
      or
      unicorns.
      But
      the
      kids
      at
      least
      grow
      up
      and
      learn
      to
      live
      with
      the
      truth.

      One
      girl
      in
      my
      class
      was
      supposed
      to
      make
      a
      sentence
      "I
      don't
      like
      when
      my
      brother
      annoys
      me
      when
      chewing
      too
      loud."
      She
      said
      ,,I
      haven't
      like
      when
      my
      brother
      me
      poison
      biting
      much
      loud."
      That's
      how
      our
      native
      language
      works
      -
      we
      say
      haven't
      like
      instead
      of
      don't
      like,
      we
      have
      the
      same
      word
      for
      poisoning
      and
      annoying
      or
      chewing
      and
      biting,
      and
      we
      say
      me
      annoys
      instead
      of
      annoys
      me.
      Her
      English
      didn't
      improve
      since
      then,
      I
      would
      say
      it's
      even
      worse.

      You're
      just
      lazy.
      Your
      life
      must
      be
      boring.
      I
      will
      invite
      some
      more
      people
      so
      it's
      not
      just
      the
      two
      of
      us.
      You
      only
      look
      at
      your
      phone
      and
      don't
      even
      go
      out
      of
      your
      room.
      I
      will
      call,
      texting
      is
      boring.
      You
      have
      no
      life.
      Small
      talk
      is
      fun.
      I
      don't
      understand
      you.
      Books
      are
      bullshit.
      Drawing
      is
      bullshit.
      You
      only
      think
      of
      yourself.
      Stop
      over
      thinking.
      Internet
      friends
      aren't
      real
      friends.
      Introversion
      doesn't
      exist,
      it's
      just
      people
      being
      lazy
      or
      mentally
      ill.
      You
      should
      see
      psychologist.
      You
      don't
      look
      like
      you
      are
      introvert.
      You
      are
      not
      shy,
      you
      are
      just
      not
      being
      honest.
      You
      only
      think
      about
      stuff,
      why
      don't
      you
      do
      stuff?
      If
      everyone
      was
      like
      you,
      humanity
      would
      propably
      still
      be
      in
      caves.
      You
      have
      no
      future.
      You
      are
      wird.
      You
      won't
      get
      job
      like
      this.
      When
      did
      you
      become
      like
      this?
      You
      must
      have
      trauma/be
      depressed.
      I'm
      glad
      I'm
      not
      like
      you.
      Why
      don't
      you
      make
      more
      friends,
      you
      only
      have
      few.
      No
      successful
      people
      are
      introverts.
      Go
      talk
      to
      people,
      it
      will
      make
      you
      energetic.
      There's
      more.

      Oh,
      that's
      my
      favourite
      type!
      I
      read
      INFPs
      help
      others
      a
      lot
      as
      well,
      and
      I
      don't
      feel
      like
      that
      too.
      We
      can't
      be
      100%
      as
      the
      description
      says,
      but
      that
      doesn't
      mean
      you
      aren't
      good
      person.
      Your
      differences
      are
      what
      makes
      you
      an
      amazing
      person.

      It
      indeed
      is.
      I
      think
      introverts
      wouldn't
      be
      that
      shy
      if
      they
      were
      treated
      better,
      we
      would
      still
      enjoy
      time
      alone
      and
      have
      few
      close
      friends
      but
      we
      would
      be
      more
      confident
      and
      more
      open
      about
      ourselves.

      I
      was
      buying
      cola
      and
      there
      was
      a
      kid
      staring
      at
      me
      with
      a
      serious
      face.
      I
      asked
      him
      what's
      wrong
      and
      he
      said
      slowly,
      with
      unnaturally
      serious
      voice
      "Cola
      is
      poisonous.
      Don't
      drink
      it
      or
      you
      wil
      die
      in
      pain."
      Not
      the
      scaries5
      thing
      to
      hear
      but
      I
      returned
      the
      cola
      and
      bought
      mineral
      water
      to
      be
      a
      good
      example.
      I
      met
      him
      again
      after
      a
      while
      and
      he
      gave
      me
      such
      a
      sweet
      smile
      when
      he
      saw
      me
      holding
      a
      water
      and
      said
      to
      his
      mom
      "Look!
      I
      saved
      her
      life
      when
      telling
      her
      to
      not
      buy
      cola!"
      His
      mom
      was
      very
      proud
      of
      him
      and
      thanked
      me
      for
      being
      a
      good
      example.
      I
      felt
      so
      bad
      for
      the
      kid
      when
      drinking
      and
      eating
      unhealthy
      so
      I
      started
      eating
      healthier.
      I
      never
      thought
      a
      little
      guy
      could
      completely
      change
      my
      diet.

      one
      from
      their

      When

      wanted
      to
      take
      a
      bath,
      they

      Pasta.
      I
      love
      pasta,
      it's
      simple
      to
      make
      and
      there
      are
      so
      many
      ways
      to
      make
      a
      dish
      with
      it.
      I
      also
      think
      sushi
      would
      be
      fun,
      I
      would
      like
      to
      try
      different
      combinations
      or
      give
      people
      opportunity
      to
      make
      a
      custom
      sushi
      -
      you
      would
      have
      a
      paper
      of
      ingredients
      and
      you
      could
      choose
      what
      type
      of
      sushi
      you
      want
      and
      what
      do
      you
      want
      in
      it.
      Each
      ingredient
      would
      have
      certain
      price
      and
      people
      would
      mark
      what
      do
      they
      want.
      There
      might
      me
      restaurants
      like
      that
      but
      I
      never
      saw
      any
      near
      my
      city
      and
      I
      would
      love
      it.

      if

      they
      will
      be
      punished
      by
      society.
      Some
      people
      would
      consider
      face-showing
      even
      a
      man
      walking
      out
      of
      his
      house
      in
      skirt
      or
      wearing
      makeup,
      even
      tho
      he
      just
      feels
      better
      that
      way

      She
      was
      forcing
      me
      to
      go
      out
      a
      lot,
      socialize,
      she
      was
      too
      extroverted
      for
      me.
      She
      was
      nice
      and
      energetic,
      but
      I
      was
      exhausted
      and
      if
      I
      stayed
      with
      her
      for
      the
      rest
      of
      my
      life,
      we
      would
      propably
      end
      up
      living
      two
      separate
      lives,
      she
      would
      travel
      and
      socialize
      and
      I
      would
      stay
      in
      my
      room
      and
      paint
      and
      read,
      so
      it
      wouldn't
      last.
      When
      I
      told
      her
      about
      breakup,
      she
      said
      she
      was
      thinking
      about
      it
      as
      well
      because
      she
      wasn't
      sure
      if
      she
      is
      a
      lesbian
      or
      not.
      Turned
      out
      she
      wasn't,
      she
      has
      a
      guy
      now
      and
      we
      are
      both
      happy.

      I
      get
      very
      unmotivated
      to
      do
      stuff
      that
      would
      normally
      make
      me
      happy
      and
      I
      just
      lie
      in
      my
      bed
      not
      doing
      anything
      for
      hours
      and
      hours.
      When
      I
      have
      the
      worst
      days
      I
      forget
      things,
      memories
      blend
      together
      and
      I
      have
      problems
      remembering
      details.
      Everything
      is
      dark
      and
      blur
      and
      it
      makes
      depression
      even
      worse.
      People
      think
      I
      hate
      them
      because
      I
      often
      avoid
      them
      so
      I
      have
      a
      hard
      time
      keeping
      relationships.
      You
      have
      better
      days
      but
      it
      never
      goes
      away
      and
      it's
      exhausting.

      Art
      lessons.
      It
      might
      be
      boring
      for
      some
      people
      but
      if
      you
      have
      a
      good
      teacher
      who
      actually
      knows
      some
      art,
      you
      can
      get
      better
      imagination.
      That's
      also
      problem
      with
      schools
      (or
      at
      least
      at
      my
      school),
      cuz
      people
      think
      anyone
      can
      teach
      art.
      Most
      of
      teachers
      we
      had
      just
      found
      some
      "art"
      on
      Google,
      figured
      out
      how
      could
      it
      be
      made
      and
      told
      us
      to
      do
      it.
      My
      classmates
      who
      aren't
      in
      any
      art
      clubs
      have
      no
      idea
      what
      art
      is,
      when
      they
      see
      abstract
      art
      they
      say
      they
      could
      do
      it
      as
      well
      and
      give
      it
      some
      poetic
      name.
      No,
      you
      couldn't,
      because
      nobody
      teached
      you
      to
      have
      imagination
      and
      you
      propably
      would
      even
      know
      how
      to
      mix
      the
      colors.
      You
      maybe
      don't
      need
      to
      paint
      well
      to
      get
      a
      job,
      but
      you
      might
      need
      an
      imagination
      to
      do
      it
      well.

      I

      a
      panic
      attack
      after
      triggering
      one
      traumatic
      memory.
      I
      couldn't
      get
      myself
      together
      and
      cried
      and
      had
      problems
      breathing
      and
      my
      friend
      told
      me
      she
      does
      have
      nerves
      for
      my
      shit
      and
      I
      should
      pack
      my
      things
      and
      go
      home.
      I
      went
      out
      and
      sat
      next
      to
      a
      tree
      for
      like
      15
      minutes
      before
      I
      had
      a
      strenght
      to
      go
      home.
      I
      don't
      under
      how
      could
      I
      ever
      be
      friends
      with
      her,
      she
      only
      cares
      about
      her
      looks
      and
      if
      you
      tell
      the
      stuff
      she
      wants
      to
      hear.

      I
      enjoy
      reading,
      drawing,
      writing
      stories
      or
      watching
      movies
      or
      series,
      but
      most
      of
      the
      activities
      seem
      more
      interesting
      when
      done
      without
      people.
      You
      can
      only
      focus
      on
      what
      you're
      doing
      and
      you
      aren't
      interrupted
      by
      some
      person
      talking
      crap.

      hard
      but
      it's

      Lesbians,
      cuz
      I'm
      bi
      and
      girl
      just
      knows

      feels
      good
      better

      No

      you

      she
      has

      annoying
      voice,
      stupid

      and

      Also,
      the

      her
      songs...
      I
      don't
      understand

      she

      like

      I
      never
      really
      made
      friends
      because
      I
      didn't
      feel
      any
      need
      have
      to
      any,
      I
      was
      adopted
      by
      some
      extroverts
      or
      I
      met
      them
      because
      my
      mom
      knew
      their
      parents.
      But
      if
      you
      want
      to
      make
      friends
      yourself,
      maybe
      show
      them
      you
      admire
      them,
      you
      have
      same
      hobbies
      and
      be
      open
      to
      their
      opinions??
      I
      don't
      know,

      cat
      plushie
      with
      a
      little
      bag
      on
      its
      belly.
      I
      would
      always
      write
      my
      thoughts
      on
      a
      little
      piece
      of
      paper
      and
      put
      it
      in
      a
      bag
      and
      I
      called
      it
      a
      memory
      kitty.

      I
      love
      it,
      but
      I'm
      kinda
      picky
      so
      I
      hardly
      ever
      finish
      watching
      it
      and
      there
      is
      only
      few
      of
      them
      I
      loved.
      I
      hate
      most
      of
      the
      fans
      around
      me,
      annoying
      weebs.

      Vegan
      dishes.
      I
      am
      not
      vegan
      but
      I
      love
      vegan
      food,
      the
      plant
      taste
      is
      just
      amazing
      (if
      it's
      not
      made
      with
      chemicals,
      of
      course),
      but
      most
      people
      around
      me
      won't
      eat
      food
      that
      is
      vegan
      just
      because
      it
      has
      "vegan"
      on
      it.
      Like...
      It's
      not
      poisonous,
      you
      eat
      vegetables
      with
      meat
      as
      well

      I
      keep
      my
      cat
      in
      my
      room
      anytime
      I
      feel
      like
      I
      want
      to
      cut
      myself.
      I
      would
      feel
      guilty
      if
      he
      had
      to
      see
      me
      like
      this,
      so
      it
      usually
      helps
      a
      lot.
      Also
      playing
      with
      him
      or
      cuddling
      him
      helps
      a
      lot,
      it
      makes
      me
      feel
      loved.
