      Recently
      I
      have
      been
      getting
      into
      fights
      a
      lot
      more.
      As
      a
      6 #8217;1 #8217;
      16
      year
      old
      who
      looks
      older
      than
      he
      is
      I
      get
      approached
      semi-regularly
      by
      people
      who
      want
      to
      pick
      a
      fight.
      I
      did
      2
      years
      of
      taekwondo
      a
      few
      years
      ago
      but
      from
      what
      I #8217;ve
      experienced
      it
      barely
      helps
      in
      a
      street
      fight
      situation,
      as
      your
      opponent
      doesn #8217;t
      follow
      the
      rules.
      Is
      it
      worth
      getting
      back
      into
      martial
      arts
      to
      deal
      with
      this
      or
      is
      it
      a
      better
      idea
      to
      get
      a
      punchbag
      and
      practice
      on
      that
      or
      with
      friends?
      If
      you
      have
      any
      alternative
      methods
      say
      as
      well.

      It
      depends
      what
      forum
      you
      are
      in.
      As
      someone
      who
      lives
      in
      England
      we
      have

      that
      kind
      of
      claim
      acceptable
      so
      many
      people
      do
      that.
      I #8217;ve
      experienced
      it
      a
      huge
      amount.
      As
      someone
      who #8217;s
      opinions
      transitioned
      from
      radical
      left
      to

      Yes.
      Where
      I
      live
      there
      is
      a
      park
      near
      the
      river
      and
      I
      was
      walking
      my
      dog
      when
      I
      heard
      screaming
      coming
      from
      the
      direction
      of
      the
      park.
      So
      I
      ran
      over
      and
      all
      these
      children
      were
      crying
      and
      pointing
      at
      one
      of
      their
      friends
      who
      had
      walked
      to
      close
      to
      the
      edge
      and
      fallen
      in.
      So
      I
      jumped
      in
      and
      pulled
      him
      out.

      I
      think
      that
      part
      of
      it
      is
      the
      tribalism
      of
      groups
      such
      as
      the
      republicans
      and
      democrats
      as
      well
      as
      the
      growing
      number
      of
      minority
      issues
      being
      touted
      as
      major
      problems.
      Especially
      coming
      from
      the
      extremes
      of
      the
      spectrum,
      such
      as
      antifa
      and
      the
      kkk.
      Another
      part
      of
      it
      is
      the
      left
      wing
      media
      being
      more
      widespread
      then
      the
      right.
      I
      do
      see
      your
      point,
      as
      it #8217;s
      an
      opinion
      I
      used
      to
      hold
      myself,
      but
      I
      can #8217;t
      help
      but
      see
      the
      centre
      right
      and
      centre
      left
      being
      attacked
      by

      Why
      is
      being
      a
      communist
      acceptable
      and
      being
      a
      nazi
      not?
      I
      mean,
      didn #8217;t
      communism
      kill
      millions
      more.
      (Not
      a
      nazi
      btw,I
      hate
      them
      with
      a
      passion.
      just
      an
      interesting
      question)

      As
      someone
      who
      has
      an
      issue
      with
      chronic
      depression
      and
      anxiety.
      The
      best
      advice
      I
      can
      give
      is
      to
      get
      away
      from
      people
      who
      you
      make
      you
      feel
      bad,
      go
      for
      long
      walks
      with
      close
      friends,
      take
      up
      an
      instrument
      or
      a
      sport
      you #8217;ve
      always
      wanted
      to
      and
      focus
      on
      the
      positive
      in
      general.
      Chances
      are
      you #8217;ll
      end
      up
      feeling
      good
      if
      you
      are
      surrounded
      by
      good
      people.
      Also,
      and
      I
      can #8217;t
      stress
      this
      enough,
      never
      regret
      being
      yourself.
      If
      people
      don #8217;t
      like
      that
      it #8217;s
      their
      problem.
      Things
      will
      get
      better
      eventually!!!

      Some
      facts
      are
      offensive.
      Even
      if
      the
      cause
      is
      racist,
      it
      doesn #8217;t
      mean
      addressing
      the
      problem
      is.
      Eg.
      High
      crime
      in
      black
      neighbourhoods.
      That #8217;s
      how
      it
      is,
      so
      address
      the
      problem
      of
      the
      crime
      as
      opposed
      to
      addressing
      a
      something
      that
      happened
      a
      century
      ago.
      As
      well
      as
      the
      fact
      that
      criminals
      are
      coming
      through
      the
      border
      illegally.
      That
      is
      a
      fact,
      so
      address
      the
      problem
      instead
      of
      virtue
      signalling
      about
      the
      good
      people
      who
      are
      being
      effected.
      Then
      there
      wouldn #8217;t
      be
      any
      problem.
      so
      no
      good
      people
      would
      be
      hurt.

      training
      with
      a
      45kg

      have

      trying
      many

      I

      boxing

      mma
      the
      most
      effective
