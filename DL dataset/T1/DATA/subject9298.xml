      My
      French
      pointer
      sucks
      on
      the
      cheeks
      of
      teddy
      bears.
      It's
      his
      way
      of
      relaxing
      and
      soothing
      himself.
      When
      we
      have
      people
      over,
      he
      knows
      he
      needs
      to
      behave,
      but
      he
      gets
      so
      excited.
      He
      will
      excitedly
      greet
      people
      then
      find
      his
      teddy
      bear
      and
      start
      aggressively
      suckling
      on
      it,
      his
      ears
      even
      flap
      back
      and
      forth.
       #128514;
      This
      is
      how
      he
      shows
      he's
      under
      control

      I
      have
      BPD,
      and
      honestly,
      let
      her
      figure
      it
      out
      on
      her
      own
      if
      you
      can.
      What
      you
      say
      will
      feel
      like
      an
      attack,
      so
      let
      her
      read
      your
      body
      language
      when
      she
      does
      something
      you
      don't
      like.
      Also,
      she
      might
      be
      doing
      things
      that
      you
      don't
      like
      because
      she
      wants
      to
      see
      if
      you
      will
      stay.
      I
      do
      this
      very
      often
      to
      test
      people's
      loyalty/their
      reaction
      to
      see
      if
      they
      love
      me
      or
      are
      deep
      down
      annoyed
      with
      me
      and
      never
      want
      to
      see
      me
      again.
      Last
      thing,
      she
      needs
      to
      be
      on
      meds
      if
      she
      isn't
      already.
      It's
      a
      nightmare
      illness
      to
      not
      be
      on
      psychiatric
      medication.

      Try
      to
      look
      at
      therapy
      as
      a
      place
      to
      vent
      instead
      of
      a
      place
      where
      you
      have
      to
      fix
      yourself.
      After
      breaking
      up
      with
      a
      therapist,
      I
      told
      my
      new
      one
      that
      im
      not
      ready
      to
      work
      on
      things
      because
      change
      is
      really
      hard
      for
      me.
      So
      he
      is
      very
      slow
      going
      and
      doesn't
      expect
      much
      from
      me
      except
      for
      tiny
      small
      improvements
      and
      lots
      of
      venting.
      This
      makes
      me
      feel
      a
      lot
      better,
      week
      by
      week.
      You
      have
      a
      personality
      disorder,
      so
      it's
      a
      part
      of
      you
      and
      it
      will
      take
      a
      long
      time
      to
      'fix'.
      After
      being
      on
      quite
      a
      few
      of
      ssri's,
      I
      was
      put
      on
      an
      atypical
      antipsychotic,
      olanzapine.
      It's
      made
      the
      most
      difference
      out
      of
      all
      of
      my
      meds.

      in
      English
      class,
      my
      group
      was
      talking
      about
      celebrities
      they
      liked.
      I
      was
      more
      on
      the
      quiet-side,
      but
      I
      chimed
      in.
      I
      said,
      "how
      about
      that
      Toby
      Mcquire
      though?"
      And
      they
      all
      just
      kinda
      stared
      at
      me.

      it's
      weird,
      now
      that
      I
      feel
      better
      on
      my
      mixture
      of
      drugs,
      I
      pine
      for
      the
      days
      when
      suicide
      and
      depression
      was
      all
      I
      thought
      about,
      bc
      at
      least
      I
      had
      some
      direction
      in
      life.
      have
      hope
      in
      the
      fact
      that,
      you
      feel
      this
      emotion
      so
      strongly
      now,
      that
      sometime
      in
      days
      to
      come,
      you
      will
      feel
      so
      strongly
      in
      the
      opposite
      direction
      too.
      and
      then
      maybe
      you'll
      want
      'the
      good
      ol
      days'
      back
      when
      you
      felt
      so
      strongly
      about
      dying
      when
      you're
      happy,
      as
      maybe
      the
      opposite
      is
      true
      now.
      Idk
      Life
      is
      ups
      and
      downs,
      ups
      and
      downs.
      I
      try
      to
      take
      hope
      in
      this,
      and
      I
      hope
      u
      could
      too.

      I
      hate
      parties
      too,
      because
      I
      hate
      shallow
      conversations
      that
      usually
      occur
      at
      them.
      I
      don't
      like
      mingling
      too
      much
      because
      I
      don't
      get
      to
      understand
      how
      a
      person
      is
      actually
      doing,
      you
      only
      get
      the
      surface
      stuff,
      which
      I
      guess
      is
      ok
      to
      know
      but
      gets
      old
      fast
      and
      I
      become
      pessimistic
      half
      way
      thru
      a
      party

      I
      feel
      like
      it's
      a
      BPD
      thing
      to
      cut
      someone
      off
      when
      it
      gets
      difficult,
      so
      that's
      why
      I
      don't
      want
      to
      be
      rash.
      I
      try
      to
      be
      open
      and
      honest,
      but
      most
      times
      I
      just
      want
      to
      answer
      "I
      don't
      know".
      I
      feel
      pressured
      to
      give
      an
      answer
      even
      if
      it's
      not
      really
      super
      accurate
      so
      he
      feels
      like
      he's
      doing
      his
      job,
      bc
      again
      I
      don't
      want
      to
      hurt
      his
      feelings.

      Shampoo.
      I've
      had
      really
      bad
      dandruff
      my
      whole
      life,
      and
      recently
      I
      started
      to
      use
      bentonite
      clay
      instead
      of
      shampoo.
      My
      scalp
      is
      completely
      clear
      and
      my
      hair
      is
      clean.

      that
      hurt
      when
