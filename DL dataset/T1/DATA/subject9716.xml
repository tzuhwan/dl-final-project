      Yeah
      it
      was
      that
      cunt
      class
      bully
      Kevin,
      I
      didn't
      want
      to
      tell
      the
      teacher
      out
      of
      fear
      but
      he
      and
      I
      both
      knew
      that
      the
      pencil
      meant
      more
      to
      him
      than
      it
      did
      to
      me.
      You
      see
      Kevin
      was
      a
      troubled
      child,
      he
      was
      in
      and
      out
      of
      the
      office
      and
      most
      of
      the
      time
      he
      was
      in
      class
      he
      would
      act
      up
      and
      try
      to
      be
      funny
      but
      would
      snap
      from
      time
      to
      time,
      yelling
      and
      making
      the
      teacher
      even
      more
      depressed.
      Kevin's
      mother
      was
      a
      chain
      smoker
      and
      most
      of
      the
      household
      beat
      Kevin
      like
      a
      punching
      bag.
      Kevin
      was
      almost
      a
      stillborn
      but
      unfortunately
      he
      managed
      to
      live,
      Kevin
      grew
      worse
      as
      the
      year
      progressed
      he
      even
      brought
      a
      knife
      to
      school
      to
      make
      the
      teacher
      pay
      for
      making
      him
      sit
      in
      the
      corner,
      he
      was
      held
      down
      and
      was
      suspended
      for
      a
      month.
      Kevin
      when
      he
      returned
      was
      cover
      in
      brutal
      sores
      and
      purple
      marks
      hidden
      with
      long
      sleeve
      shirts
      and
      hoodies
      I
      saw
      them
      when
      he
      was
      stomping
      around
      and
      making
      a
      mess.
      I
      didn't
      tell
      the
      teacher
      or
      anyone
      else
      for
      that
      matter
      because
      of
      fear
      that
      who
      ever
      did
      that
      to
      Kevin
      would
      come
      after
      me.
      Kevin
      and
      I
      grew
      close
      after
      grade
      2
      and
      him
      and
      I
      soon
      became
      friends,
      we
      would
      share
      secrets
      and
      tell
      each
      other
      everything.
      We
      made
      into
      middle
      school
      together
      and
      grew
      even
      closer,
      so
      close
      that
      we
      figured
      out
      that
      we
      were
      both
      gay,
      we
      experimented
      and
      Kevin
      expressed
      great
      emotion
      for
      me
      .
      By
      high
      school
      me
      and
      Kevin
      were
      lovers
      and
      the
      entire
      school
      knew,
      Kevin
      told
      me
      he
      wanted
      to
      marry
      I
      simply
      told
      him
      to
      wait
      until
      the
      prom
      where
      he
      was
      to
      propose.
      Kevin
      saved
      for
      2
      years
      to
      buy
      me
      the
      most
      beautiful
      ring
      he
      could
      find,
      he
      had
      it
      engraved
      with
      the
      year
      we
      met
      it
      and
      read
      "Throughout
      my
      life
      you
      were
      the
      consent
      and
      kept
      me
      together".
      He
      rented
      a
      limo
      for
      us
      to
      arrive
      in,
      by
      the
      night
      of
      the
      prom,
      Kevin
      arrived
      in
      a
      expensive
      suit,
      he
      had
      waited
      for
      this
      moment
      for
      the
      entirety
      of
      high
      school,
      we
      got
      into
      the
      limo
      and
      went
      to
      prom.
      By
      the
      time
      we
      got
      there
      everyone
      was
      clapping
      for
      us
      and
      our
      courage,
      Kevin
      was
      a
      Straight
      A
      student,
      a
      volunteer
      at
      the
      local
      homeless
      shelter
      and
      had
      a
      part
      time
      job
      at
      a
      up
      and
      coming
      law
      firm.
      When
      king
      and
      queen
      were
      announced
      both
      me
      and
      Kevin
      were
      selected
      we
      were
      both
      king,
      Kevin
      was
      in
      tears
      and
      told
      everyone
      that
      this
      was
      the
      best
      day
      of
      his
      life,
      that's
      when
      he
      got
      down
      on
      his
      knee
      and
      asked
      me
      to
      marry
      him
      in
      front
      of
      the
      whole
      school.
      I
      was
      a
      mess
      and
      was
      sobbing,
      Kevin
      had
      a
      smile
      on
      his
      face,
      my
      sobbing
      quickly
      grew
      to
      laughter,
      Kevin's
      face
      grew
      confused,
      I
      started
      to
      laugh
      more
      and
      more
      and
      then
      stopped.
      I
      simply
      reached
      into
      my
      pocket
      and
      pulled
      put
      a
      pencil,
      I
      smacked
      him
      with
      it
      and
      told
      that
      idiot
      to
      die,
      and
      with
      that
      I
      walked
      off.

      Kevin
      was
      devastated
      by
      my
      actions
      at
      the
      prom,
      he
      continued
      to
      call
      for
      the
      next
      4
      months
      he
      wanted
      to
      know
      why
      the
      pencil
      and
      what
      he
      could
      do
      to
      win
      me
      back,
      I
      moved
      into
      a
      different
      house
      and
      change
      my
      phone
      number.
      He
      said
      if
      it
      was
      the
      long
      hours
      he
      worked
      that
      drew
      us
      apart,
      but
      I
      didn't
      say
      a
      thing.
      Kevin
      was
      left
      a
      broken
      man
      and
      a
      hollow
      person,
      he
      got
      into
      a
      bar
      fight
      where
      he
      was
      drinking
      away
      his
      sorrows
      and
      was
      left
      in
      critical
      condition
      because
      the
      other
      man
      had
      brought
      a
      knife,
      Kevin's
      family
      did
      not
      visit
      him,
      Kevin
      really
      had
      no
      other
      close
      friends
      aside
      from
      me.
      Kevin's
      medical
      bills
      were
      astronomical
      high
      and
      Kevin
      couldn't
      pay
      them
      he
      lost
      his
      job
      due
      to
      coming
      in
      drunk
      and
      pissed
      on
      the
      receptionist
      desk.
      Kevin
      found
      out
      where
      I
      moved
      and
      begged
      me
      to
      take
      me
      back,
      I
      simply
      opened
      the
      door
      and
      spat
      on
      him.
      Kevin
      stayed
      in
      that
      defeated
      position
      for
      hours
      before
      he
      just
      laid
      on
      the
      road
      sobbing.
      I
      threw
      a
      pencil
      at
      him.

      Considering
      that
      fuel
      plays
      justice
      next,
      trill
      should
      should
      at
      least
      be
      played
      so
      he
      can
      have
      a
      chance
      to
      prove
      himself
      starting
      over
      oge.
      Though
      what's
      gonna
      happen
      most
      likely
      is
      trill
      is
      gonna
      ride
      the
      bench
      indefinitely
      unless
      oge
      gets
      sick/injured.

      OGE
      is
      an
      extremely
      emotional
      player
      though
      you
      can
      tell
      since
      if
      fuel
      loses
      their
      first
      map
      then
      they
      will
      lose
      the
      series.
      I
      think
      what
      fuel
      should
      do
      is
      for
      them
      to
      implement
      what
      they
      did
      with
      taimou
      and
      akm
      so
      if
      OGE
      is
      feeling
      confident
      he
      should
      be
      played
      and
      otherwise
      trill.

      Vancouver
      titans
      now
      is
      not
      OWL
      level,
      as
      fanboy-triggering
      as
      that
      sounds.
      People
      loved
      them
      for
      their
      underdog
      streak,
      and
      their
      vibrant
      brand/personality,
      but
      expecting
      them
      to
      get
      pick
      up
      is
      very
      unrealistic.
      They
      still
      have
      to
      actually
      win
      something
      first.
      At
      the
      same
      time,
      I'd
      honestly
      advise
      Harsha
      to
      sell
      Bumper,
      Stitch
      and
      Haksal
      and
      then
      rebuild.
      Those
      buyouts
      money
      can
      help
      Vancouver
      titans
      for
      a
      few
      more
      seasons.

      Gonna
      be
      spicy
      with
      this
      one.
      **Titans
      2-4
      Dynasty**
      Dynasty
      is
      looking
      like
      a
      championship
      tier
      team
      especially
      with
      marve1
      cosplaying
      as
      Kobe.
      I
      don't
      have
      too
      much
      faith
      in
      Titans
      ability
      to
      play
      the
      orisa
      sigma
      effectively
      though
      I
      wouldn't
      be
      too
      surprised
      if
      they
      grinded
      the
      hell
      out
      of
      scrims
      they
      are
      the
      #1
      seed
      after
      all.
      **Spark
      1-4
      Gladiators**
