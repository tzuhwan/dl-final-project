      Why
      is
      Lynette
      accused
      of
      emasculating
      Tom
      whenever
      she
      tries
      to
      stop
      him
      making
      stupid
      decisions?

      It's
      a
      constant
      theme
      that
      Lynette
      "emasculates"
      Tom.
      But
      seriously,
      all
      I
      see
      is
      her
      giving
      reasonable
      arguments
      to
      decisions
      that
      could
      potentially
      affect
      their
      family
      in
      a
      bad
      way.
      The
      pizza
      place
      almost
      ruined
      them,
      and
      Lynette
      was
      just
      offering
      logical
      advice
      beforehand
      to
      yet
      another
      of
      his
      random
      mid-life
      crisises.
      I
      thought
      married
      couples
      were
      supposed
      to
      discuss
      life
      changing
      decisions,
      but
      whenever
      she
      tries
      to
      have
      a
      say
      on
      things
      that
      will
      affect
      her
      and
      her
      children,
      she's
      accused
      of
      being
      a
      ball
      breaker.
      It's
      like
      Tom
      is
      a
      petulant
      child
      with
      an
      inferiority
      complex,
      who'd
      risk
      everything
      to
      prove
      a
      point
      to
      his
      much
      more
      sensible
      wife.

      if

      it
      could
      well
      be
      a
      club.
      Just

      I
      studied

      neuropsychology,

      I
      agree
      there
      someone
      can
      be
      a
      paedophile
      (harbouring
      an
      unhealthy
      sexual
      desire
      of
      children)
      but
      not
      a
      child
      molester
      (a
      paedophile
      who
      acts
      on
      said
      desires).
      Those
      of

      to
      be

      Probably
      because
      the
      majority
      of

      It's

      afterall,
      right?
      The

      children's
      clothes
      increases
      with
      the

      so
      surely
      this
      should
      apply
      to
      adult

      It

      buying

      It

      to
      forgive,

      I

      as

      5
      years

      as

      You're
      not
      bursting
      a

      I
      kinda
      cottoned

      that
      they
      must
      have
      been
      in
      contact
      beforehand.
      She
      just
      decided
      to
      approach
      me
      about
      it
      at
      that
      time
      of
      vulnerability.
      Maybe
      on
      some
      level,
      she
      was
      trying
      to
      replace
      the
      suicide
      with
      an
      issue
      that
      might
      be
      easier
      to
      deal
      with
      emotionally.
      But
      it
      all
      worked
      out
      in
      the
      end,
      and
      I'm
      honestly
      glad
      they're
      happy
      together.

      when
      you've
      felt
      most
      betrayed,
      and
      at
      this
      point,
      I
      did.
      It
      was
      both
      of
      us
      against
      the
      world
      when
      our
      father
      committed
      suicide,
      so
      I
      thought
      we'd
      have
      each
      other's
      back
      that
      time.
      Back
      then
      it
      was
      selfish
      and
      ignorant
      to
      think
      of
      it
      as
      a
      triple
      rejection,
      as
      opposed
      to
      supporting
      her
      pain
      and
      outlets
      of
      that,
      regardless.
      It's
      hard
      in
      the
      moment,
      which
      is
      why
      I
      find
      that
      time
      facilitates
      reflection,
      which
      in
      turn
      allows
      you
      to
      consider
      the
      actions
      of
      others.

      When
      people/children
      are
      exposed
      to
      suicide,
      it
      becomes
      a
      reality,
      rather
      than
      something
      people
      just
      talk
      about.
      It's
      a
      taboo
      that
      suddenly
      becomes
      accessible,
      or
      something
      that
      can
      be
      done.
      Stats
      show
      that
      familial
      suicides
      cause
      consequential
      ones.
      My
      father's
      inquest
      deemed
      him
      of
      sound
      mind
      with
      his,
      but
      my
      sister
      was
      declared
      too
      intoxicated
      and
      a
      'cry
      for
      help'.
      Unfortunately,
      her
      boyfriend
      killed
      himself
      too
      a
      year
      later.
      It's
      a
      sad
      residual
      effect.

      usually.
      But
      as

      said,
      as
      the
      age

      vodka

      I
      had
      it
      a
      lot
      whilst
      at
      uni,
      including
      hallucinations.
      The
      worst
      was
      when
      I
      couldn't
      move,
      but
      I
      could
      see
      a
      figure
      crouched
      over
      the
      desk
      at
      the
      bottom
      of
      my
      bed.
      It
      turned
      it's
      head,
      and
      all
      I
      could
      see
      was
      a
      sinister
      dark
      figure
      with
      bright
      red
      eyes
      looking
      at
      me.
      Absolutely
      terrifying.

      I
      think
      you're
      over-analysing
      your
      interactions
      with
      girls
      now
      you've
      lost
      weight.
      Congrats
      btw
      (that's
      not
      a
      come
      on).

      That
      I
      still
      help
      support
      my
      mother
      in
      little
      ways
      (bills,
      chores,
      emotional
      support),
      despite
      not
      living
      with
      her.
      I
      truly
      appreciate
      and
      respect
      my
      mother's
      kindness,
      whereas
      all
      my
      siblings
      take
      advantage
      of
      it.
      I
      don't
      want
      acknowledgement,
      I
      just
      wish
      they'd
      realise
      I'll
      always
      be
      there
      for
      my
      ma,
      no
      matter
      what,
      and
      to
      appreciate
      that
      -
      put
      their
      selfishness
      aside,
      and
      act
      like
      they
      care
      so
      I
      don't
      feel
      I
      have
      to
      hold
      up
      the
      fort
      on
      my
      own.
      It'd
      be
      nice
      to
      catch
      a
      break
      without
      worrying
      I'm
      the
      only
      one
      who
      gives
      a
      damn.

      Growing
      up
      as
      a
      totally
      normal
      family,
      being
      particularly
      close
      with
      my
      dad.
      His
      suicide
      at
      our
      home
      leading
      to
      multiple
      other
      suicides
      in
      the
      immediate
      family
      and
      mental
      health
      issues.
      The
      rest
      of
      the
      family
      still
      suffer
      so
      much
      in
      that
      respect.
      I've
      coped
      by
      my
      favourite
      quote,
      "worst
      things
      happen
      at
      sea".
      I've
      never
      been
      to
      sea,
      of
      course,
      but
      I
      see
      problems
      of
      today
      so
      trivial
      in
      comparison.
      The
      day
      my
      father
      went,
      part
      of
      me
      left
      too.
      I
      would
      hate
      for
      anyone
      to
      feel
      that
      pain,
      so
      making
      people
      happy
      is
      somewhat
      restorative
      for
      me.

      I
      completely
      concur.
      I
      used
      to
      promote
      bands
      of
      the
      rock
      genre
      -
      heavy
      metal
      owns
      my
      heart
      -
      but
      going
      to
      festivals
      has
      just
      never
      appealed
      to
      me.
      I
      think
      music
      can
      be
      a
      personal
      thing,
      not
      just
      in
      the
      creation
      of
      it,
      but
      in
      the
      way
      people
      enjoy
      it.
      I'm
      glad
      I'm
      not
      the
      only
      one.

      Dementia
      is
      so
      heart
      breaking
      for
      all
      involved.
      What
      kind
      of
      dementia?
      Have
      you
      thought
      about
      putting
      things
      towards
      a
      memory
      box
      when
      she's
      having
      a
      good
      day?
      Music
      she
      liked
      in
      her
      youth,
      pictures,
      pop
      groups,
      places
      she/you
      both
      visited.
      I
      did
      an
      advocacy
      program
      here
      for
      people
      with
      dementia
      (early
      stages),
      and
      these
      boxes
      really
      helped
      with
      both
      parties.
      Mainly
      though,
      I've
      found
      songs
      to
      be
      the
      most
      profound
      thing
      in
      relaxing
      the
      horrible
      anxiety
      of
      dementia.
      Find
      something
      she
      used
      to
      love
      in
      her
      teens.
      Respect
      that
      it's
      a
      degenerative
      disease,
      amd
      will
      get
      worse.
      Just
      find
      ways
      to
      make
      her
      feel
      better
      and
      more
      comfortable.
      She's
      lucky
      to
      have
      someone
      like
      you
      who
      cares.
      And
      that's
      the
      most
      important
      thing.
      My
      heart
      goes
      out
      to
      you
      all.

      I
      fantasize
      about
      going

      all
      day,

      in
      finally
      getting
      there.

      How
      do
      you
      deal
      with
      it
      all
      when
      you
      suddenly
      realise
      the
      damage
      you've
      done
      to
      yourself?
      I
      don't
      really
      care
      what
      other
      people
      think.
      It's
      been
      years,
      and
      I'm
      used
      to
      the
      looks.
      I
      just
      want
      the
      scars
      to
      go
      away,
      because
      they
      make
      me
      feel
      as
      though
      there
      was
      some
      hateful
      and
      insidious
      person
      hijacking
      my
      mind
      and
      body
      for
      so
      long.
      How
      do
      you
      accept
      it
      in
      yourself?
      After
      the
      temptations
      fad
      away,
      how
      do
      you
      rid
      yourself
      of
      the
      shame?

      I
      found
      my
      first
      few
      times,
      the
      biggest
      bitch
      was
      the
      damage
      from
      the
      gurning.
      So
      yeah,
      magnesium
      a
      few
      hours
      before
      and
      plenty
      of
      chewing
      gum
      during.
      The
      eating
      thing
      is
      just
      because
      your
      appetite
      is
      so
      suppressed,
      and
      you
      may
      not
      be
      able
      to
      eat
      the
      next
      day,
      so
      it's
      like
      preparing
      for
      a
      potential
      fast.
      Your
      body
      takes
      so
      much
      longer
      to
      recover
      with
      no
      sustainance.

      I
      think
      ugly
      has
      a
      different
      meaning
      for
      animals
      compared
      to
      humans.
      Has
      anyone
      heard
      the
      phrase,
      "n'awwww,
      he's
      so
      ugly,
      he's
      cute!"
      when
      a
      weird
      looking
      dog
      comes
      into
      the
      room?
      Funny
      thought
      though
      -
      when
      someone
      describes
      a
      dog
      as
      ugly,
      it's
      purely
      the
      dog's
      appearance
      they're
      talking
      about.
      Whereas
      if
      someone
      says
      a
      person
      is
      ugly,
      it
      could
      mean
      their
      face,
      actions,
      intentions,
      personality,
      etc.

      A
      reporter
      turned
      up
      to
      my
      sister's
      inquest
      after
      she
      committed
      suicide.
      Suspicions
      were
      raised
      about
      a
      pregnancy
      termination
      that
      were
      refuted
      by
      her
      GP.
      The
      reporter
      completely
      ignored
      this
      and
      reported
      in
      a
      national
      newspaper
      that
      she
      killed
      herself
      after
      having
      an
      abortion.
      Eight
      years
      on
      and
      they
      still
      refuse
      to
      retract
      the
      article
      despite
      the
      facts.
      There
      were
      real
      issues
      leading
      to
      her
      suicide
      that
      should
      have
      been
      highlighted.

      It
      depends
      on
      your
      reasoning.
      Morbid
      curiosity
      is
      just
      natural
      I
      think.
      I
      used
      to
      look
      at
      it
      daily
      when
      some
      pretty
      terrible
      stuff
      happened
      in
      my
      life.
      Sounds
      weird,
      but
      it
      was
      a
      reminder
      that
      there
      were
      people
      out
      there
      suffering
      way
      more
      than
      I
      was.
      Stopped
      me
      spiralling
      into
      a
      world
      of
      self
      pity,
      and
      blaming
      my
      actions
      on
      traumatic
      events.

      I've
      found
      this
      (for
      me)
      comes
      down
      to
      how
      different
      genders
      are
      used
      to
      conflict.
      As
      in

      are
      used
      to
      saying
      something
      to

      females
      and
      being
      reassured
      with
      a
      negative
      sandwich.
      I've
      found
      men
      to
      be
      much
      more
      forthright,
      and
      women
      just
      don't
      wanna
      hear
      the
      honest
      truth
      at
      times
      of
      heightened
      emotion
      (eg
      you're
      being
      an
      irrational
      biatch
      right
      now).
      I've
      always
      had
      people
      tiptoe
      around
      me
      because
      of
      emotional
      traumas
      in
      my
      life,
      but
      the
      guy
      I'm
      with
      knows
      everything
      and
      isn't
      afraid
      to
      call
      me
      on
      my
      bullshit.
      Infuriating
      at
      the
      time,
      but
      gains
      a
      lot
      of
      respect.

      Totally
      right.
      You
      shouldn't
      ever
      assume
      that
      someon's
      way
      of
      communicating
      is
      a
      personal
      attack
      on
      you.
      Everyone's
      different.

      Girls
      tend
      to
      enjoy
      congregating
      and
      discussing
      another
      friend
      who
      isn't
      there,
      and
      coming
      to
      a
      conclusion
      about
      said
      absent
      friend.
      They
      then
      come
      to
      a
      satisfied
      unconfirmed
      conclusion
      and
      feel
      as
      though
      they've
      been
      a
      good
      friend.
      Whereas
      they
      could
      just
      talk
      to
      the
      person
      and
      find
      out
      what's
      up
      themselves.

      "When
      in
      Rome".
      It
      just
      tends
      to
      happen.
      Muscle
      memory,
      maybe?

      So
      raw
      and
      so
      relatable.
      With
      all
      due
      respect,
      I'm
      glad
      I'm
      not
      alone.

      I
      think
      that's
      the
      problem
      -
      "trying"
      to
      own
      them.
      It's
      a
      major
      battle
      that
      isn't
      considered
      after
      the
      acute
      stage
      of
      self
      harm.
      Someone
      who
      stops
      cutting
      (or
      other
      whichways
      they
      harm)
      seems
      to
      be
      left
      with
      no
      recovery,
      no
      relapse
      minimalization,
      and
      no
      coping
      strategies.
      Your
      reply
      was
      very
      helpful.
      Thank
      you
      for
      being
      so
      relatable.

      Four
      months
      ago
      was
      the
      last
      time
      I
      self
      harmed.
      I
      stabbed
      myself
      in
      the
      leg
      three
      times
      with
      a
      kitchen
      knife.
      Where
      did
      that
      jump
      from
      razorblade
      stiches
      to
      actually
      stabbing
      myself
      come
      from?
      I'm
      totally
      torn
      between
      new
      physical
      boundaries
      self
      harm
      me
      wants
      to
      explore,
      and
      fear
      of
      what
      I
      could
      do
      if
      I
      relapse.
      Did
      anyone
      have
      a
      point
      where
      "enough
      was
      enough"?
      How
      did
      you
      cope?
      Please?

      I've
      looked
      back
      at
      some
      of
      my
      self
      harm
      diaries,
      and
      this
      was
      a
      common
      theme.
