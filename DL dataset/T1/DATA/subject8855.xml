      a
      bad
      idea
      to
      be
      friends

      ex
      right
      after
      we
      broke

      My
      boyfriend
      just
      broke
      up
      with
      me.
      I
      tried
      to
      cut
      him
      out
      my
      life
      but
      he #8217;s
      my
      only
      real
      friend
      and
      I
      can #8217;t
      do
      that.
      I #8217;m
      still
      in
      love
      with
      him
      but
      he
      doesn #8217;t
      have
      the
      same
      feelings.
      We #8217;ve
      been
      together
      for
      a
      little
      over
      a
      year.
      It #8217;s
      so
      hard
      to
      resist
      the
      urge
      to
      call
      him
      or
      text
      him.
      I
      don #8217;t
      know
      who
      I
      am
      anymore.
      He
      wants
      to
      have
      the
      same
      relationship
      just
      none
      of
      the
      romance
      part.
      Our
      relationship
      was
      perfect,
      he
      just
      felt
      like
      I
      put
      more
      time
      into
      the
      relationship
      more
      than
      he
      did,
      which
      is
      true.
      Is
      it
      healthier
      to
      stop
      talking
      to
      him
      or
      should
      I
      keep
      a
      friendship
      between
      us?

      I #8217;m
      still
      so
      in
      love
      with
      you.
      It
      makes
      me
      sad
      how
      you
      haven #8217;t
      been
      in
      love
      with
      my
      for
      months
      but
      never
      told
      me.
      I
      rethink
      every
      time
      you
      said
      I
      love
      you
      and
      how
      it
      was
      a
      lie.
      My
      heart
      hurts
      so
      much.
      Not
      talking
      to
      you
      is
      the
      hardest
      thing
      to
      do.
      I
      know
      I
      need
      to
      avoid
      communication.
      Hopefully
      you
      wonder
      how
      I #8217;m
      doing
      and
      reach
      out
      to
      me
      if
      you
      truly
      do
      feel
      you
      want
      to
      be
      friends
      with
      me.
      I
      don #8217;t
      know
      how
      to
      live
      anymore.
      Everything
      I
      see
      reminds
      me
      of
      you.
      I
      just
      stare
      at
      the
      wall
      in
      silence.
      When
      we
      talked
      you
      made
      it
      sound
      like
      the
      possibility
      of
      getting
      back
      together
      was
      very
      high,
      I
      hope
      you
      truly
      meant
      that.
      Your
      my
      best
      friend
      and
      the
      thought
      of
      not
      talking
      to
      you
      physically
      hurts
      me.
      I
      love
      you
      so
      much

      You
      were
      the
      perfect
      boyfriend.
      Not
      abusive
      not
      toxic
      not
      controlling.
      For
      the
      past
      couple
      months
      I
      felt
      you
      didn #8217;t
      put
      me
      as
      your
      priority,
      which
      was
      true.
      We #8217;re
      young
      we
      shouldn #8217;t
      be
      tied
      down
      to
      one
      person.
      But
      you
      made
      me
      think
      you
      were
      in
      the
      same
      boat
      as
      me.
      You
      made
      me
      think
      we
      were
      going
      to
      be
      together
      forever.
      Talking
      about
      where
      we
      were
      gunna
      live
      our
      kids
      names
      the
      trip
      we
      were
      going
      to
      save
      up
      on.
      I
      knew
      you
      were
      excited
      for
      this
      trip
      and
      we #8217;re
      serious
      about
      it.
      It
      makes
      no
      sense.
      You
      had
      time
      to
      start
      detaching
      from
      me
      while
      I
      was
      getting
      even
      more
      attached.
      I
      don #8217;t
      want
      to
      live
      anymore.
      I
      feel
      like
      I #8217;m
      never
      gunna
      stop
      crying.
      I
      feel
      like
      this
      feeling
      will
      never
      go
      away.

      I
      replay
      the
      last
      kiss,
      the
      last
      hug,
      the
      last
      time
      we
      hung
      out.
      I
      should
      have
      held
      you
      longer,
      kissed
      you
      harder,
      stayed
      with
      you
      a
      little
      longer.
      I
      wish
      I
      would
      have
      known
      that
      was
      the
      last
      time
      I
      would
      say
      I
      love
      you.
      I
      should
      have
      done
      so
      many
      things
      differently.
      I
      want
      to
      go
      back
      in
      time,
      I
      just
      want
      to
      change
      the
      past.
      I
      need
      to
      stop
      calling
      you.
      I
      know
      I #8217;m
      hurting
      you
      making
      you
      listen
      to
      me
      cry.
      I #8217;m
      sorry
      I
      can #8217;t
      let
      go.
      I
      know

      This
      gives
      me
      a
      lot
      of
      hope
      of
      moving
      on.
      Right
      now
      it
      seems
      impossible
      to
      move
      on
      personally,
      but
      the
      fact
      that
      others
      have
      makes
      me
      happy:)

      for
      this
      advice
      I #8217;ll
      try

      everything
      I
      liked
      my
      ex
      liked.
      And
      everything
      reminds
      me
      of
      him.

      the

      All
      day
      I
      think
      about
      you.
      Even
      when
      we
      were
      together
      I
      would
      daydream
      about
      you
      everyday.
      Now
      these
      dreams
      are
      nightmares
      and
      I
      want
      it
      to
      stop.
      I
      want
      to
      stop
      feeling
      I
      want
      to
      stop
      thinking
      I
      want
      to
      stop
      crying
      I
      want
      to
      stop
      hurting.
      This
      has
      been
      the
      most
      miserable
      couple
      days
      of
      my
      life.
      I
      think
      about
      just
      ending
      my
      life.
      I
      know
      I #8217;ll
      never
      do
      it
      but
      the
      fact
      that
      my
      head
      even
      goes
      there
      scares
      me.
      It
      shown
      how
      much
      I
      needed
      you,
      how
      weak
      I
      am
      without
      you.
      I #8217;m
      not
      strong
      enough
      to
      go
      through
      this.
      My
      body
      and
      mind
      is
      crumbling.
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      I
      can
      take
      much
      of

      I
      get
      that
      sorry
      I
      said
      that.
      I
      feel
      the
      same
      way
      about
      my
      ex.
      I
      want
      to
      hate
      him
      but
      I
      just
      can #8217;t.
      I
      advise
      writing
      everything
      you
      feel
      and
      use
      this
      platform
      instead
      of
      messaging
      her.
      I
      know
      it #8217;s
      so
      so
      hard
      I #8217;m
      going
      through
      that
      same
      pain
      but
      it
      will
      make
      you
      heal
      faster.
      At
      least
      I
      hope
      it
      does

      Fuck

      It #8217;s
      so
      hard
      to
      not
      be
      attached
      anymore.
      People
      around
      me
      when
      they
      go
      through
      a

      say
      how
      hard
      it
      was
      to
      unattach
      and
      I
      never

      understood
      them.
      This
      feeling
      hurts
      like
      hell.

      I
      found
      mine
      today,
      a
      way
      to
      stop
      thinking
      about
      him.
      Me
      personally
      painting
      was
      my
      way
      out.
      The
      only
      thing
      that
      has
      made
      me
      feel
      better
      was
      distracting
      myself
      with
      something
      I
      can
      put
      my
      whole
      mind
      too.
      It
      was
      a
      great
      feeling,
      but
      once
      I
      stopped
      I
      fell
      back
      in
      the
      hole

      That #8217;s

      Today
      was
      surprisingly
      really
      good.
      I
      haven #8217;t
      cried,
      I
      talked
      to
      my
      ex
      because
      he
      reached
      out.
      I #8217;m
      not
      sure
      if
      it
      was
      a
      good
      idea
      to
      respond
      but
      it
      made
      me
      feel
      a
      lot
      better
      to
      know
      he
      genuinely
      wants
      to
      keep
      a
      relationship
      with
      me
      even
      if
      we #8217;re
      just
      friends.
      I
      talked
      to
      someone
      going
      through
      a
      breakup
      also
      and
      it
      feels
      so
      good
      to
      talk
      to
      someone
      that
      really
      knows
      and
      feels
      what
      I #8217;m
      talking
      about.
      My
      friends
      are
      supportive
      but
      it #8217;s
      just
      not
      the
      same
      you
      know.
      I
      feel
      like
      there #8217;s
      a
      lot
      of
      hope.
      I
      haven #8217;t
      felt
      this
      free
      in
      a
      while.
      This
      might
      be
      a
      faze
      and
      I #8217;ll
      go
      back
      into
      a
      sad
      hole
      tomorrow
      but
      let #8217;s
      hope
      it #8217;s
      not.

      So
      my
      ex
      texted
      me
      this
      morning
      after
      making
      eye
      contact
      in
      school
      for
      the
      first
      time
      since
      he
      broke
      up
      with
      me.
      He
      said
      he
      wants
      to
      talk
      after
      school.
      What
      does
      that
      mean?
      Should
      I
      keep
      my
      hopes
      up?
      I
      he
      does
      want
      to
      get
      back
      together
      do
      I
      take
      him
      back?
      Idk
      what
      to
      do.
      What
      if
      he
      does
      this
      to
      me
      again,
      I
      wouldn #8217;t
      be
      able
      to
      handle
      it.
      Why
      did
      he
      have
      to
      lose
      me
      to
      realized
      he
      would
      miss
      me.
      If
      he
      doesn #8217;t
      love
      me
      anymore
      how
      could
      his
      feelings
      change
      just
      like
      that.
      It #8217;s
      so
      confusing.
