      I
      can't
      breathe
      for
      shit
      because
      of
      my
      allergies
      so
      i
      had
      to
      pop
      ny
      oxy
      by
      mouth
      which
      i
      rarely
      do.
      After
      about
      25
      minutes
      max,
      I
      threw
      up.
      I'm
      a
      bit
      high
      but
      it
      was
      supposed
      to
      be
      so
      much
      better
      than
      this.
      I
      am
      so
      disappointed

      idk,

      feel

      no
      one
      wants
      the

      advertised.
      And
      a
      real

      man
      definitely
      would
      freak

      I've

      happen
      once,
      I
      was

      and
      it
      scared
      the
      shit
      out
      of
      me.
      It
      took
      a
      lot
      of
      reading
      about
      it
      for

      to
      literally
      not
      think
      my
      house
      was
      haunted.
      Lol.
      But
      yeah,
      the
      time
      I
      experienced
      it
      I
      was
      super
      sick,
      not
      on

      I
      tell
      myself
      I'm
      not
      really
      an
      addict
      all
      the
      time.
      I
      rarely
      miss
      work
      and
      very
      few
      people
      know
      I
      use.
      I
      have
      done
      terrible
      things
      for
      drugs
      but
      currently
      am
      not,
      so
      I
      lie
      to
      myself.
      I
      tell
      myself
      I'm
      not
      that
      bad.
      But
      ANYTIME
      I
      go
      through
      even
      a
      little
      wd
      symptoms,
      I'm
      a
      crabby
      ass
      bitch
      who
      is
      CLEARLY
      very
      addicted
      to
      opiates.
      Keeping
      my
      job
      doesn't
      make
      me
      not
      an
      addict,
      unfortunately.

      I
      guess
      what
      i
      meant
      morseo
      is
      that
      I
      don't
      do
      anyhting
      in
      my
      mind
      "morally
      wrong"
      for
      my
      drugs
      so
      it
      seems
      "less
      of
      a
      problem"
      to
      me
      and
      I
      can
      tell
      myself
      I'm
      not
      that
      deep
      because
      of
      it.
      Even
      though
      realistically
      I'm
      addicted
      physically
      and
      mentally
      to
      some
      degree.

      I
      knew
      I'd
      be
      in
      Canada
      for
      2
      hours.
      If
      I
      was
      STAYING
      in
      Canada,
      I'd
      have
      had
      drugs
      in
      my
      vagina.
      But
      I
      KNEW
      you'd
      have
      something
      for
      me
      on
      the
      other
      side.
      That
      has
      absolutely
      no
      correlation
      to
      how
      addicted
      I
      am,
      only
      how
      smart
      I
      am.
      And
      not
      bringing
      ANYTHING
      into
      Canada
      considering
      they
      DID
      search
      me
      was
      really
      fucking
      smart
      on
      my
      part.
      It's
      not
      what
      I
      wanted
      as
      an
      addict,
      just
      the
      smarter
      of
      the
      two
      choices.

      you
      and

      you
      need.

      If
      you
      aren't
      looking
      for
      closure,
      I'm
      not
      really
      sure
      what
      it
      is
      you
      are
      looking
      for?
      You
      want
      to
      know
      why
      they
      wouldn't
      be
      honest....
      well
      it's
      because
      they
      lied.
      You
      have
      your
      answer.
      There
      is
      seldom
      an
      interesting
      or
      different
      reason
      than
      they
      aren't
      comfortable
      with
      their
      body
      image.
      It
      seems
      you
      already
      know
      why
      this
      person
      did
      what
      they
      did,
      so
      if
      you
      don't
      want
      closure
      I'd
      say
      fuck
      this
      and
      move
      on.
      If
      you
      don't
      need
      closure,
      why
      bother
      with
      any
      of
      this?
      You
      don't
      need
      closure
      so
      none
      of
      it
      actually
      matters.
      Good
      luck
      finding
      whatever
      it
      is
      you
      are
      looking
      for
      though

      this

      a

      I
      was
      really

      this

      Well
      hey
      just
      remember
      to
      use
      protection,
      from
      the
      way
      you
      talk
      you
      probably
      don't
      need
      it
      though....
      sounds
      like
      you
      have
      tons
      of
      unprotected
      sex
      and
      are
      just
      riddled
      with
      diseases
      to
      be
      honest.
      Be
      careful
      out
      there,
      champ!

      I
      feel
      so
      sorry
      for
      you.
      Good
      luck
      buddy.
      Try
      to
      keep
      in
      mind
      that
      there
      is
      absolutely
      no
      reason
      to
      hurt
      people
      the
      way
      ypu
      do.
      No
      one
      deserves
      it.
      And
      you
      really
      need
      help
      and
      it
      is
      out
      there
      for
      you.
      But
      you
      need
      to
      want
      to
      be
      better.
      I
      used
      to
      be
      very
      narcissistic
      like
      yourself.
      You're
      at
      a
      critical
      age
      for
      that.
      Things
      will
      get
      better.
      I
      hope
      you
      soon
      have
      an
      experience
      that
      teaches
      you
      how
      wrong
      this
      is
      and
      changes
      your
      views.
      It's
      really
      sad
      to
      see
      this,
      and
      frankly
      sickening.
      I
      am
      so
      very
      sorry
      for
      you.
      For
      your
      sake
      and
      the
      poor
      woman
      that
      end

      Preface:
      i
      was
      catfished
      for
      a
      year
      and
      a
      half.
      I
      met
      a
      man
      on
      Tumblr
      and
      after
      some
      time
      I
      found
      out
      that
      he
      was
      not
      who
      he
      said
      he
      was.
      I
      have
      hit
      rock
      bottom
      before
      where
      I
      had
      nowhere
      to
      stay,
      very
      little
      clothes,
      a
      cell
      phone
      that
      I
      rarely
      could
      actually
      pay
      off
      each
      month
      so
      I
      was
      reliant
      on
      wireless
      internet.
      Because
      of
      this
      experience,
      when
      I
      met
      someone
      else
      going
      through
      the
      same
      struggles,
      I
      was
      in
      a
      very
      vulnerable
      position
      and
      it
      was
      very
      easy
      for
      me
      to
      believe
      that
      he
      would
      not
      lie
      about
      having
      some
      of
      the
      issues
      he
      did.
      Little
      did
      I
      know
      that
      is
      a
      common
      tactic
      for
      catfish
      to
      use.
      A
      user
      here
      from
      Reddit
      helped
      me
      in
      finding
      my
      catfish
      and
      understanding
      why
      these
      people
      sometimes
      do
      what
      they
      do.
      In
      a
      sense
      I
      was
      able
      to
      forgive
      my
      catfish.
      It
      was
      absolutely
      not
      all
      forgiven,
      but
      talking
      to
      someone
      who
      has
      experience
      as
      a
      catfish,
      it
      made
      it
      easier
      for
      me
      to
      put
      myself
      in
      my
      cat
      catfish's
      shoes
      and
      understand
      why
      he
      may
      have
      done
      what
      he
      did.
      He
      and
      I
      spoke
      a
      few
      times
      after
      he
      was
      found
      out
      and
      admitted
      to
      me
      what
      he
      had
      done.
      We
      were
      not
      exactly
      friends,
      but
      I
      did
      not
      want
      to
      kick
      this
      man
      out
      of
      my
      life
      because
      I
      felt
      sympathy
      for
      him
      and
      because
      we
      did
      have
      a
      connection,
      I
      felt
      at
      the
      time.
      For
      a
      short
      time
      he
      and
      I
      were
      friends,
      but
      it
      didn't
      take
      long
      for
      me
      to
      realize
      that
      he
      was
      using
      more
      manipulation
      tactics
      to
      keep
      me
      as
      a
      friend.
      He
      got
      me
      again.
      I
      told
      him
      that
      the
      pity
      he
      often
      gave
      himself,
      by
      always
      telling
      me
      how
      sorry
      he
      was
      when
      really
      we
      had
      moved
      on,
      showed
      me
      that
      he
      really
      wanted
      my
      affection
      in
      a
      different
      way
      still,
      and
      that
      he
      didn't
      really
      want
      to
      accept
      just
      friendship.
      We
      stopped
      talking
      and
      I
      felt
      a
      lot
      better.
      Just
      tonight
      my
      phone
      rang.
      I
      don't
      usually
      answer
      phone
      calls
      from
      numbers
      I
      don't
      know
      but
      this
      was
      my
      area
      code
      so
      I
      actually
      picked
      it
      up.
      It
      was
      my
      catfish.
      He
      called
      me
      to
      tell
      me
      how
      he
      couldn't
      live
      without
      me
      anymore,
      that
      the
      pain
      was
      too
      real.
      He
      said
      he
      didn't
      want
      to
      do
      it
      anymore
      and
      threatened
      to
      kill
      himself
      on
      the
      phone
      with
      me.
      Although
      this
      is
      not
      his
      first
      suicide
      threat
      to
      me,
      it
      made
      me
      so
      upset.
      I
      was
      sobbing
      uncontrollably
      and
      totally
      bought
      into
      it.
      I
      feel
      so
      ridiculous
      for
      having
      fallen
      for
      something
      so
      many
      times.
      But
      at
      the
      same
      time
      I
      start
      to
      wonder,
      how
      sick
      is
      this
      person
      and
      how
      does
      no
      one
      around
      him
      see
      it?
      I
      still
      have
      pity
      for
      this
      person...
      After
      everything,
      and
      now
      he
      leaves
      me
      sobbing
      crying
      on
      the
      phone
      and
      hangs
      up
      on
      me;
      last
      words
      saying
      goodbye
      in
      a
      manner
      he
      knows
      I
      am
      taking
      as
      a
      permanent
      goodbye
      to
      life.
      It's
      amazing
      how
      long
      some
      of
      these
      people
      will
      continue
      to
      fuck
      with
      someone.
      I
      would
      loke
      to
      think
      I
      have
      learmed
      a
      lot
      from
      this,
      and
      I
      truly
      did.
      But
      it
      honestly
      does
      bother
      me
      that
      I
      let
      this
      man
      even
      phase
      me
      again.
      Before
      y'all
      say
      it,
      I'm
      calling
      verizon
      and
      requesting
      they
      block
      calls
      amd
      texts
      from
      him
      number.
      He
      is
      already
      blocked
      on
      the
      other
      few
      sociak
      networks
      he
      has.
      But
      amyway,
      that
      should
      be
      the
      end
      of
      it.
      Should
      be.
      He's
      gone
      to
      excessive
      lengths
      to
      contact
      me
      thus
      far
      but
      blocking
      him
      verizon
      will
      hopefully
      take
      care
      of
      this,
      finally.
      Him
      calling
      me
      amd
      threatenung
      something
      so
      serious
      just
      really
      upset
      me
      and
      I
      needed
      to
      get
      it
      off
      my
      chest.

      Today
      I
      went
      to
      take
      my
      dealer's
      wife
      and
      son
      so
      we
      could
      all
      go
      see
      her
      daughter
      in
      jail
      and
      my
      dealer
      informed
      me
      he
      had
      what
      I've
      been
      hunting
      for
      years....
      Opana!!!
      I
      got
      two
      30mg
      G77
      brown
      opanas
      and
      I
      am
      so
      super
      fucking
      happy.
      Wasn't
      even
      looking
      for
      them
      and
      they
      just
      showed
      up....
      what
      a
      day!
      Edit:
      Question
      for
      experienced
      opana
      users:
      bioavailability
      wise....
      if
      I
      want
      the
      highest
      percentage,
      what
      do
      I
      do,
      between
      snort
      or
      swallow?

      I
      couldn't
      believe
      it.
      I've
      never
      ever
      come
      across
      them
      in
      my
      area,

      know
      someone
      from

      who

      opana
      in

      Do
      you
      use
      opana
      often?
      I
      use
      120mg
      oxy
      most
      days.
      Do
      you

      Perfect.
      This
      is
      abdolutely
      the
      answer
      I
      was
      looking
      for.
      Thanks
      SO
      much!
      I
      know
      the
      bioavailability
      for
      oxy
      is
      higher
      orally
      so
      I
      am
      always
      skeptical
      when
      people
      say
      smort
      cause
      everyone
      seems
      to
      snort
      oxy.
      This
      is
      the
      exact
      answer
      I
      was
      looking
      for,
      thank
      you
      again!

      Thank
      you
      so
      much.
      I
      feel
      so
      stupid
      for
      feeling
      bad.
      The
      whole
      thing
      just
      messes
      me
      up.
      I
      know
      he
      is
      a
      heavy
      drug
      user,
      or
      am
      fairly
      certain
      anyhow,
      so
      part
      of
      me
      he
      gets
      messed
      up
      and
      tries
      to
      find
      ways
      to
      contact
      me?
      He
      has
      left
      me
      alone
      for
      some
      time
      now....
      and
      I
      don't
      hate
      him.
      So
      no
      matter
      what,
      the
      idea
      of
      him
      hurting
      himself
      will
      always
      hurt
      me,
      as
      i
      would
      never
      wish
      that
      upon
      anyone.
      Thank
      you
      for
      everything
      you've
      done
      with
      talking
      with
      me
      to
      help
      understand
      and
      get
      through
      my
      situation
      more.
      It
      truly
      has
      been
      so
      much
      help.

      Thank
      you.
      You're
      right.
      This
      isn't
      my
      fault
      he
      lied.
      It
      can't
      be.
      I
      can't
      let
      myself
      hurt
      over
      that.
      I
      just
      cared
      for
      this
      person
      and
      it
      is
      not
      on
      me
      for
      caring
      but
      him
      for
      lying.
      But
      also
      he
      is
      great
      at
      manipulating
      me.
      He
      is
      likely
      not
      planning
      to
      actually
      hurt
      himself.
      He
      is
      merely
      crying
      wolf
      for
      the
      umpteenth
      time.
      At
      least
      i
      think
      i
      finally
      know
      how
      to
      completely
      block
      him
      and
      avoid
      him
      all
      together.
      That
      is
      relieving
      for
      me
      at
      least.

      a
      chunk

      it
      tonight

      already

      But
      I'll

      a
      try

      I
      couldn't
      take
      it
      last
      night
      because
      I
      had
      done
      a
      little
      xan
      and
      other

      already

      this
      I
      can
      handle
      yet,
      I
      waited.
      I
      will
      be
      snorting
      half
      a
      pill
      after
      I
      get

      I
      know
      not
      to
      take
      suicide
      lightly,
      and
      thank
      you
      so
      much
      for
      understanding
      why
      I
      would
      not
      buy
      it,
      by
      you
      saying
      you
      don't
      either.
      It
      feels
      like
      a
      horrible
      thing
      to
      say....
      but
      you're
      right.
      He
      is
      likely
      only
      using
      this
      to
      manipulate
      me
      and
      I
      am
      not
      a
      bad
      person
      for
      not
      feeding
      into
      it
      anymore.
      Thank
      you

      Thank
      you.
      It
      helps
      to
      read
      that
      I
      am
      not
      wrong
      for
      now
      ignoring
      these
      threats.
      It
      definitely
      somewhat
      feels
      wrong
      but
      a
      little
      reassurance
      from
      others
      that
      I
      need
      to
      pay
      no
      mind
      to
      this
      and
      move
      on
      really
      does
      help
      me
      not
      feel
      so
      bad
      about
      this.

      I
      believe
      it
      does.
      I
      use
      opiates
      daily
      and
      have
      a
      moderate
      tolerance
      to
      them.
      Personally,
      I
      can
      take
      4
      or
      5
      grams
      of
      tolerance
      and
      avoid
      withdrawal.
      But
      I
      do
      not
      get
      any
      feelings
      of
      euphoria
      or
      any
      type
      of
      "high"
      really.
      For
      most
      opiates
      users
      with
      any
      tolerance,
      it
      will
      only
      work
      to
      stop
      some
      withdrawal
      symptoms.

      honestly.....
      your
      car
      probably
      still
      reeked.
      lol.
      when
      you
      smoke,
      your
      nose
      doesn't
      pick
      the
      smell
      up
      the
      way
      it
      should.
      I
      wouldn't
      rely
      on
      this
      method.
      or
      any
      method.
      only
      way
      to
      make
      your
      car
      not
      smell
      is
      by
      not
      smoking
      in
      it
      unfortunately.
      weed
      is
      just
      too
      smelly.
      any
      decent
      weed
      at
      least
      lol

      this
      works
      for
      me
      every
      time:
      put
      a
      lot
      of
      water
      in
      your
      mouth.
      hold
      your
      breath
      and
      plug
      your
      ears.
      slowly
      swallow
      little
      sips
      of
      the
      water
      in
      your
      mouth
      and
      hold
      your
      breath
      as
      long
      as
      you
      can.
      good
      luck
      OP.
      I
      get
      hiccups
      from
      opiate
      use,
      also
      never
      heard
      of
      it
      happening
      to
      anyone
      else
      but
      I
      get
      them
      alllll
      the
      timeeeee
      and
      this
      always
      does
      trick
      for
      me!

      People
      view
      me
      as
      an
      innocent
      young
      lady.
      That's
      what
      I
      appear
      as.
      I
      think
      I
      am
      respected
      in
      my
      community
      as
      most
      people
      tell
      me
      they
      are
      completely
      shocked
      when
      they
      find
      out
      I
      am
      an
      opiate
      addict.
      I
      got
      started
      by
      taking
      the
      pain
      killers
      prescribed
      to
      me
      by
      my
      doctor
      for
      a
      few
      different
      things;
      ovarian
      cysts,
      gum
      infection
      and
      wisdom
      teeth
      removal.
      I
      was
      21
      when
      all
      those
      things
      occurred.
      Now
      at
      25,
      I
      use
      opiates
      daily
      and
      only
      had
      about
      6
      months
      clean
      time
      since
      I
      have
      started.
      I
      enjoy
      my
      life.
      It's
      hard
      being
      an
      addict...
      spending
      all
      your
      money
      on
      a
      substance
      just
      to
      feel
      "okay".
      It
      sucks.
      It
      is
      hard.
      It
      is
      not
      cute.
      But
      at
      the
      same
      time,
      when
      I
      am
      not
      hurting
      or
      chasing....
      I
      am
      in
      pure
      bliss.
      It's
      hard
      to
      create
      boundaries
      for
      opiates.
      You
      can
      set
      them.
      But
      like
      a
      lover,
      you
      fall
      deep
      and
      the
      lines
      start
      to
      get
      blurry.
      I
      wish
      I
      could
      quit....
      moreso
      I
      wish
      I
      had
      the
      motivation
      to
      quit.
      Right
      now,
      I
      do
      not.
      I
      am
      not
      prepared
      for
      that.
      But
      I
      hope
      to
      one
      day
      be
      sober
      with
      a
      loved
      one,
      no
      kids,
      but
      I'd
      like
      to
      be
      close
      to
      my
      family
      again.
      Since
      I
      started
      using,
      that
      is
      absolutely
      what
      I
      miss
      most.
      I
      miss
      real
      love.
      Not
      artificial
      love
      I
      snort
      up
      my
      nose.

      My
      dumbass
      (who
      at
      least
      has
      some
      opana)
      fucked
      up
      and
      spent
      practically
      every
      dime
      I
      have
      and
      I'm
      legit
      starving.
      I
      hate
      resorting
      to
      change
      hunting
      and
      returning
      cans
      and
      bottles.
      It
      makes
      me
      feel
      so
      fucking
      low
      and
      I
      just
      hate
      it.
      But
      here
      I
      fucking
      am.
      Sometimes
      I
      hate
      this
      life
      but
      I
      know
      it
      will
      never
      change
      for
      me,
      only
      get
      worse.
      Fuck
      it.
      In
      5
      hours
      I
      am
      doing
      a
      little
      work
      for
      my
      aunt
      for
      money
      and
      then
      maybe
      I
      can
      snort
      an
      opana
      and
      ignore
      life
      the
      rest
      of
      the
      evening.
      Sorry
      I
      sound
      like
      such
      a
      narcissistic
      fuck,
      holy
      shit.
      I
      hope
      you
      all
      have
      a
      great
      day!
      I'm
      just
      hangry.
      Opana
      tonight.
      It's
      allllll
      okay.
      Edit:
      I
      changed
      the
      word
      begging....
      I
      do
      not
      need
      to
      beg
      my
      family
      for
      money.
      I
      asked
      her
      if
      I
      could
      help
      her
      out
      with
      some
      chores
      in
      exchange
      for
      10
      or
      20
      dollars
      for
      food,
      not
      even
      dope.
      Also,
      this
      is
      a
      rarity,
      I
      never
      do
      this,
      so
      I
      definitely
      already
      feel
      like
      complete
      shit
      about
      it.

      all

      Cops
      are
      usually
      polite
      to
      me,
      but
      I
      am
      a
      young
      looking,
      white
      female.
      So
      of
      course
      they
      are
      usually
      somewhat
      respectful
      towards
      me.
      However,
      my
      overall
      opinion
      of
      them
      is
      that
      the
      good
      cops
      will
      always
      defend
      their
      other
      LE
      officers,
      when
      an
      officer
      abuses
      their
      power,
      it
      often
      gets
      overlooked.
      And
      that
      is
      a
      major
      flaw
      in
      our
      system.
      Say
      an
      officer
      pulls
      over
      a
      man
      because
      he
      is
      black,
      and
      it's
      obvious
      that
      is
      why
      the
      man
      was
      pulled
      over,
      most
      officers
      are
      going
      to
      defend
      the
      officer
      who
      pulled
      the
      man
      over
      whether
      he
      is
      right
      or
      wrong
      and
      that
      is
      the
      problem
      I
      have
      with
      police
      officers.
      If
      they
      stuck
      up
      for
      victims
      of
      police
      brutality
      more
      rather
      than
      standing
      with
      the
      officers
      saying
      it
      doesn't
      happen,
      I
      would
      have
      more
      faith
      in
      them.

      If
      you
      are
      going
      to
      do
      this
      no
      matter
      the
      warnings...
      with
      zero
      tolerance
      you
      should
      be
      safe
      to
      take
      a
      whole
      5mg
      pill
      to
      start
      with,
      and
      could
      take
      another
      and
      hour
      or
      2
      later
      but
      I
      wouldn't
      exceed
      10mgs
      your
      first
      time
      so
      you
      get
      a
      feel
      for
      it.
      And
      remember
      this
      is
      a
      stimulant
      and
      it'll
      keep
      you
      up
      so
      if
      you
      plan
      on
      sleeping
      you
      should
      take
      it
      very
      early
      in
      the
      day.

      I
      need
      to
      start
      doing
      that

      my

      is
      literally
      empty
      all
      over
      again.
      I
      am
      such
      an
      irresponsible
      dumb
      piece
      of
      shit
      sometimes.

      Did
      you
      read
      the
      part
      where
      I
      admitted
      I
      was
      a
      dumbass
      because
      I
      fucked
      up
      on
      my
      spending
      this
      week
      and
      need
      a
      little
      help?
      Good
      for
      you
      if
      you've
      never
      had
      to
      ask
      family
      for
      help
      with
      money
      troubles.
      A
      lot
      of
      people
      on
      this
      sub
      have
      and
      can
      relate
      to
      me.
      Edit:
      I
      said
      begging
      to
      emphasize
      the
      story.
      I
      don't
      need
      to
      BEG
      my
      family.
      I
      offered
      to
      help
      her
      with
      some
      errands
      and
      chores

      with

      jesus
      Christ
      someone
      who
      understands....
      THANK
      YOU.
      I
      know...
      I've
      gotten
      pretty
      desperate
      this
      time
      around,
      I've
      not
      fucked
      up
      and
      ended
      up
      this
      broke
      seriously
      in
      probably
      over
      a
      year
      so
      this
      feels
      beyondddd
      shitty.
      I
      am
      doing
      lawn
      work
      at
      my
      aunt's
      in
      about
      an
      hour
      so
      she'll
      pay
      me
      for
      what
      I
      can
      get
      done
      before
      dark
      she
      said!
      Thankfully
      someone
      in
      my
      family
      will
      still
      help
      me
      out.
      Desperate
      times
      definitely
      call
      for
      desperate
      measures,
      luckily
      I
      can
      worth
      this
      off
      until
      I
      get
      paid
      though!
      I
      appreciate
      the
      good
      thoughts,
      lovely!

      days.
      The
      smell
      lingers.
      Seasoned
      pot
      smokers
      rarely
      pick
      up
      the
      smell.

      Lol
      you
      think
      you
      know
      me
      all
      because
      you
      know
      i
      have
      an
      addiction.
      That's
      what's
      wrong
      with
      this
      fucking
      world.
      People
      view
      addicts
      as
      dishonorable.
      You
      don't
      know
      me
      at
      all.
      You
      know
      this
      post
      about
      me.
      But
      it's
      okay.
      I
      am
      fully
      aware
      hpw
      we
      are
      stereotypically
      viewed
      and
      that's
      okay.
      Good
      luck
      with
      everything

      I
      am

      I
      am
      content.
      Kids
      are
      great
      for
      other

      but
      not

      As
      an

      i
      currently
      do
      not
      have

      mental
      and
      emotional
      capacity

      it
      would

      that
      is
      the

      irresponsible
      thing
      i
      could
      do
      to
      a
      child.
      I
      am
      25
      but
      am
      mentally
      still
      a
      kid
      myself.
      That
      why
      no
      kids.
      A
      lot
      of
      people
      should
      never
      have
      kids
      and
      i

      one
      of

      bday
      gift
      i
      couldn't

      Got

      with

      half
      a

      was
      the

      It
      is
      significantly
      stronger
      than
      oxycodone.
      I
      take
      about
      120
      to
      150mgs
      of
      oxycodone
      in
      a
      day
      and
      about
      15
      mgs
      of
      opana
      actually
      has
      me
      nodding,
      athough
      i
      did
      take
      other
      opiates
      today.
      Also,
      Opana
      is
      oxymorphone.
      Dilaidid
      is
      hydromorphone.
      So
      i
      would
      put
      it
      a
      step
      above
      dilaudid,
      but
      I'm
      not
      sure
      this
      really
      answers
      your
      question.
      Sorry
      mam
      but
      that's
      best
      I
      can
      describe
      it...
      hope
      it
      helps!
