      I
      enjoyed
      the
      story.
      I
      think
      it's
      an
      interesting
      take
      on
      what
      the
      future
      could
      end
      up
      looking
      like.
       gt;She
      died
      in
      an
      aircar
      accident
      six
      months
      ago.
      This
      sentence
      allows
      the
      reader
      to
      infer
      that
      the
      story
      is
      taking
      place
      in
      the
      future.
      Since
      aircars
      do
      not
      exist
      (at
      least
      not
      yet)
      it's
      a
      smart
      way
      to
      set
      yourself
      up
      for
      later
      in
      the
      story
      when
      it's
      important
      to
      know
      it's
      in
      the
      future.
       gt;Life
      insurance
      dispatched
      me
      this
      morning.
      I
      do
      not
      like
      the
      way
      this
      sentence
      is
      worded.
      Saying
      life
      insurance
      dispatched
      something
      doesn't
      really
      make
      much
      sense.
      Life
      insurance
      is
      not
      a
      concrete
      noun;
      it's
      an
      abstract
      noun.
      Because
      of
      this,
      it
      can
      not
      act
      on
      its
      own
      to
      dispatch
      something.
      Only
      a
      concrete
      noun
      could
      dispatch
      something
      and
      be
      able
      to
      act
      with
      a
      verb.
      Therefore,
      the
      sentence
      should
      be
      something
      like
      this:
       gt;The
      life
      insurance
      agency
      dispatched
      me
      this
      morning.
       gt;
       gt;The
      life
      insurance
      company
      dispatched
      me
      this
      morning.
       gt;
       gt;Her
      life
      insurance
      policy
      was
      enacted
      dispatching
      me
      this
      morning.
      The
      only
      way
      I
      could
      see
      the
      original
      sentence
      being
      correct
      would
      be
      if
      life
      insurance
      is
      a
      synecdoche,
      but
      there
      would
      be
      no
      way
      for
      the
      reader
      to
      know
      this.
       gt;I
      found
      her
      son
      watching
      cartoons.
       gt;
       gt;Our
      boy
      is
      so
      smart.
      These
      two
      sentences
      don't
      work
      well
      together.
      You
      change
      the
      perspective
      which
      confuses
      the
      reader.
      Does
      the
      clone
      think
      the
      boy
      is
      her
      son?
      Or
      does
      she
      think
      the
      boy
      is
      not
      hers?
      There
      is
      not
      a
      way
      for
      the
      reader
      to
      figure
      this
      out
      because
      of
      the
      change
      in
      perspective.
      I
      just
      wanted
      to
      focus
      on
      the
      more
      technical
      aspects
      of
      the
      story
      rather
      than
      the
      story
      itself
      since
      it
      seems
      most
      of
      it
      has
      been
      thoroughly
      covered
      already.

       #8220;YOU
      ARE
      NOW
      ENTERING
      THE
      ATMOSPHERE, #8221;
      blares
      a
      robotic
      voice
      through
      the
      pod #8217;s
      communication
      system.
      The
      woman
      comforts
      her
      whimpering
      child,
       #8220;We #8217;re
      almost
      there
      sweetie.
      Everything
      will
      be
      alright. #8221;
      They
      crash.
      The
      radio
      crackles,
       #8220;Why
      did
      you
      launch
      the
      emergency
      pod?! #8221;
      blurts
      a
      panicked
      voice.
       #8220;The
      ground
      is
      still
      not
      survivable.
      You #8217;ll
      be
      dead
      within
      days! #8221;
       #8220;I
      had
      no
      choice, #8221;
      the
      woman
      replies,
       #8220;I
      saw
      the
      oxygen
      generators
      were
      in
      critical
      failure.
      We
      only
      had
      hours
      left. #8221;
      Pausing
      for
      a
      moment
      the
      voice
      responds,
       #8220;You
      weren #8217;t
      supposed
      to
      see
      that. #8221;
      Another
      pause,
       #8220;There
      was
      a
      glitch.
      Everyone
      will
      be
      fine. #8221;
      The
      pod #8217;s
      battery
      then
      dies
      leaving
      them
      in
      utter
      darkness
      and
      silence.

      Did
