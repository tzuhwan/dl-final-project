      Hey
      everyone
      I #8217;ve
      found
      myself
      in
      quite
      the
      predicament.
      I
      have
      never
      broken
      a
      bone
      which
      is
      odd
      because
      I
      have
      been
      in
      situations
      where
      I
      should #8217;ve.
      My
      bones
      are
      very
      strong
      I
      guess,
      but
      here #8217;s
      the
      thing...
      I #8217;m
      lactose
      intolerant
      and
      I
      don #8217;t
      consume
      nearly
      as
      much
      as
      everyone
      here.
      Am
      I
      welcome?

      so
      on.
      Some
      people
      don #8217;t
      believe
      that
      men
      can
      struggle
      emotionally,
      when
      in
      reality
      we #8217;re
      just
      used
      to
      caging
      it
      in
      until
      we #8217;re
      alone.
      So
      women,
      ask
      your
      boyfriend,
      guy
      friend,
      brother,
      if
      they #8217;re
      doing
      okay.

      Story
      time:
      I
      once
      found
      one
      that
      wandered
      into
      the
      climbing
      gym
      I
      frequent,
      it
      was
      annoying
      a
      lot
      of
      people
      so
      I
      picked
      it
      up
      not
      knowing
      what
      it
      was
      (and
      really
      hoping
      it
      doesn #8217;t
      sting
      or
      bite)
      and
      put
      it
      outside.
      Success!
      I
      tried
      finding
      out
      what
      it
      was
      the
      next
      day
      and
      I
      learned
      that
      it
      can
      leave
      a
      pretty
      painful
      bite.

      So
      I
      have
      two
      western
      banded
      geckos
      that
      I
      got
      from
      a
      little
      kid
      who
      wasn #8217;t
      taking
      great
      care
      of
      them.
      I #8217;ve
      had
      them
      for
      about
      six
      months
      now
      and
      they #8217;ve
      been
      healthy
      the
      whole
      time
      no
      problems.
      I
      checked
      on
      them
      tonight
      and
      one
      of
      them
      dropped
      it #8217;s
      tail
      and
      it #8217;s
      nowhere
      to
      be
      found.
      I #8217;ve
      never
      seen
      them
      aggressive
      towards
      each
      other,
      but
      that #8217;s
      the
      only
      situation
      I
      can
      think
      of
      because
      it #8217;s
      just
      them
      and
      some
      crickets
      in
      there
      enclosure.
      Is
      it
      possible
      it
      ate
      his
      own
      tail?
      Extra
      info:
      They
      were
      originally
      caught
      as
      babies
      in
      Southern
      California
      as
      babies
      so
      I
      feel
      like
      if
      they
      were
      released
      back
      into
      the
      wild
      they
      would
      have
      issues
      surviving.
      I
      have
      no
      idea
      what
      sex
      either
      of
      them
      are
      They
      are
      pretty
      small
      maybe
      4
      inches
      max
      (tail
      included)
      They
      are
      in
      a
      10
      gallon
      tank
      and
      have
      plenty
      of
      water
      and
      have
      no
      problem
      chowing
      crickets.
      If
      anyone
      is
      willing
      to
      take
      one
      if
      they
      need
      to
      be
      separated
      that
      would
      be
      awesome
      because
      I
      only
      have
      one
      tank.

      I
      was
      playing
      Minecraft
      on
      PS4
      and
      I
      was
      using
      two
      of
      my
      shulker
      boxes
      so
      they
      were
      placed
      on
      the
      floor.
      One
      had
      all
      of
      my
      diamonds,
      iron,
      gold
      and
      three
      heart
      of
      the
      sea #8217;s.
      The
      other
      one
      had
      an
      enchanted
      trident
      and
      my
      elytra
      along
      with
      a
      bunch
      of
      random
      pieces
      of
      enchanted
      diamond/
      iron
      armor
      that
      I
      got
      from
      an
      end
      city.
      (I
      was
      gonna
      put
      unbreaking
      on
      a
      diamond
      shovel
      and
      all
      the
      stuff
      were
      in
      those
      shulker
      a).
      Well
      anyway
      I
      tried
      to
      open
      a
      shulker
      box
      and
      it
      lagged
      for
      a
      second
      and
      then
      the
      game
      crashed
      and
      said
      it
      was
      force
      closed.
      I
      load
      it
      back
      up
      and
      start
      the
      world
      again
      and
      the
      two
      shulker
      boxes
      that
      I
      placed
      on
      the
      floor
      were
      gone.
      Not
      in
      my
      inventory,
      not
      in
      any
      chests,
      not
      in
      my
      Ender
      chest.
      I
      lost
      just
      about
      everything
      that
      I
      consider
      valuable.
      I
      tried
      quitting
      and
      loading
      it
      again
      but
      to
      no
      avail.
      Is
      there
      a
      way
      where
      I
      can
      undo
      a
      couple
      of
      saves?
      Has
      anyone
      else
      had
      this
      happen?
      Please
      I
      need
      help.

      More

      Tell

      boost

      to
      leave

      let

      tell

      one
      thing,
      don #8217;t
      get
      on
      their
      nerves
      and
      force
      them
      to
      do
      anything
      they
      don #8217;t
      want
      to.People
      with
      depression
      (including
      myself)
      can
      feel
      emotional
      a
      lot
      easier
      than
      someone
      without
      it.
      You
      don #8217;t
      want
      them
      in
      a
      bad
      mood
      because
      it
      could
      make
      them
      sad/
      mad.
      When
      someone
      with
      depression
      is
      sad
      or
      angry
      we
      tend
      to
      beat
      ourselves
      up
      mentally
      and
      believe
      me
      it
      is
      a
      scary
      horrible
      place
      to
      be
      in.
      So
      just
      be
      as
      positive
      as
      possible.
      Give
      hugs
      and
      a
      shoulder
      to
      cry
      on,
      listen
      to
      what
      they
      say
      and
      they
      will
      appreciate
      it.

      I
      used
      to
      have
      a
      cat
      that
      would
      wait
      on
      the
      stairs
      for
      the
      first
      person
      to
      wake
      up.
      That
      person
      was
      then
      attacked
      for
      a
      couple
      of
      seconds.
      The
      most
      terrifying

      ever
      was
      her
      b-lining
      up
      the
      stairs.

      This
      happened
      to
      me
      too.
      I
      wasn #8217;t
      progressing
      for
      a
      while
      and
      my
      psychiatrist
      asked
      if
      I
      was
      dreaming.
      I
      tried
      to
      remember
      the
      last
      dream
      I
      had
      but
      I
      couldn #8217;t.
      It
      had
      probably
      been
      a
      year
      of
      sleeping
      without
      proper
      REM.
      She
      gave
      me
      a
      prescription
      for
      mirtazapine
      and
      it
      seemed
      to
      help
      pretty
      quickly.

      of
      which
      had
      started
      growing
      roots
      and
      some
      were
      ready
      to
      be
      planted.
      Well
      anyway
      I
      put
      the
      pan
      outside
      in
      the
      planter
      on
      top
      of
      a
      pot,
      because
      they
      needed
      sun.
      Little
      did
      I
      know
      the
      gardener
      didn #8217;t
      understand
      that
      these
      weren #8217;t
      trash.
      I
      went
      to
      check
      on
      them
      later
      and
      couldn #8217;t
      find
      a
      single
      one.
      Im
      kinda
      bummed
      because
      I
      have
      been
      so
      patient
      with
      them
      and
      sometimes
      they
      were
      the
      highlight
      of
      my
      day,
      but
      now
      I
      have
      to
      start
      over.

      Does
      anyone
      have
      a
      hardline
      airbrush
      or
      know
      how
      I
      can
      get
      one?
      I #8217;ve
      been
      trying
      to
      make
      one
      but
      it
      doesn #8217;t
      work.
      This
      screenshot
      is
      from
      a
      different
      app
      and
      it #8217;s
      exactly
      what
      I
      want.
