      Hey
      there.
      I #8217;m
      an
      incoming
      sophomore
      who #8217;s
      going
      to
      take
      AP
      Biology
      and...
      oddly
      enough,
      I #8217;m
      stoked.
      I
      heard
      the
      class
      is
      really
      hard
      but
      I
      enjoyed
      standard
      biology
      a
      lot
      this
      year.
      It #8217;s
      a
      field
      that
      I
      have
      genuine
      interest
      in,
      so
      I
      decided
      to
      take
      AP
      Biology
      to
      get
      possible
      college
      credits
      and
      to
      build
      my
      knowledge.
      On
      an
      extra
      note..
      I #8217;m
      taking
      online
      classes.
      From
      anyone
      who #8217;s
      taken
      AP
      Bio,
      what
      should
      I
      expect?
      From
      anyone
      who #8217;s
      taken
      AP
      (especially
      AP
      science)
      classes
      in
      online
      school
      in
      general,
      how
      is
      it?
      What
      kind
      of
      expectations
      did
      you
      have?
      Thanks.
      Sorry
      if
      this
      is
      a
      redundant
      question
      by
      the
      way,
      thank
      you
      for
      reading!

      I
      feel
      like
      girl
      groups
      have
      had
      some
      kind
      of
      impact
      on
      my
      femininity.
      Before
      discovering
      K-pop
      girl
      groups,
      I
      actually
      didn #8217;t
      like
      expressing
      my
      ultra
      femininity
      through
      my
      style
      or
      demeanor
      too
      much
      because
      I
      thought
      it #8217;d
      make
      me
      look
      weak.
      Surprise!
      Cute
      concept
      girl
      groups
      have
      some
      of
      the
      baddest
      bitches
      in
      K-Pop.

      has

      your

      WJSN
      has
      caught
      my
      eye
      the
      most.
      They
      are
      strong
      in
      vocals,
      rapping,
      dancing,
      visuals,
      and
      overall
      concept.
      They
      are
      silly
      and
      have
      decent
      variety
      skills.
      I
      love
      them

      they #8217;re
      one
      of
      my
      ults.
      On
      the
      other
      hand,
      I
      haven #8217;t
      had
      much
      interest
      in
      Weki
      Meki.
      Most
      of
      their
      singles
      have
      only
      scored
      a
       #8220;meh #8221;
      from
      me.
      Their
      concept
      confuses
      me
      and
      I
      feel
      like
      they
      don #8217;t
      have
      a
      niche
      yet.
      However,
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      they #8217;re
      untalented.

      I
      liked
      how
      my
      high
      school
      taught
      American
      history.
      While
      I
      do
      think
      they
      gave
      our
      government
      a
      lot
      more
      credit
      than
      it
      deserves,
      the
      course
      acknowledged
      that
      we #8217;ve
      had
      some
      oppressive
      presidents
      and
      our
      government
      has
      done
      some
      overall
      shit
      things.
      No
      sugar-coating
      there.
      I
      liked
      how
      we
      were
      taught
      fairly
      in-depth
      about
      LGBT+
      rights,
      Stonewall,
      modern
      social
      movements,
      and
      the
      environment.

      It
      seems
      like
      all
      of
      LOONA #8217;s
      subunits
      so
      far
      release
      an
      EP,
      a
      repackage,
      and
      dip,
      with
      the
      exception
      of
      YYXY.
      We
      were
      supposed
      to
      get
      the
      ballad
      album,
      which
      I #8217;m
      not
      sure
      if
      it
      was
      supposed
      to
      be
      for
      YYXY
      or
      OT12.
      In
      the
      near

      I #8217;d
      love
      to
      see
      subunit
      comebacks.
      Full
      group
      comebacks
      are
      great,
      of
      course,
      but
      a
      couple
      of
      scattered
      subunit
      comebacks
      throughout
      the
      year
      would
      be
      nice
      to
      see.
      I
      really
      want
      1/3
      to
      make
      a
      comeback,
      possibly
      with
      Yeojin.

      Hey
      dudes.
      I #8217;m
      going
      to
      be
      a
      sophomore
      this
      September
      and
      I #8217;m
      looking
      forward
      to
      it.
      I
      go
      to
      online
      school,
      however
      the
      academics
      are
      basically
      the
      same
      and
      I
      am
      building
      my
      social
      life,
      so
      I #8217;d
      say
      I
      have
      a
      pretty
      similar
      experience
      to
      people
      in
       #8220;regular
      school. #8221;
      Backstory
      aside,
      what
      should
      I
      expect
      from
      sophomore
      year?
      Are
      the
      expectations
      different?
      Do
      colleges
      look
      at
      this
      year
      a
      lot?
      Additionally,
      do
      you
      have
      any
      tips
      with
      AP
      classes,
      specifically
      AP
      Biology/AP
      sciences
      in
      general?

      Though

      if
      Blockberry
      sprinkled

      ESH/leaning

      YTA:
      You
      are
      18.
      Your
      brother
      is
      10,
      he
      is
      a
      little
      kid,
      albeit
      a
      bratty
      kid,
      with
      a
      lot
      to
      learn.
      Now
      you #8217;ve
      cost
      your
      parents
      in
      damages,
      as
      they
      have
      to
      get
      a
      new
      phone
      for
      the
      kid,
      damaged
      your
      relationship
      with
      your
      brother,
      and
      escalated
      the
      situation
      overall.
      A
      better
      idea
      would #8217;ve
      been
      to
      get
      your
      parents
      involved
      or
      to
      turn
      off
      the
      modem/the
      internet
      so
      your
      brother
      doesn #8217;t
      have
      access
      to
      it
      overnight.
      Breaking
      his
      phone
      only
      made
      things
      worse.

      I
      think
      racist/offensive
      jokes
      in
      general
      are
      usually
      in
      poor
      taste
      and
      I
      avoid
      making
      them.
      However
      I #8217;m
      used
      to
      my
      friends,
      and
      pretty
      much
      everyone
      else
      around
      me
      making
      them,
      considering
      I #8217;m
      in
      high
      school.
      If
      your
      friend
      was
      okay
      with
      it
      then
      NAH.
      Sounds
      like
      you
      two
      had
      a
      laugh
      over
      it.
      However,
      you
      sound
      immature,
      and
      you
      will
      be
      TA
      if
      you
      continue
      carelessly
      making
      racist
      jokes
      around
      people
      who
      ARE
      offended
      by
      it.
      If
      you
      aren #8217;t
      careful,
      this
      shit
      will
      land
      you
      with
      no
      friends.
      When
      making
      offensive
      jokes,
      all
      parties
      involved
      should
      be
      okay
      with
      it.

      I

      experimental,
      bubblegum

      aren #8217;t
      always
      that

      I
      also
      listen

      sometimes.
      Again,
      lyrics
      that

      I

      I

      I
      just
      wanted
      to
      say
      that
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      SuperM,
      SM #8217;s
      new
       #8220;super
      group, #8221;
      is
      such
      a
      bad
      idea.
      WayV/NCT,
      EXO,
      and
      Taemin #8217;s
      solos
      are
      doing
      just
      fine.
      However,
      I
      think
      seeing
      a
      mashup
      of
      members
      of
      these
      groups
      together
      will
      be
      a
      breath
      of
      fresh
      air
      while
      SHINee
      and
      EXO
      members
      are
      enlisting.
      While
      it
      may
      have
      been
      a
      better
      idea
      to
      let
      the
      artists
      from
      the
      groups
      undergoing
      enlistment
      start
      their
      own
      solo
      pursuits,
      I
      think
      SM
      going
      to
      new
      heights
      isn #8217;t
      such
      a
      bad
      idea.
      WayV
      and
      NCT
      will
      get
      more
      promotion,
      and
      so
      will
      EXO
      and
      SHINee.
      If
      they
      are
      to
      have
      a
      US
      debut,
      I #8217;m
      sure
      it
      will
      catch
      the
      eyes
      of
      Americans
      and
      strengthen
      their
      original
      groups #8217;
      popularities
      in
      the
      states.
      I
      feel
      like
      some
      people
      are
      lying
      to
      themselves.
      Who
      wouldn #8217;t
      be
      excited
      to
      see
      all
      these
      members
      performing
      together
      on
      stage?
      With
      their
      stage
      presence
      and
      talent,
      it
      sounds
      amazing.
      However,
      I
      do
      think
      that
      it
      may
      be
      a
      bad
      idea
      in
      some
      way
      for
      NCT/WayV,
      as
      they
      are
      very
      actively
      promoting
      and
      this
      could
      take
      the
      members
      away
      from
      their
      original
      group.
      I #8217;m
      also
      concerned
      about
      NCT
      members
      especially
      being
      overworked.
      Though,
      perhaps
      it
      isn #8217;t
      all
      doom
      and
      gloom.
      This
      could
      be
      a
      really
      good
      idea.
      It #8217;s
      workable.
      How
      do
      you
      all
      feel
      about
      SM #8217;s
      new
      super
      group?

      if
      you #8217;ve
      ever
      spent
      a
      day
      on
      kpop
      stan
      twitter,
      you
      will
      notice
      that
      stans
      constantly
      push
      the
      narrative
      of
      being
      either
      gay,
      straight,
      bisexual,
      etc.
      on
      idols,
      especially
      when
      dating
      rumors
      come
      out.
      this
      is
      either
      done
      as
      a
      joke
      or
      done
      in
      genuine
      belief
      that
      a
      specific
      idol
      is
      [insert
      sexuality
      here].
      it #8217;s
      honestly
      fucking
      gross.
      as
      a
      bisexual
      person,
      it
      makes
      me
      uncomfortable.
      treating
      kpop
      idols
      as
      if
      they #8217;re
      some
      sort
      of
      character
      where
      you
      can
      just
      make
      up
      sexualities,
      personalities,
      preferences,
      etc.
      is
      so
      fucking
      wrong.
      i #8217;ve
      seen
      fellow
      lgbt+
      stans
      who
      do
      it
      say
      it #8217;s
      a
      way
      to
       #8220;cope, #8221;
      or
      just
      bypass
      it
      as
      a
      joke.
      even
      if
      it #8217;s
      a
      joke,
      it #8217;s
      rather
      dehumanizing
      to
      impose
      any
      type
      of
      sexuality
      on
      a
      real
      life
      person.
      it #8217;s
      gross,
      it #8217;s
      fetishizing,
      similarly
      with
      legitimately
      shipping
      idols
      with
      each
      other.
      just
      stop.
      and
      no,
      i #8217;m
      not
      a
      pissed
      off
      straight
      person
      who
      feels
      attacked
      by
      the
       #8220;queers #8221;
      or
      whatever,
      i
      just
      find
      it
      annoying
      and
      rather
      dehumanizing
      that
      certain
      stans
      like
      to

      i #8217;m
      sorry,
      but,
      if
      you #8217;re
      disappointed
      because
      your

      I #8217;m
      15.
      I
      live
      with
      my
      parents
      and
      they
      really
      want
      me
      to
      do
      chores.
      They
      give
      me
      a
      couple
      of
      chores
      to
      do
      per
      day
      but
      I
      just,
      have
      absolutely
      no
      motivation
      to
      follow
      them,
      even
      with
      the
      incentive
      of
      money.
      For
      some
      reason,
      I
      have
      always
      been
      terribly
      lazy.
      I #8217;ve
      always
      had
      trouble
      following
      tasks
      and
      listening
      to
      authority.
      I
      can
      listen
      at
      a
      job,
      and
      I
      can
      listen
      to
      teachers,
      but
      I
      just
      have
      issues
      following
      tasks
      from
      my
      parents/other
      older
      people.
      I
      do
      great
      in
      school,
      but
      I
      lack
      heavily
      in
      household
      tasks.
      I
      really
      hate
      how
      lazy
      I
      am,
      I
      wish
      I
      had
      more
      motivation
      and
      I
      wish
      I
      was

      make

      Lately,
      I #8217;ve
      been
      noticing
      that
      whenever
      I
      am
      worried
      about
      something,
      I
      constantly
      have
       #8220;thought
      loops, #8221;
      where
      the
      same
      train
      of
      thought
      will
      loop
      in
      my
      mind.
      This
      also
      happens
      with
      certain
      things
      people
      say
      to
      me.
      It #8217;s
      almost
      as
      if
      it #8217;s
      a
      method
      of
      reassuring
      myself
      that
      this
      is
      exactly
      what
      someone
      said
      to
      me.
      Additionally,
      this
      will
      also
      manifest
      into
      interactions
      I
      have
      with
      others.
      I
      constantly
      have
      to
      have
      other
      people
      repeat
      things,
      even
      if
      I
      can
      hear
      them
      clearly
      and
      understand
      them,
      just
      to
      reassure
      my
      mind.
      It #8217;s
      so
      weird,
      and
      I
      hate
      it.
      I
      often
      propose
      the
      same
      questions
      to
      myself
      and
      my
      thoughts
      will
      run
      in
      loops.
      When
      this
      happens,
      I
      often
      go
      silent
      and
      just
      get
      lost
      in
      my
      thoughts,
      making
      others
      around
      me
      put
      off
      by
      my
      behavior.

      upbeat.
      considering
      everything
      she #8217;s

      solemn
      and
      personal
      body
      of
      work
      of

      it #8217;s
      definitely
      a

      fact
      that
      america
      isn #8217;t

      even

      the

      divide
      is
      awful
      at

      is

      people
      aren #8217;t

      like
      it
      or
      not,
      american
      pop
      culture
      has
      given
      birth
      to
      so
      many
      subcultures
      and
      trends-
      another
      reason
      why
      i
      like
      being
      an
      american.
      we

      maybe

      to
      hang
      out
      with
      you
      as

      in

      my

      going

      and
      doing

      pat #8217;s
      and
      geno #8217;s,
      you #8217;re
      better
      off
      getting
      a
      much
      better
      quality
      and
      less
      expensive
      steak
      from
      a
      smaller
      cheesesteak
      place
      like
      steve #8217;s
      prince
      of
      steaks.
      oh
      also,
      the
      liberty
      bell.
      boring
      as
      shit.
      art
      museum
      steps/the
      rocky
      statue
      are
      also
      up
      there.
      admittedly
      it
      feels
      badass
      as
      fuck
      taking
      pictures
      there

      i
      understand
      how
      you
      feel
      but
      don #8217;t
      take
       #8216;sjw #8217;/social
      media
      feminism
      as
      a
      reflection
      of
      how
      actual
      feminism
      is.
      and
      no,
      women
      do
      not
      have
      more
      rights
      than
      men.
      in
      this
      society
      we
      have
      equal
      rights,
      though
      we
      still
      have
      different
      struggles.
      you
      sound
      ignorant
      but
      i
      can
      understand
      why.
      just
      remember
      that
       #8216;feminazis #8217;
      and
       #8216;men-hating #8217;
      feminists
      are
      a
      small
      minority
      in
      the
      feminist
      movement.

      twilight

      so
      fucking
      good.
      it
      never
      gets
      old.
      it #8217;s
      a
      shame
      that
      the
      films
      themselves
      weren #8217;t

      if
      y #8217;all
      want
      true
      noise
      music,
      listen
      to
      sophie,
      who #8217;s
      a
      pop
      artist.
      but
      her
      noise
      music
      is
      great.
      not
      the
      point
      tho.
      people
      do
      this
      because
      they
      lack
      knowledge
      of
      music
      genres/sub-genres.
      so
      they
      categorize
      everything
      that
      isn #8217;t
      typical
      bubblegum
      k-pop
      as
      something
      noisy
      or
      whatever.
      though
      there
      are
      some
      actual
      fucking
      noise
      k-pop
      songs
      that
      it
      feels
      like
      producers
      just
      threw
      together.
      this
      year
      in
      k-pop
      has
      been
      NOTORIOUS
      for
      having
      some
      messy,
      noisy,
      songs
      with
      no
      direction.
      anyway
      i #8217;d
      like
      some
      more
      actual
      good
      experimental
      music
      to
      be
      added
      to
      k-pop.
      f(x)
      and
      shinee
      were
      my
      main
      hopes
      but
      f(x)
      is
      probably
      going
      to
      disband
      and
      shinee
      is
      on
      a
      hiatus.
      sad.
      we
      need
      a
      new
      group
      w
      an
       #8216;experimental #8217;
      or
       #8216;artpop #8217;
      concept
      because
      red
      velvet
      hasn #8217;t
      been
      cutting
      it
      for
      me
      lately.

      Thank
      you!!
      I #8217;ll
      try
      to
      do
      that.
      On
      that
      note,
      honestly,
      self-harming
      has
      seemed
      to
      come
      from
      my
      urge
      of
      wanting
      to
      vent
      when
      I
      am
      very
      upset.
      However,
      when
      I
      have
      no
      one
      to
      talk
      to
      or
      when
      I
      am
      too
      afraid
      to
      vent
      to
      others,
      I
      vent
      through
      means
      of
      violence
      against
      myself,
      of
      course
      that
      isn #8217;t
      good.
      I
      have
      a
      boyfriend
      but
      I
      don #8217;t
      know
      how
      he #8217;d
      take
      it.
      I #8217;m
      not
      sure
      if
      I #8217;m
      ready
      to
      unload
      this
      onto
      him.
      I
      am
      honestly
      afraid
      that
      he #8217;s
      going
      to
      be
      deeply
      disturbed,
      rightfully
      so,
      and
      then
      break
      up
      with
      me.
      :/
