      The
      Blue
      Jane
      Hello
      beautiful
      people!
      I
      am
      The
      Blue
      Jane,
      the
      Lady
      of
      Hell
      Renown
      with
      Bohemian
      ties!
      I
      am
      a
      lover
      of
      all
      Neathly
      delights.
      The
      lively
      clothes
      from
      Polytheme,
      decadent
      golden
      honey,
      and
      perhaps
      the
      Neath's
      most
      alluring
      delight
      -
      beautiful
      women.
      Not
      yet
      a
      person
      of
      some
      importance,
      but
      that
      is
      clearly
      just
      a
      simple
      mistake
      that
      will
      be
      rectified
      soon.
      I
      simply
      adore
      all
      social
      infractions,
      and
      would
      love
      to
      meet
      you.

      talking
      now.

      Fresh
      out
      of
      New
      Newgate,
      an
      incredibly
      somber
      individual
      enters
      Fallen
      London.
      Going
      by
      the
      title
      of
      The
      Porcelain
      Facade,
      this
      lady
      is
      most
      recognizable
      by
      the
      fact
      that
      she
      has
      a
      porcelain
      mask
      burned
      into
      her
      face.
      She
      talks
      very
      little,
      and
      had
      come
      to
      the
      Neath
      to
      avenge
      her
      wife
      (Nemesis
      ambition).
      She
      focuses
      on
      very
      little
      outside
      of
      her
      vengeance,
      and
      will
      do
      anything
      to
      assist
      in
      her
      quest.
      Open
      for
      all
      social
      interactions,

      Quick

      I
      have
      the
      option
      right
      now
      to
      begin
      courting
      the
      Artist's
      Model
      and
      hopefully
      marry
      her.
      I
      do
      like
      the
      Artist's
      Model,
      but
      the
      one
      true
      love
      of
      both
      my
      character
      and
      I
      is
      the
      Captivating
      Princess.
      I
      am
      fairly
      certain
      it
      is
      impossible
      to
      romance
      the
      Captivating
      Princess,
      but
      I
      don't
      know
      for
      sure
      and
      would
      hate
      to
      marry
      the
      Model
      and
      then
      have
      to
      go
      through
      all
      the
      hassle
      of
      a
      divorce
      later
      when
      if
      I
      get
      the
      option
      to
      romance
      the
      Captivating
      Princess.
      So
      without
      any
      spoilers
      (I'd
      just
      go
      to
      the
      wiki
      if
      I
      wasn't
      worried
      about
      that),
      can
      you
      tell
      me
      if
      my
      dream
      of
      a
      union
      with
      the
      most
      divine
      of
      royalty
      is
      nothing
      more
      than
      a
      fantasy,
      or
      is
      it
      possible
      with
      enough
      hard
      work
      and
      luck?

      This

      go

      but
      the
      story
      of

      seems
      to
      be
      moving
      away
      from
      the
      Neath,
      and
      a
      lot
      of
      the
      lore
      I'm
      talking
      about
      originally
      came
      from
      FL,
      soooo.....
      And
      seriously,
      lots
      of
      spoilers.
      I'll
      censor
      out
      what
      I
      can,
      but
      not
      all
      of
      it
      because
      then
      this
      would
      just
      be
      a
      big
      white
      block.
      A
      lot
      of
      people
      talk
      about
      the
      sixth
      city.
      It's
      been
      hinted
      at
      that
       gt;!Paris
      will
      be
      the
      sixth
      city! lt;,
      but
      it
      is
      definitely
      not
      something
      set
      in
      stone.
      Some
      people
      argue
      that
       gt;!there
      will
      never
      be
      a
      sixth
      city! lt;
      for
      a
      number
      of
      reasons.
      One
      being
      that
       gt;!Mr.
      Wines
      is
      the
      only
      master
      who
      still
      believes
      in
      the
      Bazaar's
      mission,
      and
      some
      masters
      are
      even
      trying
      to
      actively
      sabotage
      it! lt;
      and
      that
       gt;!since
      France
      saw
      the
      devastation
      brought
      onto
      the
      British
      Empire
      from
      their
      deal
      with
      the
      Bazaar
      they
      would
      likely
      be
      unlikely
      to
      ever
      make
      a
      deal
      of
      their
      own! lt;
      Okay,
      I
      think
      that's
      most
      of
      the
      spoilers
      I
      will
      be
      covering,
      so
      I'm
      not
      going
      to
      censor
      anymore.
      I'm
      on
      mobile,
      and
      I'm
      not
      even
      sure
      if
      it's
      working
      anyway.
      You've
      been
      warned.
      For
      the
      sake
      of
      this
      discussion,
      I
      want
      to
      assume
      that
      the
      Masters
      put
      aside
      their
      differences
      and
      decide
      they
      want
      another
      city,
      and
      decide
      that
      they
      want
      that
      city
      to
      be
      Paris;
      I'm
      wondering
      what
      they
      would
      offer
      France
      in
      exchange
      for
      Paris.
      One
      theory
      I
      have
      is
      that
      after
      The
      Empress
      lead
      the
      exodus
      to
      the
      High
      Wilderness,
      presumably
      leaving
      London
      mostly
      abandoned,
      the
      Masters
      would
      start
      doing
      some
      city
      shopping.
      This
      would
      place
      the
      time
      period
      as
      the
      Dawn
      of
      the
      20th
      century.
      As
      I
      said
      above,
      France
      would
      have
      to
      be
      extremely
      desperate
      before
      making
      any
      deals
      with
      the
      masters
      after
      they
      saw
      how
      it
      blew
      up
      in
      Britain's
      face.
      They
      would
      have
      to
      certain
      that
      the
      collapse
      of
      their
      entire
      empire
      would
      be
      worth
      whatever
      they'd
      gain.
      I
      believe
      the
      time
      period
      is
      the
      most
      important
      thing
      here.
      At
      the
      Dawn
      of
      the
      20th
      century,
      France
      was
      working
      on
      making
      alliances
      with
      nearby
      nations,
      but
      they
      were
      heavily
      divided
      internally.
      Of
      course,
      who
      knows
      what
      the
      state
      of
      France
      was
      in
      the
      fallen
      london
      universe
      given
      that
      the
      disappearance
      of
      one
      of
      the
      other
      major
      works
      powers
      probably
      influenced
      history
      in
      all
      sort
      of
      ways.
      Either
      way,
      nothing
      particularly
      big
      is
      happening
      in
      France
      for
      the
      first
      decade
      or
      so.
      At
      least
      no
      major
      disasters
      that
      would
      warrant
      selling
      the
      entire
      city
      to
      fix.
      This
      could
      change
      however
      in
      1914
      which
      is
      when
      the
      first
      world
      war
      began.
      It
      would
      be
      hard
      to
      say
      if
      the
      first
      world
      War
      would
      even
      happen
      in
      this
      universe,
      the
      biggest
      problem
      being
      that
      Germany
      has
      not
      been
      formed
      and
      is
      still
      Prussia.
      (At
      least
      I
      think
      so?
      This
      is
      from
      the
      Empress'
      Shadow
      story
      and
      I
      never
      bought
      that
      one).
      I
      still
      think
      the
      war
      would
      happen
      despite
      this,
      the
      arch-duke
      Ferdinand
      would
      still
      be
      assassinated
      which
      would
      cause
      both
      Russia
      and
      France
      to
      move
      to
      war,
      and
      I
      find
      it
      likely
      that
      even
      if
      Germany
      is
      not
      fully
      formed
      at
      this
      time
      they
      would
      likely
      still
      have
      their
      alliance
      with
      Austria-Hungary
      so
      Prussia
      would
      still
      attack
      France.
      France
      suffered
      a
      lot
      during
      the
      first
      world
      War,
      but
      during
      the
      war
      as
      we
      knew
      it
      they
      had
      Britain
      helping
      them
      out.
      In
      the
      fallen
      london
      universe;
      however,
      they
      would
      be
      left
      alone
      to
      fight
      Prussia
      while
      Russia
      slowly
      gathered
      their
      troops
      before
      even
      having
      a
      chance
      to
      invade
      Prussia,
      let
      alone
      give
      France
      any
      support.
      I
      think
      in
      this
      universe,
      France
      would
      be
      absolutely
      devastated
      by
      Prussia
      and
      this
      would
      put
      them
      in
      a
      very
      desperate
      situation.
      I
      can
      definitely
      see
      the
      Masters
      try
      to
      capitalize
      off
      of
      that.
      I
      would
      hope
      that
      the
      French
      would
      learn
      from
      the
      forth
      city
      and
      not
      just
      wish
      for
      their
      city
      to
      be
      protected
      from
      their
      enemies
      because
      that
      would
      be
      boring
      to
      have
      a
      trade
      we've
      already
      seen.
      Really
      though,
      the
      deal
      itself
      can
      be
      a
      lot
      of
      things,
      but
      this
      is
      what
      I've
      pictured.
      Prussian
      soldiers
      are
      a
      few
      days
      from
      overtaking
      Paris.
      The
      French
      army
      is
      in
      shambles.
      Russia
      is
      still
      struggling
      to
      mobilize,
      so
      no
      help
      is
      coming
      from
      them.
      The
      French
      agree
      to
      give
      the
      Masters
      Paris
      if
      they
      could
      destroy
      all
      of
      Prussia
      and
      win
      the
      war
      for
      Paris.
      I
      can
      see
      a
      number
      of
      ways
      to
      do
      this;
      maybe
      the
      Bazaar
      uses
      correspondence
      to
      set
      Prussia
      ablaze,
      or
      maybe
      the
      Masters
      themselves
      fight
      against
      all
      of
      Prussia.
      Maybe
      they
      could
      even
      convince
      some
      devils
      to
      come
      to
      the
      surface
      to
      do
      all
      the
      fighting.
      Lots
      of
      options.
      Anyway,
      this
      was
      long.

      Thank
      you
      for
      reminding
      me
      of
      all
      that!
      There's
      so
      much
      lore
      it
      can
      get
      a
      bit
      difficult
      to
      keep
      everything
      straight.
      :P
      I
      still
      want
      to
      go
      with
      WW1
      being
      the
      catalyst
      in
      Paris
      being
      taken
      so
      I
      did
      a
      bit
      of
      research
      in
      who
      the
      Masters
      would
      see
      as
      the
      "Owner"
      of
      Paris
      at
      this
      time.
      The
      prime
      minster
      at
      the
      time
      was
      Georges
      Clemenceau
      (who
      was
      also
      nicknamed
      The
      Tiger,
      and
      the
      idea
      that
      the
      French
      equivalent
      to
      the
      Traitor
      Empress
      would
      be
      called
      The
      Tiger
      would
      be
      awesome).
      When
      it
      comes
      to
      something
      he
      loves
      that
      he
      would
      want
      from
      the
      Masters,
      I
      believe
      the
      best
      bet
      would
      actually
      be
      the
      Nation
      of
      France.
      Throughout
      his
      political
      career,
      Clemenceau
      advocated
      for
      France
      to
      be
      a
      powerful
      military
      force
      and
      to
      be
      prepared
      for
      any
      conflict.
      So
      I
      can
      see
      the
      deal
      he
      would
      make
      would
      either
      be
      to
      preserve
      the
      nation
      be
      loves
      or
      to
      give
      France
      military
      strength
      only
      possible
      in
      the
      Neath.

      I
      didn't
      know
      that!
      Very
      interesting.
      It
      is
      a
      little
      sad
      that
      the
      reasoning
      for
      the
      deal
      was
      just
      to
      save
      another
      dying
      person.
      If
      we
      ever
      fully
      see
      the
      sixth
      city
      being
      taken
      I'd
      want
      it
      to
      be
      something
      unique.
      The
      first
      five
      cities
      were
      all
      unique
      in
      their
      circumstances,
      and
      that
      seems
      really
      similar
      to
      London's
      situation.
      I
      really
      like
      the
      idea
      I
      replied
      with
      to
      the
      previous
      comment.

      Also,
      if
      the
      sixth
      city
      turns
      out
      to
      be
      Prussia
      maybe
      the
      shadow
      wouldn't
      even
      need
      to
      stage
      a
      coup.
      We
      never
      fully
      find
      out
      what
      happens
      to
      the
      Dawn
      Machine
      after
      the
      exodus
      to
      the
      high
      wilderness
      (at
      least,
      not
      that
      I
      know
      of)
      so
      it
      could
      still
      be
      in
      the
      Neath.
      If
      the
      leader
      of
      Prussia
      really
      likes
      learning
      about
      judgements
      he
      would
      probably
      be
      interested
      in
      studying
      the
      Dawn
      Machine.
      Either
      that
      or
      be
      disgusted
      by
      it,
      but
      the
      Bazaar
      promising
      the
      leader
      of
      Prussia
      a
      semi-judgement
      that
      he
      could
      personally
      communicate
      with
      would
      probably
      do
      the
      trick.

      need
      the
      ideas
      of
      other
      people
      to
      reach
      any
      sort
      of
      understanding.
      It
      feels
      like
      I
      discover
      something
      new
      about
      the
      lore
      everyday

      I
      remember
      reading
      that!
      That
      always
      made
      me
      think
      that
      Paris
      does
      end
      up
      being
      the
      sixth
      city
      and
      they
      somehow
      also
      get
      through
      Avid
      Horizon.
      Though
      I
      suppose
      there
      could
      be
      other
      ways,
      or
      they
      just
      travel
      down
      to
      the
      Neath
      through
      the
      canal
      instead
      of
      taking
      the
      whole
      city
      with
      them.

      And
      I
      have
      almost
      exhausted
      all
      the
      options
      for
      the
      creative
      endeavors.
      A
      short
      while
      after
      starting
      my
      quest
      I
      concluded
      that
      the
      34
      Inspiration
      works
      were
      the
      only
      ones
      worth
      pursuing.
      I
      really
      enjoy
      making
      works
      as
      I'm
      a
      writer
      myself
      and
      I
      like
      the
      creative
      aspect
      of
      my
      character.
      However,
      I've
      almost
      completed
      all
      the
      possible
      versions
      of
      the
      34
      Inspiration
      works.
      I
      wish
      that
      there
      was
      a
      way
      to
      write
      in
      your
      own
      text
      for
      your
      pieces.
      Just
      for
      more
      flavor.
      I'm
      not
      even
      halfway
      to
      becoming
      laureate
      so
      I'm
      going
      to
      end
      up
      seeing
      these
      same
      rewards
      over
      and
      over
      so
      it's
      a
      bit
      frustrating.

      Since
      the
      Great
      Game
      is
      so
      vague
      as
      to
      what
      everyone
      is
      playing
      for,
      my
      headcanon
      is
      that
      no
      one
      actually
      knows
      why
      they're
      playing.
      Like,
      everyone
      assumes
      that
      the
      person
      they
      are
      working
      for
      knows
      what's
      up,
      and
      that
      person
      assumes
      that
      whoever
      they're
      working
      for
      knows
      what's
      up,
      and
      the
      highest
      of
      the
      higher
      ups
      just
      inherited
      their
      place
      in
      the
      game
      from
      their
      parents
      so
      even
      they
      don't
      know
      what
      they're
      doing;
      they're
      just
      keeping
      up
      the
      tradition
      at
      this
      point.

      I
      seriously
      love
      Skies
      more
      than
      Seas
      when
      it
      comes
      to
      game
      play.
      I
      couldn't
      really
      get
      into
      Seas
      with
      all
      the
      repetition
      and
      slower
      combat
      and
      travel
      that
      Skies
      for
      the
      most
      part
      did
      away
      with.
      However,
      I
      love
      the
      Neath.
      I
      find
      it
      so
      interesting
      from
      a
      storytelling
      perspective,
      and
      I
      feel
      like
      it
      just
      has
      so
      much
      more
      potential
      than
      the
      High
      Wilderness.
      I
      just
      hope
      an
      update
      to
      Skies
      has
      some
      sort
      of
      way
      for
      us
      to
      play
      in
      the
      Neath
      again.
      I
      find
      it
      unlikely
      as
      it
      feels
      that
      the
      story
      is
      shifting
      away
      from
      the
      Neath
      and
      the
      Bazaar,
      but
      I
      really
      miss
      how
      the
      Neath
      made
      me
      feel.

      I
      was
      raised
      Mormon,
      and
      discovered
      a
      couple
      years
      ago
      that
      I
      was
      transgender.
      I
      agree
      with
      a
      pervious
      reply,
      you
      should
      develop
      a
      "logical
      family"
      before
      telling
      your
      actual
      family.
      It
      is
      likely
      you
      won't
      get
      a
      lot
      of
      support
      from
      your
      actual
      family,
      like
      you
      said,
      so
      you
      will
      need
      that
      support
      from
      somewhere.
      Also,
      you
      should
      practice
      coming
      out
      before
      telling
      your
      family.
      Tell
      friends,
      even
      those
      who
      are
      just
      online.
      You
      won't
      be
      able
      to
      do
      it
      perfectly,
      but
      practice
      will
      make
      it
      much
      easier.
      If
      you
      feel
      like
      this
      is
      likely
      to
      cause
      major
      issues
      then
      you
      might
      want
      to
      even
      wait
      until
      you
      have
      moved
      out
      of
      your
      home
      and
      are
      completely
      independent.
      Most
      parents
      are
      not
      cruel
      when
      in
      this
      situation,
      but
      you
      know
      your
      parents
      better
      than
      anyone
      so
      only
      you
      would
      know
      when
      the
      best
      time
      is.

      This
      is
      going
      to
      be
      long,
      just
      so
      you've
      been
      warned.
      I'm
      also
      doing
      this
      on
      mobile
      so
      there
      may
      be
      some
      typos,
      but
      I'll
      try
      my
      best
      to
      catch
      them.
      I
      was
      raised
      Mormon.
      In
      the
      middle
      of
      Utah,
      actually.
      Very
      early
      in
      my
      life,
      my
      parents
      got
      divorced
      because
      my
      dad
      was
      cheating
      on
      my
      mother.
      It
      was
      unfortunate,
      but
      not
      the
      main
      point
      of
      my
      story.
      Sufficient
      to
      say,
      after
      that
      my
      mother
      began
      to
      push
      for
      our
      family
      to
      become
      active
      in
      the
      church
      since
      she
      was
      convinced
      that
      our
      inactivity
      is
      what
      lead
      to
      my
      father's
      actions.
      That
      happened
      when
      I
      was
      seven.
      Fast
      forward
      a
      year.
      Due
      to
      the
      sudden
      absence
      of
      my
      father's
      income,
      we
      moved
      even
      deeper
      into
      Mormon
      territory,
      Ogden
      if
      any
      of
      you
      are
      familiar.
      At
      eight
      years
      old
      I
      was
      first
      exposed
      to
      porn.
      Ironically,
      I
      only
      found
      it
      because
      a
      talk
      in
      church
      mentioned
      it
      offhand
      and,
      being
      the
      ever
      knowledge-seeking
      child
      I
      was,
      when
      I
      heard
      a
      word
      I'd
      had
      no
      understanding
      of
      I
      decided
      to
      type
      it
      into
      Google.
      You
      can
      guess
      the
      rest.
      I
      consumed
      porn
      regularly
      for
      a
      couple
      months
      before
      my
      mother
      found
      out.
      She
      sat
      me
      down
      while
      she
      was
      in
      tears
      and
      told
      me
      that
      what
      I'd
      done
      was
      one
      of
      the
      worst
      sins
      imaginable,
      and
      that
      I
      would
      need
      to
      tell
      the
      bishop
      what
      I'd
      done.
      That
      was
      awful.
      With
      everything
      that
      has
      happened
      lately,
      I'm
      luckily
      I
      wasn't
      assaulted,
      but
      my
      shame
      made
      me
      want
      to
      kill
      myself
      as
      I
      spoke
      to
      my
      bishop.
      Only
      eight,
      and
      already
      wanting
      to
      die.
      Fun.
      I
      was
      placed
      in
      Religious
      Therapy.
      While
      there
      I
      was
      placed
      with
      exclusively
      male
      therapists,
      and
      often
      asked
      turned
      describe
      the
      images
      I
      had
      seen
      in
      detail.
      Again,
      this
      happened
      while
      I
      was
      between
      the
      ages
      of
      8-12.
      I
      desperately
      tried
      to
      talk
      to
      these
      therapists
      about
      my
      growing
      depression
      and
      self-loathing
      as
      well
      as
      the
      strain
      about
      my
      distrust
      of
      men
      in
      general(including
      the
      three
      therapists
      I
      went
      through),
      but
      no
      matter
      what
      problem
      I
      had
      their
      solution
      was
      always
      that
      I
      had
      to
      stop
      viewing
      porn.
      By
      middle
      school
      I
      refused
      to
      see
      any
      religious
      therapists.
      My
      mother
      tried
      a
      bit,
      but
      I
      refused
      to
      say
      a
      word
      to
      anyone
      who
      used
      religion
      in
      their
      therapy.
      I
      also
      moved
      wards
      a
      couple
      times,
      and
      each
      time
      I
      had
      to
      repeat
      the
      process
      of
      telling
      my
      new
      bishop
      about
      my
      sins.
      Despite
      being
      completely
      honest
      about
      everything,
      I
      was
      still
      given
      full
      priesthood
      authority.
      I
      was
      allowed
      to
      pass
      the
      sacrament
      when
      I
      turned
      twelve,
      and
      prepare
      it
      when
      I
      turned
      fourteen.
      When
      I
      was
      fifteen
      we
      moved
      to
      Wyoming,
      and
      with
      that
      came
      a
      lot
      of
      revelations.
      I
      discovered
      I
      was
      a
      transgender
      woman.
      This
      was
      because
      of
      a
      number
      of
      pieces
      of
      media
      I
      had
      begun
      to
      consume
      during
      our
      move
      that
      exposed
      be
      to
      the
      LGBTQ
      community.
      When
      I
      first
      discovered
      this,
      I
      nearly
      killed
      myself.
      I
      had
      a
      plan,
      and
      almost
      did
      myself
      in.
      All
      that
      stopped
      me
      was
      the
      fear
      that
      Hell
      was
      waiting
      for
      me,
      so
      I
      guess
      the
      church
      did
      something
      good
      for
      once.
      I
      kept
      this
      hidden
      for
      two
      years
      before
      I
      told
      anyone.
      I
      ended
      up
      telling
      some
      friends,
      and
      it
      was
      amazing.
      I
      also
      lost
      my
      virginity,
      an
      event
      that
      stressed
      me
      out
      to
      the
      point
      of
      developing
      an
      ulcer,
      and
      the
      stress
      from
      hiding
      this
      fact
      from
      my
      family
      lead
      to
      that
      relationship
      falling
      apart.
      A
      year
      after
      that
      my
      mother
      found
      out.
      She
      kicked
      me
      out
      of
      the
      house
      for
      the
      day
      so
      she
      could
      "think."
      That
      was
      the
      second
      time
      I
      nearly
      killed
      myself.
      I
      was
      left
      all
      alone
      for
      hours
      on
      end,
      and
      I
      had
      a
      plan,
      but
      I
      luckily
      survived.
      Now
      it's
      three
      years
      later.
      I
      got
      through
      seminary,
      though
      it
      was
      a
      nightmare.
      My
      mother
      refuses
      to
      acknowledge
      my
      gender
      change
      and
      dead
      names
      me
      daily.
      But,
      I'm
      saving
      up
      to
      leave
      the
      conservative
      town
      I
      live
      in
      to
      the
      west
      coast.
      So
      that's
      my
      one
      major
      hope
      now.

      about
      amazon's

      of

      your

      Extending

      will

      I
      can
      understand
      that.
      A
      lot
      of
      people
      struggle
      with
      feeling
      safe
      around
      cis
      men.
      It
      could
      be
      that
      you
      haven't
      met
      the
      right
      cis
      man,
      or
      maybe
      you
      never
      will.
      Either
      way,
      I
      don't
      think
      you
      are
      subconsciously
      misgendering
      them.
      Maybe
      you
      are
      pan,
      or
      something
      more
      specific,
      but
      I
      don't
      think
      it
      is
      something
      to
      worry
      about.

      where

      be
      much

      She
      is
      a
      transgender
      woman
      who
      draws
      short

      has
      a
      very
      active
      social
      media

      Perhaps
      you

      even
      reach
      out
      to
      her
      if
      you
      feel
      comfortable.

      Yes,
      the

      either

      a

      identifies
      how
      they
      wish,
      it
      doesn't

      the
      majority
      of

      is
      with
      you.
      I'm

      to
      know.

      Yeah,
      I
      get
      that
      honeymoons
      are
      typically
      pretty
      sex-filled,

      having
      gone
      your

      without

      be

      where
      so
      much
      would
      be

      I

      a
      lot
      of
      Mormon
      couples
      doing
      sexual
      activities
      they
      are
      not
      comfortable
      with
      just
      to
      because
      they

      sexual
      intimacy.

      include
      trans
      characters
      but
      don't
      have
      it
      tell
      the
      audience
      what
      it
      means
      to
      be
      a
      transgender
      person.
      Like,
      what
      it
      means
      to
      be
      trans
      is
      a
      story
      that
      should
      be
      told
      by
      a
      trans
      person.
      Unless
      you
      are
      trans,
      which
      I
      did
      assume
      by
      your
      phrasing
      but
      I
      could
      be
      wrong,
      then
      it
      wouldn't
      be
      your
      story
      to
      tell.
      A
      simpler
      way
      of
      putting
      this
      could
      be
      that
      you
      make
      it
      obvious
      that
      the
      character
      is
      trans
      but
      don't
      make
      the
      entire
      character's
      story
      be
      about
      their
      struggles
      because
      they
      are
      trans.
      Also,
      as
      side
      advice
      that
      I'm
      sure
      you
      already
      know,
      avoid
      really
      overused
      cliches.
      Like,
      "My
      name
      used
      to
      be
      Gabe
      but
      now
      I'm
      *dramatic
      hair
      flip*
      Gabriella"
      or
      the
      character
      disguising
      themselves
      as
      their
      dead
      gender
      to
      sneak
      into
      someplace.
      Thank
      you
      for
      asking
      how
      to
      do
      this!
      The
      fact
      that
      you
      are
      willing
      to
      research
      is
      already
      much
      better
      than
      some
      famous
      authors
      do.

      is

      I
      live
      in
      a
      small,
      Wyoming
      town
      that
      is
      mostly
      Mormon.
      For
      context,
      I'm
      a
      transgender
      woman
      so
      I
      spent
      most
      of
      my
      time
      in
      the
      church
      as
      part
      of
      the
      young
      men's
      group.
      I
      knew
      a
      lot
      about
      the
      young
      men
      in
      my
      quorum,
      and
      not
      a
      single
      one
      was
      worthy
      of
      using
      the
      sacrament,
      at
      least
      according
      to
      what
      the
      church
      believes.
      I'd
      seen
      those
      boys
      have
      sex
      with
      multiple
      young
      women,
      drink
      alcohol
      frequently,
      and
      some
      of
      them
      even
      did
      a
      collection
      of
      drugs.
      Despite
      this,
      they
      all
      performed
      their
      priesthood
      duties
      without
      a
      second
      thought.
      I
      checked
      in
      on
      my
      ward
      recently.
      There
      are
      no
      more
      young
      men.
      All
      the
      priesthood
      duties
      are
      being
      performed
      by
      the
      elders.
      All
      those
      boys
      I
      knew
      have
      gone
      inactive.
      A
      lot
      of
      the
      young
      women
      went
      with
      them.
      At
      least
      when
      it
      comes
      to
      my
      town,
      the
      church
      is
      being
      held
      up
      by
      the
      really
      old.
      It
      will
      probably
      only
      be
      a
      couple
      decades
      until
      they
      can't
      do
      all
      the
      priesthood
      ordinances
      by
      themselves,
      and
      a
      a
      handful
      more
      before
      they
      die
      off.
      I've
      never
      been
      more
      excited

      It's

      I'm
      actually
      from
      Star
      Valley,
      and
      from
      what
      I
      know
      it
      is
      mostly
      older
      people,
      like
      what
      I
      said
      about
      the
      other
      stuff.
      But
      that
      also
      didn't
      stop
      those
      other

      You

      one

      From
      what
      I
      understand
      it
      is
      like
      most
      addictive
      substances.
      Alcohol
      for
      example.
      Alcohol
      is
      bad
      for
      you.
      Period.
      It
      hurts
      your
      body
      and
      is
      addictive.
      However,
      a
      lot
      of
      people
      use
      alcohol
      for
      social
      activities;
      and
      in
      moderation
      that
      can
      be
      fine.
      The
      same
      goes
      for
      porn.
      Aside
      from
      this,
      there
      are
      a
      lot
      of
      issues
      with
      the
      porn
      industry
      itself.
      Plenty
      of
      videos
      are
      recorded
      and
      published
      without
      consent,
      videos
      are
      stolen
      from
      the
      personal
      sites
      of
      some
      models
      and
      re-uploaded
      onto
      free
      sites,
      and
      some
      are
      even
      obtained
      using
      sex
      trafficking.
      When
      finding
      a
      site
      to
      support,
      I
      usually
      recommend
      finding
      a
      single
      model
      you
      like
      and
      supporting
      then
      directly
      rather
      than
      finding
      random
      videos
      that
      could
      have
      been
      obtained
      by
      less
      legal
      means.
      There
      are
      also
      studies
      showing
      that
      watching
      excess
      porn
      leads
      to
      twisting
      men's
      views
      of
      sex.
      Because
      of
      this,
      you
      should
      always
      be
      aware
      of
      what
      material
      you
      are
      viewing
      and
      how
      much
      of
      it.
      If
      you
      are
      in
      a
      relationship
      where
      you
      are
      sexually
      intimate
      with
      the
      other,
      you
      should
      be
      honest
      about
      your
      porn
      viewing
      habits,
      and
      it
      is
      a
      good
      recommendation
      to
      even
      integrate
      your
      intake
      of
      porn
      with
      your
      sexual
      activity
      with
      your
      partner.
      This
      makes
      the
      activity
      less
      of
      an
      individual
      behavior
      and
      more
      of
      a
      social
      one
      that
      increases
      your
      intimacy
      with
      one
      another.
      TL:DR
      -
      Porn,
      like
      most
      addictive
      substances,
      is
      harmful.
      However,
      like
      most
      addictive
      substances,
      carefully
      moderated
      consumption
      can
      reduce
      these
      risks.

      I'm
      trans
      as
      well,
      nineteen
      right
      now,

      my

      three

      She

      there.
      While
      this
      is
      definitely
      not
      the
      worst
      way
      she
      could
      have
      responded
      (at
      least
      she
      still
      let
      me
      stay
      in
      the
      house
      after
      I
      was
      eighteen),
      it
      does
      not
      feel
      good
      to
      be
      so
      invisible.
      What's
      more
      important
      at
      your
      age
      is
      to
      build
      yourself
      a
      new
      family
      who
      accepts
      who
      you
      are.
      Friends
      who
      can
      support
      you
      in
      case
      your
      family
      does
      not.
      Then,
      after
      you
      have
      a
      support
      group,
      come
      out
      to
      your
      family
      if
      you
      still
      feel
      like
      you
      need
      to.
      And
      who
      knows?
      They
      could
      be
      really
      chill
      and
      accepting.
      Just
      take
      your
      time

      As
      a
      trans
      woman
      raised
      in
      the
      church,
      I
      can
      state
      that
      the
      church
      teaches
      that
      biological
      sex
      and
      gender
      are
      the
      same
      thing.
      I
      have
      even
      had
      it
      stated
      by
      a
      seminary
      teacher
      that
      was
      also
      a
      highly
      respected
      bishop,
      "When
      you
      go
      to
      heaven
      you
      will
      be
      the
      gender
      you
      were
      born
      with.
      So
      when
      certain
      people
      have
      surgeries
      to
      change
      this,
      they
      will
      have
      a
      little
      surprise
      waiting
      for
      them
      when
      they
      die."
      This
      was
      one
      of
      the
      main
      things
      that
      set
      me
      against
      the
      church,
      actually.
      According
      to
      Mormon
      doctrine
      I'd
      end
      up
      in
      the
      Telestial
      kingdom,
      which
      is
      stated
      to
      be
      "100
      times
      better
      than
      life
      on
      earth."
      However,
      that
      can't
      possibly
      true
      if
      I
      am
      forced
      to
      be
      a
      gender
      I
      am
      not.
      TL:DR
      -
      The
      church
      is
      dumb
      and
      thinks
      that
      gender
      and
      sex
      are
      the
      same
      thing,
      and
      believe
      that
      if
      a
      trans
      person
      undergoes
      sex
      realignment
      surgery
      they
      will
      be
      reverted
      to
      their
      dead
      gender
      when
      they
      get
      to
      the
      afterlife.

      Most
      Mormons
      think
      the

      is
      a
      good
      thing.

      I
      am
      a
      transgender
      woman,
      and
      I
      was
      raised
      in
      the
      church.
      Even
      before
      I
      realized
      that
      I
      was
      a
      woman,
      I
      suffered
      from
      intense
      self-loathing
      because
      of
      the
      church's
      strict
      divide
      between
      genders.
      I
      hated
      my
      young
      men's
      quorum,
      and
      much
      preferred
      spending
      time
      with
      the
      young
      women.
      I
      was
      forced
      by
      my
      family
      to
      attend
      the
      Boy
      Scouts,
      an
      activity
      that
      constantly
      reaffirmed
      the
      belief
      that
      I
      was
      wrong
      somehow.
      Due
      to
      this
      loathing
      and
      my
      lack
      of
      social
      connections,
      I
      became
      severely
      depressed.
      My
      mother
      noticed
      this,
      and
      arranged
      for
      me
      to
      see
      a
      counselor.
      Any
      other
      counselor
      could
      have
      probably
      realized
      that
      I
      was
      trans,
      but
      my
      mom
      decided
      to
      send
      me
      to
      a
      Mormon
      counselor.
      He
      did
      nothing
      but
      worsen
      my
      depression.
      I
      had
      developed
      a
      slight
      porn
      habit,
      and
      my
      counselor
      focused
      on
      this
      fact,
      blaming
      it
      for
      all
      of
      my
      troubles
      and
      making
      me
      feel
      even
      more
      shame.
      When
      I
      first
      discovered
      that
      I
      was
      trans
      I
      tried
      to
      kill
      myself
      that
      same
      day.
      The
      only
      exposure
      I
      had
      gotten
      relating
      to
      people
      changing
      their
      biological
      sex
      was
      brief
      mentions
      in
      church,
      and
      that
      info
      had
      always
      framed
      such
      people
      as
      crazy
      perverts
      who
      did
      so
      for
      sex.
      All
      the
      shame
      I
      had
      felt
      leading
      up
      to
      that
      moment
      came
      to
      a
      head,
      and
      I
      wanted
      to
      die.
      The
      only
      reason
      I
      didn't
      kill
      myself
      in
      that
      moment
      was
      out
      of
      fear
      that
      I
      would
      go
      to
      Hell
      because
      of
      what
      I
      was.
      If
      you're
      looking
      for
      positive
      influences
      the
      church
      has
      had
      on
      my
      life,
      that
      may
      be
      the
      only
      one.
      Over
      the
      next
      couple
      years
      I
      distanced
      myself
      from
      the
      church,
      and
      now
      I
      hate
      it
      vehemently
      for
      what
      it
      has
      put
      me
      though,
      and
      what
      it
      has
      put
      countless
      others
      through.
      The
      church
      has
      built
      a
      divide
      between
      my
      family
      and
      myself.
      My
      mother
      broke
      down
      into
      tears
      when
      she
      found
      out,
      and
      to
      this
      day
      a
      full
      year
      later
      she
      still
      believes
      that
      I
      am
      being
      lead
      astray.
      My
      younger
      sister
      and
      I
      used
      to
      have
      a
      great
      relationship,
      but
      once
      she
      found
      out
      she
      stopped
      speaking
      to
      me.
      She
      tells
      her
      friends
      at
      school
      how
      I
      am
      stupid
      and
      am
      making
      this
      all
      up
      for
      attention.
      TL;DR
      The
      church
      worsened
      my
      depression
      and
      self-loathing,
      nearly
      bringing
      me
      to
      killing
      myself,
      and
      formed
      an
      immense
      divide
      between
      me
      and
      my
      family

      In
      SSkies,
      the
      closest
      things
      to
      black
      holes
      that
      you
      can
      find
      are
      called
      Wells.
      They
      function
      similar
      to
      black
      holes
      as
      they
      suck
      in
      anything
      that
      gets
      too
      close,
      and
      can
      sometimes
      be
      difficult
      to
      get
      out
      of.
      However,
      unlike
      in
      our
      universe,
      these
      black
      holes
      do
      not
      come
      from
      dead
      stars.
      Instead,
      they
      are
      created
      by
      living
      judgments
      to
      trap
      their
      enemies.
      An
      example
      would
      be
      the
      Well
      in
      Eleutheria.
      This
      Well
      traps
      one
      of
      the
      enemies
      of
      the
      Halved,
      ABC
      the
      Well
      in
      the
      Blue
      Kingdom
      traps
      some
      creatures
      that
      wish
      to
      kill
      the
      local
      judgement.
      As
      for
      the
      souls
      question,
      no
      clue.
      But
      everything
      has
      a
      soul,
      and
      a
      lot
      of
      the
      weird
      creatures
      we
      see
      in
      SSkies
      wouldn't
      necessarily
      need
      gravity
      or
      other
      things
      to
      live
      so......idk

      I
      say
      unlikely
      but
      not
      impossible?
      Some
      of
      the
      paragraphs
      do
      feel
      like
      something
      an
      apostle
      would
      write,
      and
      the
      domain
      has
      been
      secured
      so
      the
      creator
      can't
      be
      tracked
      so
      whoever
      made
      this
      did
      spend
      some
      money
      to
      ensure
      they
      can't
      be
      found.
      The
      resource
      page
      seems
      really
      out
      of
      place,
      and
      a
      couple
      of
      sentences
      seem
      really
      unlike
      the
      apostles.
      If
      this
      apostle
      doesn't
      come
      forward
      either
      before
      or
      shortly
      after
      conference
      I
      would
      say
      it's
      definitely
      fake.
      Until
      then,
      we
      can
      hope.
      This
      would
      be
      amazing
      if
      true.

      I'm
      a
      huge
      fan
      of
      speed
      running,
      especially
      when
      the
      game
      is
      not
      one
      that
      seems
      to
      lend
      itself
      to
      that
      format.
      An
      example
      of
      this
      would
      be
      a
      person
      speed
      running
      Sunless
      Sea,
      and
      hoping
      that
      the
      rng
      of
      that
      game
      twisted
      in
      your
      favor.
      So
      of
      course
      when
      I
      got
      into
      Fallen
      London,
      I
      started
      thinking
      about
      what
      it
      would
      be
      like
      to
      speed
      run
      this
      game.
      Of
      course,
      traditional
      speed
      running
      with
      a
      running
      timer
      would
      not
      be
      appropriate
      for
      this
      game.
      It
      would
      not
      be
      enjoyable
      to
      observe
      or
      perform
      as
      it
      would
      start
      with
      the
      player
      quickly
      using
      up
      their
      starting
      20
      actions,
      and
      then
      doing
      nothing
      for
      ten
      minutes
      at
      a
      time.
      It
      would
      also
      require
      the
      player
      to
      stay
      awake
      for
      potentially
      hundreds
      of
      hours,
      so
      that
      doesn't
      seem
      like
      a
      good
      way
      of
      doing
      things.
      A
      better
      way
      of
      "timing"
      runs
      in
      a
      game
      like
      this
      would
      be
      by
      counting
      the
      number
      of
      in-game
      actions
      it
      took
      you
      to
      accomplish
      any
      one
      achievement.
      This
      would
      allow
      runners
      to
      stop
      and
      take
      breaks,
      and
      even
      allow
      them
      to
      not
      use
      any
      actions
      until
      they
      get
      a
      particular
      opportunity
      card
      they
      may
      need.
      Proving
      the
      number
      of
      actions
      actually
      used
      is
      a
      difficult
      task,
      and
      the
      closest
      solution
      I
      could
      think
      of
      is
      by
      having
      the
      runner
      echo
      every
      action
      they
      make,
      and
      change
      the
      title
      to
      the
      number
      that
      action
      was
      (or
      numbers
      for
      choices
      that
      take
      more
      than
      one
      action).
      It
      is
      not
      a
      perfect
      solution,
      but
      doing
      this
      would
      require
      some
      level
      of
      mutual
      trust.
      As
      for
      categories,
      that's
      the
      fun
      part.
      You
      of
      course
      could
      have
      categories
      for
      all
      the
      ambitions,
      at
      least
      once
      they're
      all
      finished.
      You
      could
      have
      a
      category
      dedicated
      to
      obtaining
      Courier's
      footprint,
      or
      to
      obtain
      7
      in
      all
      the
      "A
      Name
      Scrawled/Whispered/Flourished/Written"
      categories.
      There
      are
      a
      lot
      of
      options
      there.
      Let
      me
      know
      if
      this
      sounds
      interesting
      to
      you,
      and
      if
      anyone
      else
      has
      ever
      done
      it
      before.
      I
      just
      might
      start
      making
      alts
      to
      start
      doing
      this.

      I

      that

      I
      would
      say
      that
      there
      should
      be
      a
      seperation
      between
      Fate-Assisted
      Runs
      and
      No
      Fate
      Runs.
      That
      way
      people
      who
      are
      willing
      to
      spend
      fate
      for
      certain
      stories
      can.
      Perhaps
      it
      can
      be
      divided
      even
      further
      into
      Free
      Fate-Assisted
      runs
      where
      you
      can
      use
      the
      fate
      you
      are
      given
      at
      the
      start
      but
      not
      any
      more.
      More
      on
      Fate,
      I
      personal
      think
      any
      fate-locked
      path
      that
      is
      purely
      for
      grinding(such
      as
      gaining
      favors
      through
      the
      items
      that
      increase
      renown,
      instantly
      curing
      menaces,
      and
      also
      buying
      more
      cards)
      should
      be
      banned.
      Fate
      locked
      storylines
      could
      be
      a
      way
      to
      gain
      special
      items
      that
      can
      be
      beneficial,
      but
      buying
      infinite
      cards
      or
      favors
      seems
      to
      artificially
      lower
      the
      action
      count.
      But
      if
      people
      really
      wanted
      to
      do
      that,
      they
      could
      just
      create
      yet
      another
      category
      On
      seasonal
      events,
      I
      believe
      that
      they
      should
      be
      divided
      into
      their
      own
      category
      as
      well.
      Perhaps
      a
      blanket
      rule
      that
      says
      if
      any
      action
      you
      perform
      is
      only
      possible
      during
      a
      seasonal
      event,
      then
      that
      run
      goes
      under
      the
      seasonal
      event
      category.
      That
      way
      a
      runner
      could
      still
      play
      while
      an
      event
      is
      active,
      but
      still
      be
      in
      the
      category
      that
      does
      not
      include
      those
      events.
      Also,
      happy
      cake
      day!

      I
      really
      don't

      I
      personally
      see

      as

      they

      their
      own
      personal
      preferences
      such
      as
      what
      opera
      to
      see
      or
      strong
      beliefs
      about
      lying,
      but
      they
      change
      their
      personalities
      to
      match
      what
      they
      think
      you
      would
      like.
      That's
      why
      you
      are
      tempted
      by
      both
      male
      and
      female
      devils.
      They're
      trying
      to
      find
      your
      preference.
      I
      also
      got
      a
      lot
      of
      this
      from
      the
      January
      exceptional
      story,
      Cricket,
      Anyone?
      A
      devil
      in
      that
      story
      explains
      that
       gt;!devils
      do
      not
      actually
      speak,
      and
      their
      voice
      is
      just
      a
      lure
      to
      steal
      souls.
      Instead,
      they
      communicate
      by
      dancing
      out
      correspondence
      sigils.! lt;
      This
      makes
      sense
      because
       gt;!devils
      are
      bees,
      and
      bees
      communicate
      by
      doing
      specific
      movements
      that
      could
      be
      interpreted
      as
      a
      dance.! lt;
      I
      basically
      took
      the
      info
      from
      that
      exceptional
      story,
      and
      I
      ran
      with
      it
      and
      began
      to
      interpret
      devils
      as
      creatures
      that
      are
      willing
      to
      change
      anything
      about
      themselves
      if
      it
      means
      a
      better
      chance
      at
      taking
      your
      soul.

      Oh,
      so
      helpful
       #128530;
      Anyway,
      I
      get
      this
      often
      as
      well.
      Particularly
      because
      I
      fear
      that
      the
      world
      will
      end
      and
      I'll
      die.
      Honestly,
      there
      is
      nothing
      to
      force
      this
      to
      lessen.
      But
      the
      longer
      you
      are
      out
      of
      the
      church,
      the
      less
      you
      will
      feel
      this.
      It
      takes
      time
      to
      recover
      from
      the
      trauma
      that
      the
      church
      put
      you
      through,
      and
      there
      is
      very
      little
      you
      can
      do
      to
      hasten
      the
      process.
      Maybe
      consider
      getting
      a
      therapist
      if
      it
      gets
      really
      bad.
      You
      just
      need
      to
      handle
      this
      line
      any
      other
      traumatic
      event

      Yeah
      that
      second
      spoiler
      is
      pretty
      well
      hidden.
      Although
      if
      you
      have
      access
      to
      this
      month's
      exceptional
      story
      they
      do
      touch
      on
      it
      a
      not
      l
      bit.
      No
      spoilers
      other
      than
      that
      unless
      you
      don't

      Opposing
      the
      other
      comment
      here,
      I
      would
      suggest
      not
      using
      those
      terms
      at
      all.
      Sir
      and
      ma'am
      are
      highly
      outdated,
      and
      people
      under
      the
      age
      of
      40
      typically
      do
      not
      like
      them
      used
      to
      describe
      them.
      On
      the
      topic
      of
      gender
      nonconforming
      individuals,
      I
      can
      say
      as
      a
      trans
      woman
      who
      gets
      misgendered
      a
      lot
      that
      most
      people
      who
      are
      not
      in
      line
      with
      the
      traditional
      gender
      binary
      feel
      really
      uncomfortable
      when
      it
      comes
      to
      correcting
      random
      strangers
      on
      their
      pronouns.
      Gender
      nonconforming
      individuals
      typically
      have
      a
      lot
      of
      anxiety
      with
      how
      they
      are
      perceived,
      and
      if
      they
      are
      misgendered
      their
      typical
      reaction
      would
      be
      to
      get
      out
      of
      the
      situation
      as
      fast
      as
      possible
      rather
      than
      correct
      the
      individual
      and
      potentially
      make
      a
      scene.
      While
      the
      fact
      that
      you
      are
      asking
      this
      question
      makes
      it
      sound
      like
      you
      are
      a
      very
      welcoming
      and
      kind
      person
      towards
      the
      community,
      they
      do
      not
      know
      that.
      And
      even
      if
      they
      do,
      there
      could
      be
      a
      person
      nearby
      who
      is
      not.
      I
      recommend
      looking
      at
      this
      thread
      that
      talked
      about
      a
      similar
      topic,
      and
      it
      gives
      some
      suggestions
      for
      what
      to
      use
      in
      place
      of
      sir
      and
      ma'am.

      Get
      a
      new
      therapist.
      All
      the
      other
      stuff
      aside,
      the
      fact
      that

      As
      a
      trans
      woman
      myself,
      I
      know
      what
      you're
      going
      through.
      I
      went
      through
      a
      lot
      of
      it
      myself,
      even
      the
      thought
      "I
      can't
      do
      that,
      people
      don't
      just
      switch
      genders."
      On
      your
      fears
      that
      this
      is
      just
      a
      phase,
      I
      would
      not
      worry
      about
      that
      at
      all.
      It
      takes
      years
      for
      a
      trans
      person
      to
      get
      anything
      done
      that
      isn't
      irreversible.
      If
      you
      start
      slow
      with
      clothes
      and
      having
      people
      refer
      to
      you
      as
      female,
      and
      very
      slowly
      work
      towards
      the
      big
      things
      like
      hormones
      and
      surgery,
      then
      by
      the
      time
      you
      get
      to
      that
      point
      you'll
      have
      had
      years
      to
      think
      about
      this
      and
      decide
      if
      it
      is
      something
      you
      want.
      As
      for
      your
      parents,
      that
      is
      a
      tough
      one.
      Every
      parent
      is
      different,
      and
      you
      are
      the
      only
      one
      who
      is
      qualified
      to
      say
      how
      they
      might
      react
      because
      you
      know
      them
      better
      than
      anyone
      else.
      I
      would
      say
      that
      you
      should
      trust
      your
      gut,
      and
      if
      you
      truly
      think
      they
      already
      know
      and
      are
      waiting
      on
      you
      then
      you
      should
      tell
      them.
      However,
      before
      you
      do
      any
      of
      that
      I
      would
      make
      sure
      you
      have
      a
      plan
      to
      keep
      you
      safe.
      You
      should
      come
      out
      to
      a
      small
      collection
      of
      friends
      and
      adults
      who
      you
      trust
      before
      you
      talk
      to
      your
      parents,
      just
      to
      ensure
      you
      will
      have
      a
      safe
      place
      to
      turn
      in
      the
      event
      of
      anything
      bad
      happening.
      It'll
      also
      be
      great
      practice
      for
      when
      you
      come
      out
      to
      your
      parents.

      Hello
      everyone!
      I'm
      looking
      to
      form
      a
      DnD
      group,
      and
      my
      experience
      with
      the
      game
      is
      that
      it
      is
      just
      way
      more
      fun
      to
      play
      with
      like-minded
      people,
      so
      that's
      why
      I'm
      positing
      here!
      No
      experience
      with
      the
      game
      is
      needed,
      but
      for
      those
      who
      do
      know
      a
      bit
      we'll
      be
      playing
      the
      Monster
      of
      the
      Week
      system.
      PM
      me
      for
      details,
      and
      I
      hope
      to
      make
      some
      good
      friends
      :)

      Maybe
      Marvin
      still
      has
      not
      confessed,
      so
      now
      it's
      Paul's
      job
      to
      get
      him
      to
      do
      that.
      Or,
      if
      you're
      like
      me
      and
      you
      plan
      to
      believe
      in
      the
      Paul=Care
      theory
      until
      the
      day
      you
      die,
      the
      game
      could
      be
      trying
      to
      get
      Paul
      to
      remember
      his
      life
      as
      Care
      so
      he
      can
      divulge
      where
      he
      was
      taken.

      I'm
      not
      sure
      about
      the
      threat
      part,
      but
      I
      think
      it
      does
      explain
      why
      they
      were
      censored
      in
      the
      past,
      and
      how
      Paul
      recognized
      them.
      These
      things
      seem
      to
      be
      sort
      of
      secret
      family
      heirlooms,
      things
      only
      meant
      to
      be
      seen
      by
      people
      who
      are
      in
      the
      family
      already.
      That's
      how
      Paul
      immediately
      recognized
      it,
      and
      why
      he
      kind
      of
      freaked
      out
      when
      he
      saw
      them
      the
      first
      time.
      They
      were
      for
      the
      eyes
      of
      family
      members
      only,
      and
      yet
      they
      had
      somehow
      been
      recreated
      in
      some
      random
      game.
      As
      for
      why
      we
      get
      to
      see
      them
      now,
      maybe
      that
      is
      a
      threat?
      Saying
      how
      we
      the
      viewers,
      are
      too
      far
      in
      to
      turn
      back,
      and
      have
      become
      part
      of
      the
      family
      against
      our
      wills?
      Or
      it
      could
      be
      a
      nicer
      thing,
      meaning
      that
      we
      are
      trusted
      enough
      to
      see
      these
      things,
      and
      are
      considered
      a
      part
      of
      the
      family
      now
      It's
      weird

      This
      is
      a
      commonly
      discussed
      theory,
      and
      it
      is
      one
      I
      personally
      love
      and
      look
      into
      a
      lot.
      One
      common
      explanation
      for
      Paul's
      seeming
      memory
      loss
      is
      that
      Paul
      has
      suppressed
      the
      horrible
      memories
      associated
      with
      being
      Care.
      Afterall,
      Care
      was
      kidnapped
      as
      a
      young
      child,
      and
      that
      certainly
      would
      have
      an
      adverse
      affect
      on
      anyone.
      But
      then
      why
      begin
      to
      believe
      that
      he
      and
      Care
      are
      a
      different
      person?
      Well,
      if
      Paul
      was
      Care
      at
      some
      point,
      it
      is
      likely
      that
      he
      is
      transgender.
      Some
      people
      say
      that
      maybe
      Marvin
      forced
      Care
      to
      become
      Paul,
      but
      I
      find
      that
      unlikely
      as
      Marvin
      seems
      focused
      on
      turning
      Care
      into
      the
      Windmill
      Girl,
      and
      forcing
      Care
      to
      be
      male
      seems
      counterintuitive
      to
      this
      goal,
      so
      I
      think
      Care's
      transition
      to
      Paul
      was
      a
      choice
      on
      her
      part.
      So
      after
      Paul
      transitioned,
      I
      think
      that
      the
      combined
      trauma
      of
      being
      kidnapped
      and
      both
      verbally
      abused
      and
      physically
      mutilated
      by
      his
      father
      lead
      to
      Paul
      forgetting
      his
      life
      as
      Care,
      and
      distancing
      himself
      from
      those
      events.
      For
      example,
      by
      pretending
      it
      all
      happened
      to
      a
      family
      member
      he
      never
      really
      met.
      (BTW:
      If
      this
      is
      true
      it
      would
      be
      a
      very
      toxic
      representation
      of
      trans
      peeps.
      Just
      wanted
      to
      poke
      in
      here
      and
      say
      that
      this
      is
      all
      fiction
      and
      not
      meant
      to
      be
      a
      real
      representation
      of
      what
      trans
      people
      go
      through.
      I
      am
      a
      trans
      woman
      myself,
      and
      understand
      the
      struggles)
      Anyway,
      the
      question
      the
      game
      seems
      to
      want
      answered
      is
      where
      was
      Care
      after
      she
      escaped
      from
      Martin.
      It
      says
      in
      19
      that
      Care
      "left
      her
      father's
      school"
      on
      one
      day
      and
      "arrived
      at
      home"
      two
      days
      later,
      but
      that
      no
      one
      knew
      where
      she
      was
      for
      the
      day
      in
      between.
      It's
      likely
      the
      game
      has
      been
      used
      to
      get
      a
      number
      of
      family
      members
      to
      admit
      to
      various
      things
      (Martin
      being
      the
      prime
      example),
      and
      right
      now
      it
      seems
      to
      be
      trying
      to
      get
      Paul
      to
      remember
      his
      life
      as
      Care
      to
      answer
      that
      question.
      Anyway,
      that
      was
      long,
      but
      that's
      my
      thoughts
      on
      it.

      Personally
      for
      me,
      I
      believe
      that
      Paul
      is
      Care
      after
      deciding
      to
      go
      through
      a
      gender
      transition
      rather
      than
      having
      something
      to
      do
      with
      the
      rebirthing
      process,
      like
      some
      other
      people
      think.
      I
      like
      this
      because
      it's
      more
      in
      the
      realm
      of
      reality(which
      I
      feel
      the
      majority
      of
      Petscop
      is),
      and
      because
      I'm
      trans
      so
      I
      like
      it
      :p.
      Either
      way,
      I
      think
      the
      change
      was
      likely
      to
      occur
      a
      couple
      years
      after
      Care
      escaped
      from
      Marvin
      and
      returned
      home.
      Going
      though
      such
      a
      traumatic
      event
      would
      likely
      prompt
      a
      lot
      of
      introspection
      on
      Care's
      part,
      and
      would
      likely
      lead
      to
      the
      realization
      that
      they
      wished
      to
      live
      as
      Paul.

      I
      mean,
      they
      are
      explicitly
      making
      fun
      of
      the
      company
      and
      telling
      the

      how
      dumb
      the

      Just
      like
      the
      title
      says.
      This
      theory
      does
      have
      some
      shortcomings,
      which
      I
      will
      explain
      at
      the
      bottom,
      but
      I
      think
      I'm
      onto
      something.
      Anyway,
      we
      all
      know
      the
      Windmill
      Problem.
      Marvin
      goes
      to
      see
      a
      windmill
      with
      his
      two
      female
      friends,
      one
      of
      them
      being
      his
      future
      wife,
      and
      the
      other
      being
      Lina,
      who
      will
      be
      disappearing
      and
      dying
      soon.
      Marvin
      and
      Lina
      play
      around
      inside
      the
      Windmill,
      as
      shown
      with
      the
      segment
      where
      Paul,
      playing
      as
      the
      Shadow-Monster-Man,
      goes
      into
      the
      Windmill,
      and
      plays
      with
      the
      mechanisms
      using
      a
      tool,
      while
      a
      female
      looking
      figure
      that
      represents
      Lina
      is
      nearby.
      My
      theory
      states
      that
      this
      is
      not
      showing
      Marvin
      doing
      anything
      sinister
      to
      Lina,
      but
      instead
      him
      tampering
      with
      the
      structural
      integrity
      of
      the
      Windmill
      itself.
      The
      scene
      as
      we
      know
      it
      is
      that
      Marvin,
      Lina,
      and
      Marvin's
      future
      wife
      are
      at
      the
      Windmill
      for
      whatever
      reason,
      and
      Rainer
      states
      that
      this
      was
      a
      bad
      idea.
      I
      believe
      this
      was
      a
      bad
      idea
      simply
      because
      the
      Windmill
      was
      old,
      and
      falling
      apart.
      The
      way
      Rainer
      phrased
      that
      saying
      did
      not
      imply
      that
      it
      was
      a
      bad
      idea
      for
      Lina
      to
      be
      with
      Marvin,
      simply
      that
      it
      was
      a
      bad
      idea
      to
      go
      to
      the
      Windmill
      at
      all,
      as
      if
      the
      Windmill
      itself
      was
      dangerous.
      For
      me,
      the
      only
      way
      a
      building
      can
      be
      dangerous
      is
      if
      it
      is
      structurally
      unsound.
      Anyway,
      the
      kids
      are
      playing
      at
      the
      Windmill
      and
      it
      is
      during
      this
      time
      that
      we
      get
      that
      scene
      of
      Marvin
      using
      the
      tool
      inside
      the
      Windmill.
      Then
      we
      get
      to
      the
      big
      question
      of
      the
      disappearing
      windmill.
      The
      scene
      as
      it
      is
      described
      is
      that
      Marvin
      and
      Lina
      are
      standing
      in
      front
      of
      the
      Windmill
      for
      one
      moment,
      and
      the
      next
      moment
      the
      only
      thing
      you
      can
      see
      is
      Marvin
      standing
      there,
      no
      Lina
      and
      no
      windmill.
      Whenever
      I
      do
      theories
      on
      Petscop,
      I
      like
      to
      base
      them
      in
      reality.
      I
      do
      not
      see
      Petscop
      as
      supernatural
      horror,
      I
      see
      it
      as
      a
      murder
      mystery.
      So
      while
      people
      are
      referencing
      different
      dimensions,
      and
      things
      of
      the
      sort,
      those
      don't
      do
      it
      for
      me.
      If
      the
      story
      goes
      in
      that
      direction,
      I'll
      accept
      it,
      but
      right
      now
      it
      feels
      like
      it
      isn't
      so
      I'm
      going
      to
      do
      my
      best
      time
      describe
      this
      incident
      as
      something
      that
      could
      happen
      in
      the
      real
      world.
      I
      believe
      that
      due
      to
      a
      combination
      of
      Martin's
      tampering,
      and
      the
      disrepair
      of
      the
      windmill,
      that
      the
      entire
      windmill
      collapsed.
      Viewing
      the
      collapse
      of
      an
      entire
      building
      would
      be
      extremely
      traumatizing,
      especially
      to
      a
      young
      child,
      and
      this
      could
      create
      the
      illusion
      in
      the
      minds
      of
      the
      viewer
      that
      the
      windmill
      simply
      disappeared.
      I
      believe
      this
      would
      have
      taken
      place
      shortly
      after
      Martin's
      tampering.
      He
      and
      Lina
      would
      have
      exited
      the
      windmill,
      Martin
      in
      front
      and
      Lina
      shortly
      behind.
      Lina's
      sister
      would
      have
      seen
      them
      leaving,
      and
      just
      as
      Lina
      was
      about
      to
      leave
      the
      windmill
      it
      would
      collapse.
      This
      would
      give
      the
      appearance
      that
      the
      windmill
      disappeared,
      and
      Lina
      with
      it.
      This
      would
      lead
      to
      the
      family
      labeling
      this
      event
      as
      a
      horrible
      tragedy,
      and
      only
      Martin
      would
      know
      that
      Lina's
      death
      was
      entirely
      his
      fault.
      Rainer
      would
      then
      do
      some
      research
      and
      find
      this
      out
      too,
      and
      confront
      Martin.
      TL:DR
      -
      Martin
      did
      something
      to
      compromise
      the
      integrity
      of
      the
      windmill,
      and
      it
      collapsed
      with
      Lina
      aside
      giving
      the
      affect
      of
      them
      both
      disappearing.
      Now,
      there
      are
      a
      number
      of
      problems
      with
      this
      theory.
      The
      first
      being
      that
      it
      appears
      that
      Lina
      actually
      died
      by
      getting
      hit
      by
      a
      car,
      due
      to
      what
      her
      tombstone
      says
      and
      the
      actions
      of
      the
      player
      character
      after
      discovering
      said
      tombstone.
      This
      not
      only
      throws
      a
      wrench
      into
      my
      theory,
      but
      also
      Rainer's
      original
      story
      where
      Lina
      disappeared
      with
      the
      windmill,
      and
      it
      is
      something
      we
      as
      a
      community
      need
      to
      figure
      out.
      The
      second
      being
      that
      Rainer
      seems
      to
      believe
      that
      Martin
      can
      find
      Lina's
      unmarked
      grave,
      implying
      that
      the
      family
      never
      found
      the
      body
      but
      Martin
      did,
      and
      he
      buried
      it
      himself.
      I
      do
      have
      a
      couple
      ways
      to
      explain
      this
      with
      my
      theory,
      but
      nothing
      super
      solid.
      One
      idea
      I've
      been
      throwing
      around
      is
      that
      Martin
      dug
      through
      the
      ruins
      of
      the
      windmill
      before
      help
      arrived
      in
      order
      to
      ensure
      there
      was
      no
      evidence
      that
      this
      was
      his
      fault.
      I
      see
      it
      as
      Martin's
      future
      wife
      running
      to
      get
      help
      while
      Martin
      says
      he
      is
      going
      to
      try
      and
      get
      Lina
      out.
      He
      gets
      any
      possible
      evidence
      towards
      his
      tampering,
      and
      finds
      Lina's
      body.
      For
      a
      reason
      I
      have
      yet
      to
      think
      of,
      he
      moves
      her
      body
      to
      another
      location,
      and
      later
      buries
      her.
      Why?
      Idk,
      and
      it's
      especially
      hard
      because
      we
      don't
      know
      how
      old
      Martin
      is
      right
      now.
      Like,
      if
      he's
      8
      then
      this
      is
      definitely
      not
      happening.
      But
      if
      he's
      a
      little
      older,
      say
      maybe
      close
      to
      his
      twenties?
      I
      can
      see
      him
      doing
      this.
      Anyway,
      the
      best
      reason
      for
      him
      doing
      that
      is
      because
      her
      body
      somehow
      provides
      evidence
      to
      his
      tampering.
      Or,
      if
      you
      want
      to
      go
      really
      dark
      with
      it
      all,
      perhaps
      he
      found
      Lina
      alive
      but
      badly
      injured,
      and
      since
      she
      saw
      him
      mess
      with
      the
      windmill
      he
      killed
      her
      so
      she
      wouldn't
      tell
      anyone,
      and
      hid
      her
      body
      so
      they
      wouldn't
      see
      that
      she
      was
      actually
      murdered.
      Anyway,
      I
      would
      say
      everything
      below
      the
      TL:DR
      is
      wild
      speculation,
      but
      the
      part
      before
      it
      actually
      holds
      some
      ground.
      I
      hope
      you
      like
      this
      theory,
      and
      I'd
      like
      to
      hear
      what
      you
      think.

      Are
      you
      mtf?
      Cause
      I
      know
      that
      going

      estrogen
      usually
      makes
      your

      gain

      If

      usually
      helps
      build
      muscle
      mass

      maybe
      it
      would
      help
      gain
      weight

      In
      my
      opinion,
      almost
      always
      yes.
      It
      makes
      short
      hops
      and
      up
      tilts
      much
      easier
      time
      perform,
      and
      it
      just
      gives
      you
      more
      control
      over
      your
      movement.
      One
      of
      the
      few
      exemptions
      from
      this,
      in
      my
      opinion,
      is
      when
      playing
      Joker.
      The
      advanced
      mobility
      with
      the
      gun
      special
      feels
      much
      smoother
      for
      me
      with
      tap
      jump.
      But
      that
      could
      be
      just

      I'm
      new
      to
      the

      I
      want
      to

      I'm

      I'm

      an

      drawing

      I
      honestly
      think
      Wormwood
      is
      the
      best
      character
      added
      by
      Hamlet,
      if
      not
      the
      best
      character
      period.
      His
      ability
      to
      manipulate
      his
      sanity
      so
      easily
      makes
      nightmare
      fuel
      farming
      a
      breeze
      and
      allows
      him
      to
      easily
      get
      beard
      hair
      for
      meat
      effigies.
      That
      combined
      with
      him
      be
      able
      to
      eat
      monster
      food
      with
      no
      significant
      penalties
      makes
      him
      extremely
      powerful.

      Do
      you
      think
      they
      will
      change
      anything
      about
      him,
      or
      will
      be

      Do
      you

      I
      understand
      what
      you
      are
      saying,
      but
      I
      believe
      that
      you
      are
      completely
      wrong
      about
      this
      interpretation.
      In
      the
      spirit
      of
      professional
      debate
      I
      will
      go
      through
      each
      of
      your
      points
      and
      explain
      why
      I
      disagree
      with
      them.
      Family
      Values
      -
      I
      completely
      agree
      that
      one
      of
      the
      most
      important
      themes
      of
      this
      show
      is
      family
      values,
      that
      you
      must
      protect
      your
      family
      and
      support
      them.
      However,
      I
      do
      not
      believe
      that
      this
      is
      a
      purely
      conservative
      viewpoint.
      In
      fact,
      I
      believe
      that
      with
      the
      way
      it
      is
      portrayed
      in
      this
      show
      it
      is
      a
      more
      liberal
      one.
      One
      example
      would
      be
      Lady
      Margery
      being
      aware
      of
      her
      brother's
      love
      of
      men,
      and
      keeping
      this
      quiet
      from
      Joffrey,
      and
      even
      being
      willing
      to
      allow
      her
      husband
      Renly
      to
      be
      with
      her
      brother
      so
      the
      two
      could
      be
      happy.
      She
      loved
      her
      brother,
      and
      only
      wanted
      him
      to
      be
      happy.
      This
      acceptance
      for
      a
      family
      member
      despite
      their
      differences
      is
      not
      something
      that
      is
      in
      line
      with
      conservative
      ideology,
      and
      is
      instead
      something
      liberal
      movements
      try
      to
      encourage.
      Morality
      -
      When
      it
      comes
      to
      "alternative
      lifestyles"
      as
      you
      put
      it,
      I
      think
      you
      have
      missed
      a
      good
      portion
      of
      the
      show.
      When
      it
      comes
      to
      sexually
      open
      relationships,
      Oberyn
      Martell
      and
      Ellaria
      Sand
      are
      an
      example
      of
      a
      couple
      who
      has
      an
      alternative
      lifestyle
      and
      love
      each
      other
      very
      much.
      And
      while
      Oberyn
      did
      eventually
      die,
      he
      did
      so
      because
      of
      a
      mixture
      of
      his
      own
      hubris
      and
      his
      desire
      to
      avenge
      his
      sister.
      Or
      you
      could
      look
      at
      the
      large
      number
      of
      queer
      characters
      in
      the
      show.
      While
      they
      are
      still
      disliked
      I'm
      the
      primary
      high
      society,
      the
      average
      Joe
      doesn't
      care
      about
      hating
      them,
      and
      in
      places
      like
      Dorne
      or
      Highgarden
      they
      are
      accepted
      wholeheartedly.
      Again,
      something
      definitely
      not
      accepted
      by
      conservative
      ideology.
      And
      on
      the
      comparing
      of
      murdering
      children
      in
      the
      show
      to
      modern
      day
      abortions,
      I
      think
      that
      is
      not
      an
      equal
      comparison.
      In
      all
      the
      situations
      like
      that
      in
      the
      show,
      the
      mother
      is
      having
      the
      child
      taken
      forcibly
      from
      her,
      while
      an
      abortion
      is
      when
      the
      mother
      is
      willingly
      getting
      rid
      of
      a
      fetus.
      The
      reason
      those
      scenes
      are
      horrible
      are
      because
      the
      mother's
      are
      having
      their
      children
      taken
      from
      them
      despite
      their
      best
      efforts.
      Kind
      of
      like
      what
      modern
      conservative
      government
      is
      doing
      to
      the
      families
      of
      illegal
      aliens,
      although
      fortunately
      without
      the
      permanent
      nature
      of
      death.
      Political
      Correctness
      -
      I
      believe
      that
      this
      show
      actually
      does
      a
      great
      job
      of
      political
      correctness,
      and
      that
      is
      seen
      at
      the
      beginning
      of
      every
      episode.
      A
      warming
      about
      the
      content
      that
      is
      in
      the
      episode,
      and
      warnings
      like
      that
      are
      both
      needed
      for
      legal
      reasons
      but
      they
      are
      also
      a
      form
      of
      political
      correctness.
      That,
      and
      the
      show
      is
      a
      tragedy.
      My
      favorite
      saying
      is
      "Writing
      tragedy
      is
      not
      problematic."
      Basically,
      if
      you
      are
      writing
      a
      tragedy
      you
      will
      likely
      have
      scenes
      that
      would
      be
      culturally
      problematic
      in
      any
      other
      work,
      but
      if
      viewers
      are
      aware
      that
      the
      media
      they
      are
      consuming
      is
      a
      tragedy,
      then
      they
      know
      that
      the
      content
      within
      may
      be
      of
      a
      sensitive
      nature.
      Men
      and
      Women
      -
      Okay,
      I
      think
      this
      section
      is
      where
      you
      have
      come
      to
      misunderstand
      this
      show
      the
      most.
      Yes
      there
      are
      many
      male
      characters
      who
      protect
      their
      family,
      and
      yes
      there
      are
      many
      nurturing
      female
      characters.
      But
      there
      are
      just
      as
      many
      characters
      that
      are
      the
      opposite
      of
      this.
      I
      see
      that
      you
      mentioned
      Brienne,
      but
      she
      is
      only
      the
      most
      obvious
      character.
      Her
      entire
      character
      arc
      revolves
      around
      the
      fact
      that
      she
      has
      a
      lot
      of
      masculine
      traits.
      But
      outside
      of
      her
      we
      have
      Ygriette
      protecting
      Jon
      Snow
      when
      he
      first
      met
      the
      Wildlings,
      and
      even
      in
      the
      first
      assault
      on
      Castle
      Black.
      There
      is
      Arya,
      one
      of
      the
      main
      character
      who
      protects
      Gendry
      from
      the
      gold
      cloaks,
      gets
      him
      out
      of
      Harrenhal,
      and
      who
      made
      it
      her
      sole
      mission
      to
      protect
      her
      family
      by
      killing
      everyone
      who
      had
      ever
      wronged
      them.
      You
      have
      Cersei
      who
      was
      both
      nurturing
      to
      her
      children,
      but
      was
      just
      as
      much
      a
      protector
      to
      them.
      Or
      Catelyn
      Stark,
      who
      was
      nurturing
      to
      her
      children
      yes,
      but
      also
      fiercely
      protected
      them
      by
      trying
      to
      kidnap
      the
      man
      she
      believed
      to
      have
      harmed
      her
      children,
      and
      even
      until
      her
      death
      she
      fought
      to
      protect
      her
      children.
      On
      the
      flipside,
      you
      have
      Varys
      who
      was
      not
      a
      protector,
      but
      one
      who
      cared
      and
      loved
      those
      close
      to
      him.
      He
      did
      not
      actively
      protect
      Ross,
      but
      he
      was
      loving
      and
      caring
      towards
      her
      and
      treated
      her
      like
      family.
      In
      fact,
      he
      almost
      never
      took
      the
      protective
      role
      for
      anyone
      he
      cared
      for.
      He
      only
      loved
      them.
      I
      see
      you
      mention
      Sam
      in
      this
      section,
      and
      while
      he
      was
      definitely
      a
      protector,
      he
      was
      also
      a
      nurturing
      individual.
      He
      was
      extremely
      family
      oriented,
      and
      desired
      to
      help
      take
      care
      of
      Gilly's
      child
      and
      Gilly
      herself.
      Or
      Jorah
      Mormont
      who
      both
      wanted
      to
      protect
      Daenarys
      but
      who
      also
      cared
      for
      and
      nurtured
      her.
      As
      Dany
      needed
      less
      and
      less
      actual
      protection
      and
      more
      and
      more
      advice
      he
      switched
      roles,
      and
      supported
      her
      until
      his
      death.
      In
      short,
      Game
      of
      Thrones
      shows
      that
      men
      and
      women
      are
      the
      same.
      Both
      are
      capable
      of
      amazing
      things
      in
      all
      walks
      of
      life,
      and
      can
      have
      hopes
      and
      dreams
      outside
      of
      the
      extremely
      basic,
      two
      dimensional
      model
      of
      masculinity
      and
      femininity
      that
      you
      described
      in
      your
      post.
      Both
      men
      and
      women
      are
      simply
      people,
      and
      are
      capable
      of
      many
      different
      things.
      Walls
      work
      -
      I'm
      actually
      pretty
      sure
      that
      a
      big
      plot
      point
      of
      the
      last
      season
      is
      that
      walls
      don't
      always
      work?
      That
      aside,
      you
      said
      that
      this
      show
      puts
      the
      military
      in
      a
      positive
      light,
      and
      this
      is
      anything
      but
      the
      truth.
      You
      can
      look
      to
      Cersei
      talking
      to
      Sansa
      while
      they
      wait
      out
      Stannis'
      attack
      on
      King's
      Landing.
      She
      talks
      about
      how
      when
      a
      city
      is
      sacked,
      the
      attacking
      army
      rapes
      the
      women
      and
      kill
      children.
      Even
      Jorah
      agrees
      with
      this,
      saying
      how
      any
      men
      that
      follow
      Dany
      will
      wrongfully
      harm
      the
      people
      she
      invades.
      This
      is
      even
      further
      shown
      by
      Oberyn
      speaking
      of
      how
      his
      sister
      was
      raped
      and
      brutally
      murdered
      right
      after
      her
      children
      had
      been
      murdered
      in
      front
      of
      her
      as
      well.
      All
      of
      these
      actions
      were
      committed
      by
      men
      who
      were
      in
      the
      army,
      who
      you
      said
      believed
      in
      honor,
      but
      this
      is
      not
      honor.
      A
      common
      theme
      of
      GoT
      is
      that
      the
      men
      who
      make
      up
      armies
      are
      monsters.
      Daenarys
      was
      the
      Ultimate
      Democrat
      -
      I
      would
      actually
      say
      that
      if
      Dany
      resembled
      any
      modern
      political
      leader,
      I
      would
      compare
      her
      to
      Donald
      Trump
      before
      any
      democratic
      leader.
      Trump's
      entire
      campaign
      was
      "Make
      America
      Great
      Again"
      and
      you
      could
      say
      that
      Dany's
      belief
      system
      was
      quite
      similar.
      And
      you
      don't
      even
      have
      to
      look
      so
      hard
      to
      find
      news
      stories
      of
      former
      trump
      supporters
      who
      regret
      their
      decision
      because
      the
      policies
      he
      is
      setting
      are
      harming
      them
      personally.
      That
      and
      the
      fact
      that
      Trump
      does
      frequently
      threaten
      violence
      to
      those
      in
      his
      way
      or
      who
      critics
      criticize
      him.
      The
      system
      of
      government
      -
      I
      am
      going
      to
      neglect
      to
      talk
      on
      this
      point,
      as
      plenty
      of
      other
      people
      who
      are
      more
      knowledgeable
      on
      me
      in
      this
      topic
      have
      already
      explained
      in
      the
      comments
      why
      this
      section
      is
      wrong.
      The
      King
      -
      And
      finally,
      we
      have
      Bran
      as
      the
      king.
      A
      calm
      and
      dispassionate
      leader
      who
      values
      facts
      over
      emotions.
      I
      agree
      that
      these
      can
      be
      useful
      qualities
      for
      a
      leader,
      but
      when
      was
      the
      last
      time
      we
      had
      a
      conservative
      leader
      who
      acted
      in
      this
      manner?
      Looking
      at
      the
      current
      leader
      we
      have
      a
      man
      who
      will
      angrily
      rant
      at
      anyone
      who
      disagrees
      with
      him
      on
      a
      social
      media
      platform,
      who
      has
      tried
      to
      implement
      several
      policies
      that
      ended
      up
      falling
      due
      to
      him
      not
      thinking
      them
      through,
      and
      has
      personally
      insulted
      and
      called
      for
      violence
      against
      people
      in
      his
      congress
      that
      oppose
      him.
      As
      I
      said
      above,
      if
      Dany
      is
      to
      be
      compared
      to
      any
      modern
      day
      leader
      it
      is
      Trump.
      A
      hot-headed
      leader
      who
      does
      not
      consider
      the
      consequences
      of
      their
      actions
      before
      doing
      them,
      and
      causes
      their
      people
      to
      suffer
      because
      of
      it.
      Someone
      who
      is
      so
      obsessed
      with
      what
      they
      think
      is
      the
      perfect
      way
      to
      build
      their
      society
      that
      they
      harm
      anyone
      who
      stands
      in
      their
      way.
      I
      would
      personally
      compare
      Bran
      to
      president
      Obama.
      Not
      perfect
      by
      any
      regard,
      but
      someone
      willing
      to
      listen
      to
      their
      peers
      and
      think
      about
      their
      actions
      before
      doing
      them.
      A
      man
      who
      listens
      to
      the
      needs
      of
      the
      people,
      and
      does
      his
      best
      to
      slowly
      make
      the
      world
      better
      for
      everyone.
      That
      is
      all
      I
      have
      to
      say.
      I
      am
      sure
      this
      will
      be
      downvoted
      to
      Hell,
      but
      I
      couldn't
      stand
      such
      a
      blatant
      misinterpretation
      of
      one
      of
      my
      favorite
      shows.

      I've
      gotten
      pretty
      good
      at
      navigating
      the
      ruins
      in
      Hamlet,
      but
      there
      is
      one
      room
      layout
      that
      has
      been
      the
      death
      of
      five
      different
      runs,
      all
      five
      of
      which
      I
      was
      doing
      really
      good
      until
      that
      point.
      The
      room
      I'm
      struggling
      with
      is
      the
      room
      that
      has
      the
      Blue
      Sow
      Idol
      in
      the
      ruins
      that
      leads
      to
      the
      second
      island,
      and
      has
      the
      spinning
      dart
      traps.
      Does
      anyone
      have
      any
      suggestions
      on
      how
      to
      clear
      this
      room?

      In
      solo
      I
      have
      fallen
      in
      love
      with
      Wormwood.
      I
      just

      quickly
      lower

      From
      what
      I
      remember
      about
      seminary
      finals,
      they
      are
      pretty
      easy.
      As
      long
      as
      you
      have
      a
      vague
      understanding
      about
      Christianity
      you
      can
      guess
      most
      of
      the
      answers.
      And
      I'm
      pretty
      sure
      most
      teachers
      will
      literally
      tell
      you
      the
      answers
      right
      after
      the
      test
      and
      immediately
      give
      you
      the
      option
      to
      retake
      it.
      You'll
      be
      fine,

      You
      could
      use
      stone
      walls,

      you

      and

      I
      am
      vocal
      because
      they
      hurt
      my
      family,
      and
      they
      still
      do.
      My
      mother
      is
      in
      extreme
      financial
      trouble
      and
      feels
      so
      much
      shame
      because
      she
      cannot
      pay
      tithing.
      My
      sister
      refuses
      to
      speak
      with
      me
      because
      I'm
      trans.
      My
      aunts
      and
      uncles
      harass
      my
      mother
      to
      the
      point
      of
      tears
      because
      they
      believe
      that
      it
      was
      because
      of
      her
      failure
      as
      a
      mother
      that
      I
      became
      like
      this.
      My
      mother
      cried
      after
      conference
      because
      according
      to
      the
      church
      she
      believed
      in
      so
      fiercely
      told
      her
      that
      I
      would
      not
      be
      with
      her
      once
      we
      both
      die.
      Sure,
      the
      church
      hurt
      me
      but
      I'll
      never
      forgive
      them
      for
      hurting
      my
      family
      and
      convincing
      them
      that
      the
      abuse
      they
      are
      suffering
      is
      for
      their
      own

      I

      get
      clone

      never

      Yeah,
      a
      lot
      of
      servers
      are
      like
      that.
      I
      would
      recommend
      either
      joining
      a
      server
      with
      people
      you
      know,
      or
      make
      your
      own.
      People
      tend
      to
      be
      more
      hostile
      towards
      random
      people
      joining
      and
      asking
      what
      to
      do
      while
      a
      friend
      will
      gladly
      help
      you,
      or
      if
      you
      own
      the
      server
      they
      may
      be
      more
      inclined
      to
      help.
      Another
      suggestion
      would
      be
      to
      look
      at
      some
      guides
      to
      get
      a
      better
      understanding
      of
      the
      game.
      DST
      has
      a
      pretty
      steep
      learning
      curve,
      and
      it's
      no
      fun
      of
      some
      random
      dude
      joins,
      dies
      in
      a
      stupid
      way,
      and
      then
      is
      now
      a
      constant
      sanity
      drain
      for
      everyone
      else.
      It's
      pretty
      hard
      to
      help
      people
      online
      in
      DST
      as
      you
      have
      to
      stop
      doing
      whatever
      you
      are
      doing
      to
      type
      instructions.
      Two
      channels
      I
      would
      recommend
      watching
      to
      get
      better
      is
      The
      Beard
      777
      and
      Volx.
      Both
      have
      made
      some
      very
      good
      guides
      that
      have
      helped
      me
      become
      much
      better
      at
      the
      game.
      And
      if
      you
      have
      any
      specific
      questions
      on
      what
      to
      do,
      I
      would
      be
      happy
      to
      answer
      them.
      I
      hope
      you
      have
      a
      better
      experience
      next
      time
      you

      he's
      a
      bit
      silly,
      but
      he
      is
      genuinely
      a
      good
      player
      and
      has
      a
      comprehensive
      understanding
      of
      the
      game.
      He
      is
      probably
      the

      I
      mean,
      if
      you
      don't
      like
      him
      because
      he
      talks
      slow
      whatever,
      but
      I've
      actually
      seen
      him
      use
      his
      strategies
      and
      be
      good
      at
      the
      game?
      He
      isn't
      just
      taking
      other
      people's
      ideas,
      he
      uses
      them
      and
      is
      successful.
      Also,
      what
      do
      you
      mean
      about
      misinformation?
      I've
      tried
      almost
      every
      strategy
      he
      has
      detailed
      and
      they
      have

      Pretty
      good
      for
      a
      beginner!
      I
      see
      that
      you
      took
      advantage
      of
      the
      potato
      thing
      set
      piece,
      very
      smart.
      One
      suggestion
      would
      be
      to
      move
      those
      grass
      and
      twigs
      closer
      to
      your
      alchemy
      machine
      before
      summer
      comes.
      You'll
      need
      an
      ice
      fling-o-matic
      by
      then,
      and
      you'll
      want
      all
      your
      combustibles
      away
      from
      your
      fire,
      although
      that
      is
      not
      a
      huge
      necessity.
      You'll
      need
      an
      ice
      box
      soon,
      so
      you'll
      need
      some
      gears.
      If
      you
      can
      find
      some
      clockwork
      knights
      around
      they
      can
      be
      pretty
      easy
      to
      kill
      without
      taking
      much
      damage,
      there
      are
      a
      large
      number
      of
      video
      guides
      that
      explain
      how
      to
      dodge
      their
      attacks.
      Bishops
      and
      rooks
      are
      a
      bit
      harder
      to
      kite,
      so
      for
      a
      new
      player
      I'd
      recommend
      avoiding
      them
      for
      now.
      And
      if
      you
      don't
      feel
      that
      comfortable
      fighting
      clockworks
      you
      can
      just
      go
      grave
      digging
      for
      a
      bit
      and
      hope
      you
      get
      lucky.
      I'd
      also
      hammer
      down
      that
      science
      machine
      for
      more
      materials.
      All
      around,
      you're
      doing
      pretty
      well.
      :)

      I
      remember
      getting
      a
      lone
      island
      like
      that
      once.
      It
      was
      super
      small,
      like
      I
      could
      easily
      have
      the
      entire
      island
      in
      my
      screen
      at
      once.
      I
      decided
      to
      base
      there
      because
      it
      was
      cool,
      and
      it
      also
      messed
      with
      hound
      spawns
      so
      that
      was
      cool.
      It
      wasn't
      until
      some
      shadow
      hands
      spawned
      and
      I
      couldn't
      get
      rid
      of
      them
      that
      I
      realized
      my
      mistake,
      lol

      I
      mean,
      this
      franchise
      is
      definitely
      not
      one
      for
      realism,
      but
      the
      majority
      of
      the
      cowboys
      in
      the
      wild
      west
      were
      bisexual
      so
      that's
      interesting.
      And
      as
      for
      you
      saying
      it's
      dumb
      that
      a
      toy
      has
      a
      sexuality,
      Buzz
      literally
      has
      a
      relationship
      with
      Jesse
      in
      the
      third
      movie.
      So
      toys
      having
      romantic
      feelings
      is
      not
      something
      new
      to
      this
      universe,
      and
      you
      are
      kind
      of
      making
      a
      big
      deal

      Yeah.
      They
      were
      alone
      with
      men
      for
      long
      periods
      of
      time,
      and
      their
      typical
      excuse
      whenever
      confronted
      was
      that
      without
      women
      it
      was
      their
      only
      other
      option,
      but
      people
      didn't
      talk
      about
      it
      a
      lot
      because
      sex
      in
      general,
      regardless
      of
      the
      orientation,
      was
      not
      something
      frequently
      discussed
      by
      decent
      folk.
      Of
      course
      they
      didn't
      have
      terms
      like
      homo/heterosexual,
      but
      most
      cowboys
      frequently
      had
      sex
      with
      men
      and
      enjoyed
      it.
      If
      you'd

      read
      more

      it's
      my

      any
      form
      of
      sexual
      experimentation
      while
      you're
      a
      teenager
      is
      perfectly
      fine.
      Just
      don't
      be
      an
      idiot
      about
      it.
      Literally

      I
      left
      the
      church
      because
      it
      taught
      me
      to
      hate
      myself.
      I
      am
      a
      transgender
      woman,
      and
      I
      have
      known
      that
      I've
      wanted
      to
      be
      a
      woman
      ever
      since
      the
      third
      grade.
      Because
      of
      that
      I
      was
      kept
      awake
      every
      night
      terrified
      of
      the
      second
      coming,
      and
      that
      I
      would
      be
      killed
      in
      a
      horrific
      manner
      when
      it
      happened.
      I
      was
      even
      terrified
      of
      heaven;
      the
      idea
      of
      having
      to
      spend
      eternity
      as
      a
      man
      sounded
      terrible.
      It
      hurt
      my
      mom
      to.
      When
      she
      found
      out
      she
      kicked
      me
      out
      of
      my
      house
      for
      twenty
      four
      hours.
      I
      was
      sixteen
      by
      the
      way.
      When
      we
      talked
      she
      cried
      and
      cried
      because
      she
      believed
      that
      I
      was
      committing
      a
      sin
      equal
      to
      what
      your
      husband
      committed
      by
      just
      existing.
      And
      speaking
      of
      your
      husband,
      he
      is
      a
      terrible
      person
      and
      nothing
      will
      excuse
      that.
      He
      did
      not
      cheat
      on
      you
      because
      he
      left
      the
      church,
      he
      cheated
      on
      you
      because
      he
      is
      a
      bad
      person.
      There
      are
      millions
      of
      non
      religious
      people
      who
      have
      committed
      healthy
      relationships.
      A
      church
      does
      not
      make
      people
      faithful,
      they
      choose
      to
      be.
      And
      I'm
      am
      extremely
      sorry
      for
      what
      you
      went
      through.
      My
      mother
      went
      through
      something
      similar.
      But
      it
      was
      not
      my
      father's
      lack
      of
      faith
      that
      lead
      to
      him
      cheating
      on
      my
      mother,
      it
      was
      because
      he
      is
      an
      awful
      person

      I
      mean
      I'd
      watch
      it.
      It's
      really
      fun
      to
      watch
      that
      sort
      of
      stuff,
      and
      not
      a
      lot
      of
      people
      do
      it
      well
      so
      I'd
      like
      to
      see
      it.
      Really,
      the
      biggest
      thing
      for
      me
      is
      commentary.
      Make
      sure
      you
      have
      a
      good
      quality
      mic
      and
      practice
      how
      you
      will
      talk,
      not
      necessarily
      practicing
      lines
      but
      just
      get
      a
      feel
      for
      how
      you
      need
      to
      sound.
      Since
      we
      will
      just
      be
      watching
      CPUs
      fighting,
      the
      quality
      of
      the
      announcer
      is
      what
      makes
      or
      breaks
      it

      I
      get

      I
      actually
      have
      the
      opposite

      It's
      one
      of
      those
      things
      you
      just
      have

      Sure
      it
      is
      historic,
      but
      nothing
      will
      come
      of
      it.
      Because
      Trump
      is
      incompetent.
      This
      isn't
      a
      business
      deal,
      and
      he's
      not
      even
      that
      good
      at
      business.
      He
      is
      a
      terrible
      diplomat
      and
      a
      sub
      par
      businessman.
      I
      wish
      we
      had
      someone
      with
      more
      experience

      And
      I
      Agree,
      But
      I
      Also
      Agree
      With
      The
      Comments
      Saying
      That
      The
      Heart
      Is
      Meant
      To
      Be
      Difficult,
      And
      Some
      Boss
      Relics
      Would
      Be
      Greatly
      Overpowered.
      But
      I
      Have
      An
      Interesting
      Solution
      That
      Would
      Still
      Have
      The
      Heart
      Be
      Challenging,
      But
      Still
      Give
      The
      Player
      A
      Bit
      Of
      A
      Reward
      For
      Making
      It
      That
      Far
      To
      Begin
      With
      After
      The
      Act
      3
      Boss,
      And
      After
      The
      Heart
      Moves
      Out
      Of
      Your
      Way,
      You
      Get
      A
      Relic
      Chest.
      This
      Chest
      Will
      Only
      Contain
      A
      Single,
      Unique
      Relic
      That
      Will
      Change
      Depending
      On
      Your
      Character.
      The
      Relic
      Will
      Be
      The
      Head
      Of
      Your
      Character.
      For
      Example,
      If
      You
      Are
      Playing
      The
      Ironclad
      You
      Will
      Receive
      The
      Head
      of
      the
      Ironclad.
      This
      Makes
      Sense
      Within
      The
      Story
      Of
      The
      Game,
      And
      Is
      Also
      Fitting
      Because
      You've
      Probably
      Died
      Hundreds
      Of
      Times
      To
      Get
      To
      This
      Point.
      These
      Relics
      Will
      Be
      Optional,
      And
      Have
      Both
      Very
      Powerful
      Uses,
      But
      Very
      Detrimental
      Drawbacks,
      And
      Each
      Will
      Be
      Inspired
      By
      The
      ____-Form
      Cards
      Held
      By
      Each
      Character.
      Here
      Are
      My
      Ideas
      For
      The
      Heads
      Head
      of
      the
      Ironclad
      -
      Whenever
      You
      Gain
      Strength,
      Gain
      Double
      That
      Amount.
      You
      Take
      Double
      Damage.
      Head
      of
      the
      Silent
      -
      If
      You
      Don't
      Play
      Any
      Attacks
      On
      Your
      Turn,
      Gain
      1
      Intangible.
      Apply
      3
      Poison
      To
      Yourself
      At
      The
      End
      Of
      Each
      Turn.
      Head
      of
      the
      Defect
      -
      During
      The
      First
      Turn
      Of
      Combat,
      Every
      Card
      Played
      Is
      Played
      Twice.
      When
      You
      End
      Your
      First
      Turn,
      Shuffle
      Five
      Voids
      Into
      Your
      Deck.
      Anyway,
      I
      Was
      Just
      Brainstorming.
      It'd
      Make
      For
      A
      Good
      Mod
      At
      Least

      I
      have
      always
      been
      terrified
      about
      putting
      myself
      out
      there
      in
      the
      lesbian
      community
      because
      I
      am
      still
      very
      early
      in
      my
      transition
      process.
      I
      know
      TERFs
      are
      nowhere
      near
      the
      majority
      of
      the
      community,
      but
      my
      anxiety
      is
      still
      a
      problem
      and
      I
      mostly
      just
      don't
      want
      to
      make
      anyone
      uncomfortable.
      Do
      you
      think
      I
      should
      just
      wait
      until
      I'm
      further
      along
      in
      my
      transition?
      Or
      do
      you
      have
      suggestions
      for
      lessening
      my
      anxiety
      over
      it
      all?

      All
      true,
      I
      forgot
      about
      Riju.
      Though
      she
      could
      have
      been
      bi
      and
      had
      a
      male
      lover
      at
      some
      point,
      maybe
      after
      it
      was
      clear
      that
      the
      queen
      loved
      Roam
      and
      not
      her.
      I
      suppose
      there
      isn't
      a
      lot
      of
      evidence
      in
      either
      direction.
      However,
      there
      are
      female
      Gorons,
      despite
      how
      amazing
      an
      image
      of
      all
      the
      Gorons
      being
      gay
      is.
      You
      meet
      them
      in
      Gerudo
      town
      I
      believe,
      and
      the
      Goron
      representative
      of
      tourism
      is
      a
      woman
      if
      I'm
      remembering
      right

      I

      she

      my

      hates

      It
      seemed
      so
      obvious.
      But

      Actually
      American
      figures
      are
      quite
      a
      bit
      different
      than
      UK
      ones!
      There
      have
      been
      several
      studies
      into
      the
      percentage
      of
      police
      officers
      who
      have
      been
      been
      charged
      with
      domestic
      violence,
      and
      they
      have
      shown
      that
      a
      family
      with
      at
      least
      one
      member
      in
      law
      enforcement
      has
      anywhere
      between
      a
      40-24%
      chance
      of
      experiencing
      domestic
      violence
      as
      opposed
      to
      the
      10%
      of
      the
      general
      population.
      In
      short,
      this
      flag
      is
      a
      little
      bit
      over
      exaggerated,
      but
      not
      by
      that
      much!

      Hero's
      down
      b
      is
      near
      useless.
      The
      reason
      a
      good
      chunk
      of
      the
      abilities
      it
      can
      use
      are
      so
      strong
      is
      because
      it
      is
      extremely
      difficult
      to
      find
      a
      time
      to
      use
      them.
      Hocus
      Pocus
      will
      never
      be
      used
      in
      competitive
      play
      because
      it
      has
      a
      chance
      to
      just
      kill
      you.
      Zoom
      is
      super
      useful,
      but
      will
      never
      be
      used
      to
      recover
      because
      why
      would
      you
      risk
      pulling
      a
      down
      b
      when
      your
      recovery
      is
      already
      pretty
      good?
      Kaklang
      is
      useful,
      but
      when
      will
      you
      ever
      use
      it?
      You
      can't
      just
      down
      b
      in
      someone's
      face
      because
      what
      if
      it's
      not
      there?
      Same
      for
      Kamikaze,
      Whack,
      Thwack,
      Kakrackle
      Slash,
      etc.
      They
      all
      require
      you
      to
      be
      near
      the
      opponent,
      and
      you
      can't
      just
      down
      b
      in
      an
      opponents
      face.
      Magic
      burst
      is
      a
      good
      edge
      guard
      option,
      but
      it
      is
      not
      a
      guarantee
      to
      even
      be
      pulled
      and
      if
      they
      miss
      or
      you
      get
      off
      halo
      quickly
      you
      can
      punish
      them
      while
      they
      are
      low
      on
      mp.
      The
      only
      good
      options
      are
      the
      "buffs"
      which
      are
      all
      reused
      abilities
      from
      other
      characters.
      Also
      bounce
      which
      I
      will
      admit
      might
      need
      to
      be
      nerfed
      a
      bit,
      but
      that
      is
      it.
      As
      for
      the
      crits,
      I
      see
      those
      as
      fine.
      It's
      just
      a
      slightly
      weaker
      Luigi
      misfire.
      Combine
      all
      of
      this
      with
      the
      fact
      that
      whenever
      you
      use
      down
      b
      all
      of
      the
      skills
      are
      in
      a
      random
      order,
      making
      muscle
      memory
      impossible,
      and
      that
      makes
      for
      a
      weak
      character
      a
      mid
      to
      high
      level.
      The
      reason
      hero
      is
      dominating
      right
      now
      is
      due
      to
      both
      match-up
      inexperience
      and
      poor
      play

      Yeah,
      whenever
      you
      get
      a
      crit
      your
      hero
      gets

      for

      too
      much,
      but
      crits
      from

      also
      activate

      A
      couple
      suggestions
      If
      you
      spared
      a
      single
      monster
      the
      run
      is
      dead
      and
      you
      have
      to
      reset
      A
      suggestion
      is
      to
      find
      a
      corner
      and
      hold
      down
      all
      the
      arrow
      keys
      to
      up
      your
      steps
      per
      second.
      In
      the
      end,
      however,
      DO
      NOT
      FIGHT
      TORIEL
      UNTIL
      YOU
      GET
      THE
      CREEPY
      MUSIC.
      Doing
      so
      nullifies
      the
      the
      run,
      even
      if
      you
      kill
      her.
      This
      goes
      for
      all
      bosses(Papyrus,
      Undyne,
      Mettaton,
      etc.)

      The
      biggest
      downside
      with
      anger
      is
      that
      it
      adds
      another
      copy
      of
      itself
      into
      your
      deck
      each
      time
      you
      play
      it.
      If
      it
      didn't
      have
      that
      ability
      it
      would
      be
      an
      amazing
      card.
      But
      for
      longer
      fights
      where
      it
      is
      played
      often
      it
      will
      eventually
      clog
      up
      your
      deck
      and
      you
      could
      get
      a
      hand
      of
      nothing
      but
      anger
      leading
      to
      your
      death.
      Like
      most
      cards
      in
      the
      game,
      it
      definitely
      can
      be
      useful,
      especially
      in
      exhaust
      heavy
      decks.
      However
      it
      is
      very
      inconsistent
      and
      risky

      Wormwood
      and
      Warly
      are

      play
      whoever
      you
      want.

      First
      things
      first,
      you
      are
      going
      to
      need
      four
      separate
      Legend
      level
      Vestals.
      In
      my
      experience
      they
      are
      the
      only
      healers
      with
      the
      consistency
      needed
      to
      handle
      the
      dungeon,
      and
      in
      case
      you
      didn't
      already
      know,
      any
      hero
      who
      survives
      a
      trip
      to
      the
      Darkest
      Dungeon
      will
      refuse
      to
      go
      back,
      or
      you
      might
      be
      able
      to
      force
      them
      to
      go
      back
      at
      the
      cost
      of
      a
      heavy
      stress
      penalty
      depending
      on
      your
      difficulty
      setting.
      You
      will
      also
      always
      need
      a
      stress
      healer
      of
      any
      kind
      for
      each
      mission,
      a
      jester
      being
      preferred
      though
      the
      Houndmaster
      may
      be
      better
      for
      the
      third
      mission
      because
      that
      one
      is
      filled
      with
      beast
      enemies.
      Also,
      you
      should
      at
      least
      look
      up
      the
      maps
      of
      the
      dungeon
      before
      going
      in.
      No
      spoilers
      is
      cool,
      but
      without
      a
      map
      you'll
      wander
      into
      a
      lot
      of
      unnecessary
      fights
      and
      just
      die.
      Plague
      doctors
      are
      also
      super
      good
      because
      a
      lot
      of
      enemies
      in
      these
      dungeons
      deal
      heavy
      blight
      and
      bleed.
      The
      doctor
      can
      cure
      that
      easily.
      Also,
      a
      Hellion
      is
      nearly
      required
      for
      the
      third
      dungeon.
      No
      spoilers,
      but
      there
      is
      a
      lot
      of
      battles
      that
      need
      you
      to
      hit
      the
      fourth
      slot
      so
      iron
      swan
      is
      perfect.
      A
      few
      other
      notes,
      you
      never
      need
      shovels
      or
      keys
      in
      the
      dungeons
      so
      just
      save
      your
      money
      and
      not
      bother.
      Buy
      as
      much
      food
      as
      you
      can
      hold
      and
      use
      it
      liberally
      for
      healing.
      If
      you
      have
      The
      Color
      of
      Madness
      dlc
      I
      recommend
      grinding
      out
      the
      Mill
      district
      so
      you
      don't
      have
      to
      mess
      with
      hunger
      checks,
      but
      it's
      not
      too
      important.
      Don't
      bring
      anti
      venom
      on
      the
      first
      mission
      because
      no
      monsters
      there
      do
      blight,
      but
      pack
      all
      the
      bandages
      you
      can.
      Every
      mission
      following
      pack
      up
      with
      both
      bandages
      and
      anti
      venom.

      In
      my
      opinion,
      the
      best
      districts
      are
      the
      Outcasts
      bonfire
      and
      the
      one
      that
      affects
      the
      Vestal/Crusader
      stun
      chance.
      They
      are
      helpful,
      but
      not
      super
      important.
      As
      for
      prot,
      most
      of
      the
      monsters
      are
      pretty
      average
      in
      that
      regard.
      The
      exception
      is
      the
      third
      mission,
      which
      has
      monsters
      with
      crazy
      high
      prot.
      Shield
      breakers
      would
      be
      amazing
      for
      that,
      and
      being
      able
      to
      hit
      every
      rank
      really
      good.
      Especially
      since
      a
      few
      enemies
      in
      the
      second
      mission
      and
      onwards
      are
      pretty
      good
      at
      shuffling
      your
      party
      around.
      Oh
      I
      almost
      forgot,
      after
      the
      second
      mission
      you
      no
      longer
      need
      the
      Talisman
      of
      the
      Flame
      trinket
      so
      don't
      waste
      a
      trinket
      slot
      on
      it
      after
      that's
      done

      The
      blood
      curse
      isn't
      too
      bad,
      just
      another
      thing
      to
      juggle.
      It
      does
      slow
      you
      down
      a
      lot
      though.
      After
      a
      couple
      weeks
      all
      of
      your
      stress
      relief
      activities
      are
      weakened
      until
      you
      do
      a
      quest
      in
      the
      courtyard.
      The
      quest
      itself
      is
      fairly
      difficult,
      but
      not
      to
      hard
      if
      you
      know
      what
      to
      look
      out
      for.
      The
      real
      difficulty
      comes
      from
      after
      that
      where
      as
      time
      goes
      on
      monsters
      from
      the
      courtyard
      will
      start
      to
      spread
      into
      the
      other
      regions.
      This
      can
      cause
      the
      curse
      to
      spread
      through
      your
      whole
      roster.
      The
      only
      way
      to
      cure
      it
      is
      to
      fight
      a
      trio
      of
      extremely
      powerful
      bosses,
      the
      first
      of
      which
      is
      easily
      harder
      than
      any
      boss
      in
      the
      base
      game
      outside
      of
      the
      Darkest
      Dungeon
      stuff.
      In
      my
      opinion
      it
      is
      my
      favorite
      of
      the
      two
      DLCs.
      I
      just
      like
      hard
      boss
      fights.
      I'd
      say
      the
      main
      difference
      between
      the
      two
      is
      urgency.
      You
      are
      never
      forced
      to
      do
      anything
      for
      TCoM,
      and
      can
      procrastinate
      as
      long
      as
      you
      like.
      With
      CC
      you
      have
      to
      be
      on
      top
      of
      it
      or
      it
      will
      overwhelm
      you

      The
      end
      goal
      to
      "Win"
      is
      to
      clear
      four
      quests
      in
      the
      Darkest
      Dungeon.
      The
      problem
      is
      that
      the
      Dungeon
      is
      one
      of
      the
      most
      hostile
      and
      dangerous
      places
      in
      the
      game
      so
      lower
      level
      heroes
      have
      no
      chance
      of
      surviving.
      So
      to
      progress
      you
      need
      to
      slowly
      do
      lower
      level
      quests
      to
      raise
      the
      level
      of
      your
      roster
      until
      you
      have
      a
      good
      collection
      of
      level
      6
      heroes
      and
      use
      them
      to
      clear
      the
      final
      Dungeons.
      Along
      the
      way
      you'll
      encounter
      bosses
      from
      each
      of
      the
      other
      regions.
      You
      don't
      need
      to
      kill
      these,
      but
      it
      is
      usually
      worth
      it
      for
      the
      money
      and
      trinkets.

      I
      personally
      never
      use
      the
      Occultist
      as
      a
      main
      healer.
      Usually
      I
      have
      him
      either
      stun
      or
      pull

      in

      I'll

      It
      is
      a
      pretty
      harsh
      learning
      curve,
      abs
      usually
      the
      solution
      is
      to
      keep
      trying
      and
      learning.
      The
      biggest
      things
      I
      learned
      were
      these:
      Almost
      always
      remove/transform
      strikes
      and
      defends.
      Almost
      any
      card
      is
      better
      than
      a
      strike
      or
      defend
      And
      consider
      buying
      potions.
      If
      you
      know
      you're
      going
      to
      fight
      Hexaghost,
      consider
      buying
      a
      thorns
      potion.
      Is
      there
      a
      hallway
      fight
      in
      this
      act
      that
      you
      don't
      think
      you
      can
      beat
      with
      your
      current
      deck?
      Buy
      a
      smoke
      bomb
      in
      case
      you
      run
      into
      it.
      Finally,
      take
      the
      act
      you're
      in
      to
      prepare
      for
      the
      coming
      boss.
      Say
      you
      get
      to
      act
      three
      with
      a
      shiv
      deck
      and
      you
      suddenly
      see
      Time
      Eater.
      Now
      you
      have
      an
      entire
      act
      to
      do
      your
      best
      to
      adjust
      your
      deck
      to
      deal
      with
      it.
      Good
      luck!
      Keep
      climbing!

      Big
      brain
      theory:
      The
      entirety
      of
      Petscop
      was
      just
      an
      elaborate
      marketing
      campaign
      for
      the
      Grave
      Robber

      It
      would
      be
      interesting
      if
      we
      saw
      Petscop
      spilt
      up
      into
      multiple
      parts.
      Maybe
      the
      next
      part
      will
      be
      hosted
      on
      a
      different
      channel
      and
      told
      from
      a
      new
      character's
      point
      of
      view.
      I
      agree
      that
      Petscop
      isn't
      over,
      but
      I
      hadn't
      considered
      it
      being
      done
      with
      one
      side
      of
      the
      story
      and
      moving

      Honestly

      The
      way
      I
      see
      it
      is
      that
      Rose
      was
      a
      selfish
      child
      when
      she
      was
      Pink
      Diamond.
      She
      didn't
      see
      other
      gems
      or
      living
      beings
      as
      worth
      her
      time.
      She
      cared
      only
      for
      herself
      After
      coming
      to
      earth
      with
      Pearl
      she
      got
      a
      bit
      better,
      recognizing
      how
      unfair
      it
      was
      that
      the
      life
      on
      Earth
      would
      all
      die,
      but
      she
      still
      viewed
      that
      life
      as
      lesser.
      Like
      how
      a
      human
      looks
      at
      a
      dog.
      Then
      after
      meeting
      Greg,
      specifically
      after
      he
      attempted
      to
      fuse
      with
      her,
      she
      began
      to
      see
      human
      beings
      as
      actual
      people
      who
      deserve
      respect.
      It
      is
      this
      version
      of
      Rose
      that
      decided
      the
      world
      would
      be
      better
      off
      with
      her
      son
      than
      herself.
      So
      the
      answer
      is
      complicated

      One
      reason
      it's
      so
      good
      is
      both
      the
      two
      cards
      with
      the
      randomizer.
      Every
      card
      you
      draw
      has
      a
      chance
      to
      be

      and
      now
      you

      draw
      more
      cards.

      Snecko
      isn't

      its
      own,

      entire

      it.

      three
      most
      important
      things

      Snecko
      decks
      are
      card
      draw,
      discard,
      and
      energy
      gain.
      In
      the
      deck
      above,
      I
      have
      two
      powers

      stance.
      Since
      the
      two
      base
      stance
      changing
      cards
      are
      both
      two
      cost
      I
      have
      a
      higher
      chance
      of
      them
      being
      cheaper
      anyway,
      and
      whenever
      I
      exit
      calm
      I
      get
      more
      energy
      to
      play
      more
      cards
      that
      mess
      with
      my
      stance.
      Also
      I
      think
      someone
      did
      the
      math
      somewhere
      and
      Snecko
      is
      still
      worth
      taking
      in
      a
      deck
      with
      nothing
      but
      one
      and
      zero
      cost
      cards
      because
      of
      the
      card
      draw.
      Like,
      you
      will
      still
      end
      up
      playing
      more
      cards
      per
      turn
      on
      average.
      Anyway,
      Snecko
      is
      very
      powerful
      but
      it
      takes
      a
      lot
      of
      planning
      and
      getting
      used
      to,
      and
      sometimes
      you'll
      just
      have
      a
      horrible
      turn.
      I
      had
      a
      couple
      of
      those
      in
      this
      run,
      but
      that
      was
      followed
      up
      by
      a
      great
      turn
      next
      time
      to
      recover.
      Yes
      it's
      RNG,
      but
      it's
      RNG
      you
      can
      manipulate
      and
      exploit

      every

      that

      should
      be
      made
      for
      Deva
      form.
      Maybe
      a
      buff
      that
      changes
      how
      your
      stances
      work?
      Like,
      after
      this

      is
      played
      you
      take

      temporary
      strength
      for
      each
      attack
      you

      That

      More
      bosses/elites.
      Before
      the
      Watcher
      was
      implemented,
      each
      of
      the
      three
      possible
      bosses/elites
      per
      floor
      connected
      to
      the
      three
      base
      characters.
      For
      example,
      Gremlin
      Nob
      relating
      to
      the
      Ironclad
      due
      to
      strength
      gain,
      the
      Sentries
      to
      the
      Defect
      due
      to
      being
      robots,
      and
      Lagavulin
      relating
      to
      Silent
      due
      to
      weakening
      opponents,
      I
      guess?
      (Admittedly
      that's
      the
      weakest
      connection)
      Anyway,
      with
      a
      new
      character
      that
      should
      mean
      new
      elites
      and
      bosses
      for
      each
      floor
      to
      match
      the
      Watcher.
      I
      really
      hope
      this
      is
      the
      case
      because
      seeing
      new
      enemies
      is
      so
      fun.
      That
      aside,
      one
      thing
      I
      want
      more
      than
      anything
      is
      a
      sort
      of
      bestiary
      for
      all
      the
      enemies
      in
      the
      game.
      It
      could
      have
      their
      names,
      health
      values,
      and
      maybe
      even
      their
      attack
      patterns.
      It
      could
      also
      show
      how
      many
      of
      them
      you've
      killed,
      and
      how
      many
      times
      they've
      killed
      you.
      But
      what
      I
      would
      want
      more
      than
      anything
      in
      this
      bestiary
      is
      a
      bit
      of
      flavor
      text
      for
      each
      enemy,
      like
      what
      they
      have
      on
      the
      relics.
      I
      always
      loved
      reading
      the
      flavor
      text
      on
      new
      relics,
      and
      this
      could
      add
      so
      many
      fun
      tidbits
      about
      recurring
      enemies
      and
      bosses.
      Anyway,
      this
      is
      just
      a
      fun
      thought
      I
      had

      amazing
      and
      I
      agree
      that
      it
      would
      be
      a
      good
      solution
      once
      the
      amount
      of
      characters
      starts
      to
      increase
      the
      potential
      elites
      to
      stupid
      numbers,
      though
      I
      feel
      bumping
      that
      number
      up
      to
      four
      wouldn't
      put
      us
      in
      that
      situation
      yet.
      I
      mostly
      stuck
      with
      a
      smaller
      suggestion
      because
      it
      seemed
      more
      realistic,
      but
      alternate
      acts
      would
      be
      a
      dream
      come
      true.
      Variety
      is
      what
      I
      love
      about
      this
      game

      Yeah,
      I
      agree
      that
      if
      new
      elites
      are
      added
      with
      each
      character
      it
      could
      get
      a
      bit
      crazy
      and
      hard
      to
      deal
      with.
      I
      don't
      think
      four
      would
      push
      us
      to
      that
      point,
      but
      I
      could
      see
      us
      getting
      there.
      And
      I
      think
      that
      could
      be
      a
      great
      solution
      once
      it
      gets
      a
      bit
      overwhelming,
      maybe
      around
      five
      or
      six
      characters,
      if
      there
      ever
      are
      that
      many.

      Oof
      yeah.
      I
      don't
      think
      bumping
      it
      to
      four
      bosses
      would
      make
      it
      horrible,
      but
      I
      can
      see
      it
      getting
      to
      that
      point
      if
      a
      new
      boss
      was
      added
      with
      each
      character.
      I'm
      assuming
      you
      can't
      see
      who
      the
      second
      boss
      is,
      so
      maybe
      they
      could
      change
      it
      so
      you
      can?

      Yeah,
      so
      if
      you
      could
      see
      the

      boss
      that

      I

      it

      While
      people
      in
      these
      comments
      are
      saying
      this
      isn't
      a
      boomer
      meme
      because
      it
      is
      liberal,
      that
      is
      completely
      wrong.
      Boomer
      memes
      are
      defined
      by
      their
      style
      and
      this
      fits
      the
      bill.
      The
      font
      and
      text
      color,
      the
      only
      kind
      of
      funny
      joke,
      the
      use
      of
      generic
      pictures
      likely
      found
      after
      a
      quick
      search
      on
      Google,
      it's
      exactly
      what
      a
      boomer
      meme
      is.
      I
      can
      see
      my
      hard
      core
      liberal
      mother
      laughing

      Again
      people
      on
      this
      sub
      think
      this
      isn't
      boomer
      humor!
      I'll
      say
      it
      a
      million
      times,
      boomer
      humor
      is
      not
      exclusive
      to
      any
      particular
      political
      party
      it's
      just
      the
      sense
      of
      humor
      of
      a
      generation.
      My
      hard
      core
      liberal
      mother
      would
      definitely
      share
      this
      all
      across
      her
      Facebook,

      As
      I #8217;m
      sure
      most
      of
      you
      are,
      I
      am
      extremely
      excited
      for
      the
      announcement
      of
      the
      next
      new
      character
      to
      join
      DST.
      The
      refreshes
      are
      always
      a
      welcome
      change,
      but
      new
      characters
      always
      mean
      so
      much
      more
      for
      the
      ever
      evolving
      meta.
      Wortox
      was
      a
      huge
      change,
      and
      while
      Wormwood
      was
      a
      familiar
      face
      he
      definitely
      brought
      a
      lot
      of
      interesting
      strategies
      with
      him.
      And
      now
      with
      the
      hype
      around
      the
      Woodie
      rework
      dying
      down,
      I #8217;ve
      started
      to
      turn
      my
      eyes
      towards
      what
      the
      next
      possible
      character
      could
      be.
      But
      before
      I
      get
      into
      my
      ideas
      and
      predictions,
      a
      little
      history.
      For
      those
      of
      you
      who
      did
      not
      know
      already,
      the
      first
      DLC
      character
      Wortox
      was
      actually
      in
      the
      base
      game
      of
      Don #8217;t
      Starve
      as
      an
      unfinished
      character.
      There
      were
      a
      number
      of
      unfinished
      characters
      left
      in
      the
      code
      of
      the
      base
      game,
      but
      Wortox
      stood
      out
      as
      he
      was
      in
      a
      state
      of
      surprising
      completion;
      having
      most
      of
      his
      sprites
      completed,
      his
      voice
      recorded,
      and
      even
      a
      few
      unique
      quotes
      written.
      He
      was
      cut
      from
      the
      game
      for
      unknown
      reasons,
      though
      I #8217;ll
      share
      my
      own
      theories
      on
      why
      he
      was
      cut
      later.
      Either
      way,
      he
      found
      his
      way
      into
      DST
      years
      later.
      This
      has
      lead
      a
      lot
      of
      people
      to
      look
      at
      other
      character
      that
      had
      been
      cut
      from
      the
      base
      game
      as
      possible
      future
      DLC
      options.
      Out
      of
      the
      handful
      of
      cut
      characters
      from
      the
      base
      game,
      there
      are
      only
      two
      that
      had
      the
      same
      level
      of
      completion
      Wortox
      had.
      The
      first
      being
      the
      Pyro
      character
      from
      TF2,
      a
      character
      which
      I #8217;m
      going
      to
      say
      is
      unlikely
      to
      be
      the
      next
      DLC
      character.
      It #8217;d
      be
      pretty
      funny
      if
      they
      were,
      but
      I #8217;m
      not
      betting
      on
      it.
      The
      last
      character
      who
      was
      nearly
      completed
      by
      inevitably
      cut,
      and
      the
      one
      I
      believe
      will
      be
      one
      of
      the
      next
      two
      DLC
      characters,
      was
      Wilton.
      Wilton
      was
      a
      skeleton
      character
      that
      used
      the
      same
      model
      as
      the
      failed
      survivors
      you
      find
      littered
      about
      the
      Constant.
      Like
      Wortox,
      he
      was
      fully
      modeled,
      had
      his
      voice
      sounds
      recorded,
      and
      even
      had
      a
      few
      unique
      quotes
      already
      written.
      And
      yet
      he
      was
      cut.
      Why?
      I
      believe
      Wilton
      was
      cut
      for
      the
      same
      reason
      as
      Wortox,
      he
      did
      not
      fit
      the
      theme
      of
      Don #8217;t
      Starve
      at
      the
      time.
      I
      believe
      Wortox
      was
      originally
      going
      to
      fill
      the
      role
      of
      Webber
      in
      the
      base
      game,
      a
      monster
      that
      is
      hated
      by
      pigs
      but
      gains
      unique
      benefits.
      However
      without
      a
      group
      of
      monsters
      to
      call
      his
      own,
      he
      likely
      was
      put
      aside
      in
      favor
      of
      the
      little
      spider
      boy.
      I
      believe
      Wilton,
      on
      the
      other
      hand,
      was
      going
      to
      fill
      the
      role
      of
      joke
      character
      that
      Wes
      would
      come
      to
      fill
      later.
      I
      believe
      that
      Wilton
      was
      eventually
      scrapped
      because
      he
      did
      not
      fit
      in
      well
      with
      the
      rest
      of
      the
      cast.
      Keep
      in
      mind
      that
      at
      the
      time
      the
      base
      game
      was
      released,
      and
      even
      into
      Reign
      of
      Giants,
      every
      single
      character
      lived
      in
      the
      real
      world
      and
      made
      their
      way
      to
      the
      Constant
      one
      way
      or
      another.
      It
      wasn #8217;t
      until
      Wilbur
      in
      Shipwrecked
      that
      we
      had
      a
      character
      who
      originated
      from
      the
      Constant,
      followed
      soon
      after
      by
      Wilba,
      Wormwood,
      and
      Wortox.
      So
      if
      Wilton
      was
      meant
      to
      be
      released
      alongside
      the
      main
      cast
      in
      place
      of
      Wes,
      it
      makes
      sense
      that
      Klei
      realized
      that
      a
      living
      skeleton
      would
      not
      fit
      well
      within
      the
      world
      they
      had
      created.
      Afterall,
      at
      that
      point
      in
      the
      series
      life
      there
      had
      been
      no
      signs
      of
      living
      skeletons.
      However,
      now
      that
      we
      are
      in
      DST,
      things
      are
      extremely
      different.
      Not
      only
      do
      we
      now
      have
      two
      characters
      who
      originated
      from
      the
      Constant,
      we
      also
      have
      a
      very
      important
      example
      of
      a
      reanimated
      skeleton,
      being
      the
      Ancient
      Fuelweaver.
      My
      concept
      for
      Wilton
      will
      revolve
      around
      making
      him
      closely
      related
      to
      the
      Ancient
      Fuelweaver
      itself.
      Firstly,
      I #8217;ll
      discuss
      what
      I
      think
      would
      be
      the
      intro
      animation
      for
      Wilton.
      Currently
      in
      terms
      of
      the
      story
      we
      are
      in
      a
      bit
      of
      a
      weird
      place
      with
      our
      characters.
      We
      saw
      them
      defeat
      the
      Fuelweaver
      and
      gain
      access
      to
      the
      ancient
      gateway,
      we
      saw
      them
      fight
      through
      the
      Forge
      and
      Gorge,
      and
      now
      they
      are
      suddenly
      back
      on
      the
      mainland
      again
      dealing
      with
      the
      new
      Lunar
      Island.
      Now
      it
      is
      possible
      that
      I
      missed
      something,
      but
      this
      just
      seems
      like
      a
      retcon
      of
      sorts.
      So
      with
      my
      idea
      I
      am
      going
      to
      make
      the
      assumption
      that
      they
      were
      planning
      on
      taking
      on
      the
      Fuelweaver,
      and
      then
      were
      distracted
      by
      a
      large
      chunk
      of
      the
      moon
      falling
      into
      the
      ocean.
      So
      the
      scene
      would
      start
      with
      Maxwell,
      Wilson,
      and
      Wickerbottom
      examining
      the
      Shadow
      Atrium,
      having
      it
      placed
      on
      top
      of
      an
      End
      Table.
      I #8217;m
      imagining
      that
      they
      are
      talking
      about
      what
      to
      do
      with
      the
      thing.
      As
      their
      conversation
      continues,
      their
      attention
      is
      drawn
      to
      the
      shore
      line
      and
      away
      from
      the
      Shadow
      Atrium.
      While
      they
      are
      distracted,
      Willow
      will
      approach
      the
      End
      Table
      and
      curiously
      pick
      up
      the
      shadow
      heart.
      She #8217;d
      walk
      over
      with
      it
      towards
      Wendy,
      showing
      it
      to
      her.
      Wendy
      would
      take
      it
      and
      look
      it
      over,
      and
      then
      draw
      a
      little
      heart
      in
      the
      air
      to
      show
      that
      she
      believes
      it
      is
      supposed
      to
      be
      a
      heart
      of
      some
      kind.
      Willow
      would
      look
      around,
      and
      notice
      a
      failed
      survivor
      lying
      nearby.
      She
      would
      point
      to
      it
      excitedly,
      and
      both
      she
      and
      Wendy
      would
      walk
      over
      towards
      it.
      As
      Willow
      leans
      down
      to
      place
      the
      Atrium
      in
      the
      chest
      cavity
      of
      the
      skeleton,
      Maxwell
      will
      finally
      notice
      what
      they
      are
      doing,
      and
      call
      out
      for
      them
      to
      stop.
      He
      will
      be
      too
      late
      as
      Willow
      places
      the
      Atrium
      in
      the
      chest
      cavity.
      What
      follows
      would
      be
      a
      similar
      animation
      to
      what
      the
      Fuelweaver
      does
      when
      it
      is
      summoned
      before
      rising
      to
      his
      feet
      as
      Wilton.
      I #8217;d
      also
      update
      his
      sprite
      in
      general
      so
      it
      isn #8217;t
      just
      a
      reused
      asset
      of
      the
      failed
      survivor,
      but
      there
      would
      be
      nightmare
      fuel
      particles
      in
      between
      the
      bones,
      much
      like
      the
      Ancient
      Fuelweaver.
      With
      the
      concept
      and
      the
      cinematic
      out
      of
      the
      way,
      now
      I #8217;ll
      go
      over
      his
      traits.
      Here
      is
      how
      they
      will
      be
      listed
      on
      his
      character.
      Has
      a
      burning
      hunger
      Is
      connected
      to
      unseen
      forces
      Is
      brittle
      Now
      for
      what
      may
      seem
      to
      be
      the
      craziest
      part
      of
      this
      character;
      his
      stats.
      His
      hunger
      rests
      at
      an
      insane
      400
      points.
      His
      health
      sits
      at
      a
      ridiculously
      small
      5
      points.
      And
      his
      sanity
      is
      hard
      capped
      at
      0
      points.
      I
      supposed
      I
      should
      explain
      why
      I
      chose
      this,
      and
      I #8217;ll
      start
      with
      the
      least
      ridiculous
      of
      the
      three;
      the
      hunger.
      With
      400
      hunger,
      Wilton
      has
      the
      highest
      hunger
      stat
      in
      the
      game.
      However,
      his
      hunger
      drain
      significantly
      faster,
      at
      around
      100
      points
      per
      day.
      This
      means
      that
      he
      can
      still
      go
      the
      longest
      without
      eating
      out
      of
      the
      whole
      roster,
      being
      able
      to
      go
      4
      whole
      days
      before
      his
      hunger
      hits
      zero.
      In
      addition
      to
      this,
      Wilton
      does
      not
      eat
      like
      a
      normal
      character.
      Much
      like
      Wortox,
      any
      food
      Wilton
      eats
      only
      fills
      him
      for
      half
      of
      its
      original
      value,
      and
      given
      his
      increased
      hunger
      drain
      this
      means
      he
      must
      turn
      towards
      other
      sources
      of
      food.
      And
      by
      far
      the
      best
      source
      of
      this
      food
      would
      be
      Nightmare
      Fuel.
      A
      single
      piece
      of
      Nightmare
      Fuel
      would
      be
      the
      equivalent
      of
      a
      normal
      character
      eating
      meatballs.
      Very
      efficient,
      even
      more
      so
      for
      reasons
      I #8217;ll
      get
      into
      later.
      In
      addition
      to
      filling
      him
      quite
      well,
      a
      single
      piece
      of
      Nightmare
      fuel
      will
      heal
      him
      for
      one
      point
      of
      health
      each
      time,
      and
      no
      other
      food
      is
      capable
      of
      healing
      him.
      We #8217;ll
      get
      more
      into
      the
      health
      side
      of
      things
      later.
      He
      can
      actually
      eat
      a
      lot
      of
      things.
      Living
      logs
      would
      be
      the
      equivalent
      of
      cooked
      meat,
      dark
      petals
      would
      be
      equal
      to
      butterfly
      wings,
      and
      anything
      that
      can
      be
      used
      to
      light
      a
      fire
      (logs,
      grass,
      twigs,
      boards,
      etc.)
      can
      be
      used
      with
      varying
      effectiveness.
      My
      idea
      is
      that
      his
      stomach
      functions
      a
      bit
      like
      the
      night
      light
      structure.
      It
      is
      a
      magical
      fire
      that
      must
      be
      kept
      burning.
      All
      this
      aside
      though,
      Nightmare
      Fuel
      will
      be
      your
      standard
      food.
      To
      help
      with
      this,
      Wilton
      will
      start
      with
      4
      nightmare
      fuel
      in
      his
      inventory,
      similar
      to
      how
      Wigfrid
      starts
      with
      meat.
      Also,
      more
      of
      as
      a
      funny
      easter
      egg
      and
      less
      of
      something
      you #8217;d
      actually
      do;
      but
      Wilton
      can
      eat
      a
      Shadow
      Atrium
      and
      if
      he
      does
      so
      his
      hunger
      will
      be
      maxed
      out,
      his
      health
      fully
      restored,
      and
      his
      hunger
      drain
      will
      stop
      entirely
      for
      one
      day.
      Just
      as
      something
      cool.
      Now
      to
      tackle
      the
      insanely
      low
      health.
      Before
      I
      go
      any
      further
      I
      should
      mention
      that
      any
      armor
      Wilton
      wears
      will
      not
      reduce
      the
      damage
      he
      takes
      at
      all.
      However,
      whenever
      he
      takes
      any
      form
      of
      damage,
      whether
      it
      be
      from
      picking
      a
      cactus
      all
      the
      way
      up
      to
      being
      struck
      directly
      by
      a
      meteor,
      that
      damage
      is
      immediately
      reduced
      to
      1
      point
      of
      damage.
      Now
      that
      I #8217;ve
      explained
      that,
      I #8217;m
      sure
      you
      can
      see
      how
      this
      character
      is
      playable.
      You
      basically
      get
      five
      total
      hits
      from
      any
      source
      before
      you
      die.
      I
      got
      the
      idea
      for
      this
      from
      the
      Bone
      Armor
      dropped
      by
      the
      Ancient
      Fuelweaver.
      It #8217;s
      armor
      that
      allows
      you
      to
      completely
      nullify
      any
      damage
      taken
      a
      set
      number
      of
      times
      before
      needing
      to
      be
      refueled
      by
      Nightmare
      Fuel.
      The
      idea
      is
      that
      Wilton
      is
      a
      skeleton,
      and
      he
      should
      die
      in
      one
      hit
      to
      anything.
      But
      because
      of
      the
      power
      of
      the
      Shadow
      Antrium,
      he
      is
      able
      to
      survive
      a
      set
      amount
      of
      hits
      before
      he
      needs
      to
      recharge.
      But
      Wilton
      is
      not
      permanently
      stuck
      at
      5
      health.
      Wilton
      has
      his
      own
      personal
      Magic
      recipe
      called
      Bone
      Reinforcement.
      It
      costs
      4
      boneshards,
      2
      pieces
      of
      Nightmare
      Fuel,
      and
      25
      points
      of
      hunger
      to
      craft,
      and
      gives
      Wilton
      an
      item
      that
      he
      can
      eat
      to
      gain
      1
      point
      of
      temporary
      HP
      up
      to
      a
      max
      of
      20.
      These
      HP
      points
      would
      act
      like
      soul
      hearts
      in
      the
      Binding
      of
      Isaac,
      or
      armor
      in
      Enter
      the
      Gungeon.
      Once
      you
      get
      hit
      this
      HP
      is
      lost
      permanently
      and
      cannot
      be
      healed
      back
      up.
      These
      would
      primarily
      be
      used
      for
      boss
      fights,
      stacking
      a
      bunch
      in
      your
      inventory
      and
      eating
      them
      whenever
      you
      feel
      like
      you
      need
      to.
      As
      a
      side
      note,
      Wilton
      can
      still
      heal
      from
      a
      life
      giving
      amulet,
      he
      just
      heals
      one
      point
      at
      a
      time
      in
      exchange
      for
      a
      large
      chunk
      of
      hunger.
      Also
      eating
      Warly #8217;s
      nightmare
      pie
      won #8217;t
      kill
      him
      even
      though
      it
      should.
      I #8217;m
      just
      going
      to
      say
      that
      it
      maxes
      out
      his
      health
      because
      it
      has
      nightmare
      fuel
      in
      it.
      It
      should
      also
      be
      noted
      that
      when
      his
      hunger
      reaches
      zero
      he
      does
      not
      take
      tick
      damage
      like
      other
      characters,
      he
      just
      dies
      instantly.
      Even
      if
      he
      did
      take
      tick
      damage
      it
      would
      only
      take
      literally
      five
      seconds
      to
      kill
      him
      so
      its
      not
      that
      big
      of
      a
      change.
      In
      the
      same
      vein
      as
      that,
      Wilton
      does
      not
      suffer
      damage
      from
      overheating
      or
      freezing
      as
      this
      would
      kill
      him
      in
      seconds.
      Instead,
      if
      he
      is
      freezing
      he
      suffers
      a
      50%
      movement
      speed
      penalty,
      the
      reasoning
      of
      this
      being
      that
      his
      bones
      are
      locking
      in
      place
      due
      to
      freezing.
      And
      if
      he
      overheats
      his
      hunger
      will
      begin
      to
      drain
      at
      double
      the
      speed
      until
      he
      cools
      down,
      bumping
      it
      to
      a
      massive
      200
      points
      per
      day.
      So
      temperature
      is
      not
      nearly
      as
      big
      a
      deal
      as
      it
      is
      on
      other
      characters,
      but
      it
      can
      still
      be
      your
      downfall
      if
      you
      aren #8217;t
      careful.
      Now
      for
      sanity,
      and
      I
      based
      this
      value
      off
      of
      the
      Bone
      Helm
      you
      can
      obtain
      from
      the
      Ancient
      Fuelweaver.
      This
      functions
      like
      a
      nightmare
      amulet,
      setting
      your
      sanity
      to
      zero,
      but
      has
      the
      bonus
      effect
      of
      making
      all
      nightmare
      creatures
      neutral
      towards
      you.
      It
      will
      have
      the
      same
      effect
      here.
      Nightmare
      creatures
      see
      Wilton
      as
      one
      of
      them,
      and
      will
      not
      attack
      him
      unless
      provoked.
      Also,
      I #8217;m
      going
      to
      say
      that
      Nightmare
      Creatures
      do
      not
      have
      a
      pack
      mentality,
      and
      attacking
      one
      will
      not
      provoke
      all
      the
      others.
      This
      allows
      for
      Wilton
      to
      always
      have
      access
      to
      his
      primary
      source
      of
      food
      in
      addition
      to
      being
      able
      to
      farm
      nightmare
      fuel
      much
      better
      than
      anyone
      else
      on
      the
      roster,
      and
      that
      would
      primarily
      be
      his
      function.
      Wilton
      is
      meant
      to
      make
      nightmare
      fuel
      farming
      easier,
      and
      if
      combined
      with
      a
      Wormwood
      that
      duo
      would
      be
      able
      to
      make
      countless
      Dark
      Swords
      for
      the
      team.
      Wilton
      would
      also
      make
      a
      great
      ruins
      rusher.
      He
      is
      unaffected
      by
      the
      constant
      sanity
      drain,
      will
      not
      be
      attacked
      by
      the
      swarms
      of
      nightmares,
      and
      is
      always
      surrounded
      by
      a
      good
      source
      of
      food
      in
      the
      form
      of
      Nightmare
      Fuel.
      Honestly,
      if
      Wilton
      were
      to
      exist
      in
      the
      game
      he
      would
      likely
      have
      the
      easiest
      time
      if
      he
      flat
      out
      based
      in
      the
      caves.
      As
      a
      smaller
      thing,
      Wilton
      would
      also
      be
      good
      for
      exploring
      the
      lunar
      island
      as
      he
      would
      constantly
      have
      0
      lunacy
      and
      would
      not
      be
      harassed
      by
      Gestalts.
      I #8217;m
      hoping
      they
      add
      positive
      effects
      of
      high
      lunacy
      in
      the
      future
      so
      that
      Wilton
      will
      be
      missing
      out
      on
      some
      things,
      but
      as
      of
      right
      now
      he
      would
      only
      have
      the
      advantage.
      As
      a
      side
      note,
      I #8217;m
      just
      going
      to
      say
      all
      obelisks
      will
      always
      be
      small
      for
      Wilton,
      I
      don #8217;t
      want
      him
      being
      trapped
      out
      of
      places
      because
      he
      can #8217;t
      raise
      his
      sanity.
      Also,
      just
      as
      a
      quality
      of
      life
      thing,
      I #8217;m
      going
      to
      say
      that
      shadow
      hands
      cannot
      harass
      Wilton.
      That
      would
      just
      be
      annoying.
      Anyway,
      that
      is
      the
      whole
      character!
      I
      really
      think
      this
      character
      would
      add
      a
      lot
      to
      the
      game.
      At
      the
      very
      least,
      it'd
      make
      a
      cool
      mod
      right?

      Easily
      the
      easiest
      act
      3
      boss
      because
      he
      only
      scales
      when
      you
      do
      something.
      If
      you
      don't
      have
      a
      power
      heavy
      deck,
      you
      can
      just
      tank
      up
      against
      him.
      Pop
      a
      demon
      form,
      kill
      the
      cultists,
      and
      wait.
      Pop
      a
      couple
      dark
      orbs
      and
      wait,
      using
      one
      for
      each
      phase.
      Pop
      a
      Wish
      and
      gain
      Live
      Forever
      and
      wait.
      Really
      only
      the
      Silent
      struggles
      really
      hard
      against
      it
      as
      they
      don't
      have
      the
      sort
      of
      scaling
      as
      the
      other
      characters
      outside
      of
      poison,
      and
      the
      poison
      is
      lost
      on
      the
      death
      of
      the
      first
      phase.
      But
      even
      then
      it
      isn't
      too
      hard.
      Really,
      he
      is
      the
      Champ
      of
      Act
      Three.
      If
      you
      have
      any
      form
      of
      scaling
      you
      just
      wait
      out
      his
      first
      phase
      until
      you
      can
      one
      shot
      both
      of
      them

      About
      his

      in

      he
      used

      What
      I
      Am
      Hoping
      For
      The
      Eventual
      Wes
      Rework

      Ah
      Wes.
      The
      character
      everyone
      either
      does
      hate
      or
      is
      wrong
      and
      should
      hate.
      His
      rework
      will
      inevitably
      come
      at
      some
      point,
      my
      guess
      being
      that
      he
      will
      be
      the
      last
      character
      to
      be
      done.
      But
      what
      could
      they
      do
      for
      this
      character?
      To
      make
      him
      better
      would
      ruin
      his
      existence
      as
      a
      challenge
      character,
      and
      to
      make
      him
      harder
      would
      just
      make
      him
      even
      more
      despised.
      My
      thought
      for
      Wes
      is
      to
      make
      him
      difficult
      to
      survive
      on
      his
      own,
      but
      invaluable
      to
      those
      around
      him.
      I
      think
      he
      should
      keep
      his
      low
      stats,
      extra
      hunger
      drain,
      and
      weak
      damage.
      However,
      I
      would
      first
      give
      him
      a
      slight
      boost
      to
      speed,
      around
      equal
      to
      running
      on
      a
      road
      for
      all
      other
      characters.
      This
      will
      feed
      into
      his
      next
      trait
      which
      will
      be
      labeled:
      Hated
      by
      everyone
      This
      trait
      will
      cause
      all
      creatures
      capable
      of
      attacking
      to
      always
      be
      hostile
      towards
      Wes.
      Including
      pigs
      and
      Beefalos.
      This
      is
      a
      horrible
      downside,
      but
      it
      has
      its
      uses.
      As
      long
      as
      Wes
      is
      nearby,
      any
      mob
      will
      prioritize
      killing
      him,
      even
      if
      they
      are
      being
      attacked
      by
      another
      player.
      This
      could
      help
      in
      boss
      battles
      where
      a
      boss
      could
      be
      focused
      on
      Wes,
      who
      runs
      away,
      while
      other
      players
      kill
      a
      boss.
      This
      won't
      be
      foolproof,
      and
      for
      every
      300
      damage
      the
      enemy
      suffers
      from
      a
      source
      that
      isn't
      Wes
      they
      will
      lose
      their
      aggro
      on
      Wes
      and
      refocus
      on
      whatever
      last
      hit
      it.
      To
      regain
      aggro,
      Wes
      will
      have
      to
      hit
      the
      enemy
      to
      restart
      the
      cycle.
      Again,
      this
      trait
      will
      make
      solo
      survival
      with
      Wes
      a
      huge
      challenge,
      but
      be
      a
      useful
      tool
      to
      the
      group
      as
      a
      whole.
      His
      next
      trait
      will
      be
      Accustomed
      to
      dying
      This
      trait
      will
      make
      it
      so
      Wes
      does
      not
      suffer
      the
      penalty
      of
      being
      revived.
      He
      also
      will
      inflict
      half
      of
      the
      sanity
      penalty
      of
      being
      a
      ghost
      as
      compared
      to
      other
      characters.
      Not
      only
      that,
      but
      he
      will
      have
      a
      lot
      more
      things
      to
      do
      while
      he
      is
      a
      ghost.
      Whenever
      he
      haunts
      a
      creature
      it
      will
      go
      into
      a
      frenzy
      and
      try
      it's
      best
      to
      attack
      Wes'
      ghost
      for
      fifteen
      seconds,
      taking
      the
      aggro
      off
      of
      his
      teammates.
      And
      finally,
      I
      believe
      Wes
      should
      keep
      his
      balloons.
      They
      will
      function
      just
      like
      they
      do
      already,
      but
      will
      also
      draw
      the
      aggro
      of
      any
      enemies
      which
      will
      prioritize
      destroying
      the
      balloon
      over
      anything
      else,
      even
      Wes.
      This
      will
      mostly
      just
      help
      Wes
      survive
      on
      his
      own
      a
      little
      bit.
      Anyway,
      that's
      my
      idea.
      It
      is
      mostly
      just
      a
      joke,
      but
      I
      still
      think
      it
      would
      help
      Wes
      be
      a
      bit
      useful
      while
      still
      being
      a
      challenge
      character
      at
      heart

      Definitely,

      he
      is
      fun
      as
      a
      solo
      challenge,
      but
      he
      is
      so
      annoying
      in
      a
      multiplayer
      game.
      I

      in

      Wortox
      already
      cannot
      interact
      with
      pigs
      and
      bunny
      men,
      and
      he
      is
      one
      of
      the
      best
      characters
      in
      the
      game.
      Plus,
      basing
      in
      a
      pig
      village
      is
      a
      bad
      idea
      anyway.
      I
      do
      agree
      that
      it
      would
      be
      hard
      if
      another
      player's
      tamed
      Beefalo
      attacked
      Wes,
      so
      maybe
      it
      could
      be
      changed
      so
      that
      Beefalo
      tamed
      by
      another
      player
      don't
      attack
      Wes.
      And
      besides,
      the
      point
      of
      this
      Wes
      is
      to
      be
      an
      insane
      challenge
      to
      tackle
      alone,
      but
      a
      reasonable
      one
      with
      friends.

      While
      I
      do
      agree
      that
      a
      rework
      exactly
      as
      I
      suggested
      is
      not
      perfect,
      your
      addition
      does
      not
      seem
      to
      fit
      the
      theme
      of
      these
      reworks.
      Thus
      far
      each
      rework
      seems
      to
      strive
      to
      make
      each
      character
      a
      better
      team
      player.
      Winona
      gained
      catapults
      to
      assist
      in
      mob
      farming,
      Willow
      gained
      a
      huge
      tank
      summon
      and
      is
      able
      to
      better
      fuel
      fire,
      Woodie
      can
      explore
      and
      farm
      living
      logs,
      and
      Warly
      has
      his
      spices.
      While
      your
      suggestion
      does
      help
      the
      team,
      it
      does
      so
      without
      the
      Wes
      needing
      to
      do
      anything.
      All
      they
      have
      to
      do
      is
      stand
      nearby
      during
      a
      fight,
      whereas
      with
      my
      suggestion
      they
      must
      take
      an
      active
      approach.
      I
      would
      say
      that
      your
      suggested
      rework
      would
      make
      him
      much
      easier
      than
      mine.
      Also,
      if
      you
      are
      implying
      that
      Wes
      is
      a
      viable
      pick
      in
      a
      team
      composition
      in
      his
      current
      state,
      I
      don't
      think
      you
      know
      this
      game
      really
      well.
      As
      he
      stands,
      Wes
      is
      completely
      useless.
      Anything
      he
      can
      do
      can
      be
      achieved
      better
      by
      most
      other
      characters,
      and
      his
      miniscule
      stats
      make
      him
      utterly
      unnecessary
      for
      any
      team
      comp.
      Balloons
      are
      a
      fun
      novelty
      but
      utterly
      useless
      when
      compared
      to
      the
      options
      other
      characters
      can
      provide.
      With
      most
      servers
      only
      allowing
      six
      players
      at
      a
      time,
      and
      with
      character
      switching
      being
      a
      late
      game
      endeavor,
      a
      character
      slot
      is
      extremely
      valuable,
      and
      to
      take
      one
      of
      those
      limited
      spaces
      with
      a
      completely
      useless
      character
      is
      incredibly
      stupid
      unless
      you
      are
      doing
      something
      just
      for
      the
      sake
      of
      a
      challenge

       gt;My
      idea
      fits
      that
      theme
      quite
      well
      while
      making
      compromises
      to
      both
      sides
      of
      the
      community.
      Wes
      like
      Warly
      would
      buff
      allies.
      Except
      unlike
      Warly,
      who
      has
      to
      work
      hard
      to
      get
      access
      to
      buffs,
      these
      would
      simply
      be
      always
      present.
      Therefore
      boring.
       gt;Wes
      is
      an
      able
      body
      with
      arms.
      He's
      just
      as
      viable
      as
      any
      other
      member
      of
      the
      cast.
      His
      potential
      may
      be
      lower,
      but
      he's
      just
      as
      viable.
      Except
      Wes
      isn't
      able
      bodied.
      He
      takes
      more
      swings
      from
      his
      weapons
      to
      kill
      anything,
      meaning
      more
      durability
      lost
      on
      weapons
      in
      any
      fight
      which
      is
      a
      waste
      of
      resources.
      The
      only
      person
      with
      comparable
      damage
      output
      is
      Wendy,
      and
      she
      has
      Abigail
      to
      help
      out.
      He
      also
      eats
      more
      food
      than
      most
      of
      the
      cast.
      And
      unlike
      the
      other
      hungry
      characters
      like
      Wolfgang
      or
      Wormwood,
      he
      eats
      more
      food
      without
      bringing
      a
      unique
      way
      to
      get
      said
      food
      to
      the
      table,
      like
      easier
      access
      to
      farming
      or
      a
      strong
      hunter.
       gt;No,
      some
      things
      he's
      equally
      tied
      for.
      "Unnecessary"
      does
      not
      mean
      useless
      or
      pointless.
      Wes
      is
      perfectly
      fine
      as
      filler,
      or
      combat
      roles.
      He's
      outclassed
      normally,
      but
      he's
      still
      viable.
      Literally
      any
      character
      is
      better
      at
      combat
      than
      Wes
      because
      he
      takes
      longer
      to
      kill
      enemies.
      And
      even
      if
      he
      isn't
      fighting,
      say
      he
      his
      farming
      or
      gathering,
      he
      still
      eats
      more
      food
      than
      anyone.
       gt;No,
      Wes
      isn't
      useless.
      What's
      useless
      is
      someone
      joining
      the
      server,
      and
      not
      choosing
      a
      character.
      An
      able
      body
      is
      an
      able
      body
      after-all.
      I
      would
      argue
      that
      with
      his
      extra
      hunger
      drain
      and
      damage
      dealt
      reduction
      it
      would
      be
      better
      for
      the
      whole
      team
      if
      no
      one
      joined
      than
      if
      a
      Wes
      joined.
      Wes
      is
      a
      challenge
      character,
      that
      is
      what
      he
      was
      in
      the
      base
      game
      and
      what
      he
      is
      in
      this
      game.
      And
      while
      a
      challenge
      character
      is
      fine
      in

      solo
      experience,
      it
      is
      annoying

      are
      trying

      Again,
      Wes
      is
      a
      fun
      challenge
      in
      solo,
      but
      just
      an
      annoyance
      is
      cooperative
      play.

      Yeah,
      and
      that's
      the
      point.
      Wes
      is
      a
      hard
      mode
      character
      on
      his
      own,
      but
      would
      be
      an
      invaluable
      tool
      for
      his
      allies.
      He
      could
      draw
      aggro
      while
      his
      friends
      kill
      a
      pig
      village,
      same
      for
      killing
      a
      few
      Beefalo.
      He
      could
      even
      make
      hunting
      Koalafants
      a
      little
      easier
      since
      they
      would
      chase
      him
      down
      instead
      of
      running
      away.
      In
      the
      end,
      to
      survive
      solo
      as
      this
      Wes
      would
      be
      an
      impressive
      feat,
      as
      all
      of
      his
      "perks"
      are
      purely
      a
      detriment
      to
      himself,
      but
      useful
      to
      everyone
      else

      Sure
      he
      can,
      but
      as
      he
      participates
      he
      uses
      up
      more
      resources
      than
      he
      can
      contribute
      with
      both
      food
      and

      you're

      it's

      harder.
      And
      it
      can
      be
      really
      annoying
      in

      both

      Hamlet
      actually
      is
      a
      high
      altitude
      area,
      being
      on
      a

      but
      I
      agree
      that
      an
      arctic
      theme
      would
      be
      awesome!
      Maybe
      in
      universe
      Wilson
      would
      find
      a
      tall
      mountain
      in
      the
      hamlet,
      climb
      it,
      and
      get
      stuck
      up
      there?
      Anyway,
      I'd
      love
      this
