      I
      was
      born
      a
      boy,
      and
      actually
      havent
      really
      looked
      into
      my
      thoughts
      and
      feeling
      clearly
      until
      very
      recently
      ,
      actually
      didnt
      really
      knew
      about
      a
      transsexuality,,
      my
      society
      has
      always
      potrayed
      them
      as
      third
      gender
      ,
      a
      part
      of
      laughing
      stock
      (in
      films
      dramas
      etc
      etc,,
      calling
      a
      boy
      third
      gender
      would
      be
      a
      joke
      of
      shaming
      .
      I
      grew
      up
      like
      that.
      Growing
      into
      adolcent
      I
      still
      thought
      myself
      as
      male
      ,,
      I
      didnt
      have
      any
      thoughts
      of
      feminity,
      but
      there
      was
      something
      that
      now
      I
      think
      ,,

      I
      didnt.know

      I
      would
      masterbate
      wearing
      my
      sisters
      dresses
      (,,

      instantly
      felt
      so
      eroctic
      (
      that
      was
      not
      incest
      feeling
      though

      dress

      years

      I
      would
      watch
      straight
      porn
      but
      trans
      porn
      really
      caught
      me
      easily.
      I
      was
      in
      no
      time
      into
      feminization
      questioning

      reminded
      me
      of
      my
      ignorant
      mom
      .
      when
      I
      was
      a
      bit
      small
      like
      12
      yrs
      I
      would
      play
      with
      her
      lipstick,
      jewelrys
      and
      bras.
      I
      would
      wear
      bra
      inside
      bathroom
      inserting
      clothes
      inside
      to
      make
      boobs
      (
      how
      innocent
      minded
      of
      me
      :p).
      In
      doing
      so
      I
      got
      lipstick
      all
      over
      bra
      and
      it
      was
      white
      bra,,
      tried
      to
      washoff
      it
      just
      got.worse.
      Then
      I
      hid
      it
      under
      my
      bed.
      .....
      then
      one
      day
      while
      cleaning
      she
      found
      it,
      She
      scolded
      me
      so
      bad,,
      told
      me
      this
      is
      all
      result
      of
      watching
      ftv
      and
      tvs
      where
      model
      walk
      naked
      .
      For
      months
      I
      couldnot
      raise
      my
      head
      in
      home
      due
      to
      shame.
      I
      havenot
      come
      out
      to
      parents
      and
      I
      dont
      think
      ill
      ever
      tell
      her
      antthing.

      I
      have
      a
      huge
      fear
      of
      opening
      to
      my
      parents,,
      I
      am
      24
      years
      old
      now,
      I
      have
      lived
      as
      male
      up
      to
      this
      point
      ,
      but
      it
      is
      getting
      harder
      to
      live
      like
      this.
      I
      get
      sucidal
      tendencies.
      this
      fear
      of
      telling
      parents
      comes
      from
      a
      incident
      ,
      it
      was
      a
      quite
      a
      while
      back,,
      I
      was
      15
      ,I
      would
      play
      with
      moms
      clothes
      and
      makeups
      whenever
      I
      was
      alone
      in
      home
      and
      in
      doing
      so
      I
      got
      lipstick
      marks
      on
      her
      bra,,
      I
      was
      scared
      so
      I
      hid
      it
      under
      my
      bed
      (
      I
      was
      so
      stupid
      to
      hide
      it
      under
      my
      own
      bed
      lol)
      and
      while
      cleaning
      mom
      found
      it
      ,,
      she
      scolded
      me
      so
      badly
      ,,
      she
      scolded
      me
      telling
      this
      is
      all
      because
      of
      influence
      from
      TV,
      films.,,
      after
      that
      I
      really
      dont
      have
      courage
      to
      tell
      anything

      I
      have
      been
      constantly
      tucking
      like
      all
      day,,
      everyday.
      It
      doesnt
      really
      feel
      uncomfortable,,
      I
      most
      sit
      crossing
      my
      legs
      and
      wear
      mostly
      tights,,
      it
      is
      not
      really
      painfull
      only
      gives
      a
      little
      discomfort
      but
      it
      is
      bearable,,
      Is
      it
      good
      to
      tuck
      every
      time
      or
      should
      I
      not
      do
      it
      all
      the
      time
      ,,
      maybe
      if
      there
      will
      be
      some
      effects
      in
      future
      do
      tell
      whoever
      does
      like
      this??
      (I
      tuck
      using
      homemade
      gaffs)

      SoI
      am
      still
      in
      closet,
      waiting
      for
      good
      moment
      to
      come
      out
      .
      I
      am
      thinking
      to
      keep
      it
      secret
      untill
      I
      complete
      my
      studies.
      basically
      I
      keep
      my
      real
      clothes
      inside
      cupboard
      but
      I
      just
      had
      changed
      into
      boymode
      and
      kept
      clothes
      in
      table
      drawer,
      then
      all
      of
      a
      sudden
      mom
      barged
      in
      searching
      for
      something
      ,
      she
      directly
      went
      towards
      drawer
      ,,
      I
      got
      so
      scared...
      I
      just
      stoop
      infront
      of
      drawer
      ,""me:
      no
      nothings
      here
      nothing.
      mom
      :
      let
      me
      open
      it
      ,,
      me
      :
      no
      the
      thing
      youre
      searching
      is
      in
      other
      room
      (I
      had
      no
      idea
      where
      it
      was
      )
      then
      her
      mobile
      rang
      and
      she
      left,,,
      she
      might
      be
      thinking
      I
      must
      have
      hid

      I
      have

      sisters
      in
      the
      family,
      I
      would
      insist
      to
      sleep
      with
      any
      cousin
      sister
      that
      come
      in
      holidays.I
      always
      enjoyed
      her
      company
      ,
      with
      sisters
      holidays
      would
      feel
      great.
      I
      have
      always
      shyed
      in
      company
      of
      brothers.
      When
      I
      entered
      puberty
      and
      sexual
      feelings
      rose,,
      it
      just
      felt
      wierd
      .
      I
      started
      thinking
      why
      did
      I
      insisted
      on
      sleeping
      with
      sisters,,
      I
      started
      feeling
      bad
      to
      know
      if
      I
      was
      some
      kind
      of
      pervert..
      But
      it
      turns
      out
      it
      was
      an
      entirely
      different
      thing
      :D.

      thing
      and
      stop
      making
      it
      sound
      easy
      .
      your
      place
      have
      different
      facilities.to
      get
      treatment
      for
      trans
      people..
      We
      dont
      have
      like
      that,
      the
      only
      doctor
      which
      does
      hormone
      related
      treatment
      lives
      in
      another
      town
      ,
      take
      12
      hrs
      to
      reach
      .
      and
      he
      is
      not
      even
      fully
      dedicated
      to
      transgsnder
      treatment
      ,
      he
      is
      doctor
      of
      thoyroid
      or
      something.
      So
      most
      easy
      option
      is
      Self
      medication
      do
      you
      suggest

      So
      ,,
      one
      fear
      of
      transition
      has
      always
      been
      there
      that
      is
      ,
      chosing
      a
      career
      path.
      I
      dont
      know
      what
      career
      path
      should
      I
      really
      choose
      ,
      weather
      there
      will
      be
      some
      difference
      between
      before
      and
      after
      transtion.
      Want
      to
      kbow
      your

      extreme

      am.
      The
      state
      of
      trans
      people
      here
      is
      horrifying.
      Many
      transgender
      who
      come
      out
      openly
      and
      have
      changed
      their
      sex
      on
      citizenships
      will
      get
      no
      jobs
      .
      since
      family
      stops
      supporting
      as
      well
      so
      many
      of
      fellow
      people
      get
      involved
      in
      sex
      work,
      living
      like
      a
      shame
      of
      the
      society.

      MTF)
      my
      parents
      feel
      weird
      when
      I
      wear
      earings.
      Thinking
      they
      were
      the
      only
      one
      who
      got
      my
      ear
      pierced
      when
      I
      was
      very
      little.
