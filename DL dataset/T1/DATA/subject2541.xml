      The
      bots
      on
      this
      game
      are
      the
      worst

      I #8217;ve
      lost
      games
      cause
      they
      were

      I

      mind
      a
      whole

      map
      just

      Sometimes
      it #8217;s
      fun
      to
      dogfight

      have

      Instead
      of
      playing
      for
      common
      parts,
      you
      get
      a
      lot
      more
      scrap
      per
      battle
      and
      build
      common
      parts
      yourself.
      It
      ranges
      between
      20-75
      scrap
      for
      a
      part
      and
      you
      earn
      between
      20-30
      scrap
      per
      battle.
      I
      actually
      like
      this
      system
      better
      than
      the
      old
      one
      because
      you
      don #8217;t
      have
      to
      play
      5
      times
      to
      get
      one
      piece
      you
      need.

      I
      was
      playing
      a
      3v3(or
      one
      of
      those
      modes)
      on
      modern
      warfare
      3.
      I
      almost
      dropped
      my
      remote,
      but
      caught
      it
      in
      midair.
      I
      accidentally
      set
      a
      claymore
      where
      I
      was
      standing.
      It
      was
      in
      such
      a
      perfect
      spot
      because
      you
      couldn #8217;t
      even
      see
      the
      laser
      designators
      on
      the
      front.
      An
      enemy
      walked
      in
      front
      of
      it
      and
      got
      killed.
      For
      anyone
      who
      hasn #8217;t
      played
      MW3,
      when
      you
      kill
      an
      enemy
      they
      get
      about
      3
      seconds
      to
      say
      something
      to
      you
      through
      their
      mic.
      He
      cussed
      me
      out,
      called
      me
      a
      pussy
      (the
      normal
      stuff)
      and
      threatened
      me.
      Now
      I
      wasn #8217;t
      planning
      to
      lay
      another
      one
      down
      the
      next
      match,
      but
      He
      was
      being
      an
      asshole
      about
      it
      and
      I
      set
      one
      in
      the
      exact
      spot.
      The
      same
      guy
      got
      killed
      but
      I
      didn #8217;t
      hear
      anything
      because
      he
      left
      before
      he
      got
      to
      say
      something
      else.

      It

      depends
      on
      what
      type
      of
      build
      you
      use.
      I

      agile,
      but
      if

      armor
      over
      speed,
      then
      go
      ahead
      with
      tracks.
      The
      perk
      for
      the
      cheetah
      engine
      is
      nice

      with
      drones
      and
      the
      chameleon,
      but
      tracks
      can
      make
      using
      cannons
      easier.

      I #8217;m
      thinking
      about
      building
      a
      werewolf
      cabin.
      Should
      I
      continue
      pursuing
      the
      werewolf,
      or
      craft
      and
      sell
      to
      get
      torero.
      Or
      should
      I
      just
      abandon
      the
      plan
      entirely
      and
      get
      something
      else.

      My
      experience
      playing
      against
      hovers
      (I #8217;m
      at
      5.5k
      ps)
      is
      that
      they #8217;re
      too
      sensitive.
      Its
      really
      easy
      to
      mow
      one
      down
      with
      an
      impulse.
      Once
      I
      knock
      off
      one
      hover
      it #8217;s
      much
      harder
      for
      them
      to
      aim
      at
      me.
      Sometimes
      I
      can
      render
      a
      hover
      build
      useless
      with
      just
      2
      boom
      sticks.
      They
      can
      be
      effective,
      but
      as
      soon
      as
      I
      catch
      them
      off
      guard
      it
      doesn #8217;t
      take
      me
      long
      to
      destroy
      them.

      The
      first
      thing
      you
      need
      to
      do
      is
      get
      all
      the
      blue
      parts
      you
      need.
      Create
      the
      blue
      types
      of
      weapons
      you
      want
      to
      use.
      Also,
      Before
      you
      move
      to
      purple,
      I #8217;d
      recommend
      a
      chameleon,
      ammo
      crate,
      a
      cooler
      or
      radiator,
      An
      engine
      and
      the
      t-51
      optics.
      You
      may
      not
      need
      them
      now,
      but
      you
      can
      do
      a
      lot
      more
      with
      them
      in
      you #8217;re
      inventory.
      After
      that,
      you
      can
      just
      grind
      out
      scrap
      metal
      and
      go
      for
      what
      you
      want.
      You
      can
      get
      the
      purple
      a
      lot
      quicker
      if
      you
      ONLY
      focus
      on
      creating
      the
      necessary
      blue
      parts.
      TLDR:create
      blue
      parts
      that
      you
      need
      for
      your
      play
      style,
      then
      grind
      for
      scrap
      and

      A
      new
      pack
      called
       #8220;born
      free #8221;
      is
      to
      be
      released
      soon.
      The
      pack
      features
      a
      Steven
      cabin,
      Golden
      eagle
      engine,
      several
      stickers,
      new
      paint,
      and
      new
      epic
      auto
      cannon
      called
      the
       #8220;joule #8221;.
      In
      all
      honesty,
      I
      think
      they #8217;re
      just
      making
      cars
      to
      make
      cars.
      The
      new
      weapons
      are
      just
      different
      designs
      of
      older
      weapons.
