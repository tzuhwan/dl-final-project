      Good
      drawback

      a

      I #8217;m
      the
      DM
      for
      a
      campaign
      right
      now
      and
      have
      decided
      that
      it #8217;s
      about
      time
      for
      the
      party
      to
      start
      getting
      some
      cool
      new
      weapons
      so
      they #8217;ll
      be
      better
      equipped
      to
      handle
      the
      enemies
      I
      plan
      to
      throw
      at
      them
      later.
      One
      weapon
      is
      an
      enchanted
      greatsword
      that
      does
      2d6
      +
      3
      slashing
      damage
      and
      can
      also
      release
      an
      energy
      wave
      that
      does
      an
      additional
      d12
      of
      damage
      if
      the
      attack
      roll
      was
      a
      17
      or
      higher
      (without
      modifiers).
      Naturally,
      a
      weapon
      this
      cool
      needs
      some
      drawbacks.
      So
      aside
      from
      needing
      a
      certain
      strength
      level
      to
      wield
      it,
      what
      are
      some
      negative
      aspects
      I
      can
      add
      to
      the
      sword
      to
      make
      it
      a
      little
      more
      problematic/harmful
      to
      the
      person
      using
      it?

      It #8217;s
      probably
      going
      to
      end
      up
      with
      the
      barbarian
      or
      the
      paladin.
      Most
      other
      members
      in
      the
      party
      prefer
      lighter
      weapons.

      So
      when
      the
      goblin
      makes
      an
      attack,
      you
      roll
      the
      d20.
      That #8217;s
      called
      the
      attack
      roll.
      You
      then
      add
      4
      to
      the
      d20
      because
      the
      goblin
      has
      a
      +4
      modifier.
      So
      say
      you
      rolled
      a
      12,
      you
      add
      the
      4,
      and
      the
      final
      number
      is
      16.
      You
      then
      compare
      the
      attack
      roll
      to
      the
      player #8217;s
      armor
      class
      (AC).
      If
      the
      attack
      roll
      is
      HIGHER
      than
      the
      armor
      class,
      the
      attack
      hits.
      If
      the
      attack
      roll
      is
      LOWER
      than
      the
      armor
      class,
      then
      the
      attack
      does
      not
      hit.
      If
      the
      attack
      hits,
      you
      roll
      the
      damage
      die.
      In
      this
      case,
      the
      attack
      die
      is
      1d6+2.
      So
      you
      just
      roll
      the
      d6
      and
      add
      2
      to
      the
      result.
      That
      number
      is
      how
      many
      hit
      points
      the
      player
      takes
      in
      damage.
      You
      do
      the
      same
      process
      when
      a
      player
      attacks
      another
      character.
      Hope
      I
      was
      able
      to
      help
      and
      best
      of
      luck
      with
      your
      campaign!

      I
      can #8217;t
      say
      that
      I #8217;ve
      gone
      through
      your
      exact
      experience,
      but
      my
      biological
      father
      behaved
      in
      a
      very
      similar
      way
      and
      did
      a
      lot
      of
      the
      same
      things
      that
      you #8217;re
      saying
      to
      me,
      my
      brothers,
      and
      my
      mom.
      I
      hated
      him
      for
      it
      and
      like
      you,
      i
      was
      feeling
      suicidal
      and
      eventually
      ran
      away
      to
      live
      with
      my
      mom
      and
      cut
      ties
      with
      my
      father.
      My
      brothers
      didn #8217;t
      make
      the
      same
      choice,
      they
      stayed,
      and
      I
      know
      how
      hard
      it
      is
      to
      watch
      your
      siblings
      get
      hurt
      for
      your
      actions.
      It
      sucks.
      But
      it
      does
      start
      to
      get
      better.
      Something
      that
      I
      had
      to
      learn
      was
      that
      it #8217;s
      okay
      to
      prioritize
      yourself
      over
      other
      people.
      After
      all,
      if
      you
      can #8217;t
      take
      care
      of
      yourself,
      you
      can #8217;t
      be
      expected
      to
      take
      care
      of
      others.
      So
      do
      yourself
      a
      favor
      and
      choose
      what #8217;s
      best
      for
      you,
      not
      for
      your
      siblings.
      Then,
      once
      you #8217;re
      stable,
      offer
      support
      and
      encouragement
      to
      the
      people
      that
      you
      love.
      Let
      them
      know
      that
      you
      love
      them,
      but
      that
      you
      refuse
      to
      be
      around
      an
      abusive
      and
      toxic
      person
      like
      your
      father.
      You
      deserve
      better
      than
      that.
      So
      do
      all
      your
      siblings
      and
      so
      does
      your
      mother.
      I
      know
      it
      might
      not
      mean
      much
      coming
      from
      a
      stranger
      on
      the
      internet,
      but
      I
      do
      hope
      to
      God
      that
      things
      turn
      out
      well
      for
      you
      and
      your
      entire
      family.

      It
      would
      only
      be
      cultural
      appropriation
      if
      you
      are

      to
      be
      the
      original
      creator
      of
      that
      culture.
      As
      long
      as
      you
      give
      credit
      where
      credit
      is
      due,
      it
      should
      not
      be
      a
      problem.
      Take
      for
      example
      Avatar:
      the
      Last
      Airbender.
      Each
      individual
      nation
      was
      based
      off
      of
      Chinese
      (Earth),
      Japanese
      (Fire),
      Tibetan
      (Air),
      and
      Native
      American
      (Water)
      cultures.
      But,
      the
      show
      was
      created
      by
      white
      Americans.
      The
      creators
      presented
      the
      various
      cultures
      in
      their
      fantasy
      world
      in
      a
      very
      respectful
      way.
      As
      long
      as
      you
      do
      the
      same,
      I
      wouldn #8217;t
      be
      worried.

      That #8217;s
      not
      a
      problem.
      It #8217;s
      honestly
      totally
      normal.
      I
      was
      the
      same
      way
      until
      I
      got
      to
      college.
      Sometimes
      I #8217;ll
      have
      a
      mixed
      drink
      or
      two

      even

      is

      don #8217;t
      want

      then
      don #8217;t.
      And
      if
      your
      friends
      make
      you
      feel
      bad
      for
      that,

      find
      better

      was
      driving
      through
      some
      mountains
      and
      a
      hail
      storm
      suddenly
      set
      it.
      Even
      though
      I
      was
      going
      a
      safe
      speed,
      it
      was
      still
      pretty
      dangerous
      and
      hard
      to
      see/control
      the
      truck.
      I
      came
      around
      one
      bend
      and
      saw
      a
      massive
      mudslide
      going
      across
      the
      road
      and
      over
      a
      cliff.
      I
      hit
      the
      breaks
      but
      the
      truck
      started
      to
      hydroplane
      forward
      and
      I
      couldn #8217;t
      stop.
      Going
      right
      meant
      crashing
      into
      the
      mountain.
      Going
      left
      meant
      going
      off
      the
      cliff.
      Going
      straight
      would
      mean
      the
      mudslide
      dragged
      me
      over
      the
      edge.
      All
      I
      could
      do
      is
      close
      my
      eyes
      and
      panic.
      When
      I
      opened
      them,
      my
      truck
      was
      on
      the
      other
      side
      of
      the
      mudslide
      without
      any
      kind
      of
      damage.
      I
      didn #8217;t
      feel
      any
      kind
      of
      a
      bump
      or
      anything
      when
      I
      went
      over
      the
      mud
      and
      have
      no
      idea
      how
      I
      made
      it
      out
      alive.
      I
      decided
      that
      it
      had
      to
      have
      been
      an
      act
      of
      God
      because
      I
      can #8217;t
      come
      up
      with
      any
      other
      logical
      explanation.

      When
      I
      was
      5,
      I
      was
      madly
      in
      love
      with
      my
      16
      year
      old
      babysitter,
      Lacy.
      My
      older
      brother
      who
      was
      8
      at
      the
      time
      knew
      about
      it
      and
      was
      going
      to
      tell
      her,
      so
      I
      hit
      him
      in
      the
      head
      with
      a
      giant
      stick
      I
      found
      in
      the
      back
      yard.
      He
      was
      unhappy
      about
      that.
      So
      he
      found
      an
      equally
      large
      stick
      and
      hit
      me
      back.
      20
      minutes
      later,
      we #8217;re
      rolling
      around
      in
      the
      yard,
      beating
      the
      hell
      out
      of
      each
      other
      while
      our
      poor
      babysitter
      can #8217;t
      do
      anything
      to
      really
      stop
      us,
      for
      fear
      of
      also
      being
      hit
      with
      a
      stick.
      Meanwhile,
      our
      other
      brother
      (age
      7)
      is
      just
      watching
      us
      go
      at
      it
      while
      eating
      Scooby
      Doo
      fruit
      snacks
      on
      the
      back
      porch.
      That #8217;s
      about
      when
      our
      parents
      got
      home
      and
      broke
      everything
      up.
      When
      they
      asked
      us
      what
      the
      hell
      was
      going
      on,
      my
      oldest
      brother
      pointed
      at
      me
      and
      blurred
      out
       #8220;HE
      DOESN #8217;T
      WANT
      LACY
      TO
      KNOW
      HE
      LOVES
      HER! #8221;
      So
      I
      hit
      him
      again.
      It #8217;s
      one
      of
      my
      earliest
      memories.

      Seriously,
      if
      I
      wanted
      to
      get
      chills
      down
      my
      spine
      and
      listen
      to
      someone
      whisper
      weird
      shit
      in
      my
      ear,
      I
      would
      spend
      the
      night
      at
      my
      uncle #8217;s
      house.
      Just
      because
      it
       #8220;kinda
      sorta
      maybe #8221;
      sounds
      like
      the
      sounds
      are
      coming
      from
      all
      around
      you
      doesn #8217;t
      make
      it
      relaxing
      or
      comfortable.
      And
      unless
      the
      device
      you #8217;re
      listening
      through
      has
      surround
      sound,
      the
      sound
      isn #8217;t
      actually
      doing
      that.
      It #8217;s
      a
      total
      placebo
      effect.
      Tapping
      on
      shit
      with
      finger
      nails,
      clicking
      pens,
      rubbing
      coins
      together,
      etc.
      are
      typically
      associated
      with
      UNCOMFORTABLE
      and
      ANNOYING
      sounds!
      So
      why
      is
      in
      when
      an
      attractive
      girl
      does
      it
      on
      camera
      with
      fancy
      sound
      equipment,
      it #8217;s
      considered
      cool
      and
      relaxing?
      The
      emphasis
      on
      the
      syllables
      is
      an
      unnatural
      way
      of
      speaking
      that
      makes
      the
      person
      behind
      the
      mic
      sound
      alien
      and
      strange,
      like
      your
      listening
      to
      a
      fake
      human
      try
      to
      pretend
      to
      be
      a
      human.
      And
      the
      way
      they
      pronounce
      the
      S
      in
      every
      word
      that
      has
      an
      S
      makes
      them
      sound
      like
      Herbert
      the
      Pervert
      from
      Family
      Guy.
      And
      listening
      to
      them
      inhale
      and
      exhale
      over
      and
      over
      and
      over
      and
      over
      again
      through
      the
      video
      is
      incredibly
      annoying.
      Not
      to
      mention
      how
      weirdly
      expressive
      they
      are
      with
      their
      hands.
      Possibly
      the
      WORST
      PART
      about
      ASMR
      videos
      though
      is
      that
      God
      awful,
      wet
      smacking
      sound
      that
      the
      mic
      picks
      up
      when
      someone
      speaks.
      I #8217;m
      talking
      about
      that
      disgusting,
      wet
       #8220;teecck #8221;
      noise.
      The
      noise
      that
      sounds
      like
      a
      baby
      trying
      to
      chew
      apple
      sauce
      with
      its
      mouth
      open
      for
      the
      first
      time.
      If
      you #8217;re
      into
      ASMR,
      cool.
      Don #8217;t
      let
      me
      stop
      you
      from
      enjoying
      the
      shit
      that
      you
      love.
      Maybe
      I
      just
      don #8217;t
      see
      the
      appeal
      or
      I #8217;m
      wired
      differently.
      But
      I
      find
      that
      shit
      to
      be
      absolutely
      repulsive.

      Yeah,
      Fortnite
      can
      be
      pretty
      annoying
      and
      the
      dances
      are
      stupid.
      Who
      gives
      a
      shit?
      Kids
      like
      stupid
      shit!
      They
      always
      have
      and
      they
      always
      will!
      When
      I
      was
      a
      kid,
      I
      had
      an
      asshole
      old
      man
      as
      my
      next
      door
      neighbor.
      I #8217;m
      talking
      about
      a
      real
      Mr.
      Scrooge.
      The
      kind
      of
      guy
      who
      would
      find
      my
      football
      in
      his
      backyard,
      stab
      it
      with
      a
      steak
      knife,
      then
      throw
      it
      back
      over
      the
      fence.
      The
      kind
      of
      guy
      who
      would
      yell
      at
      me
      and
      my
      brothers
      for
      riding
      our
      bikes
      in
      the
      street.
      A
      real
      puppy
      kicker.
      That
      dude
      was
      a
      dick
      and
      we
      all
      hated
      him
      because
      we
      were
      just
      trying
      to
      have
      fun!
      It #8217;s
      not
      our
      fault
      that
      our
      version
      of
      fun
      is
      different
      from
      his.
      Today,
      I
      try
      my
      best
      to
      avoid
      being
      like
      that
      asshole.
      Yeah,
      kids
      are
      fucking
      annoying.
      Who
      gives
      a
      shit?
      It #8217;s
      not
      like
      a
      viral
      video
      of
      some
      kid
       #8220;flossing #8221;
      is
      bringing
      you
      personal
      harm
      or
      inconveniencing
      your
      life
      in
      any
      way,
      shape,
      or
      form.
      And
      it #8217;s
      not
      like
      we
      were
      any
      better.
      Don #8217;t
      you
      people
      remember
      those
      super
      cringy
      Minecraft
      parody
      song
      videos?
      We
      ate
      that
      shit
      up
      as
      kids!
      And
      now
      that
      we #8217;re
      adults,
      we #8217;ve
      grown
      out
      of
      it.
      So
      chill
      the
      fuck
      out
      and
      let
      kids
      be
      kids.
      They #8217;re
      stupid
      and
      goofy
      because
      they
      don #8217;t
      have
      to
      deal
      with
      shit
      in
      the
      real
      world
      yet.
      And
      I
      think
      that #8217;s
      a
      good
      thing.
      Let
      them
      enjoy
      their
      video
      games.
      When
      a
      kid
      throws
      a
      ball
      in
      your
      yard,
      toss
      it
      back
      over
      the
      fence.
      When
      you
      see
      a
      video
      of
      a
      Fortnite
      dance,
      roll
      your
      eyes
      and
      skip
      it.
      Don #8217;t
      be
      the
      asshole
      old
      man/woman
      who
      lives
      next
      door.
      Be
      the
      cool
      old
      man/woman
      who
      makes
      some

      ass
      lemonade

      When
      I
      was
      16,
      I
      was
      homeless
      because
      I
      fled
      an
      abusive
      father.
      Had
      it
      not
      been
      for
      the
      kindness
      of
      strangers,
      I
      would
      have
      died.
      Most
      of
      the
      other
      homeless
      people
      I
      met
      had
      severe
      mental
      disabilities
      and
      many
      were
      vets.
      There
      is
      no
      way
      to
      distinguish
      a
       #8220;regular #8221;
      homeless
      person
      from
      a
      homeless
      vet
      and
      adding
      the
      qualifier
       #8220;unless
      they
      served
      in
      the
      US
      military #8221;
      is
      just
      a
      bullshit
      excuse
      to
      make
      yourself
      feel
      better
      about
      your
      elitist
      lack
      of
      empathy
      for
      other
      human
      beings.
      A
      person #8217;s
      worth
      shouldn #8217;t
      be
      measured
      by
      how
      much
      money
      they
      have
      or
      how
      many
      resources
      they
      can
      produce.
      Claiming
      so
      is
      disgusting.

      TL;DR
      -
      SC
      Johnson
      is
      not
      a
      family
      company,
      they #8217;re
      a
      multi
      billion
      dollar
      enterprise
      that
      happens
      to
      pass
      from
      father
      to
      son.
      They
      present
      themselves
      as
      a
      family
      company
      to
      trick
      the
      hardworking
      American
      consumer
      into
      buying
      their
      products
      and
      thinking
      they #8217;re
      supporting
      a
      deserving
      family.
      The
      family
      is
      not
      deserving
      of
      that
      kind
      of
      sympathy.
      I
      don #8217;t
      really
      know
      if
      this
      opinion
      is
      unpopular
      or
      if
      it #8217;s
      just
      something
      that
      no
      one
      notices/talks
      about.
      All
      I
      know
      is
      then
      when
      I
      get
      drunk
      and
      start
      ranting
      about
      this
      shit,
      no
      one
      seems
      to
      agree
      with
      me.
      So
      I #8217;m
      going
      to
      rant
      about
      it
      while
      sober
      to
      a
      bunch
      of
      strangers
      on
      the
      internet
      instead.
      After
      every
      fucking
      commercial
      for
      a
      SC
      Johnson
      product,
      they
      do
      that
      little
      tug
      of
      the
      corner
      of
      the
      screen
      to
      reveal
      the
      logo
      and
      that
      pleasant
      sounding
      woman
      says
      their
      slogan.
       #8220;SC
      Johnson!
      A
      family
      company! #8221;
      That #8217;s
      such
      fucking
      bullshit
      and
      it
      infuriates
      me
      to
      no
      end.
      SCJ
      is
      a
      massive
      fucking
      corporation
      that
      has
      a
      net
      value
      of
      $28.8
      billion
      and
      sell
      approximately
      $10
      billion
      worth
      of
      product
      every
      year.
      That
      puts
      the
      Johnson
      family
      as
      the
      9th
      wealthiest
      family
      in
      the
      entire
      fucking
      United
      States
      of
      America
      (according
      to
      Forbes,
      at
      least.)
      The
      company
      operates
      across
      70
      different
      nations
      in
      order
      to
      gain
      cheap
      labor
      and
      sells
      products
      in
      basically
      every
      country
      in
      the
      world.
      THEY
      ARE
      GLOBAL.
      Yet
      they
      still
      love
      to
      sit
      back
      and
      say
      that
      they #8217;re
      a
      family
      company!
      They
      employ
      roughly
      13,000
      people.
      And
      that
      doesn #8217;t
      include
      the
      manufacturers
      of
      the
      products,
      which
      they
      outsource
      for.
      Speaking
      of
      products,
      SCJ
      manufactures
      dozens
      of
      products!
      Ones
      such
      as
      Shout,
      Babyganics,
      Windex,
      Mr.
      Muscle,
      Kit,
      Baygon,
      Bayclin,
      Ziploc,
      Glade,
      Brise,
      Kiwi,
      Raid,
      OFF!,
      Kabikiller,
      Pledge,
      Scrubbing
      Bubbles,
      Caldrea,
      Mrs.
      Meyer's
      Clean
      Day,
      Drano,
      Toilet
      Duck,
      Fantastik,
      Autan,
      and
      Saran!
      That #8217;s
      basically
      every
       #8220;name
      brand #8221;
      cleaning
      supply
      found
      in
      every
      American
      household!
       #8220;Well
      yeah,
      but
      the
      company
      is
      owned
      by
      Fisk
      Johnson!
      The
      fifth
      generation
      to
      own
      it! #8221;
      You
      say?
       #8220;Who
      gives
      a
      fuck? #8221;
      I
      answer.
      Yeah,
      the
      company
      has
      been
      passed
      from
      father
      to
      son
      for
      5
      generations.
      That
      doesn #8217;t
      mean
      it #8217;s
      a
      family
      company.
      Perhaps
      it
      was
      a
      family
      company
      when
      it
      first
      started
      in
      1886,
      with
      a
      single
      man
      and
      a
      few
      employees
      trying
      to
      make
      something
      for
      themselves.
      But
      today?
      Not
      a
      fucking
      chance.
      A
      family
      company
      would
      be
      the
      local
      arts
      and
      crafts
      store
      that #8217;s
      run
      by
      an
      elderly
      couple
      who
      sits
      behind
      the
      desk
      and
      interacts
      with
      their
      customers
      on
      a
      daily
      basis.
      A
      family
      company
      is
      NOT
      a
      multi
      billion
      dollar,
      multinational
      powerhouse
      enterprise!
      SC
      Johnson
      passing
      from
      father
      to
      son
      doesn #8217;t
      make
      it
      a
      family
      company
      -
      it
      makes
      it
      a
      fucking
      dynasty.
      And
      speaking
      of
      Fisk
      Johnson,
      the
      SCJ
      website
      give
      you
      a
      [whole
      ass
      biography](https://www.scjohnson.com/en/a-family-company/the-johnson-family/fisk-johnson-current-chairman-and-ceo-of-sc-johnson-champions-innovation-and-transparency)
      of
      the
      man!
      They
      give
      you
      7
      paragraphs
      where
      they
      talk
      about
      his
      qualifications,
      accomplishments,
      and
      awards,
      then
      throw
      in
      a
      single
      sentence
      where
      they
      say
       #8220;Fisk
      is
      a
      devoted
      father
      who
      enjoys
      spending
      a
      great
      deal
      of
      time
      with
      his
      daughter. #8221;
      Only
      to
      then
      drop
      the
      subject
      of
      his
      family
      entirely
      and
      let
      you
      know
      that
      he
      has
      hobbies
      such
      as
      SCUBA
      diving
      and
      skiing!
      Woo!
      Yeah,
      he
      really
      seems
      like
      a
      family
      man
      to
      me!
      I
      should
      probably
      add
      that
      the
      website
      also
      has
      the
      words
       #8220;family
      company #8221;
      written
      all
      over
      it.
      And
      I
      mean
      that
      literally
      -
      they
      say
       #8220;family
      company #8221;
      every
      fucking
      chance
      they
      get.
      They
      are
      constantly
      shoving
      those
      words
      down
      the
      throats
      of
      their
      customers
      and
      it #8217;s
      disgusting.
      They #8217;re
      trying
      to
      masquerade
      as
      an
      actual
      family
      company,
      passing
      themselves
      off
      as
       #8220;a
      little
      ol #8217;
      Ma
      and
      Pop
      kind
      of
      place
      that
      could
      really
      use
      your
      help!
      Think
      of
      our
      kids! #8221;
      When
      that #8217;s
      an
      outright
      lie.
      They
      spit
      in
      the
      face
      of
      ACTUAL
      family
      companies
      and
      small
      business
      everywhere!
      They #8217;re
      trying
      to
      gain
      the
      sympathy
      and
      trust
      that
      comes
      with
      real
      family
      companies
      while
      operating
      as
      a
      corporation,
      and
      that
      is
      a
      bold
      faced
      lie!
      In

      No,

      this
      company
      because
      they
      lie
      about
      what

      I #8217;m
      fine
      with
      that,
      but
      only
      on
      the
      condition
      that
      all
      other
      extra
      curricular
      activities
      are
      also
      payed.
      And
      the
      law
      should
      enforce
      that
      level
      of
      equality.
      That
      means
      the
      dancers,
      the
      debate
      team,
      the

      Otherwise,

      in

      while
      other

      would
      suffer
      because
      they #8217;re

      paying

      There #8217;s
      nothing
      wrong
      with
      being
      proud
      of
      your
      heritage.
      I
      take
      pride
      in
      my
      Greek
      roots
      because
      the
      Greeks
      were
      pretty
      cool
      in
      my
      opinion.
      However,
      taking
      pride
      in
      being
      white
      means
      you
      take
      pride
      in
      having
      a
      position
      of
      privilege
      over
      people
      who
      are
      not
      white.
      Meanwhile,
      it #8217;s
      okay
      to
      be
      proud
      of
      being
      black
      because
      of
      two
      reasons.
      1)
      Being
      black
      doesn #8217;t
      inherently
      put
      you
      in
      a
      position
      of
      privilege.
      And
      2)
      When
      white
      men
      brought
      slaves
      across
      the
      Atlantic,
      the
      slaves
      were
      cut
      off
      from
      their
      countries
      of
      origin.
      Therefore,
      many
      black
      people
      cant
      trace
      their
      roots
      back
      to
      a
      specific
      country.
      They
      can #8217;t
      say
       #8220;I #8217;m
      Kenyan #8221;
      or
       #8220;I #8217;m
      Ethiopian. #8221;
      Instead,
      all
      they
      can
      say
      is
       #8220;I #8217;m
      black #8221;
      or
       #8220;I #8217;m
      African. #8221;
      No
      one
      is
      upset
      with
      you
      for
      being
      proud
      or
      interested
      in
      your
      heritage.
      It #8217;s
      fine
      to
      be
      proud
      of
      being
      English,
      Irish,
      Scottish,
      French,
      German,
      Italian,
      or
      whatever.
      But
      again,
      taking
      pride
      in
      being
      WHITE
      means
      you #8217;re
      proud
      that
      you #8217;re
      NOT
      BLACK.
      And
      that #8217;s
      a
      rather
      shitty
      thing
      to
      be
      proud
      of.

      I #8217;m
      a
      guy
      and
      I
      decided
      to
      grow
      my
      hair
      out.
      I
      should
      also
      mention
      that
      pretty
      thin
      and
      don #8217;t
      have
      the
      most
      masculine
      build,
      so
      from
      behind
      it #8217;s
      pretty
      hard
      to
      tell
      what
      I
      am.
      I #8217;ve
      accepted
      that
      fact.
      One
      time
      I
      was
      at
      the
      mall
      with
      my
      girlfriend
      and
      I
      held
      her
      bags
      while
      she
      was
      in
      the
      dressing
      room.
      As
      I
      was
      waiting,
      some
      guy
      came
      over
      and
      draped
      his
      arms
      over
      me.
      I
      reacted
      by
      elbowing
      him
      in
      the
      gut.
      When
      I
      turned
      around,
      all
      the
      color
      drained
      from
      his
      face
      and
      he
      said
       #8220;Shit,
      you #8217;re
      not
      my

      The
      question
      is
      centered
      around
      a
      hungry
      person
      vs
      a
      horny
      person
      though.
      Hunger
      is
      a
      life
      threatening
      condition.
      Being
      horny
      is
      not.
      Therefore,
      a
      hungry
      person
      has
      a
      higher
      claim
      to
      eating
      an
      animal
      than
      a
      horny
      person
      has
      to
      raping
      an
      animal.
      Arguing
      that
      feeling
      hungry
      and
      feeling
      horny
      are
      the
      same
      level
      of
      discomfort
      for
      a
      human
      is
      a
      false
      equivalency.
      It #8217;s
      a

      You #8217;re
      argument
      is
      rooted
      in
      the
      assumption
      that
      self
      preservation
      isn #8217;t
      natural.
      I
      disagree
      with
      that.
      The
      act
      of
      preserving
      one #8217;s
      self
      is
      a
      knee
      jerk
      reaction
      and
      100%
      natural
      -
      that #8217;s
      why
      we
      violently
      pull
      away
      from
      painful
      stimuli
      like
      a
      hot
      stove.
      It
      takes
      a
      great
      deal
      of
      willpower
      to
      override
      that
      natural
      instinct.
      Or,
      it
      takes
      a
      severe
      mental
      illness
      to
      override
      that
      instinct.
      Just
      because
      someone
      claims
      that
      they
      want
      to
      kill
      them
      self
      doesn #8217;t
      mean
      that #8217;s
      necessarily
      true.
      It #8217;s
      more
      accurate
      to
      say
      that
      they
      want
      to
      stop
      being
      in
      pain.
      (Which
      goes
      back
      to
      the
      self
      preservation
      instinct.)
      Therefore,
      a
      person
      who #8217;s
      contemplating
      suicide
      shouldn #8217;t
      just
      do
      so.
      Instead,
      they
      should
      seek
      ways
      to
      overcome
      the
      mental
      illness
      and
      end
      the
      pain
      that
      they #8217;re
      experiencing
      in
      a
      healthy
      way.

      So
      I #8217;ve
      got
      some
      pretty
      deeply
      rooted
      issues.
      Neglectful
      and
      abusive
      parents.
      Brothers
      tried
      to
      kill
      me
      once
      or
      twice.
      Ran
      away
      from
      home
      and
      loved
      on
      the
      streets
      for
      a
      while.
      Blah
      blah
      blah.
      That #8217;s
      all
      behind
      me
      and
      with
      years
      of
      therapy
      and
      self
      help,
      I #8217;ve
      processed
      most
      of
      it.
      But
      the
      one
      bitch
      I
      can #8217;t
      fucking
      stand
      was
      my
      6th
      grade
      computer
      teacher,
      whom
      I #8217;ll
      call
      Coach
      W.
      So
      Coach
      W
      was
      the
      dumbest
      asshat
      I #8217;ve
      ever
      met
      in
      my
      entire
      fucking
      life,
      and
      believe
      me
      when
      I
      say
      I #8217;ve
      met
      some
      dumb
      fucking
      people.
      She
      once
      accused
      the
      entire
      grade
      of
      commuting
      plagiarism
      on
      the
      same
      assignment.
      Just
      in
      case
      I #8217;m
      being
      unclear,
      she
      accused
      EVERY
      6th
      GRADER
      IN
      THE
      SCHOOL
      OF
      THE
      SAME
      CRIME
      ON
      THE
      SAME
      PAPER
      AT
      THE
      SAME
      TIME.
      Because
      she
       #8220;Knows
      how
      6th
      graders
      write,
      and
      that #8217;s
      not
      how! #8221;
      Was
      there
      any
      other
      proof?
      Nope!
      Did
      she
      put
      any
      paper
      in
      a
      plagiarism
      checker?
      Of
      course
      not!
      She
      just
      knew.
      Because
      apparently
      she #8217;s
      an
      all
      knowing
      goddess!
      She
      had
      this
      rule
      where
      you
      had
      to
      be
      logged
      in
      to
      you
      computer
      before
      class
      started.
      Which
      wasn #8217;t
      that
      big
      of
      a
      deal
      at
      first,
      but
      she
      also
      had
      a
      no
      tolerance
      policy
      if
      you
      weren #8217;t.
      And
      so,
      if
      you
      weren #8217;t
      logged
      in
      before
      the
      bell
      rang,
      you
      were
      sent
      to
      the
      principle #8217;s
      office
      for
       #8220;failure
      to
      follow
      basic
      instructions. #8221;
      The
      problem
      is
      that
      6th
      graders
      are
      all
      assholes,
      so
      there
      was
      a
      big
      problem
      with
      the
      kid
      next
      to
      you
      always
      hitting
      escape
      as
      you
      were
      trying
      to
      log
      in,
      resulting
      in
      probably
      about
      3
      or
      4
      students
      being
      sent
      to
      the
      office
      every
      class
      period.
      And
      don #8217;t
      even
      bother
      trying
      to
      explain
      that
      someone
      else
      was
      fucking
      with
      your
      keyboard,
      because
      that
      would
      only
      result
      in
      her
      adding
       #8220;delaying/disrupting
      class #8221;
      to
      your
      list
      of
      crimes.
      She
      was
      also
      exceptionally
      disorganized.
      We
      would
      have
      to
      print
      off
      assignments
      and
      turn
      them
      in,
      she #8217;d
      grade
      them,
      then
      return
      them.
      But,
      she
      wouldn #8217;t
      enter
      them
      into
      the
      grade
      book
      online,
      resulting
      in
      you
      having
      a
      failing
      grade
      in
      the
      class.
      If
      you
      went
      to
      Coach
      W
      about
      this
      problem,
      she
      would
      say,
       #8220;My
      grading
      system
      is
      perfect,
      I
      wouldn #8217;t
      make
      a
      mistake
      like
      that. #8221;
      So
      naturally,
      I
      started
      saving
      all
      my
      graded
      assignments
      to
      show
      her
      when
      she
      said
      that.
      Her
      response?
       #8220;You
      didn #8217;t
      actually
      turn
      that
      in.
      You
      just
      printed
      that
      off
      today
      and
      wrote
      a
      grade
      on
      it. #8221;
      Funny,
      right?
      So
      I
      started
      asking
      her
      to
      sign
      the
      graded
      papers
      as
      well.
      So
      that
      she
      couldn #8217;t
      say
      that
      anymore.
      And
      know
      what
      that
      bitch
      had
      to
      say
      to
      that?
       #8220;You
      forged
      my
      signature!
      How
      dare
      you?
      Go
      to
      the
      office
      right
      now! #8221;
      I
      consider
      myself
      to
      be
      a
      very
      forgiving
      and
      easy
      going
      person.
      But
      holy
      fucking
      shit.
      That
      woman
      was
      the
      bane
      of
      my
      6th
      grade
      existence
      and
      brought
      me
      more
      trouble
      than
      she
      could
      possibly
      fathom
      and
      for
      that
      reason,
      she
      can
      rot
      in
      Hell.
      I
      could
      go
      into
      more
      detail,
      but
      I
      don #8217;t
      really
      feel
      like
      writing
      an
      novel
      right
      now.

      Trolling
      used
      to
      be
      about
      provoking
      someone
      into
      an
      internet
      fight
      or
      causing
      them
      to
      become
      irrationally
      upset.
      These
      days,
      trolls
      have
      lost
      their
      flair.
      There #8217;s
      no
      shock
      factor
      anymore.
      The
      modern
      troll
      simply
      finds
      whatever
      is
      a
      hot
      topic
      and
      then
      posts
      the
      inverse
      opinion
      (in

      forum
      that
      isn #8217;t

      We #8217;ve

      before.

      If
      sex
      is
      painful,
      then
      it #8217;s
      being
      done
      incorrectly.
      The
      most
      important
      part
      is
      proper
      lubrication
      which
      (usually)
      can
      be
      achieved
      with
      a
      good
      amount
      of
      foreplay.
      If
      I
      had
      to
      guess,
      it
      sounds
      like
      that
      step
      was
      skipped
      which
      is
      pretty
      common
      for
      people
      who
      are
      just
      starting
      to
      have
      sex.
      It #8217;s
      a
      necessary
      part
      of
      sex
      if
      you
      and
      your
      partner
      actually
      want
      to
      enjoy
      yourself.

      Your
      post
      is
      an
      oxymoron.
      You
      claim
      that
      ALL
      men
      prefer
      debt-free
      virgins
      without
      tattoos
      -
      even
      going
      so
      far
      as
      to
      say
       #8220;no
      you
      don #8217;t #8221;
      when
      someone
      says
      they
      say
      they
      do
      like
      tattoos
      -
      then
      post
      that
      opinion
      on
      a
      sub
      for
      unpopular
      opinions.
      Therefore,
      you
      don #8217;t
      actually
      believe
      that
      most
      men
      prefer
      that
      kind
      of
      woman.
      If
      you
      did,
      you
      wouldn #8217;t
      consider
      it
      to
      be
      an
      unpopular
      opinion.
      You
      would
      consider
      it
      to
      be
      a
      popular
      opinion.
      By
      that
      logic,
      you #8217;re
      either
      a
      worthless
      and
      kinda
      uncreative
      troll
      or
      a
      dumbass
      who
      doesn #8217;t
      understand
      the
      definition
      of
      the
      word
       #8220;unpopular. #8221;
      Oh,
      and
      in
      reference
      to
      your
       #8220;Wouldn #8217;t
      you
      prefer
      a
      girl
      with
      no
      tattoos
      to
      get
      the
      tattoos
      you
      like? #8221;
      question
      -
      the
      answer
      is
      no.
      Human
      beings
      are
      not
      a
      canvas
      for
      you
      to
      mark
      on
      with
      your
      preferences.
      Mentally
      healthy
      men
      don #8217;t
      want
      a
      placid
      doll
      who
      will
      do
      whatever
      they
      say
      (such
      as
      permanently
      ink
      their
      bodies
      with
      your
      ideas)
      without
      any
      thought.
      That #8217;s
      not
      a
      partner,
      that #8217;s
      a
      mindless
      slave.
      And
      I
      much
      prefer
      a
      partner
      in
      life.
      Those
      that
      do
      want
      a
      mindless
      slave
      have
      deeply
      rooted
      psychological
      issues
      that
      should
      really
      be
      addressed
      as
      soon
      as
      possible.
      So
      if
      you
      actually
      believe
      what
      you #8217;re
      posting,
      you
      should
      probably
      find
      a
      therapist.

      I #8217;m
      not
      actually
      a
      chef,
      but
      a
      waiter
      and
      this
      is
      the
      only
      time
      I #8217;ve
      ever
      told
      a
      customer
      that
      they #8217;re
      wrong.
      She
      ordered
      boneless
      wings
      that
      she
      wanted
      with
       #8220;Not
      spicy
      BBQ
      sauce!
      Make
      sure
      they
      ain #8217;t
      spicy!
      I
      can #8217;t
      do
      no
      spicy! #8221;
      The
      flavors
      we
      had
      available,
      in
      order
      from
      least
      spicy
      to
      most
      spicy,
      were
      these:
      Honey
      BBQ,
      Jack
      Daniels
      BBQ,
      Garlic
      Parmesan,
      and
      Frank #8217;s
      Red
      Hot
      Buffalo
      Sauce.
      I
      should
      add
      that
       #8220;Franks
      Red
      Hot
      Buffalo
      Sauce #8221;
      is
      the
      brand
      name
      of
      the
      sauce
      we
      used.
      It
      said
      those
      exact
      words
      on
      the
      menu.
      With
      that
      in
      mind,
      I
      got
      her
      the
      Honey
      BBQ
      wings.
      When
      they
      came
      out,
      she
      complained
      they
      they
      were
      wrong
      and
      she
      wanted
      buffalo
      sauce.
      At
      which
      point,
      I
      apologized
      and
      said
       #8220;I #8217;m
      so
      sorry,
      I
      thought
      you
      wanted
      non-spicy
      wings #8221;
      She
      responded
      by
      saying
       #8220;I
      did. #8221;
       #8220;Uh...
      well
      ma #8217;am,
      the
      buffalo
      wings
      are
      the
      spiciest
      wings
      we
      have
      here.
      The
      Honey
      BBQ
      is
      the
      not
      spicy
      flavor. #8221;
       #8220;You
      don #8217;t
      have
      a
      damn
      unspicy
      buffalo
      sauce? #8221;
       #8220;No
      ma #8217;am.
      The
      buffalo
      sauce
      is
      the
      spicy
      flavor.
      If
      you #8217;d
      like,
      I
      can
      take
      these
      back
      and
      get
      you
      buffalo
      wings?
      They
      will
      be
      a
      bit
      more
      spicy
      though. #8221;
       #8220;I
      don #8217;t
      want
      spicy

      I

      buffalo
      wings! #8221;

      sauce
      we
      use
      for

      wings
      is
      called
      Frank #8217;s
      Red
      Hot
      Buffalo
      sauce.
      If
      you
      get
      the
      buffalo
      wings,
      they
      will
      be
      more
      spicy
      than
      the
      honey
      BBQ
      wings.
      This
      is
      our
      mildest
      flavor.
      I
      will
      bring
      you
      whichever
      you
      like,
      but
      one
      will
      be

      That
      distance
      wouldn #8217;t
      really
      have
      much
      of
      an
      impact.
      Contrary
      to
      popular
      belief,
      the
      distance
      of
      the

      the

      doesn #8217;t

      too
      much
      -
      presently
      at

      Instead,
      it #8217;s

      at

      the

      I
      once
      got
      super
      drunk
      and
      walked
      up
      to
      my
      roommate,
      placed
      my
      hand
      on
      his
      shoulder,
      and
      said
       #8220;Hey
      man.
      I
      like
      that
      new
      girl
      you #8217;ve
      been
      talking
      to
      lately.
      But
      I
      think
      that
      you #8217;re
      going
      to
      talk
      for
      about
      two
      months,
      she #8217;s
      going
      to
      start
      hanging
      out
      with
      us
      a
      lot,
      you #8217;re
      going
      to
      fuck
      once
      or
      twice,
      and
      then
      she #8217;ll
      disappear
      and
      we #8217;ll
      never
      see
      her
      again.
      And
      then,
      I
      think
      you #8217;re
      going
      to
      say
       #8216;Oh,
      she
      just
      started
      getting
      busy #8217;
      or
       #8216;It
      just
      kinda
      fizzled
      out #8217;
      but
      secretly,
      we #8217;ll
      all
      know
      the
      truth. #8221;
      There
      were
      6
      other
      people
      sitting
      in
      the
      room
      with
      us
      and
      I
      was
      far
      from
      quiet.

      My
      school
      was
      pretty
      small,
      so
      we
      would
      combine
      the
      elementary,
      middle,
      and
      high
      school
      talent
      shows
      into
      one
      night
      so
      that
      it
      wasn #8217;t
      just
      a
      15
      minute
      show.
      Each
      school
      competing
      separately,
      of
      course.
      I
      once
      saw
      a
      kid
      do
      some
      dope
      ass
      magic.
      Not
      just
      simple
      card
      tricks,
      but
      actually
      disappearing,
      reappearing
      elsewhere,
      making
      live
      animals
      appear,
      passing
      through
      solid
      objects,
      etc.
      The
      kid
      was
      in
      the
      4th
      or
      5th
      grade
      and
      needless
      to
      say,
      he
      won
      for
      the
      elementary
      school.

      You

      so
      much
      more
      than
      just
      your
      physical
      body.
      If
      someone
      can #8217;t
      accept
      that
      fact,
      then
      they
      aren #8217;t
      worth
      your
      time.
      I
      know
      that
      it
      must
      be
      tough
      right
      now,
      but
      think
      of
      it
      like
      this
      -
      the
      people
      who
      don #8217;t
      want
      you
      because
      of
      a
      disability
      are
      the
      one #8217;s
      who
      are
      really
      worthless.
      They #8217;re
      doing
      you
      a
      favor
      by
      not
      being
      a
      part
      of
      your
      life
      and
      wasting
      your
      time.
      I
      wish
      that
      you
      didn #8217;t
      have
      to
      go
      through
      these
      kinds
      of
      things
      and
      that
      you
      never
      had
      to
      feel
      unwanted
      in
      any
      way.
      No
      one
      should
      have
      to
      go
      through
      that.
      But
      the
      people
      that
      make
      you
      feel
      that
      way
      are
      trash.
      And
      trash
      is
      something
      to
      get
      rid
      of.

      Your
      logic
      is
      flawed
      because
      you
      say
      that
      the
      poor
      shouldn #8217;t
      have
      kids.
      My
      argument
      is
      that
      there
      shouldn #8217;t
      be
      a
       #8220;poor
      class. #8221;
      Rather
      than
      tell
      people
      that
      they #8217;re
      incapable
      of
      being
      parents
      because
      of
      their
      money,
      we
      should
      instate
      programs
      to
      assist
      those
      in
      poverty
      to
      better
      raise
      their
      kids
      and
      also
      climb
      out
      of
      poverty.
      I
      want
      to
      help
      the
      poor.
      You
      want
      to
      punish
      them.
      Therefore,
      you #8217;re
      a
      classist
      piece
      of
      shit.

      I #8217;m
      not
      here
      to
      discuss
      how
      much
      I #8217;ve
      donated
      or
      helped
      the
      poor.
      And
      I #8217;m
      sure
      as
      hell
      not
      about
      to
      post
      my
      volunteer
      hours
      or
      give
      you
      a
      list
      of
      low
      budget
      housing
      I #8217;ve
      helped
      build.
      What
      I #8217;m
      saying
      is
      that
      you #8217;re
      literally
      advocating
      for
      you
      to
      control
      a
      person #8217;s
      reproductive
      system
      based
      on
      their
      income.
      You
      think
      that
      because
      they
      don #8217;t
      have
      a
      certain
      amount
      of
      money,
      they
      should
      not
      have
      certain
      rights.
      That
      is
      the
      definition
      of
      elite
      classism.
      You
      are
      a
      classist.

      I
      do
      have
      several
      issues
      with
      most
      of
      the
      points
      that
      you
      made
      here,
      so
      I #8217;m
      just
      going
      to
      kinda
      go
      right
      down
      the
      line
      in
      the
      same
      order
      that
      you
      made
      arguments.
      First
      off,
      you
      claim
       #8220;Women
      are
      more
      compassionate.
      They
      are
      better
      at
      sending
      other
      people #8217;s
      feelings
      and
      for
      caring
      for
      children
      and
      family.
      .....
      Women
      are
      better
      team
      players
      and
      better
      at
      working
      together
      than
      men
      are. #8221;
      This
      argument
      is
      flawed
      because
      every
      aspect
      of
      what #8217;s
      said
      is
      a
      direct
      result
      of
      the
      culture
      that
      a
      person
      grows
      up
      in.
      Women
      aren #8217;t
      INHERENTLY
      more
      compassionate,
      they #8217;re
      taught
      to
      be
      more
      in
      touch
      with
      their
      emotions
      while
      men
      are
      taught
      to
      repress
      their
      emotions.
      This
      doesn #8217;t
      mean
      that
      one
      has
      more
      capacity
      to
      be
      kind
      or
      team
      oriented
      than
      the
      other,
      it
      means
      that
      one
      has
      been
      taught
      to
      avoid
      doing
      so
      because
      it #8217;s
      a
       #8220;sign
      of
      weakness. #8221;
      Next,
      you
      claim
      that
       #8220;Men
      are
      physically
      stronger
      and
      tougher.
      This
      allows
      them
      to
      better
      protect
      his
      wife
      and
      family
      and
      help
      provide
      for
      his
      family. #8221;
      While
      I
      will
      admit
      to
      there
      being
      physical
      differences
      between
      the
      male
      and
      female
      body,
      as
      that #8217;s
      an
      outright
      fact,
      I
      will
      also
      point
      out
      that
      this
      model
      of
      thinking
      is
      painfully
      outdated.
      Protect
      his
      family
      from
      what,
      exactly?
      We
      don #8217;t
      live
      in
      a
      world
      where
      wolves
      sneak
      into
      our
      campsite
      at
      night
      to
      eat
      our
      children.
      And
      it #8217;s
      rather
      unlikely
      that
      a
      neighboring
      warlord
      will
      try
      to
      conquer
      our
      lands
      -
      which
      the
      national
      military
      would
      handle,
      might
      I
      add.
      And
       #8220;provide
      for #8221;
      no
      longer
      means
       #8220;go
      hunt
      down
      food. #8221;
      It
      now
      means
       #8220;work
      a
      job
      that
      makes
      enough
      money
      to
      provide
      for
      you
      family. #8221;
      Which
      either
      sex
      is
      perfectly
      suited
      for.
      Finally,
      you
      argue
      that
       #8220;Studies
      continue
      to
      show
      differences
      in
      the
      way
      our
      brains
      work. #8221;
      And
      that #8217;s
      just...
      wrong.
      It #8217;s
      factually
      incorrect
      and
      has
      been
      proven
      incorrect
      many
      times
      over.
      You
      claim
      to
      have
      read
      an
      article,
      which
      is
      fine.
      But
      was
      it
      from
      a
      peer
      reviewed
      journal
      of
      science?
      Or
      was
      it
      something
      that
      you
      saw
      on
      Facebook?
      [This
      article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00677-x)
      by
      Nature.com
      specifically
      talks
      about
      how
      the
      search
      for
      a
      difference
      between
      male
      and
      female
      brains
      is
      known
      as
       #8220;neurosexism. #8221;
      And
      how
      it #8217;s
      very
      harmful
      because
      neurosexism
      promotes
      false
      information
      as
       #8220;facts, #8221;
      things
      like
      the
      idea
      that
       #8220;women
      aren #8217;t
      capable
      of
      doing
      math
      and
      science
      as
      well
      as
      men, #8221;
      or
      ideas
      such
      as
       #8220;women
      think
      with
      emotion
      instead
      of
      reason. #8221;
      Both
      of
      those
      are
      FALSE,
      yet
      both
      have
      been
      presented
      as
      factual
      due
      to
      neurosexism.
      The
      article
      even
      goes
      on
      to
      say
       #8220;Modern
      neuroscientists
      have
      identified
      no
      decisive,
      category-defining
      differences
      between
      the
      brains
      of
      men
      and
      women. #8221;
      And
      outright
      disproves
      the
      notion.

       #8220;Compassionate #8221;
      means
       #8220;feeling
      or
      showing
      concern
      or
      sympathy
      for

      a
      good
      trait
      for
      a
      mother
      to
      have,
      the
      fact
      that
      a
      woman
      carries
      the
      child
      has
      NOTHING
      to
      do
      with
      it.
      Plus,
      you

      NO

      I #8217;d
      be

      happy
      to
      investigate.

      TL;DR
      -
      OP
      not
      only
      doesn #8217;t
      consider
      the
      actual
      facts
      of
      homelessness
      or
      examine
      the
      problem
      from
      an
      intellectual
      standpoint.
      Also
      the
      right
      to
      housing
      is
      a
      LITERAL
      HUMAN
      RIGHT,
      so
      OP
      is
      honestly
      just
      wrong.
      So
      allow
      me
      to
      ask
      you
      a
      question.
      When
      you
      see
      a
       #8220;bum #8221;
      like
      that,
      and
      immediately
      associate
      them
      with
      drugs,
      laziness,
      and
      other
      things
      such
      as
      that,
      would
      you
      hire
      that
      individual
      to
      be
      your
      employee?
      No?
      You
      mean
      that
      you
      don #8217;t
      want
      a
      lazy,
      criminal,
      drug
      addict
      working
      for
      you?
      CRAAAAZZZYYY!
      So
      now,
      if
      everyone
      assumes
      that
      about
      all
      homeless
      people,
      how
      do
      you
      expect
      them
      to
      actually
      start
      contributing
      to
      society
      through
      work?
      They
      can #8217;t
      because
      no
      one
      will
      actually
      hire
      those
      individuals.
      Next,
      let #8217;s
      look
      at
      the
      actual
      statistical
      facts.
      According
      to
      a
      study
      done
      by
      the
      US
      Department
      of
      Housing
      and
      Urban
      Development
      Which
      can
      be
      found
      [here](https://www.bbrfoundation.org/blog/homelessness-and-mental-illness-challenge-our-society),
      25%
      of
      the
      homeless
      population
      suffers
      from
      a
      serious
      mental
      illness.
      45%
      have
      any
      mental
      illness.
      This
      comes
      at
      a
      MASSIVE
      contrast
      to
      the
      rest
      of
      the
      US
      population
      which
      only
      has
      4.2%
      of
      adults
      with
      a
      serious
      mental
      illness.
      Just
      to
      make
      sure
      that
      we
      all
      know
      what
      I
      mean
      when
      I
      say
       #8220;mental
      illness, #8221;
      I #8217;m
      using
      the
      definitions
      provided
      by
      [the
      National
      Institute

      Any
      Mental
      Illness
      (AMI)
      is
      defined
      as
       #8220;mental,
      behavioral,
      or
      emotional
      disorder.
      AMI
      can
      vary
      in
      impact,
      ranging
      from
      no
      impairment
      to
      mild,
      moderate,
      and
      even
      severe
      impairment
      (e.g.,
      individuals
      with

      Serious
      Mental
      Illness
      (SMI)
      is
      defined
      as
      a
      mental,
      behavioral,
      or
      emotional
      disorder
      resulting
      in
      serious
      functional
      impairment,
      which
      substantially
      interferes
      with
      or
      limits
      one
      or
      more
      major
      life
      activities.
      The
      burden
      of
      mental
      illnesses
      is
      particularly
      concentrated
      among
      those
      who
      experience
      disability
      due
      to
      SMI.
      That
      means
      that
      a
      good
      portion
      of
      the
      homeless
      population
      that
      you
      condemned
      as
      useless
      bums
      literally
      cannot
      function
      in
      society
      without
      help.
      Let #8217;s
      also
      not
      forget
      that
      a
      good
      portion
      of
      the
      homeless
      population
      is
      made
      up
      of
      veterans
      who
      served
      in
      the
      US
      military.
      I
      can #8217;t
      find
      a
      good
      source
      that
      give
      me
      exact
      percentages,
      but
      according
      to
      [this
      source](https://endhomelessness.org/resource/veteran-homelessness/)
      there
      are
      almost
      39,500
      homeless
      vets
      on
      the
      street
      today,
      people
      who
      DID
      contribute
      to
      their
      society
      and
      made
      the
      ultimate
      sacrifice,
      only
      to
      come
      back
      to
      people
      like
      you
      saying
      they
      don #8217;t
      deserve
      sympathy.
      In
      conclusion,
      your
      arguments
      are
      factually
      flawed
      and
      grossly
      insensitive
      at
      a
      basic
      human
      compassion
      level.
      Don #8217;t
      think
      of
      these
      people
      as
       #8220;bums
      who
      got
      there
      by
      their
      own
      choice. #8221;
      Because
      most
      of
      them
      aren #8217;t.
      Think
      of
      them
      as
      people
      who
      are
      struggling
      to
      live
      their
      lives.
      Either
      help
      or
      get
      out
      of
      the
      fucking
      way
      of
      people
      who
      are
      trying
      to
      help
      the
      HOMELESS
      population.
      Oh,
      and
      according
      to
      the
      [United
      Nations
      Human
      Rights
      Council](https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/)
      housing
      is
      a
      HUMAN
      RIGHT,
      as
      per
      article
      25.
      So
      your
      argument
      otherwise
      is
      a
      literal
      crime
      against
      humanity.

      Okay,
      fuck
      everything
      else
      I
      said
      about
      mental
      illness
      and
      war
      vets,
      right?
      None
      of
      that #8217;s
      important
      enough
      for
      you
      to
      even
      acknowledge,
      right?
      And
      once
      again,
      you #8217;re
      wrong.
      The
      Universal
      Declaration
      of
      Human
      Rights,
      which
      was
      adopted
      by
      the
      UN
      General
      Assembly
      on
      December
      10th,
      1948.
      And
      hey,
      fun
      fact!
      The
      United
      States
      IS
      a
      member
      of
      the
      UN
      General
      Assembly!
      So
      quite
      frankly,
      I
      don #8217;t
      care
      about
      your
      opinions
      on
      the
      UN
      and
      their
      influence
      on
      American
      politics.
      Factually,
      the
      US
      is
      a
      member
      of
      the
      UN
      and
      therefore
      bound
      to
      its
      rules.
      So
      I #8217;m
      going
      to
      borrow
      a
      phrase
      from
      our
      friends
      in
      the
      far
      right
      for
      a
      moment
      -
      Facts
      don #8217;t
      care
      about
      your
      feelings.

      It #8217;s
      pretty
      cool
      that
      the
      US
      can
      veto
      the
      UN.
      And
      you #8217;re
      right!
      But
      we
      didn #8217;t.
      We
      agreed
      with
      them.
      Meaning
      that
      the
      United
      States
      of
      America
      formally
      recognizes
      the
      right
      to
      housing
      as
      a
      fundamental
      human
      right.
      And
      I #8217;m
      not
      saying
      that
      free
      handouts
      are
      the
      answer.
      I #8217;m
      saying
      not
      to
      be
      a
      dick
      about
      or
      towards
      the
      homeless
      population
      because
      that
      is
      VASTLY
      unfair
      to
      them.
      Oh,
      and
      if
      you
      just
      want
      to
      institutionalize
      all
      the
      mentally
      ill,
      then
      that #8217;s
      a
      whole
      other
      discussion.
      There #8217;s
      disgusting
      abuse
      and
      gross
      dehumanization
      that
      took
      place
      in
      asylums
      which
      is
      why
      they #8217;re
      outdated
      and
      no
      longer
      used.
      Mental
      institutions
      on
      the
      other
      hand
      are
      painfully
      overcrowded.
      You
      can #8217;t
      just
      propose
      a
      simple
      solution
      to
      a
      problem
      so
      complex.

       #8220;SCIENCE

      I #8217;m
      sorry,
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      you
      know
      how
      science
      works.
      And
      I #8217;m
      going
      to
      need
      at
      least
      one
      published,
      peer
      reviewed
      source
      of
      information
      before
      you
      make
      that
      claim.
      And
       #8220;Why
      you
      gotta
      f
      so
      many
      people? #8221;
      Idk
      man,
      maybe
      because
      fucking
      feels
      good?
      It #8217;s
      a
      natural
      human
      process
      that
      is
      specifically
      designed
      to
      bring
      pleasure
      to
      the
      body.
      Why
      do
      you
      have
      to
      assign
      sexist
      motivations
      to
      something
      so
      basic?
      Ya
      dumbass
      bitch.
      And
      lastly
       #8220;more
      than
      5
      men
      that
      can
      sit
      around
      and
      say
      he
      has
      been
      with
      my
      woman? #8221;
      YOU
      DON #8217;T
      OWN

      She
      isn #8217;t
      ever
      YOUR
      woman,
      she
      is
      her
      own
      person.
      It #8217;s
      disgusting
      that
      you
      don #8217;t
      even
      recognize
      her
      as
      that.
      You #8217;re
      opinions
      aren #8217;t
      just
      unpopular,
      they #8217;re
      trashy,
      sexist,
      unintelligent,

      outdated.

      I
      fundamentally
      disagree.
      The
      separation
      of
      people
      into
      various
      classes
      is
      already
      prevalent
      enough
      in
      the
      real
      world.
      We
      don #8217;t
      need
      that
      shit
      here,
      too.
      Also,
      the
      best
      way
      for
      an
      uneducated
      person
      to
      become
      more
      educated
      is
      to
      interact
      with
      more
      educated
      people.
      So
      how
      do

      Yeah,
      because
      going
      to
      college
      is
      just
      as
      easy
      as
      finding
      one
      and
      walking
      in.
      For
      someone
      who
      claims
      to
      be
      educated,
      you
      don #8217;t
      seem
      to
      know
      a
      lot
      about
      how
      social
      and
      economic
      class
      work.
      Also,
      receiving
      an
      education
      doesn #8217;t
      mean
      you
      have
      to
      stop
      using
      social
      media.
      There #8217;s
      no
      reason
      to
       #8220;get
      off
      Reddit #8221;
      to
      go
      to
      college.
      Not
      to
      mention
      that
      what
      you #8217;re
      proposing
      would
      only
      result
      in
      an
      echo
      chamber
      of
      negative
      opinions.
      If
      you
      want
      to
      combat
      sexism
      and
      racism
      -
      such
      as
      how
      your
      original
      post
      indicated
      -
      then
      you
      will
      have
      to
      interact
      with
      racist
      and
      sexist
      people.

      [Wrong.](https://www.credible.com/blog/statistics/average-cost-of-college/)
      For
      someone
      who
      claims
      to
      be
      educated,
      you #8217;re
      kind
      of
      a
      dumbass.
      College
      costs
      money
      and
      time.
      Not
      everyone
      can
      spend
      that
      kind
      of
      money.
      Not
      everyone
      can
      dedicate
      that
      kind
      of
      time.
      If
      they
      try
      to
      get
      the
      money,
      they
      enter
      crippling
      debt.
      If
      they
      dedicate
      the
      time,
      it
      takes
      away
      from
      their
      current
      paycheck
      -
      the
      thing
      that
      allows
      them
      to
      provide
      food
      and
      shelter
      for
      themselves.
      Your
      thoughts
      aren #8217;t
      just
      illogical,
      but
      they
      also
      have
      no
      substance
      to
      them.
      You
      don #8217;t
      know
      how
      facts
      work
      and
      that #8217;s
      becoming
      more
      obvious
      every
      time
      you
      post.

      You
      are
      not
      a
      source
      dumbass.
      By
      that
      logic,
      the
      sky
      is
      red
      and
      reddit
      is
      just
      a
      figment
      of
      your
      imagination.
      Source:
      me.
      Give
      me
      a
      REAL
      source
      to
      validate
      what
      you #8217;re
      saying.
      Otherwise,
      you
      and
      everything
      you #8217;ve
      said
      are
      useless.
      It #8217;s
      kinda
      funny,
      though.
      Based
      on
      this
      conversation,
      if
      your
      idea
      were
      to
      actually
      go
      through,
      you
      would
      find
      yourself
      in
      the
      uneducated
      part
      of
      the
      internet.
      And
      a
      better
      way
      to
      spend
      your
      time
      would
      be
      working.
      In
      order
      to
      provide
      for
      yourself
      and
      your
      family.
      Which
      many
      people
      do
      every
      single
      day.
      As
      a
      result,
      there
      are
      literally
      not
      enough
      hours
      in
      the
      day
      for
      them
      to
      dedicate
      to
      their
      education.
      Edit:
      I
      should
      also
      add
      that
      you #8217;ve
      not
      actually
      made
      any
      new
      arguments
      or
      addressed
      any
      of
      my
      arguments
      so
      far.
      All
      you #8217;ve
      done
      is
      make
      unintelligent
      comments
      such
      as
       #8220;Go

      I
      never
      claimed
      that
      ONLY
      the
      rich
      could
      attend
      college.
      But
      YOU
      claimed
      that
      the
      poor
      flock
      to
      college
      in
      the
      MILLIONS.
      That
      claim
      requires
      evidence.
      My
      evidence
      clearly
      defines
      the
      cost
      of
      a
      four
      year
      program,
      demonstrating
      that
      it
      isn #8217;t
      as
      easy
      as
       #8220;just
      going
      to
      college #8221;
      as
      you
      said.
      I
      swear,
      it #8217;s
      like
      you
      don #8217;t
      even
      know
      what
      arguments
      you #8217;re
      making.
      Either
      that,
      or
      you #8217;ve
      looked
      at
      the
      evidence
      I
      presented,
      realized
      that
      you
      were
      wrong,
      and
      are
      now
      intentionally
      twisting
      your
      arguments
      to
      try
      and
      save
      face.
      I
      wonder
      which
      it
      is?
      Oh,
      and
      even
      if
      my
      one
      article
      proves
      nothing,
      it #8217;s
      a
      hell
      of
      a
      lot
      more
      proof
      than
      you #8217;ve
      presented
      so
      far.
      So
      once
      more
      I
      will
      ask-
      Got
      any
      sources
      to

      If
      you
      really
      did
      attend
      college,
      then
      I #8217;m
      sure
      that
      they
      stressed
      the
      importance
      of
      citing
      your
      sources.
      I #8217;m
      easy,
      dude.
      I
      don #8217;t
      even
      require
      MLA
      or
      APA
      formatting.
      Literally
      just
      post
      a
      link
      -
      one
      SINGLE
      link
      -
      to
      a
      source
      that
      claims
      college
      is
      easily
      accessible
      to
      anyone.
      If
      you
      can
      do
      that
      from
      a
      valid
      source,
      then
      I #8217;ll
      accept
      it.
      Until
      that
      time,
      your
      personal
      experiences
      are
      completely
      meaningless.
      Again,
      I
      never
      claimed
      that
      it #8217;s
      impossible
      for
      a
      poor
      man
      to
      go
      to
      college
      and
      I #8217;m
      not
      saying
      that
      your
      friends
      didn #8217;t
      exist.
      What
      I
      AM
      saying
      is
      that
      it #8217;s
      not
      as
      easy
      as
       #8220;just
      going
      to
      college. #8221;
      If
      you
      can #8217;t
      see
      that,
      then
      you #8217;re
      just
      a
      fucking
      dumbass.

      God,
      you #8217;re
      assumptions
      are
      stupid
      and
      I
      found
      them
      amusing
      at
      first.
      But
      I
      think
      it #8217;s
      time
      to
      clear
      up
      a
      few
      things.
      I #8217;m
      currently
      a
      senior
      in
      college
      studying
      political
      science.
      I
      plan
      to
      present
      my
      most
      recent
      research
      paper
      next
      semester
      at
      a
      conference
      and
      have
      it
      published.
      Afterwards,
      I #8217;m
      set
      to
      go
      to
      grad
      school.
      D amp;D
      is
      something
      called
      a
       #8220;hobby. #8221;
      A
       #8220;hobby #8221;
      is
      an
      activity
      that
      one
      does
      in
      their
      leisure
      time
      for
      pleasure.
      It
      occupies
      three
      hours
      of
      my
      time
      on
      Monday
      nights.
      Crrraaaazzzyyy
      right?
      This
      discussion
      has
      nothing
      to
      do
      with
      my
      personal
      life
      and
      hobbies.
      If
      you
      continue
      trying
      to
      attack
      me
      as
      an
      individual,
      then
      you
      will
      cease
      to
      be
      worthy
      of
      engaging
      in
      any
      form
      of
      discussion
      in.
      Just
      so
      I #8217;m
      absolutely
      clear,
      if
      you
      mention
      D amp;D
      again,
      then
      I
      will
      be
      forced
      to
      assume
      that
      you
      don #8217;t
      know
      what
      you #8217;re
      talking
      about
      and
      can #8217;t
      engage
      in
      a
      real
      conversation.
      I
      will
      forever
      consider
      you
      an
      incompetent
      dumbass
      who
      knows
      nothing
      about
      the
      world
      and
      certainly
      knows
      nothing
      about
      evidence.
      It #8217;s
      painfully
      immature.
      Grow
      the
      hell
      up
      and
      address
      my
      fucking
      points
      like
      an
      adult.
      Or
      take
      your
      childish
      bullshit
      elsewhere.
      Now,
      back
      to
      the
      ACTUAL
      discussion,
      yes.
      Some
      financial
      aid
      exists.
      But
      you #8217;re
      assumption
      that
      ANYONE
      can
      go
      to
      college
      is
      bullshit.
      You
      WILL
      need
      a
      source
      to
      back
      up
      that
      claim.
      And
      I
      will
      refuse
      to
      acknowledge
      you
      as
      correct
      until
      you
      do.
      I
      will
      not
      do
      your
      research
      for
      you.
      I
      will
      not
      do
      your
      job
      for
      you.
      I #8217;m
      here
      to
      find
      research
      for
      my
      arguments,
      not
      yours.
      Now:
       #8220;Millions
      of
      poor
      people
      go
      to
      college
      every
      year. #8221;
      -
      Needs
      source
       #8220;Anyone
      can
      go
      to
      college. #8221;
      -
      Needs
      source
      Give
      me
      valid
      evidence
      for
      those
      two
      claims
      and
      I #8217;ll
      kindly
      fuck
      off.
      Unless....
      you
      can #8217;t
      provide
      evidence
      because
      it
      doesn #8217;t
      exist?

      Only
      it #8217;s
      not
      a
      problem
      because
      a
      person
      wearing
      what
      they
      want
      doesn #8217;t
      infringe
      upon
      the
      freedom
      of
      anyone
      else.
      But
      trying
      to
      control
      what
      a
      person
      wears
      takes
      away
      their
      freedom
      of
      choice.
      The
       #8220;problem
      in
      the
      world #8221;
      that
      you #8217;re
      trying
      to
      change
      doesn #8217;t
      exist.
      It #8217;s
      a
      fabricated
      problem
      that
      is
      only
      real
      in
      your
      own
      mind.
      Let
      people
      wear
      what
      they
      want.
      And
      who
      gives
      a
      shit
      about
      the
      beauty
      standard?
      Some
      people
      like
      showing
      off
      their
      bodies.
      Some
      people
      like
      hiding
      their
      bodies.
      My
      point
      is
      that
      you
      should
      have
      NO
      SAY
      over
      what
      another
      person
      does
      or
      does
      not
      wear.
      Control
      your
      own
      clothes
      and
      seek
      out
      what
      you
      find
      beautiful.
      If
      someone
      doesn #8217;t
      meet
      your
      ideas
      of
      beauty,
      move
      on
      and
      ignore

      Bisexual
      here.
      I
      think
      that
      penises
      and
      vaginas
      are
      both
      weird
      and
      kind
      of
      gross,
      honestly.
      But
      I
      still
      enjoy
      the
      sexual
      pleasure
      I
      receive
      from
      them.
      Also,
      being
      attracted
      to
      one
      sex/gender
      doesn #8217;t
      mean
      you
      find
      the
      other
      to
      be
      ugly.
      It
      just
      means
      that
      you
      have
      a
      preference.

      Scientifically
      speaking,
      it #8217;s
      impossible
      to
      become
      addicted
      to
      watching
      TV.
      Addiction
      requires
      a
      chemical
      dependence
      to
      be
      present
      and
      watching
      TV
      doesn #8217;t
      develop
      a
      that
      dependence.
      Therefore,
      a
      person
      can
      still
      get
      the
       #8220;happy

      Tipping
      isn #8217;t
      mandatory
      by
      law,
      but
      by
      social
      norm.
      It #8217;s
      agreed
      upon
      by
      most
      Americans
      that
      if
      you #8217;re
      going
      to
      a
      restaurant,
      you
      should
      tip
      your
      server.
      And
      you
      should
      do
      so
      regardless
      of
      your
      perception
      of
      the
      service
      simply
      because
      you
      don #8217;t
      know
      who #8217;s
      to
      blame
      for
      the
      bad
      service.
      The
      kitchen
      may
      have
      fucked
      yo
      your
      food
      or
      forgotten
      about
      it
      altogether
      causing
      it
      to
      come
      out
      late.
      Two
      other
      servers
      may
      have
      called
      in
      sick
      and
      your
      current
      server
      is
      overwhelmed
      with
      tables
      which
      makes
      it
      more
      difficult
      to
      provide
      proper
      attention.
      These
      are
      circumstances
      that
      you
      have
      no
      way
      of
      knowing.
      So
      don #8217;t
      punish
      your
      server
      by
      threatening
      their
      ability
      to
      pay
      bills
      and
      then
      blame
      it
      on
      a
      corrupt
      system.
      The
      only
      way
      to
      fix
      that
      system
      is
      to
      start
      caring
      about
      other
      people #8217;s
      problems
      and
      ignore
      your
      own
      personal
      greed.

      My
      problem
      isn #8217;t
      with
      your
      conclusion.
      My
      issue
      is
      with
      how
      you
      arrived
      at
      your
      conclusion
      and
      what
      you
      plan
      to
      do
      with
      that
      conclusion.
      First
      and
      foremost,
      you
      use
      a
      fictional
      book
      as
      your
      source
      to
      describe
      all
      human
      nature,
      which
      isn #8217;t
      really
      valid.
      Reason
      through
      those
      things
      and
      arrive
      at
      your
      own
      conclusions.
      Don #8217;t
      take
      a
      fictional
      story
      as
      historical
      fact.
      The
      author
      can #8217;t
      see
      the
      future.
      Second,
      you
      take
      a
      pessimistic,
       #8220;give
      up #8221;
      kind
      of
      stance
      with
      your
      conclusion.
      As
      if
      to
      say
       #8220;We #8217;ll
      never
      reach
      a
      utopia,
      so
      why
      try? #8221;
      And
      that #8217;s
      the
      very
      essence
      of
      a
      dystopia
      -
      living
      in
      a
      society
      where
      you
      have
      no
      hope
      of
      improving
      it.
      I
      don #8217;t
      personally
      believe
      that
      we #8217;ll
      ever
      reach
      a
      utopia,
      but
      we
      should
      always
      strive
      for
      perfection,
      even
      knowing
      that
      we #8217;ll
      never
      reach
      it.
      The
      best
      way
      I
      can
      describe
      it
      is
      with
      Aristotle #8217;s
      explanation
      of
      the
      purpose
      of
      an
      acorn.
      The
      reason
      that
      acorns
      exist
      is
      to
      grow
      into
      the
      strongest
      oak
      tree
      that
      they
      possibly
      can,
      even
      though
      it
      will
      never
      become
      a
       #8220;perfect #8221;
      tree.
      The
      acorn
      doesn #8217;t
      know
      how
      strong
      of
      a
      tree
      it
      will
      become,
      all
      it
      knows
      is
      that
      it
      needs
      to
      grow
      as
      much
      as
      possible.
      Likewise,
      humans
      and
      human
      society
      should
      do
      the
      same.
      We
      know
      that
      we
      will
      never
      reach
      perfection,
      but
      we
      must
      always
      try
      to
      reach
      that
      perfection.

      Your
      conclusions
      are
      predicated
      off
      of
      an
      assumption

      of
      humans
      is
      part

      opening
      the

      vs
      nurture #8221;
      debate.
      I #8217;m

      a
      utopia,
      we
      inevitably
      enter
      a
      dystopia.
      You
      have
      no
      evidence
      to
      support
      this
      because,
      as
      you
      said,
      we #8217;ve
      never
      seen
      a
      utopian
      society
      in
      human
      history.
      That #8217;s
      faulty
      logic.
      You #8217;re
      essentially
      saying
       #8220;We #8217;ve
      never
      gotten
      close
      to
      a
      utopia
      because
      when
      we
      do
      get
      close
      to
      one,
      we
      enter
      a
      dystopia. #8221;
      To
      translate
      that
      statement,
      you #8217;re
      claiming
      that
      we
      have
      NEVER
      gotten
      close
      to
      a
      utopia,
      but
      every
      time
      we
      HAVE
      gotten
      close,
      we
      failed.
      So
      which
      is
      it?
      Have
      we
      never
      gotten
      close?
      Or
      do
      we
      fail
      every
      time
      that
      we
      do
      get
      close?
      Third,
      once
      again,
      I
      agree
      that
      perfection
      is
      an
      impossible
      concept
      to
      achieve.
      But
      that
      doesn #8217;t
      mean
      that
      we
      should
      stop
      trying.
      Humans
      always
      have
      and
      always
      will
      seek
      to
      improve
      their
      own
      lives,
      and
      therefore,
      the
      lives
      of
      those
      around
      them.
      That
      fact
      has
      been
      observed
      throughout
      all
      of
      human
      history.
      And
      if
      this
      shit
      that
      we #8217;re
      currently
      in
      is
      the
      best
      we
      can
      do
      -
      as
      you
      claim
      -
      then
      human
      society
      is
      fucked.
      We
      literally
      have
      people
      in
      the
      streets
      starving
      to
      death.
      Unarmed
      children
      getting
      killed
      by
      police.
      Racial
      and
      sexual
      inequality.
      Poverty.
      War.
      Famine.
      Disease.
      All
      of
      these
      problems
      exist
      here
      and
      now.
      Today.
      They #8217;re
      literally
      happening
      as
      I
      type
      this
      message.
      And
      you
      really
      think
      that
      we
      should
      call
      it
      quits
      here?
      Hell
      no.
      That #8217;s
      unacceptable.
      As
      long
      as
      there #8217;s
      suffering
      in
      this
      world,
      there
      will
      be
      those
      fighting
      to
      make
      things
      better.
      Get
      with
      the
      program
      or
      get
      left
      behind.

       #8220;We've
      reached
      a
      point
      where
      we
      basically
      can't
      grow
      anymore.
      Yeah
      its
      shite,
      but
      its
      as
      good
      as
      it
      gets. #8221;
      Those
      are
      your
      exact
      words.
      Not
      mine.
      You #8217;re
      the
      one
      who
      is
      choosing
      to
      stay
      behind
      while
      the
      rest
      of
      humanity
      moves
      forward.
      That #8217;s
      not
      a
      dystopia,
      that #8217;s
      a
      human
      being
      who
      refuses
      to
      keep
      growing.
      It #8217;s
      a
      person
      who #8217;s
      content
      with
      the
      suffering
      in
      the
      world
      and
      sees
      no
      need
      to
      do
      anything
      about
      it.
      So
      again
      -
      get
      with
      the
      program
      and
      start
      growing
      again
      or
      get
      left
      behind.
      That #8217;s
      not
      dystopia.
      That #8217;s
      just
      how
      life
      works.
      If
      you
      don #8217;t
      move,
      you
      won #8217;t
      keep
      up
      with
      those
      around
      you.

      You #8217;re
      assumption
      is
      based
      on
      the
      idea
      that
      what
      is
      easiest
      must
      be
      natural.
      That #8217;s
      flawed.
      It #8217;s
      easier
      to
      sit
      around
      and
      do
      nothing
      all
      day.
      But
      it #8217;s
      healthier
      to
      get
      up
      and
      exercise.
      It #8217;s
      easier
      to
      leach
      off
      of
      society
      and
      let
      others
      provide
      for
      you.
      But
      it #8217;s
      healthier
      to
      produce
      for
      yourself.
      Just
      because
      marriage
      is
      difficult
      doesn #8217;t
      mean
      that
      it #8217;s
      unnatural.
      It
      simply
      means
      that
      life
      is
      challenging.

      I
      think
      that
      most
      people
      realize
      that.
      But
      when
      someone #8217;s
      hurt
      by
      a
      breakup,
      it #8217;s
      very
      insensitive
      to
      tell
      them
      that
      kind
      of
      thing.
      People
      don #8217;t
      say
       #8220;You #8217;re
      better
      off
      without
      them. #8221;
      Because
      it #8217;s
      always
      true.
      They
      say
      it
      because
      their
      friend
      is
      in
      pain
      and
      they
      want
      to
      help
      them
      feel
      better.

      In
      high

      I
      once
      heard
      a
      rumor

      I
      was
      a
      hardcore
      stud
      dealer.
      Not
      like
      the
      local
      weed
      man
      -
      people
      seriously
      thought
      that
      I
      sold
      straight
      up

      I
      also
      heard
      one
      rumor
      that
      I
      had
      a
      massive
      horse
      cock.
      I
      never
      actually
      stopped
      that
      one,
      though.
      Some
      people
      still
      think
      it.

      Mine
      is
      pretty
      long,
      but
      I #8217;ll
      try
      to
      shorten
      it
      up
      and
      give
      you
      the
      basic
      gist
      of
      things.
      When
      I
      (21
      M)
      was
      about
      3,
      my
      parents
      ended
      up
      getting
      divorced
      which
      wasn #8217;t
      really
      that
      big
      of
      a
      deal.
      What
      did
      stand
      out
      to
      me
      was
      that
      my
      new
      baby
      brother
      was
      born
      later
      that
      year.
      By
      the
      time
      I
      was
      about
      5
      or
      6,
      I
      realized
      that
      my
      father
      had
      cheated
      on
      my
      mother
      with
      the
      woman
      who
      would
      later
      become
      my
      stepmother.
      After
      that,
      I
      went
      from
      being
      an
      only
      child
      to
      having
      two
      older
      step
      brothers
      and
      one
      new
      half
      brother
      in
      a
      very
      short
      amount
      of
      time.
      My
      new
      stepmom
      was
      a
      bit
      of
      a
      bitch
      who
      was
      constantly
      playing
      mind
      games
      and
      just
      outright
      never
      liked
      me.
      One
      thing
      that
      she
      would
      do
      often
      would
      be
      to
      mention
      things
      I #8217;d
      done
      in
      the
      past
      and
      gotten
      in
      trouble
      for
      any
      time
      one
      of
      my
      brothers
      was
      in
      trouble
      for
      anything.
      That
      redirected
      my
      father #8217;s
      anger
      from
      my
      brothers
      to
      me
      and
      I
      would
      end
      up
      getting
       #8220;punished #8221;
      again
      for
      something
      that
      happened
      several
      months
      before.
      Of
      course,
       #8220;punishments #8221;
      made
      no
      logical
      sense
      and
      were
      just
      violent
      displays
      of
      physical
      power
      by
      my
      father.
      Excuses
      to
      beat
      his
      children.
      For
      example,
      I
      was
      once
      beat
      with
      a
      belt
      in
      a
      parking
      lot
      when
      I
      was
      about
      7
      because
      my
      aunt
      hugged
      me
      at
      a
      family
      reunion
      and
       #8220;Men
      don #8217;t
      show
      affection
      like
      that!
      People
      might
      think
      you #8217;re
      a
      little
      faggot! #8221;
      There
      was
      also
      quite
      a
      bit
      of
      neglect.
      My
      brothers
      and
      I
      started
      having
      to
      pay
      for
      our
      own
      school
      lunches
      around
      the
      age
      of
      10
      or
      so,
      which
      meant
      saving
      up
      as
      much
      birthday
      money
      as
      we
      could
      and
      hoping
      we
      could
      make
      it
      last
      all
      year,
      then
      selling
      toys
      and
      working
      wherever
      a
      10
      year
      old
      could
      when
      we
      inevitably
      ran
      out
      of
      money.
      We #8217;d
      often
      go
      without
      things
      like
      soap
      and
      tooth
      paste
      for
      months
      before
      we
      got
      more.
      Either
      one
      of
      those
      could
      have
      been
      fixed
      by
      either
      parent
      getting
      a
      job.
      But
      my
      father
      was
      a
      self
      described
      entrepreneur
      (which
      basically
      meant
      he
      was
      a
      con
      artist)
      and
      my
      stepmother
      was
      his
      secretary
      (which
      basically
      meant
      that
      she
      didn #8217;t
      do
      shit.)
      My
      oldest
      stepbrother
      certainly
      didn #8217;t
      help
      the
      situation.
      Because
      he
      was
      often
      abused
      as
      well,
      he
      would
      turn
      around
      and
      take
      his
      frustrations
      out
      on
      me.
      At
      one
      point,
      he
      tied
      a
      rope
      around
      my
      neck
      and
      tried
      to
      hang
      me
      from
      a
      tree.
      Thankfully,
      he
      wasn #8217;t
      very
      good
      at
      tying
      knots.
      Standing
      up
      to
      him
      didn #8217;t
      do
      much
      because
      he
      was
      a
      good
      four
      years
      older
      than
      me.
      And
      telling
      my
      parents
      didn #8217;t
      do
      anything
      because
      they #8217;d
      simply
      respond
      by
      saying
       #8220;Boys
      will
      be
      boys #8221;
      or
       #8220;You #8217;ve
      got
      to
      learn
      to
      man
      up
      and
      deal
      with
      shit
      yourself. #8221;
      As
      I
      got
      older,
      the
      abuse
      didn #8217;t
      really
      slow
      down
      but
      it
      did
      get
      a
      bit
      more
      psychological
      in
      nature.
      My
      father
      and
      stepmother
      would
      often
      gaslight
      me
      to
      make
      me
      doubt
      my
      own
      sanity.
      They #8217;d
      constantly
      berate
      and
      insult
      my
      interests
      and
      hobbies.
      They
      didn #8217;t
      support
      me
      in
      any
      of
      my
      aspirations,
      no
      matter
      how
      big
      or
      small.
      They
      isolated
      me
      from
      my
      biological
      mom
      and
      constantly
      tried
      to
      convince
      me
      that
      she
      was
      some
      kind
      of
      evil
      bitch.
      They
      made
      their
      financial
      problems
      into
      my
      problem.
      So
      on
      and
      so
      forth,
      and
      the
      physical
      abuse
      continued
      as
      well.
      Eventually,
      when
      I
      was
      about
      16,
      I
      finally
      took
      my
      father #8217;s
       #8220;man
      up #8221;
      mentality
      to
      heart
      and
      when
      he
      came
      at
      me,
      I
      fought
      back
      with
      everything
      I
      had
      and
      beat
      the
      living
      hell
      out
      of
      him.
      After
      that,
      I
      ran
      away
      from
      home
      and
      found
      my
      way
      to
      my
      biological
      mom #8217;s
      place
      where
      I
      got
      the
      appropriate
      kind
      of
      help
      to
      deal
      with
      the
      years
      of
      trauma
      that
      I #8217;d
      suffered
      and
      I #8217;m
      happy
      to
      say
      that
      I #8217;m
      doing
      much
      better
      now
      than
      I
      was
      before.
      I #8217;m
      pretty
      well
      adjusted
      already
      and
      slowly
      getting
      better,
      too.
      So
      there #8217;s
      my
      abridged
      story.

      Cultural
      appropriation
      is
      a
      serious
      problem
      because
      it
      means
      that
      the
      original
      culture
      isn #8217;t
      being
      able
      to
      share
      their
      customs
      themselves.
      Instead,
      another
      culture
      is
      taking
      it
      from
      them
      and
      forcibly
      sharing
      it
      with
      the
      world.
      For
      example,
      let #8217;s
      say
      that
      you
      find
      the
      cure
      for
      cancer
      and
      go
      to
      publish
      your
      research.
      But,
      before
      you
      can
      do
      so,
      one
      of
      your
      assistants
      steals
      the
      research
      and
      publishes
      it
      himself,
      recurves
      millions
      of
      dollars
      in
      research
      grants,
      and
      is
      nominated
      for
      the
      Nobel
      Prize.
      When
      you
      try
      to
      say
      that
      you #8217;re
      the
      actual
      person
      who
      cured
      cancer,
      people
      laugh
      at
      you
      and
      call
      you
      a
      lunatic.
      Obviously,
      this
      is
      what
      most
      people
      would
      call
      a
       #8220;dick
      move. #8221;
      It #8217;s
      the
      same
      with
      culture.
      Why
      is
      it
      that
      when
      a
      white
      person
      wears
      dreads,
      they #8217;re
       #8220;artsy #8221;
      or
       #8220;going
      through
      a
      phase #8221;
      or
       #8220;discovering
      themselves. #8221;
      But
      when
      a
      black
      person
      wears
      dreads,
      they #8217;re
       #8220;nappy
      looking #8221;
      or
       #8220;a
      thug #8221;
      or
       #8220;probably
      a
      drug
      dealer. #8221;
      Another
      example
      is
      how
      if
      a
      white
      guy
      wears
      a
      traditional
      Native
      American
      headdress,
      he #8217;s
      just
      in
      a
      costume.
      But
      when
      an
      actual
      Native
      American
      does,
      he #8217;s
       #8220;dressed
      like
      a
      savage. #8221;
      Or
      worse
      yet
      -
      people
      think
      he #8217;s
      in
      a
      costume
      and
      not
      an
      actual
      article
      of
      clothing
      that
      has
      real
      significance.
      The
      important
      part
      is
      that
      perception
      that
      the
      dominant
      culture
      has
      towards
      minority
      cultures.
      And
      when
      white
      people
      are
      allowed
      to
      do
      things
      that
      other
      people
      aren #8217;t
      BECAUSE
      OF
      THAT
      PERCEPTION,
      that #8217;s
      shitty.
      Even
      more
      so
      if
      the
      thing
      in
      question
      originally
      belonged
      to
      another

      Enforcing
      the
      death
      penalty
      is
      actually
      about
      1.4
      to
      1.5
      times
      more
      expensive
      than
      long
      term
      incarceration
      on
      average.
      [Source](https://ballotpedia.org/Fact_check/Is_the_death_penalty_more_expensive_than_life_in_prison)
      Without
      looking
      into
      the
      moral
      and
      ethical
      debate,
      it #8217;s
      proven
      that
      long
      term
      incarceration
      is
      more
      cost
      effective,
      with
      the
      exception
      of
      South
      Dakota
      -
      the
      only
      state
      that
      doesn #8217;t
      house
       #8220;death
      row #8221;
      inmates
      separately
      from
      other
      inmates.
      Therefore,
      the
      argument
      that
      it #8217;s
      bad
      for
      these
      people
      to
       #8220;live
      on
      the
      taxpayer #8217;s
      dime #8221;
      falls
      apart
      because
      it #8217;s
      more
      expensive
      for
      them
      to
      die
      on
      the
      taxpayer #8217;s
      dime.

      a

      about
      the

      argument.
      But
      it
      costs
      more
      money
      to
      House
      death

      And

      it

      to

      I
      think
      with

      at
      tackling
      the
      issue
      of
      race

      it
      explained
      it
      in

      made

      If
      you
      really
      can #8217;t
      see
      the
      obvious
      racial
      overtones
      in
      that
      movie,
      then
      you
      really
      shouldn #8217;t
      be
      contributing
      to
      this
      conversation.
      In
      the
      movie,
      predator
      and
      prey
      animals
      had
      lived
      together
      in
      peace
      for
      several
      years.
      The
      threat
      of
      predators
      losing
      control
      was
      artificially
      created
      by
      a
      disgruntled
      prey
      animal.
      In
      that
      canon,
      there
      was
      no
      reason
      for
      there
      to
      be
      a
      fear
      of
      predators.
      As
      for
      the
      racism,
      there #8217;s
      literally
      a
      scene
      where
      one
      character
      yells
       #8220;Go
      back
      to
      the
      jungle! #8221;
      to
      a
      lion
      to
      which
      the
      lion
      says
       #8220;I #8217;m
      from
      the
      savanna. #8221;
      Kinda
      how
      many
      racist
      Americans
      will
      shout
       #8220;Go
      back
      to
      Africa/Mexico/China/etc. #8221;
      The
      movie
      wasn #8217;t
      subtle
      at
      all.
      In
      any
      way,
      shape,
      or
      form.
      It
      was
      super
      obvious.

      kinda
      reacted
      by
      saying
       #8220;Okay,
      cool. #8221;
      And
      then
      just
      moving
      on,
      but
      I
      was
      still
      pretty
      upset.
      That
      was
      my
      information
      to
      share.

      Yeah,
      the
      Catholic
      Church
      tried
      that
      a
      while
      back
      and
      it
      didn #8217;t
      go
      well.
      Then,
      Nazi
      Germany
      tried.
      Soviet
      Russia
      tried.
      Restricting
      things
      like
      what
      information
      can
      be
      spread
      is
      HIGHLY
      problematic.
      Not
      to
      mention
      that
      a
      law
      like
      that
      would
      specifically
      target
      uneducated
      individuals,
      which
      is
      inherently
      classist
      and
      elitist.
      You
      have
      to
      either
      have
      free
      speech,
      or
      no
      free
      speech.
      If
      you
      don #8217;t
      have
      free
      speech,
      then
      you
      risk
      losing
      it
      all.
      That
      being
      said,
      it #8217;s
      perfectly
      fine
      to
      publicly
      shame
      shitty
      opinions
      in
      a
      non-legal
      way.
      But
      making
      misinformation
      illegal?
      That #8217;s
      unacceptable.

      The
      Greek
      word
      for
      the
      host-guest
      relationship
      is
       #8220;xenia. #8221;
      It
      was
      widely
      known
      through
      all
      of
      the
      Mediterranean
      world
      and
      most
      cultures
      had
      some
      form
      of
      it.
      In
      almost
      every
      story
      involving
      the
      relationship,
      the
      offenders
      are
      struck
      with
      blindness
      followed
      by
      death,
      which
      is
      USUALLY
      enforced
      by
      the
       #8220;father
      god #8221;
      of
      that
      culture
      -
      which
      is
      exactly
      what
      happens
      to
      the
      men
      in
      the
      story
      of
      Sodom
      and
      Gomorrah.
      Another
      prime
      example
      of
      this
      is
      the
      story
      of
      Odysseus
      and
      the
      cyclops
      Polyphemus.
      In
      it,
      Odysseus
      assumes
      the
      role
      of
      guest
      in
      Polyphemus #8217;
      home
      (which
      was
      perfectly
      acceptable
      and
      not
      uncommon
      in
      that
      time)
      only
      to
      have
      Polyphemus
      violate
      the
      hospitality
      by
      killing
      one
      of
      Odysseus #8217;
      men
      and
      threatening
      to
      eat
      the
      rest.
      Odysseus
      retaliates
      by
      stabbing
      the
      cyclops
      in
      the
      eye
      and
      later
      killing
      him.
      This
      completely
      aligns
      with
      the
      rules
      of
      xenia
      -
      there #8217;s
      a
      violation,
      then
      blindness,
      and
      finally
      death.
      The
      same
      thing
      happens
      in
      both
      the
      story
      of
      Sodom
      and
      Gomorrah
      as
      well
      as
      Odysseus
      and
      Polyphemus.

      I #8217;m

      I

      no.
      But
      then
      in

      we
      had

      day #8221;
      and
      six
      kids
      really
      did
      ride
      their
      horses
      to
      school.

      Scientifically
      speaking,
      the
      human
      brain
      isn #8217;t
      fully
      developed
      until
      about
      23-25
      which
      directly
      results
      in
      people
      before
      that
      age
      not
      being
      able
      to
      have
      the
      same
      foresight.
      Yes,
      teens
      can
      be
      smart.
      But
      they
      often
      struggle
      to
      conceptualize
      the
      long
      term
      impacts
      of
      their
      decisions.
      Speaking
      from
      a
      non-scientific
      point
      of
      view,
      teens
      are
      fucking
      stupid.
      I
      was
      stupid
      as
      a
      teen.
      I #8217;m
      21
      now
      and
      I #8217;m
      still
      fucking
      stupid.
      I
      don #8217;t
      trust
      myself
      to
      do
      shit.
      Why
      would
      I
      trust
      a
      13
      year
      old
      brat
      to
      do
      any
      better?
      Holy
      shit,
      that #8217;s
      just
      a
      horrible
      idea.

      So,
      in
      short,
      you

      have
      direct

      What
      you #8217;re
      describing
      isn #8217;t
      just
      inhuman,
      it #8217;s
      also
      very
      elitist,
      fascist,
      racist,
      and
      literal
      genocide
      as
      well.
      Specifically
      your
      argument
      about
      children
      being
      born
      to
      low
      income
      households
      and
      how
      that
      apparently
      means
      that
      they #8217;ll
      be
      abused
      their
      entire
      life.
      The
      first
      obvious
      problem
      with
      that
      statement
      is
      the
      implication
      that
      poor
      people
      are
      more
      likely
      to
      abuse
      their
      children
      than
      rich
      people.
      No
      evidence
      exists
      to
      support
      that
      claim.
      It
      is
      false
      and
      also
      ELITIST.
      Second,
      you #8217;re
      argument
      fundamentally
      violates
      the
      most
      basic
      principle
      of
      the
      American
      legal
      system:
       #8220;innocent
      until
      proven
      guilty #8221;
      because
      it
      operates
      under
      the
      assumption
      that
      certain
      people
      WILL
      abuse
      their
      children
      and
      then
      proceeds
      to
      punish
      them
      for
      the
      crime
      that
      the
      system
      thinks
      that
      person
      might
      commit.
      That #8217;s
      FASCISM.
      Third,
      minorities
      are
      often
      the
       #8220;lower
      income #8221;
      families
      that
      you #8217;re
      talking
      about.
      So
      now,
      your
      policy
      would
      be
      specifically
      targeting
      people
      of
      color.
      That #8217;s
      RACIST.
      Now,
      for
      genocide.
      The
      legal
      definition
      for
      genocide
      as
      stated
      by
      the
      United
      Nations
      is
      this:
       #8220;In
      the
      present
      Convention,
      genocide
      means
      any
      of
      the
      following
      acts
      committed
      with
      intent
      to
      destroy,
      in
      whole
      or
      in
      part,
      a
      national,
      ethnical,
      racial
      or
      religious
      group,
      as
      such:
      A)
      Killing
      members
      of
      the
      group;
      B)
      Causing
      serious
      bodily
      or
      mental
      harm
      to
      members
      of
      the
      group;
      C)
      Deliberately
      inflicting
      on
      the
      group
      conditions
      of
      life
      calculated
      to
      bring
      about
      its
      physical
      destruction
      in
      whole
      or
      in
      part;
      D)
      Imposing
      measures
      intended
      to
      prevent
      births
      within
      the
      group;
      E)
      Forcibly
      transferring
      children
      of
      the
      group
      to
      another
      group. #8221;
      I #8217;d
      like
      you
      to
      pay
      close
      attention
      to
      D
      and
      E.
      That #8217;s
      literally
      what
      you #8217;re
      describing.
      You
      are
      LITERALLY
      saying
      that
      the
      United
      States
      Of
      America
      should
      commit
      genocide
      against
      people
      based
      on
      income.
      Again,
      I
      would
      like
      to
      point
      out
      that
      what
      you #8217;re
      advocating
      for
      is
      elitist,
      fascist,
      racist,
      and
      literal
      genocide.
      Now,
      I #8217;m
      not
      going
      to
      say
      that
      you #8217;re
      like
      Hitler.
      And
      I #8217;m
      not
      going
      to
      call
      you
      a
      Nazi.
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      you #8217;re
      an
      evil
      person,
      I
      think
      you
      just
      don #8217;t
      fully
      understand
      what
      you #8217;re
      advocating
      for.
      Instead,
      I
      will
      simply
      ask
      you
      this-
      Does
      what
      you
      described
      sound
      like
      a
      policy
      that
      Hitler
      would
      implant
      against
      the
      Jewish
      population?
      If
      the
      answer
      to
      that
      question
      is
      ever
      yes,
      then
      you
      should
      probably
      reevaluate
      your
      stance
      on
      the
      issue.

      (which

      just
      propaganda,
      btw)
      is
      freedom
      of
      speech.
      Which
      includes
      speaking
      out
      against
      the

      speak
      their

      You
      completely

      the
      entertainment
      value,
      the

      of
      fame,
      and
      the
      prizes
      won.
      By
      your
      logic,
      playing
      any
      game
      is
      stupid.
      Board
      games,
      video
      games,
      card
      games
      -
      all
      just
      cheap
      gimmicks
      apparently.
      And
      enjoying
      those
      games
      apparently
      makes
      someone
      low

      Plus,
      being
      on
      tv
      is
      just
      cool.
      It #8217;s
      something

      people
      get
      excited

      why

      they
      be?
      It #8217;s
      like
      a
      pseudo
      fame.
      And
      then,
      there #8217;s
      the
      actual
      prizes.
      You
      say
      they #8217;re

      people
      sometimes

      dollars,
      a
      new
      car,
      and
      a

      That #8217;s

       #8220;They
      chose
      the
      job. #8221;
      That #8217;s
      complete
      bullshit.
      First
      and
      foremost
      the
      unemployment
      rate
      in
      the
      US
      is
      sitting
      at
      about
      3.6%
      fluctuating
      up
      and
      down
      from
      month
      to
      month.
      A
      lot
      of
      people
      don #8217;t
      have
      jobs
      because
      they
      can #8217;t
      find
      any.
      Second,
      a
      lot
      of
      jobs
      are
      getting
      more
      and
      more
      competitive
      because
      more
      millennials
      went
      to
      college
      than
      went
      straight
      into
      a
      career.
      So,
      college
      degrees
      aren #8217;t
      as
      valued
      because
      there #8217;s
      a
      surplus.
      Meaning
      that
      degree
      that
      was
      SUPPOSED
      to
      get
      you
      a
      good
      job
      actually
      got
      you
      a
      massive
      debt
      and
      nothing
      else.
      Therefore,
      people
      are
      forced
      to
      accept
      low
      skill,
      low
      pay
      jobs
      such
      as
      food
      service.
      Not
      because
      the
      enjoy
      dealing
      with
      pushy
      and
      hungry
      people
      all
      day.
      I
      agree
      that
      servers
      should
      be
      payed
      more,
      but
      you
      not
      tipping
      won #8217;t
      change
      that.
      All
      you
      accomplish
      by
      not
      tipping
      is
      inconveniencing
      that
      person
      for
      the
      day.

      So
      the
      only
      time
      you
      don #8217;t
      tip
      is
      if
      the
      service
      is
      bad
      -
      meaning
      it
      isn #8217;t
      standard.
      That #8217;s
      still
      shitty
      in
      my
      opinion
      because
      you
      never
      know
      what
      all
      the
      server
      is
      having
      to
      deal
      with.
      But
      that #8217;s
      more
      excusable.
      OP
      is
      saying
      that
      not
      tipping
      isn #8217;t
      a
      red
      flag
      in
      the
      context
      of
      a
      date
      because
      the
      guy
      is
      already
      spending
      money
      on
      the
      girl.
      Not
      tipping
      a
      server
      because
      you
      want
      to
      save
      money
      is
      trash.
      If
      you

      that,
      then
      yeah.
      You #8217;re
      a

      If
      you
      don #8217;t
      do
      that,
      then
      you #8217;re
      fine.

      Pretty

      I
      know

      people
      do
      and
      don #8217;t

      I

      they
      drink,
      how
      much
      they
      drink,
      when
      it #8217;s
      time
      to

      them
      off,

      If
      that
      was
      the
      case,
      no
      one
      would
      ever
      be
      a
      server.
      You #8217;d
      never
      get
      any
      kind
      of
      service
      again.
      Also,
      it #8217;s
      not
      as
      easy
      as
       #8220;get
      a
      new
      job. #8221;
      Unemployment
      is
      currently
      at
      3.6%
      in
      the
      US.
      Plus,
      jobs
      are
      becoming
      more
      and
      more
      competitive
      because
      of
      the
      fact
      that
      more
      millennials
      sought
      a
      college
      education
      than
      starting
      a
      career.
      That
      means
      that
      there #8217;s
      less
      jobs
      available,
      forcing
      overqualified
      people
      to
      work
      in
      low
      skill,
      low
      pay
      jobs.
      Such
      as
      being
      a
      server.
      You
      accuse
      servers
      of
      being
      entitled
      for
      wanting
      to
      get
      payed.
      Truth
      is,
      that #8217;s
      how
      shit
      works.
      You #8217;re
      the
      entitled
      brat
      who
      refuses
      to
      pay
      someone
      for
      doing
      their
      job
      -
      unlike
      literally
      everyone
      else.

      Lmao,
      what?
      I #8217;m
      sorry,
      but
      I #8217;ve
      never
      had
      an

      waiter
      take
      my
      order
      and
      deliver
      the
      food.
      It #8217;s
      always
      been
      a
      human
      being.
      Where
      the
      fuck
      do
      you
      eat
      at?
      Also,
      you
      answered
      nothing
      in
      my
      last
      post.
      Unemployment
      is
      still
      a
      problem.
      People
      can #8217;t
      just
      go
      find
      new
      jobs.
      Servers
      still
      need
      money.
      And
      you #8217;re
      still
      one
      of
      the
      only
      assholes
      who
      doesn #8217;t
      seem

      get
      it,

      the

      Fast

      industry
      isn #8217;t
      the
      same
      as
      a
      waiter.
      They
      actually
      make
      minimum
      wage
      or
      above.
      Waiters
      don #8217;t.

      for

      damn
      thing
      in
      your
      life.
      Meaning
      you #8217;re
      not
      ONLY
      an
      entitled
      asshole,
      you #8217;re

      experience
      is
      the
      same
      as
      everyone
      else #8217;s.
      This
      isn #8217;t
      even
      a
      matter
      of
      opinion
      anymore.
      Factually,
      you
      are
      incorrect
      about
      the
      state

      you

      What
      I
      found
      worked
      for
      me
      was
      to
      be
      up
      front
      about
      being
      awkward
      and
      a
      little
      dorky.
      I
      would
      say
      something
      like
       #8220;Hey,
      listen.
      I #8217;m
      sorry
      about
      this,
      but
      I
      get
      kinda
      awkward
      around
      cute
      girls.
      So
      if
      I
      seem
      a
      little
      weird,
      that #8217;s
      why. #8221;
      Then
      just
      talk
      to
      them
      like
      a
      normal
      person.
      It
      might
      not
      work
      every
      time,
      but
      I #8217;ve
      found
      that
      most
      people
      like
      the
      idea
      of
      being
      attractive
      enough
      to
      make
      someone
      else
      nervous.

      The
      idea
      of
       #8220;evidence
      for
      God #8221;
      suggests
      that
      God
      is
      bound
      by
      our
      mortal
      concept
      of
      science.
      He
      is
      not.
      Operating
      the
      assumption
      that
      the
      God
      of
      the
      Christian
      Bible
      is
      real
      -
      He
      creates
      the
      entire
      universe
      and
      everything
      in
      it,
      including
      humans.
      How
      could
      a
      creation
      ever
      hope
      to
      fully
      understand
      its
      creator?
      Can
      a
      sculpture
      understand
      an
      artist?
      Can
      a
      building
      explain
      an
      architect?
      Can
      a
      computer
      prove
      the
      existence
      of
      humans?
      No.
      They
      can #8217;t.
      Simply
      because
      the
      creator
      is
      inherently
      more
      powerful
      than
      the
      creation.
      Therefore,
      humans
      can #8217;t
      prove
      the
      existence
      of
      or
      fully
      understand
      the
      nature
      of
      God
      because
      God
      is
      greater
      than
      humanity.
      The
      belief
      in
      God
      necessitates
      the
      circumvention
      of
      evidence.
      If
      you
      need
      evidence
      to
      believe
      in
      God,
      then
      you
      don #8217;t
      believe.
      You
      observe.
      Belief
      is
      the
      acknowledgement
      of
      existence
      or
      truth
      without
      evidence.
      That
      being
      said,
      I
      believe
      in
      God
      because
      I
      simply
      don #8217;t
      believe
      that
      humanity
      could
      have
      reached
      this
      point
      in
      development
      without
      some
      kind
      of
      guidance.
      Evolution
      is
      one
      thing,
      but
      human #8217;s
      have
      somehow
      taken
      it
      to
      an
      extreme.
      How
      is
      it
      that
      we
      evolved
      to
      be
      so
      vastly
      more
      intelligent
      than
      any
      other
      species
      on
      the
      planet?
      Why
      did
      no
      other
      species
      also
      evolve
      to
      reach
      our
      level
      of
      intelligence?
      How
      could
      that
      fact
      have
      come
      to
      be
      true
      through
      completely
      random
      chance?
      Wouldn #8217;t
      it
      make
      more
      sense
      for
      humans
      to
      be
      closer
      to
      the
      rest
      of
      the
      animal
      kingdom?
      Or
      for
      other
      animals
      to
      be
      closer
      to
      humans
      in
      intelligence?
      Why
      are
      we
      the
      outlier?
      I
      believe
      in
      God
      because
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      that
      humans
      were
      simply
      lucky.
      I
      think
      that
      there
      had
      to
      be
      some
      kind
      of
      a
      guiding
      force.

      I
      also

      remembered
      [this
      podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1OTlChAnAed1lk5XLgwMIt?si=5ZHF3bbhS5a72iloZMBzaA)
      on

      It
      talks
      about
      learning
      yourself,
      your
      strengths,
      weaknesses,
      etc.

      1)
      Jobs
      aren #8217;t
      defined
      by
      their
      universal
      legality.
      For
      example,
      weed
      dispensaries
      are
      legal
      in
      some
      states
      in
      the
      US
      but
      not
      others.
      But
      working
      in
      one
      still
      gets
      you
      a
      paycheck,
      therefore
      it #8217;s
      a
      job.
      2)
      Jobs
      aren #8217;t
      defined
      by
      how
      respectable
      they
      are.
      CEOs
      are
      culturally
      more
      respected
      than
      portable
      toilet
      cleaners.
      Both
      are
      still
      real
      jobs
      that
      real
      people
      do
      every
      day.
      3)
      Jobs
      aren #8217;t
      defined
      by
      how
      easy
      they
      are.
      Some
      things
      are
      easy,
      some
      things
      are
      hard.
      Construction
      work
      is
      difficult.
      Fast
      food
      cashier
      is
      easy.
      Being
      a
      lawyer
      is
      difficult.
      Being
      a
      tour
      guide
      is
      easy.
      You #8217;re
      not
      getting
      flamed,
      and
      yeah,
      you #8217;re
      technically
      right
      about
      your
      facts
      -
      if
      the
      first
      one
      is
      phrased
      differently,
      at
      least.
      But
      your
      logic
      is
      flawed
      and
      the
      conclusions
      you
      draw
      from
      those
      facts
      are
      just
      wrong.
      If
      you
      do
      work
      of
      any
      kind
      and
      receive
      a
      paycheck
      for
      it,
      then
      it #8217;s
      a
      job.
      Doesn #8217;t
      matter
      if
      it #8217;s
      universally
      legalized,
      respectable,
      easy
      or
      difficult.

      I
      was
      named
      after
      my
      abusive
      father.
      I
      was
      actually
      the
      7th
      James
      in
      my
      family,
      named
      after
      my
      father,
      grandfather,
      great
      grandfather
      blah
      blah
      blah.
      So
      believe
      me
      when
      I
      say
      that
      I
      know
      exactly
      what
      you #8217;re
      talking
      about.
      It
      sucks.
      A
      lot.
      Every
      time
      I
      wrote
      it,
      I
      hated
      it
      and
      myself
      a
      little
      bit.
      It
      was
      wrong.
      I
      would
      recommend
      going
      to
      the
      social
      security
      administration
      building
      in
      your
      home
      town
      and
      seeing
      what
      they
      can
      do
      to
      help
      you.
      Normally,
      they
      can
      replace
      a
      lost
      or
      damaged
      card.
      They
      may
      also
      be
      able
      to
      help
      with
      your
      birth
      certificate,
      but
      I #8217;m
      not
      positive
      about
      that.
      If
      they
      can #8217;t,
      then
      you
      should
      be
      able
      to
      request
      a
      copy
      from
      the
      city
      hall
      or
      courthouse
      of
      your
      hometown.
      Possibly
      even
      the
      hospital
      where
      you
      were
      born.
      I
      really
      hope
      that
      you #8217;re
      able
      to
      shake
      your
      name.
      When
      I
      was
      finally
      able
      to
      do
      so,
      I
      felt
      amazing.
      Like
      I
      was
      finally
      my
      own
      man.
      Not
      bound
      by
      the
      past
      anymore.
      It
      was
      liberating
      and
      I
      genuinely
      hope
      that
      you
      get
      to
      experience
      the
      same
      thing
      soon!
      You
      deserve
      it!

      That
      isn #8217;t
      a
      racist
      question.
      It #8217;s
      a
      question
      intentionally
      designed
      to
      show
      that
      you
      literally
      can #8217;t

      country
      of
      origin
      by
      looking
      at
      them.
      And
      since
      we #8217;re
      apparently
      talking
      about
      the
      president
      specifically
      now,
      his
      tweet
      targeted
      four
      different
      congressmen.
      Three
      of
      which
      were
      born
      in
      the
      USA
      and
      aren #8217;t
      white.
      One
      is
      a
      naturalized
      citizen
      who
      isn #8217;t
      white.
      THIS
      IS
      THEIR
      COUNTRY.
      Telling
      them
      to
      go
      somewhere
      else
      implies
      that
      Trump
      assumes
      they
      aren #8217;t
      from
      the
      US
      because
      of
      their
      skin
      color
      -
      which
      is
      therefore
      racist.

      All
      I #8217;m

      that
      you
      didn #8217;t

      it
      in
      the

      It #8217;s
      hilarious!
      Homie,
      you
      just
      copied
      and
      pasted!
      Couldn #8217;t
      even
      bother
      coming
      up
      with
      a
      way
      to
      reword
      it?
      Not
      to
      mention,
      you #8217;re
      just
      wrong
      -
      which
      makes
      it
      even
      funnier.
      Calling
      out
      trolls
      and
      shifty
      b8
      won #8217;t
      get
      banned.
      But
      trolls
      and
      shitty
      b8?
      Probably
      will
      get
      banned.
      Again,
      just
      put
      a
      liiiittttttllle
      more
      effort
      into
      triggering
      people.
      I
      promise
      you,
      it #8217;ll
      go
      a
      long
      way.

      realize

      reading

      so
      difficult
      for
      you.
      Also,
      if
      we
      don #8217;t
      deserve
      recognition,
      then
      why
      are
      you
      still
      answering
      me?

      Society
      is
      based
      off
      of
      assumptions
      and
      agreed
      upon
      ideas.
      Why
      didn #8217;t
      Trump
      say
      it
      to
      a
      white
      person?
      Why
      were
      all
      four
      of
      the
      people
      in
      question
      people
      of
      color?
      Why
      was
      he
      telling
      these
      people
      of
      color
      to
      go
      back
      to
      where
      they
      came
      from?
      What
      does
      he
      mean
      by
      that?
      If
      you
      tell
      someone
      of
      color
      to
      go
      back
      to
      where
      they
      came
      from,
      even
      though
      they #8217;re
      from
      America,
      then
      you
      are
      being
      racist.
      The
      reason
      that #8217;s
      racist
      is
      because
      you
      make
      the
      assumption
      that
      the
      person
      of
      color
      isn #8217;t
      from
      America
      while
      you
      DON #8217;T
      make
      that
      assumption
      about
      white
      people.
      Yeah,
      you
      can #8217;t
      read
      the
      guy #8217;s
      mind.
      But
      that #8217;s
      why
      you
      have
      to
      look
      at
      his
      actions.
      You
      also
      can #8217;t
      read
      the
      mind
      of
      a
      murderer,
      but
      if
      he
      murders
      someone,
      then
      he #8217;s
      a
      fucking
      murderer.
      It
      doesn #8217;t
      matter
      what
      was
      going
      through
      his
      mind
      at
      the
      time
      or
      what
      he
      believes
      he
      was
      doing.
      Murder
      is
      murder.
      And
      racism
      is
      racism.
      Am
      I
      wrong
      here?
      Surely
      even
      you
      can
      agree
      with
      that,
      right?

      That #8217;s
      the
      variable
      in
      question!
      I
      claimed
      that
      Trump
      never
      told
      a
      white
      person
       #8220;go
      back
      where
      you
      came
      from. #8221;
      You
      answered
      by
      saying
      that
      he
      had
      done
      so
       #8220;many
      many
      times. #8221;
      Now
      that
      I
      ask
      for
      evidence
      about
      that,
      you
      accuse
      me
      of
      only
      focusing
      on
      one
      variable.
      Therefore,
      I #8217;m
      forced
      to
      assume
      that
      you
      don #8217;t
      actually
      have
      the
      evidence
      to
      back
      your
      claim.
      And
      by
      the
      way,
      that
      wasn #8217;t
      sarcasm.
      If
      Trump
      has
      told
      white
      people
      to
       #8220;go
      back
      where
      they
      came
      from #8221;
      then
      I
      want
      to
      know
      about
      it
      because
      that
      will
      force
      me
      to
      reevaluate
      my
      stance
      on
      the
      issue.
      Unfortunately,
      my
      google
      searches
      resulted
      in
      nothing.
      So
      now,
      I #8217;m
      depending
      on
      you
      to
      educate
      me.
      Since
      Trump
      has
      said
      this
      kind
      of
      thing
      to
      white
      people
       #8220;many
      many
      times #8221;
      I #8217;m
      sure
      you
      have
      some
      screen
      shots
      or
      video
      clips
      of
      the
      event,
      right?
      Edit:
      Isolating
      a
      single
      variable
      and
      then
      performing
      experiments
      is
      literally
      how
      science
      works.
      Focusing
      on
      one
      variable
      is
      literally
      necessary
      to
      test
      any
      hypothesis.
      The
      hypothesis
      here
      is
       #8220;Trump
      is
      racist. #8221;

      No,
      that #8217;s
      the
      right
      variable.
      If
      you
      tell
      a
      person
      of
      color
       #8220;go
      back
      where
      you

      but
      never
      say
      it
      to
      a
      white
      person,
      then
      you #8217;re
      a
      fucking
      racist.
      Also,
      you #8217;re
      no
      longer
      arguing
      in
      a
      constructive
      way.
      Either
      give
      me
      the
      evidence
      for
      your
      claim,
      tell
      me
      what
      the
       #8220;correct
      variable #8221;
      is,
      or
      admit
      that
      I #8217;ve

      basically
      just
      saying
      that
      Trump
      is
      being
      a
      liiitttle
      bit
      racist
      in
      order
      to
      trigger
      people.
      Which
      is
      still
      racist.
      Also,
      his
      history
      of
      insulting
      political
      opponents
      means
      nothing.
      If
      you
      call
      someone
      a
      dumbass,
      that #8217;s
      an
      insult.
      If
      you
      tell
      a
      person
      of
      color
       #8220;go
      back
      where
      you
      came
      from #8221;
      then
      you #8217;re
      being
      racist.
      Making
      racist
      comments
      means
      you
      are
      a
      racist
      person.
      It
      doesn #8217;t
      matter
      what
      the
      reason
      behind
      your
      comment
      is.
      The
      ONLY
      thing
      that
      could
      possible
      excuse
      this
      behavior
      is
      if
      he
      made
      similar
      comments
      to
      other
      people
      -
      which
      you
      claim
      he #8217;s
      done
      and
      then
      offered
      no
      evidence
      to
      support.
      Right
      now,
      you #8217;re
      completely
      ignoring
      the
      facts
      of
      the
      situation
      and
      focusing
      on
      how
      you
      feel
      about
      Trump,
      which
      is
      that
      you #8217;re
      a
      fan.
      Also,
      if
      that #8217;s
      not
      the
       #8220;correct
      variable #8221;
      then
      why
      the
      fuck
      did
      you
      post
      about
      it
      in
      the
      first
      place,
      dumbass?
      You #8217;re
      a
      moving
      target.
      Your
      OP
      was
      about
      how
      telling
      people
      to
      go
      back
      to
      where
      they
      came
      from
      wasn #8217;t
      racist.
      Now
      that
      I #8217;ve
      engaged
      you
      on
      that
      topic,
      you
      want
      to
      change
      the
      subject
      and
      say
       #8220;well,
      that #8217;s
      not
      ACTUALLY
      that
      important.
      And
      talking
      about
      it
      makes
      you
      stupid! #8221;
      You #8217;re
      trying
      to
      change
      the
      subject
      because
      you
      don #8217;t
      have
      a
      valid
      argument
      agains
      what
      I #8217;m
      saying.

      1)
      You
      are.
      Not
      in
      those
      exact
      words,
      but
      making
      comments
      knowing
      that
      other
      people
      will
      interpret
      as
      racist
      means
      that
      you
      are
      making
      racist
      comments.
      Because
      all
      language
      is
      based
      in
      the
      ideas
      of
      understanding.
      You #8217;re
      basically
      making
      the
      same
      argument
      as
      that
       #8220;Die
      Bart
      Die #8221;
      meme
      that #8217;s
      been
      going
      around,
      which
      is
      -
       #8220;Oh,
      yeah,
      I
      know
      that
      NORMALLY
      this
      would
      mean
      something
      bad,
      but
      I #8217;m
      not
      meaning
      it
      like
      that
      in
      this
      instance!
      So
      it #8217;s
      okay!
      And
      it #8217;s
      your
      fault
      for
      not
      understanding! #8221;
      2)
      That #8217;s
      not
      a
      false
      assumption.
      It #8217;s
      a
      racist
      comment.
      Racist
      comments
      aren #8217;t
      always
      as
      painfully
      obvious
      as
      saying
       #8220;Fuck
      minorities. #8221;
      They #8217;re
      usually
      much
      more
      subtle
      than
      that.
      If
      you
      don #8217;t
      understand
      subtly,
      subtext,
      or
      connotations
      of
      certain
      phrases,
      then
      you #8217;re
      much
      less
      intelligent
      than
      I
      thought
      you
      were.
      Personally
      though,
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      that #8217;s
      the
      case.
      I
      think
      you
      just
      refuse
      to
      acknowledge
      the
      actual
      racial
      element
      of
      the
      comments
      because
      just
      as
      much
      as
      some
      people
      have
       #8220;TDS #8221;
      as
      you
      call
      it,
      folks
      on
      the
      right
      are
      total
      Trump
      worshipers
      who
      believe
      he
      can
      do
      no
      wrong.
      He #8217;s
      become
      a
      god
      to
      them.
      Plus,
      labeling
      someone
      as
      having
      TDS
      is
      just
      an
      excuse
      to
      ignore
      their
      arguments.
      Your
      basically
      saying
      that
      they
      don #8217;t
      like
      Trump,
      so
      any
      argument
      they
      make
      about
      him
      is
      invalid.
      That #8217;s
      a
      logical
      fallacy.
      3)
      The
      comments
      were
      already
      made.
      Now
      is
      the
      time
      to
      look
      at
      them
      and
      acknowledge
      them.
      You
      refuse
      to
      do
      so
      because
       #8220;Trump
      said
      that
      just
      to
      trigger
      the
      left!
      It #8217;s
      a
      political
      stunt! #8221;
      4)
      I #8217;ve
      looked.
      I
      have
      yet
      to
      see
      the
      president
      making
      any
      kind
      of
       #8220;go
      back
      where
      you
      came
      from #8221;
      kind
      of
      comment
      to
      any
      white
      person.
      Ever.
      You
      apparently
      have
      seen
      it
      though,
      since
      he #8217;s
      done
      so
       #8220;many,
      many
      times #8221;
      as
      you
      said.
      Yet,
      you
      refuse
      to
      share.
      Therefore,
      you #8217;re
      the
      one
      who
      doesn #8217;t
      care
      about
      sharing
      the
      truth.
      If
      there #8217;s
      so
      many
      examples,
      why
      can #8217;t
      I
      find
      a
      single
      one
      and
      why
      do
      you
      refuse
      to
      share
      one?
      5)
      The
      difference
      here
      is
      that
      I #8217;ve
      got
      the
      screenshots
      of
      Trump #8217;s
      tweet
      in
      question.
      Those
      are
      my
      facts.
      The
      question
      isn #8217;t
      if
      he
      said
      it
      or
      not,
      the
      question
      is
       #8220;Is
      this
      racist? #8221;
      Which,
      it
      is.
      You
      simply
      refuse
      to
      acknowledge
      it,
      though.
      See
      arguments
      2
      and
      3.
      6)
      Apologies.
      You #8217;re
      right,
      you
      aren #8217;t
      the
      OP.
      And
      that #8217;s
      my
      mistake.
      But,
      the
      OP
      still
      made
      the
      claim
      and
      it #8217;s
      the
      topic
      of
      discussion.
      You #8217;re
      still
      trying
      to
      change
      the
      subject.
      Your
      first
      comment
      though
      was
      basically
      the
      argument
      that
       #8220;You
      can #8217;t
      read
      Trump #8217;s
      mind
      so
      you
      don #8217;t
      know
      that
      he
      was
      ACTUALLY
      being
      racist. #8221;
      Which,
      again,
      I
      say
      that
      forces
      us
      to
      examine
      his
      actions,
      such
      as
      how
      he
      speaks
      to
      people.
      And
      he
      tells
      people
      of
      color
      to
      go
      back
      where
      they
      came
      from.
      That #8217;s
      a
      racist
      comment.
      And
      if
      you
      make
      racist
      comments,
      then
      you
      are
      a
      racist.
      Again,
      see
      arguments
      2
      and
      3.
      If
      you
      want
      to
      support
      Trump,
      that #8217;s
      cool.
      You #8217;re
      well
      within
      your
      rights
      to
      do
      so
      and
      I
      won #8217;t
      fault
      you
      for
      it.
      But
      you
      can #8217;t
      say
      that
      he #8217;s
      not
      something
      that
      he
      clearly
      is.
      It #8217;s
      delusional.
      And
      I
      genuinely
      believe
      that
      you #8217;re
      smarter
      than
      that.
      But
      you
      can #8217;t
      be
      dumb
      enough
      to
      really
      think
      that
      Trump #8217;s
      comments
      weren #8217;t
      racially
      charged.

      Yeah,
      I
      do
      believe
      it
      because
      that #8217;s
      how
      communication
      fucking
      works!
      I
      make
      these
      words
      assuming
      that
      you #8217;ll
      read
      them
      and
      understand
      them.
      If
      I
      make
      the
      comment
       #8220;I
      kill
      n*ggers
      for
      fun #8221;
      and
      you
      call
      me
      a
      racist,
      then
      me
      saying
       #8220;Oh!
      I
      just
      said
      that
      to
      trigger
      you
      and
      make
      you
      think
      I #8217;m
      a
      racist!
      Lolz! #8221;
      Just
      makes
      me
      a
      racist
      who #8217;s
      too
      much
      of
      a
      pussy
      to
      own
      up
      to
      it.
      At
      that
      point,
      it
      doesn #8217;t
      even
      matter
      if
      the
      statement
      is
      true
      or
      not
      because
      you #8217;re
      intentionally
      invoking
      race
      to
      imply
      that
      the
      group
      in
      question
      is
      lesser
      or
      inferior
      in
      some
      way.
      If
      you
      DON #8217;T
      believe
      that,
      then
      you #8217;re
      just
      delusional.
      I
      don #8217;t
      understand
      how
      you
      could
      possibly
      disagree
      with
      that
      point
      while
      still
      living
      in
      reality.
      Actually,
      that #8217;s
      not
      even
      a
      matter
      of
      believing!
      If
      you
      say
      racist
      shit,
      you #8217;re
      a
      fucking
      racist.
      And
      making
      racial
      comments
      that
      are
      intentionally
      designed
      to
      lead
      people
      to
      believe
      you #8217;re
      racist
      is
      literally
      the
      definition
      of
       #8220;Saying
      racist
      shit. #8221;
      Just
      own
      it.
      He
      said
      some
      things
      that
      he
      shouldn #8217;t
      have.
      Accept
      reality.
      If
      you
      still
      support
      him,
      rad!
      You #8217;re
      allowed
      to
      do
      so!
      But
      don #8217;t
      sit
      there
      and
      say
       #8220;Yeah,
      he
      said
      things
      that
      seem
      racist
      and
      wants
      everyone
      to
      think
      that
      he #8217;s
      racist,
      but
      he #8217;s
      not
      ACTUALLY
      racist. #8221;

      Biologically
      speaking,
      when
      a
      woman
      is
       #8220;PMSing #8221;
      as
      so
      many
      people
      like
      to
      put
      it,
      she #8217;s
      actually
      experiencing
      an
      increase
      in
      her
      usual
      testosterone
      levels.
      That
      means
      that
      when
      women
      are
      acting
       #8220;bitchy #8221;
      it #8217;s
      actually
      because
      they #8217;re
      simply
       #8220;more
      masculine #8221;
      than
      they
      normally
      are.
      Funny,
      huh?
      On
      a
      related
      note,
      the
      days
      leading
      up
      to
      mensuration
      are
      generally
      accompanied
      by
      an
      increase
      in
      estrogen
      levels.
      When
      that
      happens,
      women
      are
      less
      likely
      to
      make
      impulse
      decisions
      and
      their
      short-term
      memory
      is
      sharper.
      And
      in
      these
      periods,
      most
      women
      will
      actually
      feel
       #8220;more
      inspired #8221;
      than
      they
      normally
      do.
      So
      to
      put
      it
      simply,
      the
      idea
      that
      women
      are
      bitchy
      when
      they #8217;re
      on
      their
      periods
      isn #8217;t
      just
      sexist
      bullshit,
      it #8217;s
      some
      next
      level
      sexist
      bullshit
      because
      men
      can #8217;t
      handle
      it
      when
      women
      start
      acting
      the
      way
      they
      do.

      [Race
      baiting](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Race-baiting)
      is
      apparently
      the
      term
      for
      what
      you #8217;ve

      Just

      So
      for
      most
      of
      my
      life,
      I #8217;ve
      done
      finger
      guns
      after
      making
      shitty
      puns
      -
      after
      snapping,
      of
      course.
      I #8217;ve
      also
      always
      liked
      lemon
      bars
      and
      cuff
      my
      jeans
      on
      occasion.
      I
      joined
      this
      sub
      about
      twenty
      minutes
      ago
      and
      apparently
      all
      of
      those
      things
      are
      all
      super
      bisexual??
      If
      I #8217;d
      known
      that
      before,
      I
      probably
      would
      have
      realized
      I
      was
      bi
      years
      ago.
      Edit:
      Also
      just
      learned
      that
      cool
      and/or
      leather
      jackets
      are
      also
      a
      bi
      thing.
      So
      rad.

      Hey!
      So
      I #8217;m
      also
      a
      Christian
      and
      also
      very
      bisexual.
      It
      was
      something
      that
      I
      struggled
      with
      for
      quite
      a
      while
      and
      didn #8217;t
      become
      comfortable
      with
      until
      I
      became
      more
      educated
      in
      scripture
      and
      the
      culture
      of
      the
      time
      it
      was
      written.
      It #8217;s
      real
      easy
      to
      look
      at
      certain
      aspects
      of
      the
      Bible
      and
      assume
      that
      we
      understand
      the
      message
      clearly,
      when
      in
      all
      actuality,
      we
      don #8217;t
      get
      it
      at
      all.
      TL;DR
      -
      Don #8217;t
      take
      everything
      at
      face
      value.
      Just
      because
      your
      preacher
      says
       #8220;The
      Bible
      says
      gays
      go
      to
      hell! #8221;
      Doesn #8217;t
      mean
      it #8217;s
      true.
      Read
      it
      for
      yourself
      and
      research
      the
      REAL
      meaning.
      Also,
      Sodom
      and
      Gomorrah
      have
      LITERALLY
      NOTHING
      TO
      DO
      WITH
      GAY
      SEX!
      Now
      this
      is
      going
      to
      be
      a
      little
      bit
      long
      winded,
      but
      just
      follow
      me
      for
      a
      second.
      The
      word
       #8220;Xenia #8221;
      is
      found
      in
      ancient
      Greek.
      It
      basically
      means
       #8220;hospitality #8221;
      but
      in
      a
      VERY
      specific
      way.
      It #8217;s
      a
      concept
      that
      was
      consistent
      throughout
      the
      entire
      Mediterranean
      region.
      Basically,
      the
      rules
      of
      xenia
      are
      that
      if
      a
      traveler
      appears
      on
      your
      doorstep
      and
      asks
      to
      stay
      the
      night,
      you
      MUST
      take
      them
      in.
      Once
      they #8217;re
      in
      your
      home,
      you
      have
      to
      feed
      the
      traveler,
      offer
      them
      a
      bath,
      and
      protect
      them
      from
      any
      and
      all
      harm
      that
      might
      come
      to
      them.
      Only
      after
      you
      have
      done
      all
      of
      those
      things
      are
      you
      even
      allowed
      to
      ask
      their
      name.
      Once
      the
      guest
      leaves,
      the
      host
      is
      to
      provide
      them
      with
      a
      gift.
      Meanwhile,
      the
      guest
      is
      to
      do
      no
      harm
      to
      the
      host
      and
      provide
      them
      a
      gift
      as
      they
      leave.
      The
      Greeks
      (and
      other
      mediterranean
      cultures)
      took
      this
      concept
      VERY
      seriously
      for
      two
      reasons.
      1)
      Traveling
      alone
      at
      night
      was
      exceptionally
      dangerous.
      It
      was
      basically
      a
      surefire
      way
      to
      die.
      2)
      It
      was
      believed
      that
      God
      (or
       #8220;the
      gods #8221;)
      would
      often
      times
      travel
      to
      Earth
      and
      test
      human
      hospitality.
      If
      you
      failed,
      you
      were
      punished
      by
      being
      struck
      blind
      and
      then
      killed.
      Xenia
      was
      so
      important
      in
      Mediterranean
      life
      that
      there #8217;s
      a
      passage
      in
      The
      Iliad
      where
      two
      soldiers
      meet
      each
      other
      on
      the
      battle
      field
      and
      one
      says
      to
      the
      other
       #8220;My
      great
      grandfather
      spent
      a
      night
      in
      the
      home
      of
      your
      great
      grandfather!
      I
      refuse
      to
      fight
      a
      guest! #8221;
      And
      then
      they
      both
      turn
      around
      and
      refuse
      to
      take
      up
      arms
      against
      one
      another.
      So
      just
      to
      recap
      the
      rules
      of
      xenia
      -
      God
      will
      sometimes
      travel
      to
      Earth
      to
      test
      humans.
      You
      have
      to
      accept
      a
      stranger
      into
      your
      house
      for
      the
      night.
      You
      have
      to
      provide
      them
      food
      and
      a
      bath.
      You
      have
      to
      protect
      them
      from
      all
      harm.
      The
      guest
      can #8217;t
      harm
      the
      host.
      Both
      parties
      must
      exchange
      gifts.
      If
      you
      don #8217;t
      obey,
      God
      will
      strike
      you
      with
      blindness
      and
      death.
      Now,
      that
      we
      know
      a
      little
      bit
      about
      the
      culture
      of
      the
      Mediterranean,
      let #8217;s
      look
      at
      possibly
      the
      MOST
      anti-homosexuality
      story
      in
      the
      Bible.
      The
      story
      of
      Sodom
      and
      Gomorrah.
      The
      summarized
      version
      is
      this
      -
      God
      sends
      his
      angels
      to
      Sodom
      and
      Gomorrah
      to
      see
      if
      there
      are
      any
      non-wicked
      people.
      Lot
      meets
      them
      and
      offers
      to
      let
      them
      stay
      in
      his
      home.
      They
      refuse
      and
      say
      they #8217;ll
      stay
      outside,
      but
      Lot
      insists.
      So,
      the
      angels
      oblige
      him
      and
      accept
      his
      offer.
      Later
      that
      night,
      the
      men
      of
      the
      city
      come
      and
      demand
      to
      have
      sex
      with
      the
      angels.
      Lot
      refuses,
      the
      men
      force
      their
      way
      into
      his
      home,
      and
      then
      the
      city
      is
      destroyed
      as
      a
      result.
      Now,
      for
      more
      detail.
      Genesis
      18:
      20-21
      Then
      the
      Lord
      said,
       #8220;The
      outcry
      against
      Sodom
      and
      Gomorrah
      is
      so
      great
      and
      their
      sin
      so
      grievous
      that
      I
      will
      go
      down
      and
      see
      if
      what
      they
      have
      done
      is
      as
      bad
      as
      the
      outcry
      that
      has
      reached
      me.
      If
      not,
      I
      will
      know. #8221;
      -
      Here,
      we
      see
      the
      first
      rule.
      God
      coming
      to
      Earth
      (or
      in
      this
      case,
      sending
      His
      angels)
      and
      testing
      mankind.
      Genesis
      19:
      1-13
      The
      two
      angels
      arrived
      at
      Sodom
      in
      the
      evening,
      and
      Lot
      was
      sitting
      in
      the
      gateway
      of
      the
      city.
      When
      he
      saw
      them,
      he
      got
      up
      to
      meet
      them
      and
      bowed
      down
      with
      his
      face
      to
      the
      ground.
       #8220;My
      lords, #8221;
      he
      said,
       #8220;please
      turn
      aside
      to
      your
      servant #8217;s
      house.
      You
      can
      wash
      your
      feet
      and
      spend
      the
      night
      and
      then
      go
      on
      your
      way
      early
      in
      the
      morning. #8221;
       #8220;No, #8221;
      they
      answered,
       #8220;we
      will
      spend
      the
      night
      in
      the
      square. #8221;
      But
      he
      insisted
      so
      strongly
      that
      they
      did
      go
      with
      him
      and
      entered
      his
      house.
      He
      prepared
      a
      meal
      for
      them,
      baking
      bread
      without
      yeast,
      and
      they
      ate.
      Before
      they
      had
      gone
      to
      bed,
      all
      the
      men
      from
      every
      part
      of
      the
      city
      of
      Sodom #8212;both
      young
      and
      old #8212;surrounded
      the
      house.
      They
      called
      to
      Lot,
       #8220;Where
      are
      the
      men
      who
      came
      to
      you
      tonight?
      Bring
      them
      out
      to
      us
      so
      that
      we
      can
      have
      sex
      with
      them. #8221;
      Lot
      went
      outside
      to
      meet
      them
      and
      shut
      the
      door
      behind
      him
      and
      said,
       #8220;No,
      my
      friends.
      Don #8217;t
      do
      this
      wicked
      thing.
      Look,
      I
      have
      two
      daughters
      who
      have
      never
      slept
      with
      a
      man.
      Let
      me
      bring
      them
      out
      to
      you,
      and
      you
      can
      do
      what
      you
      like
      with
      them.
      But
      don #8217;t
      do
      anything
      to
      these
      men,
      for
      they
      have
      come
      under
      the
      protection
      of
      my
      roof. #8221;
       #8220;Get
      out
      of
      our
      way, #8221;
      they
      replied.
       #8220;This
      fellow
      came
      here
      as
      a
      foreigner,
      and
      now
      he
      wants
      to
      play
      the
      judge!
      We #8217;ll
      treat
      you
      worse
      than
      them. #8221;
      They
      kept
      bringing
      pressure
      on
      Lot
      and
      moved
      forward
      to
      break
      down
      the
      door.
      But
      the
      men
      inside
      reached
      out
      and
      pulled
      Lot
      back
      into
      the
      house
      and
      shut
      the
      door.
      Then
      they
      struck
      the
      men
      who
      were
      at
      the
      door
      of
      the
      house,
      young
      and
      old,
      with
      blindness
      so
      that
      they
      could
      not
      find
      the
      door.
      The
      two
      men
      said
      to
      Lot,
       #8220;Do
      you
      have
      anyone
      else
      here #8212;sons-in-law,
      sons
      or
      daughters,
      or
      anyone
      else
      in
      the
      city
      who
      belongs
      to
      you?
      Get
      them
      out
      of
      here,
      because
      we
      are
      going
      to
      destroy
      this
      place.
      The
      outcry
      to
      the
      Lord
      against
      its
      people
      is
      so
      great
      that
      he
      has
      sent
      us
      to
      destroy
      it. #8221;
      -
      Here,
      we
      see
      almost
      every
      other
      rule
      of
      xenia.
      Lot
      first
      offers
      his
      house
      and
      tells
      the
      angels
      that
      they
      may
      wash
      their
      feet
      (shelter
      from
      the
      night
      and
      a
      bath.)
      Second,
      he
      prepares
      them
      a
      meal
      and
      allows
      them
      to
      eat.
      Third,
      he
      seeks
      to
      protect
      them
      from
      harm
      (the
      harm
      being
      the
      men
      outside).
      He
      even
      goes
      so
      far
      as
      to
      offer
      up
      his
      daughters
      instead
      and
      then
      says
       #8220;They
      have
      come
      under
      the
      protection
      of
      my
      roof. #8221;
      Notice
      that
      phrase
      -
      he
      doesn #8217;t
      say
       #8220;gay
      sex
      is
      bad. #8221;
      He #8217;s
      basically
      saying
       #8220;these
      men
      are
      my
      guests
      and
      I
      want
      to
      keep
      them
      safe. #8221;
      The
      men
      of
      the
      city
      call
      the
      angels
      foreigners,
      showing
      that
      they
      have
      no
      regard
      for
      guests
      and
      continue
      to
      try
      to
      rape
      the
      angels.
      Then,
      the
      men
      are
      struck
      blind
      (the
      first
      part
      of
      the
      punishment)
      and
      later,
      they #8217;re
      killed
      when
      the
      city
      is
      destroyed
      (the
      second
      part
      of
      the
      punishment.)
      So
      now,
      with
      a
      bit
      of
      context
      in
      the
      culture,
      the
      passage
      is
      suddenly
      not
      about
      gay
      sex
      at
      all.
      It #8217;s
      about
      treating
      guests
      properly.
      The
      only
      difference
      is
      that
      now,
      we
      understand
      xenia
      in
      the
      same
      way
      that
      the
      people
      of
      that
      time
      period
      understood
      xenia.
      The
      knowledge
      of
      that
      concept
      makes
      all
      the
      difference.
      What
      this
      entire
      thing
      means
      is
      that
      you
      can #8217;t
      take
      the
      Bible
      at
      face
      value.
      Most
      people
      who
      preach
      it
      don #8217;t
      truly
      understand
      its
      meaning
      because
      they
      don #8217;t
      understand
      the
      culture
      surrounding
      it
      -
      they
      only
      understand
      their
      own
      culture.
      Which
      is
      natural,
      of
      course.
      But
      still
      a
      problem
      when
      it
      comes
      to
      situations
      like
      this.
      Before
      you
      simply
      say
       #8220;The
      Bible
      says
      all
      homosexuality
      of
      any
      kind
      is
      a
      sin #8221;
      you
      need
      to
      do
      the
      proper
      research
      surrounding
      each
      passage
      and
      understand
      its
      REAL
      meaning.
      This
      is
      also
      true
      for
      any
      portion
      of
      the
      Bible.
      Research
      is
      important
      because
      we
      don #8217;t
      know
      the
      culture
      surrounding
      the
      book.

      It #8217;s
      the
      institution #8217;s
      fault
      for
      allowing
      a
      dangerous
      person
      to
      easily
      obtain
      a
      tool
      designed
      to
      kill
      and
      maim
      other
      living
      creatures
      without
      any
      real
      inconvenience
      or
      challenge.
      Stop
      boiling
      these
      arguments
      down
      to
      something
      as
      simple
      as
       #8220;YoU #8217;rE
      bLaMiNg
      ThE
      gUn! #8221;
      and
      actually
      pay
      attention
      to
      what
      people
      around
      you
      are
      saying.
      Actual
      human
      beings
      are
      dead.
      Mothers
      and
      fathers
      are
      dead.
      Children
      are
      dead.
      But
      you
      don #8217;t
      want
      to
      even
      TRY
      to
      do
      jack
      shit
      about
      it
      because
      you
      love
      your
      Saturdays
      at
      the
      gun
      range
      too
      much.
      Being
      complacent
      with
      mass
      murder
      is
      just
      as
      bad
      as
      pulling
      the
      trigger.

      So
      based
      on
      this,
      I #8217;m
      going
      to
      be
      forced
      to
      assume
      that
      your
      argument
      is
      that
      the
      root
      cause
      of
      mass
      shootings
      is
      mental
      illness.
      That #8217;s
      the
      premise
      that
      I #8217;m
      operating
      under
      now,
      which
      is
      fine.
      The
      problem
      however
      is
      that
      most
      2nd
      amendment
      supporters
      are
      Republican
      -
      and
      the
      Republican
      Party
      has
      severely
      [cut
      funding](https://www.mentalhealthamerica.net/blog/how-trumps-budget-will-affect-people-mental-health-conditions)
      to
      mental
      health
      services
      by
      about
      21%.
      Therefore,
      the
      argument
      that
      2nd
      Amendment
      supporters
      want
      to
      combat
      the
      root
      cause
      of
      mass
      shootings
      (mental
      health)
      doesn #8217;t
      align
      with
      reality.
      You
      said
      that
      they
      don #8217;t
      want
      to
      put
      a
      bandaid
      on
      the
      gaping
      wound.
      That #8217;s
      true.
      Instead,
      they
      took
      a
      knife
      to
      the
      wound
      and
      made
      it
      bigger.

      Nah
      man,
      this
      is
      an
      actual
      thing.
      On
      average,
      the
      ideal
      temperature
      for
      a
      woman
      is
      about
      2
      degrees
      cooler
      than
      the
      ideal
      temperature
      for
      a
      man
      (in
      F)
      due
      to
      the
      way
      that
      fat
      and
      muscle
      are
      distributed
      on
      the
      body.
      The
      problem
      that
      we
      encounter
      is
      that
      statistically
      speaking,
      most
      managers
      in
      an
      office
      space
      are
      slightly
      overweight,
      middle
      aged
      males
      who
      set
      the
      temperature
      to
      a
      level
      that
      they #8217;re
      comfortable
      at,
      which
      results
      in
      the
      temperature
      being
      less
      comfortable
      for
      women.
      Now
      normally,
      that
      wouldn #8217;t
      really
      be
      THAT
      big
      of
      a
      deal.
      But
      studies
      have
      shown
      that
      in
      environments
      like
      this,
      women
      suffer
      a
      significant
      decrease
      in
      productivity,
      around
      21%
      if
      I #8217;m
      remembering
      correctly,
      though
      I
      admit
      I
      may
      be
      wrong
      about
      that
      number.
      However,
      in
      environments
      where
      the
      temperature
      is
      set
      to
      a
      comfortable
      level
      for
      the
      women,
      MEN
      suffer
      a
      decrease
      in
      productivity
      of
      around
      the
      same
      percentage.
      And
      when
      set
      to
      an
      acceptable
      level
      for
      both
      men
      and
      women,
      the
      decrease
      in
      productivity
      is
      significantly
      lessened
      on
      both
      sides.
      It
      has
      been
      scientifically
      proven
      that
      office
      air
      conditioning
      does
      have
      a
      direct
      effect
      on
      the
      productivity
      of
      men
      and
      women
      in
      the
      work
      place.
      So
      saying
      that
      this
      woman
      is
      unintelligent
      is
      just
      wrong.
      And
      calling
      her
      a
      thot
      in
      your
      title?
      That #8217;s
      just
      shitty,
      my
      dude.

      This
      is
      a
      really
      interesting
      podcast
      that
      actually
      touches
      on
      that
      exact
      subject.
      Apparently,
      the
      more
      repressed
      a
      culture
      is,
      the
      more
      extreme
      their
      porn
      is.
      Whereas
      a
      culture
      that #8217;s
      very
      open
      about
      sex
      has
      porn
      that #8217;s
      a
      much
      more
      accurate
      depiction
      about
      how
      things
      work.

      Fuck
      anyone
      that
      doesn #8217;t
      take

      seriously.
      You #8217;re

      person
      no

      what
      and

      of
      and
      abuse
      you.
      I
      wish
      you
      the
      best
      of
      luck
      with
      moving
      forward
      and
      hope
      that
      things
      only
      get
      better
      from
      here.

      It
      was
      Plato,
      but
      he
      later
      came
      to
      regret
      that
      decision
      when
      Diogenes
      crawled
      back
      out
      of
      the
      trash
      and
      proceeded
      to
      spend
      the
      rest
      of
      his
      life
      harassing
      Plato.

      Honestly,
      it
      depends
      on
      how
      you
      go
      about
      it.
      In
      my
      opinion,
      if
      you
      were
      to
      say
      all
      of
      that
      as
      your
      way
      of
      rejecting
      a
      person,
      then
      yeah.
      You #8217;re
      rude
      as
      hell
      and
      highly
      immature.
      But
      if
      you
      were
      to
      say
      something
      along
      the
      lines
      of
       #8220;I #8217;m
      sorry,
      but
      I #8217;m
      not
      in
      any
      kind
      of
      position
      to
      step
      up
      and
      fill
      that
      place
      for
      your
      children.
      I
      know
      that
      I #8217;m
      not
      ready
      to
      accept
      the
      responsibilities
      of
      fatherhood
      and
      I
      would
      rather
      hold
      off
      for
      now
      than
      be
      a
      bad
      parent
      to
      your
      children.
      I
      wish
      you
      the
      best,
      through. #8221;
      then
      that #8217;s
      a
      much
      more
      acceptable
      response.
      And
      it #8217;s
      generally
      along
      the
      lines
      of
      what
      I
      say
      when
      I #8217;m
      faced
      with
      that
      kind
      of
      situation.
      It
      usually
      goes
      over
      just
      fine
      for
      me.

      So
      because
      Sam
      Walton
      is
      supposedly
      an
      anti
      gun
      cuck,
      you #8217;re
      gonna
      go
      to
      Walmart
      and
      ruin
      some
      random
      ass
      employee #8217;s
      day
      in
      order
      to
      spite
      the
      multi
      billionaire
      who #8217;s
      literally
      so
      rich,
      that
      he
      never
      even
      has
      to
      set
      foot
      in
      one
      of
      his
      stores
      ever
      again?
      That #8217;s
      not
      political
      activism.
      That #8217;s
      just
      being
      a
      prick.

      Post
      Malone
      and
      Ozzy
      Osbourne
      recently
      collaborated
      on
      a
      song
      and
      there
      were
      some
      people
      who
      had
      never
      heard
      of
      Ozzy
      before.
      Although
      a
      lot
      of
      those
      people
      were
      trolls.
      It #8217;s
      kinda
      like
      how
      Kanye
      West
      and
      Paul
      McCartney
      did
      a
      collab
      a
      couple
      of
      years
      back
      and
      people
      were
      saying
      that
      Kanye
      was
      a
      great
      guy
      for
      boosting
      unknown
      artists.

      So
      fun
      little
      story
      that #8217;s
      slightly
      related.
      When
      I
      was
      a
      kid,
      my
      father
      ran
      a
      parking
      lot
      sweeping
      business
      and
      every
      night,
      he
      would
      have
      to
      go
      clean
      up
      the
      litter
      in
      parking
      lots.
      So,
      he
      taught
      us
      to
      always
      throw
      our
      car
      trash
      into
      those
      parking
      lots
      so
      that
      he
      could
      have
       #8220;job
      security #8221;

      Now
      that
      I #8217;ve
      seen
      this,
      I
      honestly
      want
      to
      hire
      a
      party
      princess
      for
      an
      adult
      party.
      It #8217;d
      be
      dope
      as
      fuck
      to
      do
      shots
      with
      Belle
      or
      some
      shit
      like
      that
      Edit;
      To
      all
      the
      people
      making
      this
      weirdly
      sexual
      and
      comparing
      the
      women
      to
      strippers....
      chill
      homie.
      I
      literally
      just
      want
      to
      take
      shots
      with
      princesses
      and
      then
      do
      some
      to
      karaoke
      to
      some
      Disney
      jams.

      I

      believe

      those

      common
      kingfishers.
      And
      if
      that #8217;s

      both

      Listen
      bud

      your
      experiences
      aren #8217;t

      While

      like
      you
      who

      September

      Whatever
      man.
      I #8217;ll
      let
      the
      likes
      do
      the
      talking
      here.
      If
      you #8217;re
      too
      caught
      up
      in
      your
      own
      blind
      patriotism
      that
      you
      can #8217;t
      objectively
      look
      at
      the
      factual
      events
      of
      September
      12th,
      2001,
      then
      that #8217;s
      on
      you
      bud.
      Factually,
      people
      of
      color
      were
      attacked
      by
      white
      people
      in
      retaliation
      to
      the
      9/11
      terrorist
      attacks.
      Pointing
      that
      fact
      out
      doesn #8217;t
      make
      me
      a
      SJW.
      It
      just
      makes
      me
      aware
      of
      history.
      A
      history
      that
      I
      don #8217;t
      want
      to
      repeat.

      My
      father
      was
      a
      con
      artist
      who
      would
      set
      up
       #8220;small
      business. #8221;
      Apparently,
      you
      can
      claim
      no
      profit
      or
      bankruptcy
      for
      up
      to
      three
      years
      and
      not
      have
      to
      pay
      any
      income
      taxes
      if
      you
      do.
      After
      three
      years,
      the
      business
      would
       #8220;go
      under #8221;
      everything
      would
      get
      liquidated,
      and
      then
      he #8217;d
      start
      a
      new
      small
      business.
      He
      at
      one
      point
      had
      a
      fencing
      company.
      He
      taught
      me
      and
      my
      brothers
      to
      go
      tear
      up
      people #8217;s
      fences
      so
      he
      could
      get
      more
      business.
      He
      had
      a
      painting
      company.
      He
      taught
      us
      to
      go
      graffiti
      random
      people #8217;s
      property.
      He
      had
      a
      parking
      lot
      sweeping
      company.
      He
      taught
      us
      to
      always
      litter
      in
      parking
      lots
      for
       #8220;job
      security. #8221;
      It
      took
      me
      longer
      than
      I #8217;d
      like
      to
      admit
      for
      me
      to
      realize
      how
      fucked
      up
      this
      all
      was.

      Okay,
      so
      serious
      question
      on
      this
      end.
      I
      will
      admit
      to
      counting
      cards,
      but
      I
      don #8217;t
      gamble
      too
      often
      and
      I
      never
      actually
      was
      taught
      how
      to
      properly
      tip
      at
      a
      blackjack
      table.
      Generally,
      I #8217;ll
      slide
      the
      dealer
      about
      $20
      to
      $50
      depending
      on
      how
      well
      I #8217;ve
      done
      (note
      that
      I
      also
      don #8217;t
      make
      a
      lot
      of
      big
      bets).
      And
      I
      usually
      tip
      when
      either
      I
      leave
      the
      table
      or
      when
      the
      they
      switch
      out
      dealers.
      Is
      that
      a
      pretty
      fair
      way
      of
      tipping?
      Or
      have
      I
      been
      doing
      it
      horribly
      wrong
      this
      entire
      time?

      I #8217;m
      good
      at
      math.
      Learned
      how
      to
      count
      from
      my
      super
      shady
      father.
      Doesn #8217;t
      me
      I
      learned
      a
      lot
      etiquette,
      though.
      I
      do
      appreciate
      the
      answer
      though.
      So
      basically,
      any
      time
      you
      get
      a
      solid
      win,
      you #8217;re
      supposed
      to
      tip
      then.

      I
      happen
      to
      work
      as
      a
      bar
      tender
      at
      an
      upscale
      joint
      and
      this
      was
      something
      that
      I
      observed
      pretty
      recently
      and
      found
      rather
      interesting.
      There
      was
      a
      group
      of
      gentlemen
      who
      were
      there
      for
      a
      business
      event
      and,
      naturally,
      started
      having
      a
      few
      cocktails.
      One
      man
      came
      up
      to
      the
      bar
      and
      asked
      that
      I
      get
      him
      a
       #8220;virgin
      Jack
      and
      Coke. #8221;
      For
      those
      who
      don #8217;t
      know
      the
      first
      thing
      about
      cocktails,
      that
      just
      means
      that
      he
      wants
      a
      alcohol
      free
      Jack
      and
      Coke,
      so...
      a
      just
      a
      Coke.
      I
      obliged
      him
      and
      put
      some
      Coke
      in
      a
      cocktail
      glass
      for
      him.
      He
      later
      explained
      that
      he #8217;d
      been
      sober
      for
      a
      good
      20+
      years
      and
      didn #8217;t
      want
      to
      relapse,
      but
      also
      didn #8217;t
      want
      to
      seem
      out
      of
      place
      with
      the
      other
      guys
      there.
      So,
      I
      suppose
      that
      all
      I #8217;m
      trying
      to
      say
      is
      if
      you
      don #8217;t
      want
      to
      drink,
      but
      you #8217;re
      with
      people
      who
      expect
      you
      to
      and
      don #8217;t
      want
      to
      explain
      your
      situation
      to
      them,
      then
      just
      use
      this
      little
      trick.
      It #8217;s
      pretty
      simple,
      but
      from
      what
      I
      saw,
      no
      one
      ever
      doubted
      the
      gentleman
      for
      a
      second.

      Yeah
      man,
      of
      course.
      I
      get
      people
      in
      all
      the
      time
      who
      don #8217;t
      drink.
      This
      one
      instance
      was
      just
      interesting
      to
      me
      because
      it
      was
      a
      situation
      where
      a
      man
      was
      expected
      to
      drink
      and
      tricked
      everyone
      into
      believing
      that
      he
      was
      drinking.

      The
      pyramids
      were
      constructed
      around
      2589
      BC.
      Rome
      wasn #8217;t
      founded
      until
      753
      BC
      and
      Alexander
      the
      Great
      didn #8217;t
      conquer
      Egypt
      until
      332
      BC
      -
      which
      marked
      the
      beginning
      of
      the
      Greek
      era
      of
      Egyptian
      history.
      That #8217;s
      2,257
      years
      time
      difference.
      For
      reference,
      we
      currently
      live
      2,351
      years
      after
      Alexander
      the
      Great
      conquered
      Egypt.
      So
      to
      put
      it
      simply,
      the
      ancient
      Greeks
      didn #8217;t
      have
      jack
      shit
      to
      do
      with
      the
      construction
      of
      the
      pyramids.
      Oh,
      and
      the
      vast
      majority
      of
      Egyptians
      were/are
      middle
      eastern.
      As
      in
      not
      white.
      Demographically
      speaking.

      Cool??
      What #8217;s
      your
      point?
      I
      acknowledged
      that
      white
      people
      existed
      in
      Egypt
      at
      one
      point.
      Never
      said
      otherwise.
      But
      they
      didn #8217;t
      show
      up
      until
      long
      after
      the
      pyramids
      were
      built.
      And
      if
      you
      want
      to
      argue
      that,
      then
      I #8217;d
      like
      to
      point
      out
      that
      those
      are
      the
      exceptions.
      Not
      the
      standards.
      Otherwise,
      it
      wouldn #8217;t
      be
      significant
      enough
      for
      any
      kind
      of
      archeologist
      to
      mention.
      It #8217;s
      significant
      because
      it #8217;s
      unusual.
      You #8217;re
      argument
      right
      now
      is
      basically
       #8220;They
      found
      this
      one
      dude
      with
      blonde
      hair!
      So
      obviously
      Egypt
      was
      full
      of
      white
      people! #8221;
      That #8217;s
      some
      seriously
      flawed
      logic,
      homie.

      Except
      there
      literally
      weren #8217;t.
      The
      Greeks
      and
      Romans
      didn #8217;t
      start
      showing
      up
      in
      Egypt
      until
      literally
      over
      2,000
      years
      after
      the
      pyramids
      were
      constructed.
      Unless
      you #8217;re
      referencing
      some
      OTHER
      mummies
      with
      blonde
      hair
      than
      the
      ones
      I #8217;m
      familiar
      with
      (which
      were
      dated
      to
      the
      GrecoRoman
      Period
      of
      Egyptian
      history)?
      And
      if
      that
      is
      the
      case,
      I #8217;d
      love
      to
      read
      more
      about
      them
      and
      would
      appreciate
      some
      kind
      of
      a
      source
      to
      validate
      what
      you #8217;re
      saying.
      It
      sounds
      interesting.
      Also,
      this
      post
      isn #8217;t
      attacking
      white
      people.
      If
      that #8217;s
      what
      you
      got
      from
      it,
      then
      that #8217;s
      your
      own
      insecurities
      combining
      with
      alt
      right
      propaganda
      and
      manifesting
      as
      some
      weird
      fear
      of
      potentially
      being
      criticized.
      It #8217;s
      very
      clearly
      a
      criticism
      of
      shows
      like
      Ancient
      Aliens,
      which
      assume
      that
      non-white
      cultures
      were
      incapable
      of
      creating
      massive
      monuments
      without
      the
      help
      of
      extraterrestrials.
      Which
      is
      honestly
      kinda
      racist.
      If
      you
      watch
      the
      shows,
      you #8217;ll
      notice
      that
      they
      rarely
      (if
      ever)
      speculate
      on
      how
      European
      monuments
      and
      wonders
      were
      created.
      Just
      because
      something
      mentions
      white
      people
      doesn #8217;t
      mean
      it #8217;s
       #8220;attacking #8221;
      white
      people.

      I
      actually
      very
      recently
      discussed
      this
      exact
      problem
      in
      a
      post
      about
      women
      archeologists.
      There #8217;s
      plenty
      of
      other
      examples
      (specifically
      the
      medical
      field,
      which
      is
      SUPER
      fucked
      up
      in
      terms
      of
      gender)
      but
      this
      was
      my
      post
      in
      the
      one
      about
      archeology:
       #8220;I
      hate
      to
      be
      *that
      guy*
      but
      there's
      actually
      fewer
      women
      in
      archaeology
      than
      men
      (much
      like
      it
      is
      in
      most
      STEM
      fields)
      and
      it's
      a
      massive
      problem
      because
      it
      completely
      skews
      explanations
      in
      one
      direction

      greatly
      affects
      how
      we
      view
      and
      understand

      We're
      basically
      erasing

      of
      the
      story.
      A
      prime
      example
      of
      this
      is
      the
      famous
      ["Rod

      Hopefully
      this
      is
      enough
      to
      at
      least
      make
      you

      if
      not,
      I
      can
      go
      into
      more
      detail
      about
      the
      issues

      gender
      discrepancy

      Well
      archeology
      and
      anthropology
      (which
      are
      hard
      sciences)
      are
      a
      lot
      more
      than
      just
      numbers.
      It #8217;s
      essentially
      speculation
      on
      the
      though
      process
      of
      people
      of
      the
      past.
      And
      half
      of
      those
      people
      are
      women.
      So,
      if
      you
      only
      ask
      men
      a
      question,
      then
      you
      never
      get
      a
      woman #8217;s
      perspective.
      Which
      could
      be
      radically
      different.
      Namely,
      the
       #8220;Rod
      With
      Breasts #8221;
      example
      that
      I
      gave
      in
      my
      previous
      post.
      As
      for
      the
      other
      aspect
      of
      your
      argument,
      you #8217;re
      focused
      entirely
      too
      much
      on
      the
      end
      result.
      Which
      isn #8217;t
      the
      problem
      that
      anyone
      has.
      No
      one
      is
      saying
      that
      women
      are
      needed
      to
      validate
      men #8217;s
      numbers.
      Instead,
      they #8217;re
      saying
      that
      there
      is
      an
      inherent
      discrimination
      against
      women
      in
      STEM
      fields.
      Unfortunately,
      I
      can #8217;t
      find
      the
      picture
      right
      now,
      but
      there
      was
      an
      image
      going
      around
      a
      subreddit
      here
      (I
      believe
      r/murderedbywords
      )
      which
      showed
      a
      model
      or
      pageant
      winner
      being
      ridiculed
      and
      insulted
      by
      various
      people
      for
      being
       #8220;too
      smart #8221;
      and
      that
      took
      away
      from
      her
      beauty.
      If
      I
      can
      find
      the
      picture,
      I #8217;ll
      happily
      share
      it.
      But
      THAT
      is
      the
      issue.
      The
      fact
      that
      women
      are
      outright
      discouraged
      from
      entering
      the
      STEM
      field
      from
      the
      very
      beginning.
      And
      then,
      those
      that
      DO
      enter
      the
      STEM
      field
      often
      face
      a
      higher
      level
      of
      scrutiny
      than
      their
      male
      counterparts
      because
      they #8217;re
      a
      woman.
      In
      essence,
      the
      other
      people
      in
      the
      field
      carefully
      watch
      for
      the
      women
      to
      make
      a
      mistake
      so
      that
      they
      can
      point
      it
      out
      and
      then
      say
       #8220;It #8217;s
      because
      she #8217;s
      a
      woman! #8221;
      Despite
      the
      fact
      that
      men
      make
      just
      as
      many
      mistakes.
      They
      simply
      aren #8217;t
      watched
      as
      carefully.
      The
      problem
      isn #8217;t
      that
      men
      and
      women
      produce
      different
      results.
      The
      problem
      is
      that
      women
      are
      taught
      that
      they #8217;re
      not
      supposed
      to
      enter
      the
      STEM
      field
      because
      they
      should
      do
       #8220;woman #8217;s
      work #8221;
      instead.
      Like
      teach.
      Or
      secretary
      work.
      Edit:
      It
      took
      me
      a
      little
      while,
      but
      I
      found
      [the
      post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MurderedByWords/comments/cr4u0k/apparently_its_impossible_for_women_to_be_smart/?utm_source=share amp;utm_medium=ios_app amp;utm_name=iossmf)
      that
      I
      was
      thinking
      of.
      As
      I
      said,
      despite
      being
      a
      qualified
      woman
      in
      a
      STEM
      field,
      she #8217;s
      being
      openly
      mocked,
      ridiculed,
      and
      discredited
      for
      not
      other
      reason
      than
      the
      fact
      that
      she #8217;s
      a
      woman.

      Quick
      little
      fun
      fact
      about
      that
      verse
      and
      what
      it
      REALLY
      means.
      TL;DR
      -
      1
      Corinthians
      6:9
      is
      actually
      about
      taking
      advantage
      of
      and
      raping
      underage
      slave
      boys
      and
      also
      not
      doing
      your
      duty
      to
      society
      as
      a
      man.
      1
      Corinthians
      6:9
      translates
      very
      poorly
      from
      Ancient
      Greek.
      But
      it #8217;s
      generally
      agreed
      upon
      by
      most
      historians
      now
      that
      it
      doesn #8217;t
      say
       #8220;men
      who
      sleep
      with
      men. #8221;
      Instead,
      it
      references
      underaged
      slave
      boys.
      There
      are
      two
      words
      that
      are
      often
      misinterpreted
      from
      this
      little
      passage.
      The
      first
      is
       #8220;Malakoi #8221;
      which
      doesn #8217;t
      directly
      translate
      into
      English,
      but
      generally
      is
      used
      to
      describe
      a
      man
      to
      over
      indulges
      in
      feminine
      activities.
      As
      in,
      he
      fights
      poorly
      in
      battle,
      can #8217;t
      tolerate
      hard
      labor,
      or
      allows
      himself
      to
      be
      governed
      by
      emotion
      rather
      than
      reason.
      (Note:
      I
      acknowledge
      the
      sexist
      tones
      here.
      I #8217;m
      just
      explaining
      the
      Ancient
      Greek
      way
      of
      thinking
      and
      understanding
      of
      the
      word.)
      In
      the
      KJV,
       #8220;Malakoi #8221;
      is
      translated
      to
       #8220;effeminate. #8221;
      It
      isn #8217;t
      until
      much
      later
      that
      they
      change
      the
      translation
      to
       #8220;the
      sexually
      immoral. #8221;
      That
      is
      not
      the
      correct
      translation
      of
      the
      word.
      The
      second
      word
      is
       #8220;Arsenokoitai #8221;
      which
      didn #8217;t
      appear
      in
      language
      until
      after
      Paul
      wrote
      this
      letter.
      Simply
      put,
      it #8217;s
      a
      word
      that
      Paul
      made
      up.
      In
      the
      modern
      world,
      it #8217;s
      generally
      the
      word
      that
      gets
      translated
      to
       #8220;men
      who
      have
      sex
      with
      men. #8221;
      But
      again,
      this
      isn #8217;t
      that
      accurate.
       #8220;Arsen #8221;
      means
       #8220;male #8221;
      while
       #8220;Koites #8221;
      means
       #8220;bed. #8221;
      So
      the
      word
      most
      closely
      translates
      to
       #8220;male
      beds. #8221;
      That
      could
      carry
      a
      homosexual
      connotation
      to
      it,
      however
      there
      already
      exist
      several
      words
      in
      Ancient
      Greek
      to
      describe
      a
      man
      who
      has
      sex
      with
      men.
      And
      Paul
      was
      a
      very
      direct
      person
      in
      most
      of
      his
      writings.
      He
      didn #8217;t
      sugar
      coat
      things.
      So,
      if
      that
      were
      the
      problem,
      he
      likely
      would
      have
      directly
      mentioned
      homosexual
      men.
      Instead,
      you
      should
      understand
      sex
      as
      the
      Romans
      did
      before
      making
      assumptions.
      See,
      they
      didn #8217;t
      think
      in
      terms
      of
      heterosexual
      vs
      homosexual.
      They
      though
      in
      terms
      of
      power.
      The
      role
      of
      a
      freeborn
      Roman
      citizen
      was
      to
      penetrate.
      The
      role
      of
      a
      woman
      and
      of
      a
      slave
      was
      to
      be
      penetrated.
      To
      penetrate
      another
      person
      was
      to
      exert
      power
      over
      them.
      And
      it
      was
      common
      practice
      for
      Roman
      men
      to
      keep
      young
      boys
      around
      for
      exactly
      that
      purpose.
      They
      were
      essentially
      sex
      slaves
      and
      often
      referred
      to
      as
       #8220;bed
      keepers. #8221;
      So,
      when
      Paul
      condemns
      those
      who
      participate
      in
       #8220;male
      beds, #8221;
      it #8217;s
      highly
      likely
      that
      he #8217;s
      talking
      about
      the
      practice
      of
      keeping
      young
      boys
      as
      sex
      slaves.
      Not
      the
      sex
      between
      two
      consenting
      adults.

      You #8217;re
      equating
      the
      actions
      taking
      by
      people
      to
      the
      content
      of
      the
      books.
      I
      never
      said
      that
      Christians
      were
      chill
      with
      homosexuality.
      I
      simply
      explained
      the
      meaning
      of
      the
      words
      used
      in
      the
      passage
      that
      the
      person
      in
      the
      pic
      referenced.
      If
      you
      want
      to
      be
      pissed
      at
      Christians
      for
      hating
      homosexuals,
      then
      cool.
      I
      am
      too.
      As
      a
      Christian,
      I #8217;m
      pissed
      about
      it,
      in
      fact.
      But
      all
      I #8217;m
      doing
      here
      is
      explaining
      why
      this
      particular
      verse
      doesn #8217;t
      have
      anything
      to
      do
      with
      homosexuality.
      And
      that #8217;s
      not
      sugar
      coating
      anything
      -
      that #8217;s
      being
      more
      educated
      on
      a
      subject
      than
      the
      general
      population.

      That #8217;s
      simply
      because
      you
      don #8217;t
      understand
      the
      connotation
      of
      the
      words.
      The
      people
      of
      that
      time
      would
      have.
      And
      the
      words
      that
      Paul
      used
      carried
      a
      connotation
      that
      implied
      boy
      slaves.
      It #8217;s
      like
      how
      today,
      if
      you
      see
      a
      young
      girl
      call
      a
      young
      boy
      around
      her
      age
       #8220;daddy #8221;
      then
      you
      know
      -
      as
      someone
      living
      in
      2019
      -
      that
      the
      man
      is
      probably
      not
      her
      father.
      And
      I
      already
      said
      in
      the
      original
      post
      that
      I
      don #8217;t
      agree
      with
      the
      fem-phobia.
      I
      agree
      that
      it #8217;s
      sexist.
      But
      it #8217;s
      not
      homophobic.
      Which
      is
      the
      point
      I #8217;m
      making.
      Don #8217;t
      assume
      that
      I
      agree
      with
      what
      Paul
      said
      just
      because
      I
      understand
      what
      he
      said.
      If
      you
      want
      to
      criticize
      the
      Bible,
      then
      go
      ahead.
      There #8217;s
      plenty
      to
      discuss.
      But
      I #8217;m
      simply
      explaining
      the
      ACTUAL
      CONTENT
      of
      the
      book
      rather
      than
      the
      gross
      mistranslation
      that
      people
      assume
      to
      be
      true.

      Nope,
      I
      don #8217;t.
      Instead,
      I
      just
      spent
      my
      early
      years
      learning
      modern
      Greek
      from
      my
      grandfather
      who #8217;s
      from
      Greece
      then
      later
      spent
      four
      years
      in
      college
      studying
      ancient
      Greek
      and
      Latin
      as
      well
      as
      classical
      literature.
      Mind
      if
      I
      ask
      what
      your
      credentials
      are?

      It #8217;s
      important
      to
      note
      that
      creating

      Damn,

      That #8217;s

      Maybe

      I
      would
      say
      that
      what
      you #8217;re
      describing
      is
      kind
      of
      the
       #8220;extreme
      tolerance #8221;
      for
      lack
      of
      a
      better
      term.
      And
      in
      instances
      like
      that,
      I
      agree.
      That
      being
      said,
      I
      don #8217;t
      necessarily
      think
      that
      white
      Americans
      like
      me
      should
      be
      braiding
      feathers

      their
      hair
      or
      wearing

      Things
      that
      have
      a
      deeper
      or
      spiritual
      meaning
      and
      carry
      great
      significance
      to
      the
      original

      shouldn #8217;t
      be
      made
      into
      trivial
      fashion
      statements.
      To
      put
      it
      in
      perspective
      -
      can
      you
      imagine
      the
      shit
      storm
      that
      would
      happen
      if
      someone
      made
      Bible
      themed
      lingerie?

      Apologies
      for
      taking
      so
      long
      to
      get
      back
      to
      you
      on
      this.
      Had
      a
      pretty
      busy
      weekend
      in
      the
      real
      world.
      Now,
      on
      to
      the
      actual
      argument
      at
      hand.\~\~\~
      You're
      correct
      -
      Paul
      could
      have
      used
      much
      more
      direct
      and
      precise
      language.
      I
      openly
      admitted
      in
      my
      very
      first
      post
      that
      the
      use
      of
      the
      words
      "male
      beds"
      could,
      in
      fact,
      carry
      a
      homosexual
      connotation.
       gt;So
      the
      word
      most
      closely
      translates
      to
       #8220;male
      beds. #8221;
      That
      could
      carry
      a
      homosexual
      connotation
      to
      it
      Your
      next
      argument
      seems
      to
      be
      arguing
      against
      noting.
      For
      whatever
      reason,
      you
      seem
      to
      have
      made
      the
      assumption
      that
      I'm
      claiming
      that
      Christian
      culture
      is
      secretly
      100%
      okay
      with
      homosexuality
      or
      that
      the
      Bible
      isn't
      homophobic.
      I
      can't
      stress
      this
      enough
      -
      ***THAT
      IS
      NOT
      WHAT
      I
      AM
      SAYING.***
      If
      you
      would
      like
      to
      discuss
      the
      morality
      of
      the
      Bible,
      I
      ask
      that
      you
      please
      take
      that
      discussion
      somewhere
      else.
      I'm
      not
      here
      to
      talk
      about
      that.
      I'm
      here
      to
      talk
      about
      the
      meaning
      of
      the
      words
      used
      in
      this
      exact
      context.
      Instead,
      what
      I'm
      saying
      is
      that
      this
      specific
      verse

      Corinthians
      6;9)
      isn't
      nearly
      as
      direct
      and
      straightforward
      as
      the
      man
      in
      the
      picture
      (left)
      makes
      it
      out
      to
      be.
      He
      would
      have
      you
      believe
      that
      the
      English
      Standard
      translation
      is
      a
      direct
      translation
      when
      it
      reads
      as
      "the
      sexually
      immoral"
      and
      "men
      who
      practice
      homosexuality."
      It
      doesn't
      take
      my
      level
      of
      education
      to
      see
      that
      those
      two
      phrases
      are
      VERY
      different
      from
      the
      words
      "effeminate"
      and
      "male
      beds."
      If
      you
      refuse
      to
      acknowledge
      those
      differences,
      then
      that's
      entirely
      on
      you.
      Next,
      you
      seem
      a
      bit
      upset
      with
      me
      for
      revealing
      my
      actual
      credentials
      on
      this
      subject
      and
      accuse
      me
      of
      only
      valuing
      appeal
      to
      authority.
      I'd
      like
      to
      point
      out
      that
      you're
      the
      one
      who
      originally
      called
      my
      credentials
      into
      question
      by
      saying,
       gt;So
      I
      suppose
      you
      have
      a
      Greek
      Urban-dictionary
      in
      your
      pocket.
      Yeah,
      no...
      You
      questioned
      my
      knowledge
      on
      the
      subject
      at
      hand
      (in
      a
      very
      needlessly
      sarcastic
      way,
      might
      I
      add)
      and
      I
      answered
      you
      by
      explaining
      my
      level
      of
      education
      on
      the
      subject.
      Don't
      you
      dare
      try
      and
      fault
      me
      for
      that.
      As
      for
      Kevin
      DeYoung,
      let's
      break
      every
      aspect
      of
      this
      down.
      *
      His
      PhD
      is
      in
      early
      modern
      history,
      not
      any
      kind
      of
      language
      studies.
      While
      I
      acknowledge
      that
      he
      is
      qualified
      to
      discuss
      history,
      I
      would
      NOT
      trust
      him
      to
      translate
      Ancient
      Greek
      texts
      into
      English.
      Unless,
      of
      course,
      he
      has
      some
      other
      training
      that
      I'm
      unaware
      of.
      *
      I
      realize
      that
      this
      is
      a
      bit
      of
      an
      ad
      hominem,
      but
      he
      completed
      his
      undergrad
      at
      Gordon-Conwell
      Theological
      Seminary.
      I
      hate
      to
      say
      it,
      but
      I
      think
      it's
      safe
      to
      assume
      that
      his
      school
      of
      choice
      probably
      wasn't
      completely
      unbiased
      in
      its
      curriculum.
      *
      The
      article
      in
      question
      is
      a
      valid
      argument.
      I
      acknowledge
      that.
      But
      again,
      we
      see
      DeYoung's
      bias
      coming
      out
      when
      he
      makes
      the
      claim
      "there
      is
      no
      real
      other
      interpretation"
      I
      genuinely
      dislike
      any
      claim
      that
      there
      is
      only
      one
      possible
      way
      to
      understand
      a
      word.
      To
      be
      quite
      frank,
      that's
      bullshit.
      But
      my
      personal
      opinions
      aside,
      I
      gave
      a
      potential
      alternative
      interpretation
      that
      does
      make
      a
      lot
      of
      sense
      with
      the
      way
      that
      other
      writers
      of
      the
      time
      were
      describing
      young
      male
      slaves
      -
      "bed
      keepers."
      *
      If
      Paul
      were
      directly
      pulling
      from
      Leviticus,
      why
      would
      he
      go
      out
      of
      his
      way
      to
      combine
      the
      two
      words
      rather
      than
      simply
      keeping
      them
      separate?
      If
      that's
      the
      case,
      then
      it's
      almost
      undoubtedly
      a
      misquote
      on
      Paul's
      part.
      Which,
      I
      again
      acknowledge
      as
      a
      possibility.
      However,
      based
      on
      your
      arguments,
      DeYoung's
      arguments,
      and
      my
      understanding
      of
      Paul
      as
      a
      person,
      it's
      very
      unlikely
      that
      Paul
      would
      misquote
      the
      Torah.
      \~\~\~
      Ultimately,
      we
      can
      sit
      and
      speculate
      on
      what
      this
      verse
      says
      for
      hours
      on
      end.
      But
      I'm
      telling
      you,
      factually,
      that
      it
      **does
      not
      say**
      "the
      sexually
      immoral"
      nor
      does
      it
      say
      "men
      who
      practice
      homosexuality."
      If
      you,
      or
      anyone
      else,
      chooses
      to
      believe
      in
      that
      *interpretation*,
      then
      I
      can't
      and
      won't
      stop
      you.
      But
      you
      can't
      accept
      that
      *translation*.
      I'm
      not
      trying
      to
      tell
      you
      (or
      anyone
      else)
      what
      you
      should
      and
      shouldn't
      believe.
      I'm
      simply
      trying
      to
      offer
      you
      a
      better
      translation
      and
      some
      added
      context
      so
      that
      you
      can
      have
      a
      better
      understand
      of
      the
      real
      meaning
      of
      the
      verse
      -
      whatever
      that
      meaning
      might
      be.
      Feel
      free
      to
      resent
      me
      for
      that
      as
      much
      as
      you
      like.

      OP,
      I'm
      so
      sorry.
      I
      know
      the
      whole
      meaning
      behind
      this
      sub
      and
      as
      per

      this
      undoubtedly
      belongs
      here.
      But
      I
      just
      can't
      bring
      myself
      to
      upvote
      it.

      At
      this
      point,
      we're
      only
      talking
      in
      circles
      so
      I'm
      going
      to
      keep
      this
      brief.
      The
      most
      direct
      translation
      of
      the
      words
      are
      "effeminate"
      and
      "male
      beds."
      The
      incorrect
      translations
      are
      "sexually
      immoral"
      and
      "men
      who
      practice
      homosexuality."
      That
      is
      my
      only
      point.
      Nothing
      else
      matters
      to
      me.
      If
      you
      want
      to
      talk
      about
      Christian
      history
      of
      homophobia,
      I
      literally
      couldn't
      care
      any
      less.
      I'm
      only
      translating
      this
      verse
      and
      explaining
      why
      it's
      far
      from
      being
      as
      straightforward
      as
      many
      Christians
      make
      it
      out
      to
      be.
      I'm
      explaining
      why
      it
      doesn't
      say
      "sexually
      immoral"
      or
      "men
      who
      practice
      homosexuality."
      I
      honestly
      don't
      know
      why
      you
      have
      a
      problem
      with
      that,
      but
      oh
      well.
      Here
      we
      are.
      Oh,
      and
      since
      you
      brought
      it
      up.
       gt;If
      asked
      about
      it,
      Paul
      would
      have
      clearly
      condemned
      homosexuality
      like
      any
      early
      Christian
      or
      Jew.
      We
      can't
      ask
      him.
      He's
      dead.
      So,
      we
      have
      to
      translate
      what
      he
      wrote
      and
      try
      to
      understand
      the
      meaning
      to
      the
      best
      of
      our
      abilities.
      Which
      is
      what
      I'm
      attempting
      to
      do
      here.
      Also,
      since
      you
      mention
      this
      point
       gt;the
      overall
      context
      is
      one
      of
      sexual
      repression
      and
      disgust
      for
      male
      homosexual
      relationships
      The
      entire
      point
      of
      this
      letter
      written
      by
      Paul
      is
      talking
      about
      Christians
      in
      Corinth
      getting
      into
      legal
      disputes,
      which
      Paul
      is
      vehemently
      against.
      This
      is
      the
      only
      time
      in
      this
      entire
      letter
      when
      he
      mentions
      anything
      even
      vaguely
      homoerotic.
      So
      if
      you
      want
      to
      know
      the
      real
      meaning
      behind
      1
      Corinthians,
      it
      can
      basically
      be
      boiled
      down
      to
      "Don't
      sue
      each
      other."
      I've
      made
      my
      point.
      I
      don't
      care
      how
      you
      choose
      to
      interpret
      the
      verse.
      I
      don't
      care
      about
      the
      history
      of
      Christian
      homophobia.
      I'm
      here
      to
      talk
      about
      translations.
       gt;
      Your
      arguments
      are
      side-steps
      from
      the
      real
      issue.
      That's
      incorrect.
      Your
      personal
      issues
      with
      the
      verse
      simply
      don't
      relate
      to
      my
      original
      argument.
      And
      until
      they
      do,
      I'm
      done
      trying
      to
      explain
      the
      definitions
      of
      words.
      Edit:
      I #8217;d
      also
      like
      to
      point
      out
      that
      the
      argument
      that
      Paul
      holds
      the
      same
      ideologies
      and
      sentiments
      as
      the
      majority
      of
      other
      early
      Christians
      is
      very
      false.
      A
      good
      portion
      of
      his
      writings
      are
      letters
      to
      other
      Christians

      Personally,
      I
      came
      to
      view
      that
      as
      more
      of
      a
      tragedy
      than
      a
      love
      story.
      The
      implication,
      for
      me
      at
      least,
      is
      that
      Sakura
      clearly
      has
      some
      kind
      of
      attachment
      issues
      for
      reasons
      that
      aren #8217;t
      fully,
      if
      ever,
      explored.
      I
      can #8217;t
      think
      of
      any
      other
      real
      reason
      why
      she
      would
      obsess
      that
      much
      over
      someone
      who
      literally
      abandoned
      and
      then
      (repeatedly)
      tried
      to
      kill
      her.
      Meanwhile,
      Sauske
      took
      advantage
      of
      Sakura #8217;s
      devotion
      and
      used
      her
      as
      a
      step
      towards
      him
      rebuilding
      the
      Uchiha
      clan.
      And
      did
      so
      knowingly,
      at
      that.
      For
      me,
      it #8217;s
      pretty
      apparent
      that
      he
      doesn #8217;t
      care
      for
      Sakura
      the
      way
      she
      cares
      for
      him.
      If
      he
      cares
      at
      all.
      Of
      course,
      that
      might
      just
      be
      me
      looking
      for
      some
      kind
      of
      a
      silver
      lining
      or
      giving
      the
      author
      more
      credit
      than
      he
      really
      deserves.
      But,
      that #8217;s
      how
      I
      choose
      to
      look
      at
      it.

      Gee,
      maybe
      we
      should
      try
      to
      fix
      that
      problem
      by
      giving
      millennials
      more
      disposable
      income.
      Perhaps
      raising
      the
      federal
      minimum
      wage
      would
      help?
      Oh
      wait....

       #8220;I
      feel
      insecure
      when
      I
      see
      people
      who
      think
      and
      act
      differently
      from
      me!
      How
      should
      I
      deal
      with
      that?
      Hmm....
      oh
      I
      know!
      I #8217;ll
      go
      online
      and
      bulky
      a
      child!
      That
      way,
      everyone
      will
      see
      that
      I #8217;m
      much

      more
