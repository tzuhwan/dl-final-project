      I #8217;m
      black
      and
      I
      love
      metal.
      From
      my
      experience,
      I #8217;ve
      been
      told
      metal
      is
       #8220;white
      people #8221;
      music
      and
      that
      it
      isn #8217;t
      culturally
      compatible
      with
      black
      people.
      Also,
      coming
      from
      a
      religious
      background
      in
      the
      black
      community
      metal
      is
      associated
      with
       #8220;devil
      music #8221;
      so
      I
      didn #8217;t
      grow
      up
      with
      anyone
      in
      my
      community
      who
      enjoyed
      metal.
      Just
      my
      experience.

      I
      forgive
      you,
      but
      the
      fact
      that
      this
      riles
      you
      up
      is
      sad.
      Why
      does
      being
      a
      part
      of
      the
      Clique
      have
      to
      do
      with
      anyone
      being
      aware
      of
      their
      music?
      Or
      that
      Stressed
      Out
      was
      the
      first
      song
      for
      some?
      (it
      was
      all
      over
      the
      radio
      and
      other
      media).
      You
      should
      probably
      just
      chill
      out
      in
      those
      flamingo
      clouds
      and
      go
      watch
      some
      anime
      and
      take
      a
      load
      off
      pal.
      I
      don #8217;t
      see
      why
      you #8217;re
       #8220;Stressed
      Out #8221;
      lol
      okay

      I

      I #8217;m
      my
      opinion
      established
      Em
      as
      a
      hip
      hop
      producer.

      lyrical
      delivery
      on
      that

      as
      its

      I #8217;d
      give
      it
      the
      small
      edge
      over
      MMLP,
      but
      I
      think
      everyone
      would
      agree
      that
      both
      albums
      are
      Em #8217;s
      best
      work.

      I
      have
      a
      question
      guys,
      I #8217;m
      planning
      on
      applying
      for
      the
      JET
      program
      2020.
      I #8217;m
      currently
      in
      college
      and
      I #8217;m
      not
      yet
      a
      US
      citizen
      (I #8217;m
      in
      the
      process
      of
      naturalization
      right
      now).
      I
      also
      graduate
      this
      coming
      spring
      with
      my
      Bachelor
      of
      Arts
      degree
      in
      Asian
      Studies.
      My
      worry
      is
      if
      I
      don #8217;t
      finish
      the
      naturalization
      process
      in
      time
      would
      that
      affect
      me?
      Should
      I
      wait
      to
      apply
      or
      apply
      now?
      I #8217;d
      love
      to
      hear
      some
      feedback
      thank
      you.

      Hey
      guys,
      I #8217;m
      an
      Asian
      Studies
      Major
      here
      in
      New
      York
      City
      and
      I #8217;m
      taking
      a
      philosophy
      class
      on
      Buddhism.
      It #8217;s
      one
      of
      the
      most
      interesting
      courses
      I #8217;ve
      ever
      taken
      but
      one
      of
      the
      most
      hard
      to
      grasp
      conceptually.
      I
      have
      an
      essay
      to
      write
      next
      month
      and
      I #8217;ve
      chose
      the
      topic
      of
      comparing
      and
      contrasting
      Theravada
      and
      Mahayana.
      Any
      good
      academic
      links
      to
      a
      break
      down
      of
      each
      tradition?
      And
      those
      who
      practice
      either
      or
      both
      any
      advice?
      Thanks
      much
      appreciated!

      This
      book
      is
      so
      good,
      I #8217;d
      recommend
      this
      to
      anyone
      who
      loves
      Chinese
      cuisine
      and
      culture.
      I #8217;m
      learning
      a
      lot
      while
      getting
      hungry.

      Thanks
      you
      so
      much
      for
      the
      insight!
      I #8217;ll
      take
      this
      into
      consideration
      when
      writing
      my
      paper.
      Buddhism
      is
      so
      vast
      and
      interesting
      that
      I
      get
      lost
      sometimes.
      My
      other
      topic
      of
      interest
      that
      my
      professor
      added
      to
      the
      list
      of
      topics
       #8220;Is
      the
      Mahayana
       #8220;reformation #8221;
      of
      Theravada
      at
      all
      comparable
      to
      the
      Protestant
       #8220;reformation #8221;
      of
      Roman
      Catholicism. #8221;
      But
      you #8217;re
      advice
      on
      narrowing
      it
      down
      makes
      sense,
      I #8217;ve
      been
      reading
      much
      about
      Zen
      for
      this
      course
      as
      well,
      currently
      reading
      Zen
      in
      the
      art
      of
      Archery
      by
      Herringel.
      Thanks
      a
      lot!

      Will
      make
      note
      of
      this,
      I #8217;ve
      never
      read
      any
      of
      his
      material
      before
      my
      professor
      gave
      us
      a
      list
      of
      different
      books
      to
      use
      and
      I
      juts
      picked
      his
      because
      I
      was
      interested
      in
      Zen.
      I #8217;ve
      read
      Alan
      Watts
      as
      well,
      I #8217;ll
      keep
      that
      in
      mind
      when
      reading
      his
      material.
      Didn #8217;t
      know
      about
      the
      Nazi
      relation
      as
      well,
      knew
      he
      was
      German
      but
      thanks
      for
      the
      information
      and
