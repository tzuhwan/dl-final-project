      Will
      it
      really
      bother
      you
      to
      see
      her?
      If
      so
      maybe
      it's
      not
      the
      best
      idea.
      Alcohol
      is
      great,
      but
      afterwards
      or
      during
      it
      might
      really
      upset
      you
      to
      see
      her
      if
      she's
      with
      someone
      or
      etc.
      Partying
      is
      great,
      I've
      heard,
      but
      it
      sounds
      like
      unless
      you
      too
      get
      along
      it's
      not
      the
      best
      idea.
      Sorry
      to
      be
      so...
      sober
      about
      it
      lol.

      lol
      but
      some
      woman
      at
      the
      front,
      in
      full
      on
      makeup
      like
      Milan
      level
      shit,
      asked
      for
      3
      hours
      then
      left.
      And
      I
      hear
      people
      barfing.
      Yikes

      Go
      home.
      Trust
      me.
      I'm
      an
      idiot
      and
      done
      a
      lot
      of
      really
      stupid
      things.
      That
      situation
      has
      no
      good
      ending
      other
      than
      you
      not
      going,
      or
      leaving
      asap.
      I
      know
      I
      sound
      like
      a
      mom,
      but
      I've
      been
      in
      similar
      stuff
      and
      there
      is
      no
      happy
      ending
      especially
      on
      a
      party
      night.
      I
      wish
      you
      the
      best,
      but
      get
      home
      safely
      if
      you
      are
      out
      there,
      because
      the
      wandering
      drunk
      mind
      rarely
      wanders
      anywhere
      good.
      I'm
      on
      all
      night
      to
      talk
      if
      you
      need.

      I'm
      not
      sober,
      I
      just
      drank
      way
      too
      much
      for
      too
      long
      and
      saw
      a
      lot
      happen
      so
      I
      figured
      put
      in
      my
      two
      cents,
      maybe
      help
      someone
      out
      in
      a
      tiny
      way.

      Cheers
      homeslice,
      it
      may
      be
      a
      choice
      for
      some,
      but
      being
      alone
      is
      never
      a
      reason
      to
      not
      have
      a
      stiff
      one.

      The
      sun
      will
      rise,
      make
      sure
      you
      drink
      long
      enough
      to
      see
      it
      !
      Drunk
      sunrise
      is
      a
      pleasure
      I
      have
      seldom
      gotten.
      But
      seriously
      sorry
      about
      that.
      I'll
      raise
      my
      shitty
      sex
      motel
      cup
      to
      you
      in

      I
      think
      that
      might
      be
      a
      calm
      before
      the
      storm,
      a
      way
      of
      not
      recognizing
      the
      major
      impact
      or
      effect
      it
      will
      have.
      I
      Have
      been
      there,
      I
      attempted
      last
      year,
      and
      before
      that
      I
      had
      been
      suicidal
      for
      over
      20
      years.
      I'm
      only
      26
      now,
      and
      honestly
      I
      believe
      that
      calmness
      and
      serenity
      is
      part
      of
      rationalizing
      and
      minimising
      the
      major
      impact
      your
      death
      will
      have.
      Please
      call
      someone
      or
      see
      a
      therapist.
      I
      have
      been
      there,
      and
      it's
      a
      terribly
      seductive
      allure
      of
      "peace"
      but
      it
      isn't,
      it's
      everything
      but.

      For
      them,
      maybe.
      For
      me,
      eh.
      I
      haven't
      had
      a
      drink
      in
      10
      months
      and
      im
      in
      a
      sex
      motel.
      But
      I
      am
      getting
      drunk
      as
      we
      speak.
      Would
      be
      better
      to
      have
      a
      partner
      to
      just
      enjoy
      it
      with,
      but
      hey.
      Ill
      take
      what
      I
      can
      get.

      completely.
      I've
      been
      the
      idiot
      bad
      ideas,
      but
      not
      like
      BAD
      ,
      just
      dumb.
      I
      try
      to
      be
      the
      voice
      of
      reason

      I
      haven't
      drank
      for
      10
      months
      so
      my
      tolerance
      is
      shit
      and,
      nobody
      to
      share
      it
      with
      lol.
      But
      i
      like
      this
      sub

      I'm

      I
      have
      been

      It's

      to
      someone
      dude,
      especially
      who

      Clearly
      you
      and
      her
      are
      going

      else
      all

      But

      So
      I
      bought
      a
      room
      for
      the
      night,
      in
      N.Y.
      area
      that's
      a
      hundred
      bucks.
      But
      they
      a
      posted
      3
      hour
      special
      deal,
      and
      people
      asking
      for
      it.
      Im
      here
      because
      I
      dont
      want
      to
      be
      home,
      right
      now,
      and
      I
      was
      supposed
      to
      be
      with
      a
      friend
      until
      Monday
      but
      they
      made
      ne
      drive
      all
      the
      back
      from
      5
      hours
      away
      and
      then
      left
      without
      a
      goodbye.
      I'm
      not
      into
      the
      activities
      that
      clearly
      go
      on
      here,
      I'm
      just
      taking
      in
      the
      "splendor"
      of
      the
      night.

      thank
      you.
      I
      tried
      to
      not
      only
      keep
      myself
      out
      of
      it,
      but
      create
      a

      possible
      drawing
      of
      myself
      while

      cup,
      cigarettes,
      and
      picture

      or

      I
      just
      didn't
      want
      to
      show
      my
      face
      or
      anything
      but
      wanted
      to
      show
      myself
      in
      a
      way.
      Seriously
      i
      appreciate
      the
      comment.

      It

      Where

      Better

      I've
      never
      considered.
      It
      is
      clean
      and
      heating
      works
      lol.
      So,
      what
      are
      you
      doing
      on
      r
      /
      drunk?

      What
      I
      do
      is,
      Tylenol,
      water
      or
      Powerade.
      Eggs,
      Adderall
      (
      only
      if
      prescribed)
      ,
      caffeine,
      and
      boom.
      You
      will
      feel
      odd
      like
      light.
      But
      it
      will

      It's
      what
      it
      is.
      Great

      times,
      a
      reminder
      of
      our
      communal
      problem
      ay
      others.
      Or
      a
      mix
      of
      both.
      It
      serves
      a
      great
      purpose
      and
      makes
      people
      think.
      I
      love
      this
      sub
      honestly.
      Because
      it's
      real,

      Good
      choice
      for
      your
      point.
      I
      had
      never
      heard
      of
      this
      but
      it
      does
      perfectly
      exemplify
      a
      blameless
      apology
      bullshit
      response.
      Personally
      I
      think
      she
      is
      way
      over
      rated
      in
      terms
      of
      acting
      and
      everything
      else,
      plus
      her
      best
      performance
      was
      in
      winters
      bone
      not
      silver
      linings
      playlist
      imho.
      But
      Hey,
      I'm
      not
      a
      member
      of
      the
      academy
      lol.

      Maybe
      you
      could
      seek
      help,
      or
      talk
      to
      a
      friend.
      That
      seems
      to
      help
      me
      sometimes.
      I
      recently
      have
      lost
      a
      lot
      of
      days,
      sometimes
      it
      feels
      like
      every
      day
      too.
      I'm
      here
      to
      talk
      if
      you
      need.

      You

      you

      I
      feel
      the
      same,
      and
      I've
      come
      to
      the
      small
      realization
      that
      sometimes
      we
      are
      all
      we
      have
      and
      that
      relying
      on
      those
      we
      know
      won't
      be
      there
      is
      just
      perpetuating
      a
      detrimental
      cuddle
      of
      disappointment
      and
      depression.
      I'm
      not
      saying
      I'm
      enlightened,
      im
      majorly
      depressed
      and
      have
      been
      for
      my
      entire
      life.
      I'm
      here
      to
      talk,
      it's
      good
      to
      have
      company
      to
      talk
      about
      this
      to
      even
      if
      it's
      just
      a
      random
      person
      on
      the
      internet.
      I
      care
      about
      everyone,
      while
      that
      doesn't
      sound
      personal,
      it
      is.
      I'm
      here.

      This
      is
      awesome
      news.
      George
      Lucas,
      for
      all
      whatever
      people
      say
      about
      him
      regarding
      the
      prequels,
      is
      a
      visionary
      who
      clearly
      cares
      a
      lot
      about
      film
      and
      the
      projects
      he
      helped
      create
      and
      that
      came
      long
      before
      and
      after
      his
      break
      into
      movies.
      A
      museum
      for
      narrative
      media
      sounds
      incredible,
      and
      im
      sure
      it
      will
      be
      a
      delight.
      American
      graffiti
      is
      a
      classic
      film,
      as
      are
      the
      original
      3
      films,
      and
      if
      I
      make
      over
      to
      California
      once
      this
      is
      done
      I
      will
      happily
      take
      a
      trip
      to
      that
      Museum.

      It
      is
      an
      accurate
      post
      for
      sure.
      I
      saw
      the
      futuristic
      setting
      for
      BO4
      and
      I
      can
      say
      im
      severely
      disappointed.
      I
      figured
      going
      back
      to
      like
      Persian
      gulf
      war
      era
      or
      earlier
      would
      have
      been
      a
      solid
      move,
      given
      the
      firearm
      familiarity
      and
      variability
      as
      well
      as
      a
      continued
      botg
      style.
      The
      gameplay
      reveal
      only
      reiterated
      the
      problems
      I
      saw
      from
      bo3
      and
      people's
      panning
      of
      iw.
      I
      enjoyed
      Iw,
      but
      wwii's
      botg
      felt
      good
      again.
      My
      favorite
      cod
      title
      was
      mw
      followed
      by
      black
      ops
      1,
      and
      I
      think
      many
      were
      severely
      let
      down
      by
      the
      reveal.
      The
      additional
      worrying
      information
      of
      apparently
      no
      single
      player,
      which
      was
      awesome
      in
      both
      BO1
      and
      mw
      1-3
      is
      extremely
      disappointing
      and
      odd.
      I
      was
      not
      the
      biggest
      fan
      of
      wwii
      at
      launch,
      but
      it
      has
      improved.
      I
      enjoy
      the
      new
      weapons
      and
      the
      zombies
      mode
      coming
      out.
      I
      think
      shg
      did
      a
      necessary
      reshuffling
      of
      key
      personnel
      and
      it's
      been
      better.
      I
      also
      will
      say
      at
      present
      I
      don't
      plan
      on
      buying
      bo4
      as
      is.
      Sorry
      for
      long
      post,
      but
      that's
      just
      how
      I
      feel
      and
      maybe
      some
      feel
      the
      same.

      quick
      Google
      search
      because
      a
      lot
      of
      the
      details
      I
      don't
      know,
      but
      they
      are
      difficult
      to
      get
      in
      all
      honesty.
      I
      have
      on
      and
      that
      is
      from
      the
      darkest
      shore.
      I'm
      sorry
      I
      can't
      be
      more
      help
      but
      it
      is
      a
      grind
      to
      get
      any
      of
      them.
      I
      wanted
      to
      get
      more,
      but
      getting
      to
      round
      20
      without
      leaving
      a
      single
      room
      is
      a
      bit
      out
      of
      my
      skill
      range.

      Not

      We
      have
      met
      now
      characters
      by
      the
      end
      of
      season
      3
      but
      Jimmy
      is
      still
      far
      from
      becoming
      Saul
      Goodman.
      It's
      well
      worth
      it
      to
      watch
      the
      show
      and
      catch
      up.
      It
      is
      less
      grand
      than
      bb,
      but
      great
      in
      its
      own
      right
      as
      a
      different
      type
      of
      slow
      burn
      show.
      Seriously
      if
      you
      enjoyed
      bb
      you
      will
      very
      much
      enjoy
      how
      much
      it
      picks
      up
      after
      season
      1.

      I
      don't
      have
      schizophrenia,
      but
      I
      do
      have
      borderline
      personality
      disorder,
      major
      depression
      and
      ADHD.
      I
      have
      been
      hospitalized
      twice
      and
      met
      many
      people
      with
      schizophrenia
      and
      related
      disorders
      like
      schizoaffective
      disorder.
      Most
      recently
      I
      met
      a
      man
      who
      preemptively
      hospitalized
      himself
      because
      he
      was
      having
      paranoid
      delusions
      about
      people
      wanting
      to
      harm
      him,
      people
      did
      not
      want
      to
      and
      he
      knew
      this
      but
      his
      condition
      told
      him
      otherwise.
      He
      received
      care
      and
      treatment
      for
      his
      disorder
      and
      they
      stabilized
      the
      delusions
      and
      he
      left
      more
      stable
      after
      a
      stay
      in
      the
      hospital.
      I
      don't
      think
      it
      is
      selfish
      of
      you
      at
      all
      to
      hospitalize
      yourself
      because
      you
      feel
      something
      bad
      may
      happen
      if
      you
      don't.
      That
      is
      being
      very
      intelligent
      and
      reasonable
      regarding
      the
      treatment
      for
      your
      condition
      and
      cognizant
      of
      what
      you
      need.
      It
      isn't
      selfish
      to
      take
      care
      of
      yourself.
      There
      will
      be
      beds
      for
      those
      who
      need
      them
      and
      you
      need
      to
      prioritize
      your
      recovery.
      I
      was
      hospitalized
      for
      two
      suicide
      attempts
      and
      I
      know
      that
      if
      I
      felt
      that
      way
      again
      to
      the
      point
      where
      I
      would
      consider
      hospitalization
      I
      would
      put
      myself
      in
      to
      protect
      myself.
      I
      think
      you
      sound
      like
      a
      caring
      and
      rational
      person
      and
      my
      advice
      would
      be
      to
      go
      in
      if
      you
      feel
      yourself
      sliding
      to
      a
      place
      that
      is
      awful
      and
      dangerous.
      Sorry
      for
      the
      long
      post
      but
      I
      wish
      you
      the
      best
      in
      this
      tough
      time.

      Specific

      completely

      So
      accurate,
      only
      inclusion
      I
      would
      make
      would

      I
      think
      your
      dissection
      of
      the
      community
      is
      very
      well
      thought
      out
      and
      captures
      what
      really
      happens
      in
      life
      to
      those
      who
      are
      maligned
      and
      who
      cope
      poorly
      with
      that
      self
      hatred
      and
      turmoil.
      A
      great,
      buried,
      post.
      Thank
      you
      for
      sharing
      this.
      I
      post
      somewhat
      infrequently
      but
      I
      just
      wanted
      to
      say
      I
      think
      your
      analysis
      is
      spot
      on.
      I
      hope
      for
      those
      that
      are
      part
      of
      those
      toxic
      communities
      can
      eventually
      get
      help
      too.
      They
      are
      people.
      Just
      like
      all
      of
      us.

      I
      completely
      agree
      with
      this.
      The
      dreadnought
      comparison
      was
      funny
      and
      informative
      plus
      did
      point
      out
      the
      general
      feelings
      that
      I
      think
      many
      fans
      share
      and
      bolster
      prequel
      support.
      Maybe
      it's
      divisive,
      but
      passion
      for
      the
      safe
      in
      general
      I
      think
      is
      good
      and
      personally
      enjoyed
      the
      original
      meme.
      "General
      reposti"
      etc
      can
      get
      a
      little
      tiring,
      even
      though
      obi
      wan
      is
      awesome
      and
      such.

      Completely
      accurate.
      I
      enjoyed
      them
      when
      they
      came
      out,
      and
      duel
      of
      the
      fates
      is
      still
      one
      of
      the
      best
      songs
      in
      the
      series.
      What
      really
      holds
      up
      to
      me
      is
      the
      acting
      of
      ewan
      and
      palpatine,
      I
      think
      they
      are
      bedrock
      when
      it
      comes
      to
      the
      prequels.

      It
      looks
      good.
      I'm
      glad
      you
      shared
      this.
      I
      don't
      suffer
      from
      schizophrenia,
      I
      have
      borderline,
      but
      it
      reminds
      me
      a
      lot
      about
      how
      I
      felt
      when
      I
      was
      inside
      and
      outside.
      I
      would
      like
      to
      know
      what
      you
      intended
      for
      that
      person
      in
      the
      picture
      to
      be
      looking
      at
      as
      they
      hold
      the
      balloon.

      What's
      scary
      is
      there
      are
      kids
      who
      ask
      "are
      all
      episodes
      before
      7
      just
      prequels?"
      Good
      post,
      even
      if
      it's
      a
      repost
      I
      sense
      a
      lot
      of
      accuracy.
      Do
      or
      do
      not.
      There
      is
      no
      try.

      This,
      this
      is
      too
      accurate
      for
      me
      to
      be
      comfortable
      with.

      I
      love
      squidward,
      and
      I
      love
      the
      realism
      of
      this
      meme.
      Is
      it
      the
      mood
      stabilizers
      or
      just
      what
      is
      normal,
      who
      knows?
      Lol.

      I
      think
      that's
      all
      we
      can
      do.
      Dbt
      might
      have
      a
      lot
      of
      holes
      in
      it,
      but
      the
      overall
      message
      makes
      sense.

      I
      have
      felt
      that
      way
      too.
      I
      cover
      my
      arms
      at
      all
      times
      with
      long
      sleeve
      shirts
      and
      jeans
      at
      all
      times,
      even
      in
      the
      summer.
      I
      always
      feel
      some
      camaraderie
      with
      people
      who
      have
      scars,
      but
      I
      know
      the
      feeling
      of
      being
      unable
      to
      say
      something
      because
      of
      company.
      I'm
      sorry
      you
      weren't
      able
      to
      talk
      to
      that
      person,
      but
      this
      seems
      to
      be
      a
      supportive
      subreddit
      and
      your
      post
      is
      nice
      to
      see
      for
      me
      because
      it
      reminds
      me
      that
      I'm
      not
      alone
      and
      someone
      may
      see
      me
      and
      that
      they
      too
      feel
      similarly.
      Thank
      you.
