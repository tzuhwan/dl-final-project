      This
      is
      a
      very,
      very
      important
      post
      to
      me.
      Etoh
      has
      always,
      ALWAYS
      been
      there
      for
      me
      when
      I
      needed
      him.
      I'm
      honestly
      amazed
      that
      he
      was
      able
      to
      put
      up
      with
      me
      whenever
      i
      came
      to
      him
      to
      vent
      about
      tokiiko
      for
      nearly
      two
      years.
      He's
      seriously
      one
      hell
      of
      a
      guy,
      I
      can't
      even
      come
      close
      to
      stressing
      enough
      how
      much
      he's
      helped
      me
      over
      the
      years.
      I
      feel
      incredibly
      lucky
      to
      have
      been
      able
      to
      meet
      him,
      and
      meet
      him
      on
      my
      way
      to
      finally
      move
      cross-country.
      It
      was
      dream-like,
      and
      it's
      memories
      that
      will
      stay
      with
      me
      forever.

      Just
      keep
      doing
      some
      sighted
      solves!
      They
      help
      a
      ton
      with
      identifying
      errors,
      and
      also
      helps
      your
      recognition
      when
      you
      finally
      do
      them
      blind
      since
      your
      setups
      and
      such
      will
      just
      be
      muscle
      memory.

      Oh
      good,
      so
      I'm
      not
      crazy?
      Been
      studying
      Japanese
      for
      ~7
      years
      on
      my
      own,
      picked
      up
      chinese
      in
      the
      last
      2-3
      months
      and
      dabbled
      into
      korean
      right
      before
      that
      with
      the
      same
      goal
      in
      mind.
      Trying
      to
      tackle
      all
      three
      languages
      isn't
      as
      insane
      as
      it
      sounds,
      but
      it
      is
      very
      difficult.
      Japanese
      and
      Korean
      share
      similar-ish
      syntax,
      and
      Japanese
      and
      Chinese
      share
      some
      kanji
      here
      and
      there.
      I'd
      say
      that
      knowing
      so
      much
      Japanese
      at
      least
      enabled
      me
      to
      be
      able
      to
      learn
      kanji
      for
      Chinese
      words
      easier.
      (Not
      so
      much
      that
      I
      "knew"
      the
      kanji
      already,
      but
      I
      knew
      how
      to
      learn
      them
      efficiently
      instead)

      Was
      pretty
      disappointed
      that
      i
      missed
      some
      of
      the
      first
      match
      too,
      started
      watching
      ~20min
      before
      the
      scheduled
      start.
      I'd
      appreciate
      a
      hard
      schedule
      but
      I
      understand
      that
      theres
      also
      an
      audience
      there
      too.
      Unfortunate.

      Also
      it
      should
      be
      kept
      in
      mind
      that
      while
      her
      stats
      aren't
      as
      high
      as
      other
      healers,
      other
      things
      play
      a
      factor
      in
      cummulative
      stats
      that
      we
      see.
      We
      are
      in
      a
      really
      barrier
      heavy/mercy
      heavy
      meta
      so
      Ana
      is
      being
      made
      less
      effective
      by
      other
      sources.
      Maybe
      we
      could
      all
      also
      consider
      reworks/adjustments
      to
      how
      her
      healing
      actually
      works
      with
      these
      things
      aswhell.
      Some
      have
      suggest
      partial
      barrier
      penetration
      (heala
      through
      barrier,
      but
      doesnt
      heal
      as
      much)
      is
      a
      great
      start
      that
      I
      see
      ALL
      the
      time.

      maybe

      I
      think
      it's
      fair
      to
      say
      we
      should
      give
      it
      time.
      Seeing
      teams
      default
      to
      dive
      could
      either
      be
      them
      playing
      what's
      strong,
      but
      could
      also
      be
      their
      comfort
      pick
      that
      they're
      used
      to.
      A
      meta
      thats
      been
      around
      for
      over
      a
      year
      won't
      just
      fade
      away
      a
      few
      weeks
      after
      a
      patch
      (ignoring
      what
      happened
      with
      mercy).
      That
      said,
      I
      think
      we'll
      start
      seeing
      a
      lot
      of
      diverse
      comps
      that
      will
      change
      how
      people
      approach
      different
      maps.

      I
      explained
      pretty
      clearly
      IMO.
      "I

      I
      used
      it
      on
      my
      face
      for
      the
      first
      time
      recently.
      Sideburns
      were
      like
      a
      7/10
      on
      pain
      for
      me,
      chin
      was
      8-9/10.
      My
      lip
      actually
      was
      the
      easiest
      part
      (it
      made
      me
      tear
      up,
      but
      the
      pain
      itself
      wasnt
      terrible).
      The
      length
      the
      hair
      has
      to
      be
      depends
      on
      the
      epilator
      too,
      and
      there
      are
      also
      facial
      epilators.
      Just
      be
      careful
      and
      take
      it
      slow
      or
      you'll
      end
      up
      like
      me
      and
      accidentally
      pulling
      skin
      off
      your
      face.
      Its
      worth
      now
      having
      any
      shadow
      tho
      since
      it
      straight
      up
      removes
      hair.

      8

      how

      Hana
      means
      flower,

      Also

      I've
      heard
      vaguely
      (?)
      that
      epilating
      can
      make
      laser
      or
      electrolysis
      more
      difficult
      in
      the
      future?
      I
      haven't
      looked
      into
      it
      myself.
      Just
      be
      careful
      on
      your
      face,
      I
      made
      the
      mistake
      of
      using
      too
      much
      pressure
      and
      ended
      up
      tweezing
      skin
      off
      my
      face,
      no
      joke.

      Played
      the
      demo,
      and
      I'm
      really
      excited
      for
      the
      release
      now.
      This
      is
      kinda
      refreshing,
      in
      the
      like,
      the
      most
      fucked
      up
      sense.
      I
      typically
      do
      VNs
      for
      the
      sad/happy
      emotions,
      not
      for
      the
      anxiety/depression/rage
      combo
      this
      one
      has
      and
      it's
      kinda
      jarring.

      I
      had
      really,
      really
      thick
      deep
      facial
      hair.
      I
      epilate
      my
      face
      as
      my
      main
      hair
      removal,
      been
      doing
      it
      for
      about
      two
      months.
      The
      first
      round
      hurt
      like
      hell,
      and
      even
      had
      some
      minor
      bleeding.
      Ive
      kept
      up
      with
      it,
      epilating
      about
      two
      or
      three
      times
      a
      week.
      It's
      pretty
      important
      to
      follow
      up
      with
      good
      skin
      care
      stuff
      afterwards,
      at
      least
      some
      kind
      of
      lotion.
      As
      others
      have
      said,
      if
      you
      want
      another
      kind
      of
      hair
      removal
      in
      the
      future
      you
      should
      avoid
      it,
      but
      if
      its
      your
      only
      option
      and
      you
      can
      take
      the
      pain
      for
      the
      first
      time
      then
      nothings
      really
      stopping
      you

      Congrats!
      Huge
      moment
      for

      if

      think
      youre
      overpaying
      for
      yours.
      I

      Epilating
      may
      help.
      Its

      It
      takes
      time
      for
      the

      to
      slow

      hair
      growth
      (and
      ymmv).
      Im
      3.5mo
      HRT
      and
      its
      noticeably
      slower
      and
      thinner.
      First
      time
      epilating
      always
      sucks,
      sometimes
      the
      second
      time
      around
      sucks
      too,
      but
      it
      was

      Oh
      goody,
      I've
      been
      hoping
      to
      hit
      you
      up
      for
      awhile
      from
      seeing
      your
      progress
      pics
      on
      twitter.
      You've
      come
      a
      long
      way,
      but
      shaping
      your
      eyebrows
      from
      the
      bottom
      up
      (increasing
      space
      between
      your
      eye
      and
      line)
      would
      do
      a
      lot
      for
      you.
      I
      like
      the
      glasses,
      they're
      cute
      :)
