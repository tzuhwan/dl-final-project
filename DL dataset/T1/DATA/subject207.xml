      When
      a
      pwBPD
      has
      a
      rage
      do
      they
      like
      writing
      non
      stop
      on
      whatsapp
      or
      everywhere?
      She
      raged
      and
      send
      me
      74
      whatsapp
      texts
      and
      called
      me
      35
      times
      one
      day.
      If
      i
      told
      her
      something
      she
      would
      write
      more
      walls
      of
      texts...like
      blocking
      whatever
      you
      say.
      Also
      some
      people
      point
      out
      that
      they
      lie,
      in
      her
      case
      is
      more
      like
      using
      things
      she
      knew
      about
      you
      which
      are
      true
      but
      exaggerating
      like
      they
      are
      the
      worsts
      things
      or
      something.
      I
      send
      her
      information
      for
      therapy
      in
      dbt
      and
      she
      acted
      like
      i
      wanted
      to
      attack
      her
      with
      psychological
      articles
      and
      send
      me
      one
      about
      victimism
      saying
      that
      i
      had
      that.
      I
      suspect
      she
      is
      also
      narcissistic
      denying
      any
      fault.

      It
      was
      weird
      how
      fast
      and
      how
      many
      messages
      she
      could
      do
      with
      the
      cellphone
      in
      a
      short
      period

      Hmm
      true,
      maybe
      other
      characteristics?
      like
      she
      loved
      talking
      to
      her
      ex
      flaunting
      her
      sexual
      acts
      with
      other
      guys
      (which
      her
      ex
      didn't
      get
      why
      she
      did
      that).

      True.
      II
      don't
      talk
      to
      her
      i'm
      trying
      to
      deal
      with
      the
      aftermath.
      She
      had
      this
      wierd
      tendency
      of
      screaming
      secret
      stuff
      out
      of
      the
      air
      like
      she
      told
      a
      group
      of
      friends
      that
      one
      of
      them
      was
      gay
      (the
      girl
      was
      upset

      she

      The
      tantrum
      was
      about
      two
      problems
      (A
      and
      B)
      so
      she
      complained
      for
      A,
      then
      you
      told
      her
      something
      and
      she
      switched

      She
      thought
      every
      guy
      wanted
      something
      with
      her
      like
      my
      60
      year
      old
      neighbor.
      Also
      she
      changed
      her

      when
      she
      found
      how
      you
      reacted
      about
      something.
      She
      is

      sadly
      is

      How
      it
      started?
      What
      were
      the
      red
      flags?
      As
      a
      way
      of
      reconstruct
      the
      pieces
      together
      of
      her
      acts
      (the
      evolution).
      \-Met
      her,
      she
      was
      a
      friend.
      \-Lies
      to
      her
      uncle
      about
      where
      she
      goes
      and
      uses
      my
      friends
      and
      I
      as
      an
      excuse
      of
      going
      out
      when
      she
      was
      going
      with
      a
      guy.
      \-Lies
      that
      the
      guy
      was
      trying
      to
      take
      advantage
      of
      her
      when
      she
      was
      seeing
      him.
      \-Dated
      a
      friend.
      Was
      his
      first
      then
      she
      cheated
      on
      him
      with
      a
      guy
      with
      alcholism,
      went
      to
      parties,
      had
      sexual
      acts
      with
      fetish.
      Tried
      to
      go
      back
      to
      my
      friend
      after
      that.
      \-She
      met
      what
      she
      call
      "best
      friend"
      (
      call
      her
      Salad)
      I
      don't
      know
      if
      that
      is
      the
      same
      as
      FP.
      \-She
      went
      back
      with
      one
      of
      her
      exes
      while
      trashing
      him.
      \-He
      did
      2
      police
      reports
      on
      her
      saying
      she
      hit
      him.
      She
      denied.
      My
      bf
      discovered
      it
      was
      a
      lie
      and
      then
      she
      changed
      to:
      he
      was
      harassing
      me.
      \-After
      we
      went
      to
      a
      salon
      she
      broke
      a
      police's
      minor
      bite
      and
      started
      to
      insult
      him,
      then
      run
      off.
      \-Salad
      got
      a
      bf.
      She
      fought
      with
      her.
      She
      told
      one
      of
      her
      exes
      that
      she
      slept
      with
      Salad's
      boyfriend
      and
      also
      told
      my
      bf.
      \-She
      lies
      to
      my
      friends
      that
      Salad's
      bf
      cheated
      her
      with
      someone
      unknown
      and
      now
      Salad
      wants
      to
      be
      alone
      like
      for
      her
      recovery
      problems.
      \-Then
      she
      called
      me
      out
      of
      the
      blue
      her
      "best
      friend".
      \-She
      met
      other
      bf's
      friend
      (
      let's
      call
      him
      C)
      and
      he
      ignores
      her.
      She
      threatened
      him
      to
      tell
      his
      gf
      that
      he
      was
      cheating
      with
      her.
      \-She
      fought
      with
      one
      of
      my
      bf's
      friends
      and
      threatened
      with
      killing
      everyone
      with
      a
      knife.
      \-She
      want
      me
      to
      got
      to
      see
      a
      movie
      and
      I
      said
      no
      an
      hour
      before
      so
      she
      got
      pissed
      for
      4
      or
      5
      days
      and
      also
      got
      upset
      with
      me
      because
      C
      was
      working
      with
      my
      bf
       #194; #191;?.
      Now
      i
      block
      her.
      Of
      course
      nothing
      of
      what
      happened
      was
      her
      fault.
      She
      talked
      shit
      of
      her
      last
      exes
      and
      talked
      bad
      things
      of
      everyone
      she
      knew
      at
      their
      backs
      so
      I
      think
      she
      will
      do
      her
      smear
      campaign
      with
      the
      few
      friends
      we
      have
      in
      common.
      She
      had
      this
      habit
      to
      be
      with
      vulnerable
      people
      like
      depressed
      and
      then
      shifting
      the
      blame
      to
      them
      as
      they
      have
      a
      problem
      already
      for
      all
      the
      little
      or
      big
      things
      they
      did.
      Thanks
      for
      reading
      you
      can
      post
      your
      things
      too.

      Now
      she
      is
      26
      and
      wants
      to
      go
      to
      US
      (California,
      Utah,
      Nevada),
      i
      knew
      her
      8
      years
      prior....
      Tried
      to
      report
      her
      ex's
      friend
      in
      his
      college
      for
      stalking
      then
      she
      went
      after
      her
      ex
      where
      the
      guy
      shifted
      to

      being
      agressive
      and
      did
      the
      but
      "he
      was
      the
      one
      stalking
      me".
      Also
      she
      tried
      to
      use
      feminist
      organizations
      when
      trying
      to

      I
      wonder
      if
      it
      went
      more
      stronger
      with
      the
      millenial
      era.
      But
      yeah
      modern
      feminism
      encourage
      this
      too.
      On
      a
      side
      note
      modern
      feminism
      is
      too
      emotional
      driven
      maybe
      there
      is
      high
      probability
      that
      many
      BPDs
      are
      feminists.
      Thankfully
      it
      seems
      organizations
      sisn't
      believe
      her
      because
      she
      was
      complaining
      how
      useless
      they
      were.

      Many
      flags
      maybe
      the
      biggest:
      -She
      got
      reported
      to
      the
      police
      twice.
      She
      called
      my
      bf
      (as
      some
      kind
      of
      confidant).
      Her
      ex
      A
      reports
      her
      and
      she
      said
      he
      was
      lying.
      My
      bf
      read
      the
      reports
      and
      it
      said
      she
      went
      violent
      on
      him.
      She
      changed:
      to
      the
      guy
      was
      stalking
      her.
      She
      called
      her
      dad
      to
      defend
      her
      but
      he
      knew
      she
      was
      lying
      and
      was
      like:
      nope,
      she
      deserve
      it
      (
      she
      got
      angry).
      Called
      one
      of
      her
      ex
      as
      witness
      (but
      the
      judge
      saw
      he
      was
      not
      in
      the
      scene
      so
      it
      was
      pointless).
      "A"
      had
      real
      witness.

      I
      have
      this
      pwBPD
      ...a
      "friend"
      bit
      i
      had
      to
      cut
      her.
      Don't
      not
      take
      responsability
      and
      act
      like
      a
      bully.
      You
      can't
      be
      a
      white
      knight
      or
      that
      would
      destroy
      you,
      she
      couldn't
      blame
      you
      for
      everything
      you
      did
      or
      not,
      true
      or
      not.
      There
      is
      this
      therapy
      pretty
      efective
      if
      she
      goes
      once
      a
      week
      with
      the
      psychologist
      monitoring
      twice
      per
      month,
      the
      dbt
      therapy
      but
      she
      will
      need
      to
      follow
      it
      to
      the
      letter.
      But
      remember,
      you
      can't
      save
      her,
      she
      may
      even
      turn
      on
      you
      and
      attack
      and
      blaming
      you
      for
      all.

      My
      psychologist
      treated
      a
      psychopath
      who
      was
      with
      a
      healthy
      person
      and
      the
      healthy
      was

      yeah
      the
      pwBPD
      i
      knew
      used
      to
      choose
      men

      problems
      and
      complaints
      why
      she
      was
      with
      them.
      She
      tried
      with
      someone
      but
      after
      he
      saw
      who
      she
      was
      he
      blocked
      her
      and
      she
      raged.
      And
      her
      first
      bf
      also
      cut
      her
      when
      she
      cheated

      and
      she
      raged
      calling
      him
      groomer
      (they
      dated
      at
      18
      which
      is
      legal

      even
      was

      I
      thought
      so,
      the
      pwBPD
      i
      knew
      was
      kinda
      bully
      with

      people.
      \--------
      Oh
      even
      the
      wiki
      says:

      **and
      codependent
      pairing**

      personality
      disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder)
       #8211;
      there
      is
      a
      tendency
      for
      loved
      ones
      of
      people
      with
      borderline
      personality
      disorder
      (BPD)
      to
      slip
      into
      "caretaker"
      roles,
      giving
      priority
      and
      focus
      to
      problems
      in
      the
      life
      of
      the
      person

      rather
      than
      to
      issues
      in
      their
      own
      lives.
      Too
      often
      in
      these
      kinds
      of
      relationships,
      the
      codependent
      will
      gain
      a
      sense
      of
      worth
      by
      being
      "the

      or

      and
      they
      knew
      this
      pwBPD.
      She
      (the

      tried
      to
      give
      them
      good

      sometimes
      like
      tuna

      chicken
      but
      they
      rejected
      her
      offerings.
      But
      when
      my
      bf
      and
      I
      gave
      them
      that
      for
      they
      would
      eat
      them.
      I
      kind
      of
      suspect
      she
      attacking
      them
      when
      we
      were
      not
      close.
      I
      heard
      cats
      perceive
      energies?
      Do
      anyone
      went

      something

      You
      have
      to
      be
      rigorous
      to
      follow
      the
      DBT
      therapy.
      I
      know
      cases
      of
      BPDs
      that
      ended
      working
      for
      banks
      (with
      their
      long
      psychological
      exams)
      and
      go
      undetected.

      You
      are
      welcome
      :)
      remember
      and
      practice
      the
      rules
      (or
      make
      a

      of
      the
      ones
      that
      you
      would
      use
      more
      if
      they
      are
      a
      lot).
      I
      did
      the
      therapy
      with
      a
      BPD
      expert
      psychologist,
      that
      therapy
      is
      useful
      for
      BPDs
      and
      non
      BPDs.

      need
      to
      suicide
      and
      told
      my
      therapist.
      My
      therapist
      also
      said
      that
      is
      good
      that
      they
      make
      groups
      for
      support
      but
      they
      needed
      the
      guise
      of
      a
      therapist
      or
      they
      could
      not
      solve
      anything.
      Or
      have
      a
      strong
      therapist
      with
      clear
      limits.
      She
      said
      ir
      not
      the
      bpd
      or
      therapist
      could
      take
      advantage
      and
      do
      sexual
      acta
      or
      whatever.
      Excuse
      my
      English.

      The
      ex
      friend
      with
      BPD
      i
      knew
      trusted
      my
      bf.
      One
      day
      she
      called
      him
      because
      she
      was
      at
      the
      police
      because
      her
      ex
      did
      something
      to
      her
      and
      needed
      his
      help....ok
      She
      said
      the
      guy
      was
      stalking
      but
      my
      bf
      saw
      the
      Two
      reports
      that
      he
      did
      against
      her
      saying
      she
      hit
      him
      and
      has
      witnesses.
      When
      he
      asked
      her
      she
      said
      that
      his
      ex
      was
      lying.
      She
      called
      her
      dad
      and
      other
      of
      her
      co-dependent
      ex
      to
      testify.
      Her
      dad
      said
      to
      the
      judge
      that
      she
      deserve
      it
      (she
      got
      so
      upset
      about
      her
      dad)
      and
      the
      judge
      told
      her
      co-dependent
      ex:
      Judge:you
      were
      there?
      -No
      Judge:
      So
      what
      you
      have
      to
      do
      with
      this?

      You
      didn't
      knew
      her
      husband,
      if
      he
      was
      narcisistic
      (
      but
      BPDs
      loves
      low
      self
      steem
      people)
      and
      you
      don't
      have
      the
      reports.
      The
      only
      way
      yo
      know
      is
      asking
      him
      ir
      some
      of
      his
      Friends
      to
      have
      to
      other
      part
      of
      the
      story
      but
      that
      is
      dangerous
      for
      you.
      This
      is
      a
      lesson
      of
      not
      trusting
      one
      side
      of
      a
      story
      and
      don't
      be
      a
      white
      knight.

      Its
      weird
      but
      when
      she
      was
      undiagnosed
      the
      pwBPD
      i
      knew,
      used
      to
      walk
      recklessly
      without
      looking
      through
      street
      tracks
      or
      was
      so
      clumsy
      that
      broked
      some
      things.
      One
      of
      her
      exs
      even
      brought
      her
      to
      one
      of
      his
      friend's
      mom.
      The
      latter
      was
      a
      psychologist
      and
      by
      looking
      at
      her,
      said
      she
      could
      be
      BPD.
      Years
      later
      i
      went
      with
      her
      to
      a
      psychiatrist.
      The
      psychiatrist
      told
      her
      to
      walk
      in
      a
      straight
      line
      (like
      those
      tests
      for
      alchoholic
      people),
      she
      walked
      with
      balancing
      problema
      and
      the
      psychiatrist
      concluded
      that
      she
      may
      have
      BPD.

      If
      you
      can,
      run,leave
      her.
      I
      knew
      this
      person
      with
      BPD
      for
      more
      of
      8
      years
      too.
      Talked
      bad
      of
      her
      exes,
      they
      always
      stalked
      or
      abuse
      her
      (
      I
      talked
      with
      one
      of
      her
      exes,
      that
      is
      one
      of
      my
      friends,and
      he
      gave
      real
      details
      of
      how
      his
      relationship
      ended
      where
      she
      cheated
      in
      him).
      She
      lied
      a
      lot,
      I
      had
      her
      as
      roomate
      for
      2
      years,
      she
      raged
      once
      and
      threatened
      to
      kill
      everyone
      with
      a
      knife,
      broke
      things,
      harass
      me
      for
      4-6
      days
      with
      more
      than
      100
      text
      messages
      and
      calls.
      She
      manipulated
      in
      those
      texts,
      blamed,
      she
      was
      never
      at
      fault.
      Does
      she
      knows
      you
      have
      avpd?
      Well
      she
      would
      say
      you
      are
      crazy,
      and
      since
      she
      knew
      you,
      you
      were
      the
      worst
      thing
      to
      her.
      She
      raged
      once
      when
      some
      guy
      blocked
      her
      (he
      was
      her
      friend)
      but
      seems
      she
      wanted
      casual
      sex
      with
      him.
      She
      will
      tell
      you
      what
      you
      want
      to
      hear,
      give
      you
      attention
      until
      you
      do
      something.
      Go
      to
      bpdlovedones
      if
      you
      want
      more
      proof.

      The
      pwbpd
      I
      knew
      raged
      for
      4-6
      days
      in
      June
      and
      some
      days
      in
      July.
      We
      had
      this
      friend
      in
      common:
      "X",
      having
      her
      birthday
      in
      July...and
      the
      BPD
      sended
      a
      message
      demanding
      me
      to
      tell
      "X"
      that
      I
      will
      not
      go
      to
      her
      birthday
       #191;?
      (I
      was
      planning
      in
      going
      but
      after
      what
      BPD
      did
      and
      her
      threatening
      to
      hit
      me,
      seriously
      she
      has
      no
      right
      to
      tell
      me
      how
      to
      handle
      the
      situation
      with
      X).
      I
      told
      X
      that
      I
      wouldn't
      go
      and
      that
      it
      has
      nothing
      to
      do
      with
      her
      and
      other
      person
      (I
      did
      not
      mentioned
      BPD).
      X
      said
      it
      was
      ok
      but
      after
      the
      party
      there
      was
      no
      contact,
      no
      even
      a
      question
      for
      it.
      X
      knew
      one
      of
      BPD's
      ex
      that
      is
      also
      my
      friend
      and
      after
      talk
      they
      ended
      as
      friends.
      But
      dunno
      it
      makes
      me
      wonder
      what
      stupidity
      said
      Bpd
      to
      X
      or
      the
      other
      friend
      (she
      knows
      nothing
      and
      said
      some
      shit
      before
      against
      me
      related
      to
      something
      that
      Bpd
      knew).

      Is
      this

      In

      that
      the

      is

      of
      an
      artist
      (a
      watercolor

      She,

      loves
      doing

      told
      not
      to
      bad
      talk
      in
      public,
      so
      she
      made
      this

      "I

      when
      everyone
      is
      arguing
      of
      the
      artist
      work.
      Is
      that
      some
      kind
      of
      attention
      seeking?
      She

      be
      in

      all

      Yes

      bad.
      I
      had
      this
      "friend"
      with
      Borderline
      and
      she
      went
      to
      my
      house
      as
      a
      roomate.
      My
      bf
      hace
      her
      rules
      and
      one
      was:
      if
      you
      need
      something
      ask
      my
      bf.
      She
      knew
      she
      couldn't
      convince
      my
      bf
      so
      she
      insisted
      with
      me
      when
      she
      wanted
      something
      and
      tried
      to
      put
      me
      against
      him
      (
      with
      her

      with

      I
      have
      diagnosed
      AvPD
      (avoidant
      personality
      disorder),
      low
      self
      steem...I'm
      not
      from
      the
      US,and
      have
      been
      thinking
      of
      ending
      all.
      It
      makes
      me
      feel
      sad
      but
      i
      find
      it
      rational....
      I
      told
      it
      to
      my
      brother
      and
      said
      i
      wanted
      attention
      (weird...in
      avpds?)
      and
      my
      father
      went
      all
      this
      you
      have
      a
      roof,
      you
      shouldn't
      feel
      like
      that
      and
      that.
      How
      i'm
      not?
      My
      last
      job
      was
      in
      a
      supermarket,
      low
      wage,
      i
      was
      doing
      good.
      The
      thing
      is,
      should
      i
      return
      to
      that
      job
      and
      resign?
      my
      father
      says
      is
      a
      stupid
      job
      but
      he
      doesn't
      give
      any
      options
      and
      the
      job
      was
      mostly
      physical
      so
      my
      back
      hurted
      a
      lot
      (i
      have
      a
      bad
      back
      posture,
      really
      bad
      and
      the
      job
      was
      making
      it
      hurt
      more).
      I
      have
      a
      career,
      sadly
      in
      my
      country
      the
      chances
      go
      up
      to
      be
      hired
      in
      a
      good
      place
      if
      you
      went
      to
      a
      renowned
      college.
      Mine
      is
      one
      that
      if
      you
      tell
      someone
      nobody
      hear
      of
      it....
      Then
      i
      had
      this
      other
      situation
      with
      a
      "friend"
      who
      was
      borderline......i
      did
      not
      know
      how
      bad
      it
      was....i
      told
      her
      personal
      stuff
      so
      guess
      what
      she
      did?
      use
      it
      against
      me,
      insults,
      names,
      twisting
      things,
      lecture,
      texts
      of
      walls,
      all
      those
      things
      to
      make
      you
      feel
      worst
      in
      their
      devaluation
      phase..............
      And
      this
      kind
      of
      people
      prey
      in
      vulnerable.
      That
      makes
      me
      wonder
      if
      i'm
      going
      to
      attract
      more
      of
      those
      kind
      of
      people
      which
      is
      worrisome.

      looking
      too
      much

      She
      got
      caught
      once
      a
      guy
      sended
      texts
      her
      saying
      she
      will
      report
      him
      as
      a
      stalker.
      You
      know
      what
      did?
      Stay
      silent
      like
      a
      kid
      that
      got
      discovered.
      Next
      she
      got
      police
      reports
      for
      violence
      and
      tried
      to
      blame
      her
      ex.what
      happened?
      The
      ex
      had
      real
      witnesses
      who
      saw
      the
      agression.
      She
      used
      another
      ex
      as
      a
      defence
      and
      her
      father
      who
      did
      nothing.
      The
      result?
      She
      was
      upset
      with
      her
      father
      for
      not
      defending
      the
      lie
       #191;?
      Having
      some
      of
      the
      evidence
      helps
      with
      the
      lies,
      the
      smear
      campaign,
      even
      you
      can
      analize
      their
      gaslighting.
      Is
      not
      that
      you
      will
      showe
      those
      things
      to
      people's
      face
      but
      if
      someone
      asks
      or
      if
      she
      report
      you
      to
      the
      police
      for
      nothing
      you
      have
      your
      record.
      Of
      course
      the
      ideal
      is
      leave
      them
      asap.

      Have
      you
      read
      how
      borderlines
      act?
      Is
      normal
      for
      them
      to
      make
      you
      feel
      loved
      and
      then..trash
      you....(see
      bpdlovedones)
      And
      it
      started
      to
      bother
      you
      ("insignifocant,
      humiliated
      or
      demeaned
      in
      my
      life").
      How
      can
      you
      live
      with
      someone
      like
      that?
      Maybe
      if
      they
      try
      dbt
      therapy
      to
      make
      the
      symptoms
      less
      strong.
      Is
      she
      going
      to
      do
      it?
      Really
      difficult,
      part
      of
      their
      bpd
      is
      lack
      of
      self

      Questions
      about
      gut:
      Many
      mentions
      the
      importance
      of
      gut
      but
      can
      you
      reaaaally
      trust
      it?
      Is
      not
      that
      your
      anti
      BPD
      alarm
      is
      activated
      24/7
      that
      makes
      you
      think,
      oh
      he
      is?
      How
      can
      you
      calm
      it
      or
      trust
      anyone
      again?
      It
      acts
      the
      same
      with
      everyone?
      (a
      feeling
      in
      shoulders,
      stomach,
      etc).
       #8203;
      Thanks
      for
      the
      answer.

      It's
      weird,
      the
      person
      with
      BPD
      i
      knew
      she
      said
      that
      she
      was
      BPD
      all
      along
      to
      someone
      she
      knew
      and
      when
      she
      did
      something
      wrong.
      Even
      she
      showed
      a
      psychological
      test
      but
      my
      bf
      saw
      it
      and
      it
      was
      a
      general
      test
      of
      personality
      that
      said
      she
      had
      emotional
      problems
      that's
      all #191;?
      Either
      way,
      my
      friend
      was
      her
      ex
      so
      he
      brought
      her
      to
      a
      known
      organizational
      psychologist
      and
      she
      warned
      him
      of
      the
      possibility
      of
      BPD
      and
      then
      i
      went
      with
      her
      to
      a
      hospital
      and
      the
      psychiatrist
      said
      that
      she
      could
      have
      it.

      Thanks
      for
      the
      complete
      and
      polite
      answer!
      The
      thing
      is
      i
      never
      did
      a
      diet
      so
      when
      someone
      talks
      about
      nutrients
      and
      the
      macros
      protein
      and
      that
      i
      get
      confused...then
      you
      got
      the
      people
      who
      gives
      half
      advices
      or
      their
      way
      of
      doing
      things,
      the
      type
      of
      keto
      and
      that...
      I
      have
      psoriasis
      that's
      why
      i'm
      thinking
      on
      giving
      a
      try.Also
      my
      metabolism
      is
      slow.
      You
      don't
      get
      high
      cholesterol
      with
      this
      diet.?

      What's
      exactly
      the
      problem?
      Her
      threatening
      to
      leave
      you?
      Either
      way
      talking
      about
      illness
      is
      complicated
      maybe
      try
      to
      talk
      about
      the
      problems
      in
      general
      or
      needs.
      But
      I
      guess
      the
      red
      flag
      that
      this
      relationship
      is
      not
      going
      so
      well
      may
      be
      the
      fact
      of
      you
      wanted
      to
      stay

      is

      Depression
      is
      like
      wearing
      negative
      glasses
      24/7,
      you
      hate
      yourself,
      people,
      things,
      ruminate
      the
      thoughts
      making
      to
      stop
      feeling
      things.
      Like,
      my
      Gf
      cheated,
      then
      you
      hate
      yourself,
      maybe
      you
      parent
      abused
      and
      that's
      why
      they
      got
      that
      gf,
      the
      gf,
      people
      in
      general
      (you
      lose
      trust),
      society
      is
      bad
      too
      (people
      don't
      get
      it
      or
      their
      rules),
      then
      mix
      it
      with
      other
      problems:
      oh!
      bills
      to
      pay,
      debt,
      non
      supportive
      people,
      etc
      And
      of
      course
      some
      cases
      in
      the
      outside
      doesn't
      seem
      bad
      like:
      you
      have
      money,
      house,
      kids
      and
      still
      depressed
      or
      just
      you
      came
      to
      the
      conclussion
      by
      philosophising
      that
      life
      have
      no
      point.
      The
      first
      thing
      to
      help
      is
      not
      invalidating
      his
      situation
      and
      talk
      with
      him,
      why
      he
      is
      like
      that
      and
      try
      to
      see
      how
      bad
      it
      is
      (almost
      suicidal,
      too
      negative
      that
      say
      no
      to
      all
      your
      help?).
      I
      had
      been
      in
      pro
      choice
      sites
      for
      suicide
      and
      people
      are
      sick
      of
      the
      happy
      responses
      or
      ignoring
      them.
      Is
      magical
      when
      someone
      says
      (depends
      of
      how
      strong
      is
      negative
      fog):
      i'm
      sorry
      you
      are
      feeling
      like
      that,
      i
      had
      been
      in
      that
      situation,
      what
      can
      i
      do
      to
      help
      you,
      i
      know
      you
      are
      like
      this
      sadly
      you
      know
      that
      the
      only
      one
      who
      can
      get
      out
      is
      you
      but
      i
      can
      help.
      You
      can
      suggest
      therapy
      (help
      him
      find
      the
      best
      therapist
      for
      him),
      maybe
      therapy
      is
      not
      enough
      maybe
      he
      could
      use
      hipnosis
      for
      the
      thoughts
      or
      have
      a
      routine
      like
      meditate
      for
      identifying
      them.
      You
      can't
      force
      it
      or
      get
      angry
      if
      he
      fail
      some
      day
      but
      you
      can
      check
      him
      once
      in
      a
      while
      if
      he
      is
      doing
      things
      (not
      making
      him
      dependant
      of
      you),
      maybe
      invite
      him
      to
      get
      out
      of
      the
      house,
      have
      an
      activity
      (singing,
      running,
      etc)
      to
      distract
      him.
      Tell
      him
      that:
      no
      think
      just
      do
      it.
      Think
      in
      the
      moment,
      in
      the
      day
      (maybe
      he
      hates
      his
      past,
      talk
      to
      him
      about
      that
      and
      help
      him
      forgive
      it,
      forgive
      people
      and
      himself).
      The
      basics
      he
      can
      do
      is
      self
      care,
      do
      his
      bed,
      shower,
      organize
      his
      room,
      do
      the
      food,
      make
      him
      have
      a
      activities
      or
      goals
      in
      this
      6
      areas:
      work,
      education,
      family,
      social,
      spiritual
      (if
      he
      is
      into
      that),
      and
      distraction
      (my
      therapist
      says
      that
      you
      need
      balance
      in
      those,
      because
      let's
      say
      you
      depend
      in
      you
      family
      and
      they
      are
      terrible
      and
      you
      don't
      have
      friend
      work,
      etc
      is
      more
      easy
      to
      fall
      apart)
      Is
      a
      thing
      of
      being
      patient
      and
      check
      him,
      but
      you
      can't
      be
      dragged
      down
      and
      take
      care
      of
      yourself,
      sometimes
      seeing
      that
      in
      you
      can
      motivate
      him
      (and
      you
      can't
      help
      him
      if
      you
      feel
      bad).
      Maybe
      you
      could
      have
      a
      Jordan
      Peterson
      attitude
      of
      a
      strict
      father/mother
      but
      understanding
      (it
      depends
      in
      how
      he
      responds
      when
      someone
      give
      him
      directions
      for
      doing
      let's
      say
      laundry
      or
      the
      food).
      You
      can
      saw
      that
      too
      in
      thetype
      of
      psychologist
      he
      prefers:
      the
      ones
      with
      a
      nice
      tone
      or
      strict
      and
      asking
      what
      helps
      him
      more
      to
      do
      stuff.
      Also
      if
      he
      likes
      reading
      you
      can
      give
      him
      books
      like
      6
      pillars
      of
      self
      steem,
      or
      Tony
      Robbins
      Awaken
      The
      Giant
      Within
      (people
      says
      is
      awesome,
      who
      knows)
      that
      may
      help
      him
      kick
      his
      ass
      a
      little
      without
      being
      harsh.
      Well
      conclussion
      is
      a
      mix
      of
      being
      patient,
      discipline
      at
      the
      start
      and
      general
      (just
      do
      it)
      and
      self
      motivation
      once
      in
      a
      while
      (oh
      you
      cleaned
      you
      teeth?
      awesome,
      you
      didn't?
      no
      one
      is
      perfect,
      you
      fall
      but
      the
      point
      is
      get
      up).
      Tell
      him
      to
      live
      in
      the
      moment,
      not
      think
      of
      the
      past
      or
      future,
      not
      yet.
      He
      may
      blame
      himself
      for
      the
      time
      he
      wasted
      with
      being
      like
      that
      (that's
      why
      not
      to
      think
      in
      the
      past
      or
      forgive
      himself
      anytime).
      I'm
      struggling
      for
      many
      years
      but
      that's
      what
      i
      found.....and
      sorry
      for
      the
      grammar,
      english
      is
      not
      my
      native
      language.

      I
      know
      my
      Dad
      does
      not
      care
      too
      like
      he
      is
      doing
      his
      things
      and
      stuff.
      He
      got
      upset
      when
      i
      honestly
      told
      him
      about
      my
      suicidal
      tendencies.....like
      i'm
      being
      honest,
      trying
      to
      scream
      saying:
      please
      help!.
      But
      nope....so
      what
      is
      left
      is
      that
      i
      have
      to
      convince
      myself
      of
      doing
      it
      i
      guess.
      Not
      for
      calling
      attention
      but
      for
      saying
      nothing
      matter
      anymore..........anyways.

       gt;Honestly,
      it
      sounds
      like
      she
      learned
      how
      to
      respond
      to
      a
      stressful
      situation
      from
      the
      pwBPD.
      Some
      intervention
      and
      better
      coping
      skills
      will
      help
      her
      a
      lot.
      Yeah....BPD
      vibes
      but
      who
      knows
      maybe
      is
      the
      age.

      I
      know...i
      guess
      he
      is
      now
      with
      his
      own
      problems
      too,
      now
      you
      are
      you
      are
      your
      own
      supportive
      family.
      Is
      nice
      to
      have
      supportive
      friends,
      family
      and
      that
      but
      sometimes
      there
      is
      no
      choice
      :/.
      If
      situation
      in
      your
      house
      is
      horrible,
      try
      to
      leave
      (if
      you
      are
      old
      enough),
      not
      hating
      them
      just
      get
      your
      own
      space,
      is
      peaceful.
      It
      helps
      you
      to
      stop
      thinking:
      my
      dad
      is
      like
      this
      today,
      my
      mom
      yelled
      at
      me,
      and
      you
      change
      with
      how
      you
      are
      feeling
      that
      day.

      I
      found
      un
      the
      postal
      :people
      are
      hopeless
      un
      helping
      a
      depressed
      person(
      something
      like
      that
      was
      called),
      someone
      said
      something
      like
      yeah
      yo
      should
      thing
      so
      people
      surround
      you.
      And
      answer
      sarcastically
      Witherspoon:
      yeah
      but
      people
      don't
      like
      to
      be
      surrounded
      by
      depressed...and
      the
      user
      made
      responses
      llike:
      oh
      then
      therapy
      is

      gonna
      work
      with
      you
      (laughingface),
      stay

      In

      life.
      My
      family
      is
      conflictive
      and
      yelled
      at
      me
      and
      say:why
      you
      are
      making
      an
      angry
      face?!.
      Then
      i
      got
      this
      borderline
      ex
      friend
      who
      always
      said:
      why
      you
      are
      making

      face
      (

      reaction
      for
      attack
      or

      she
      told
      to
      her
      ex
      (they
      were
      talking
      still)
      that
      she
      remembered
      everything
      and
      told
      him
      details
      of
      the
      sexual
      act
      like
      bragging.
      She
      loved
      to
      say
      that
      alcohol
      don't
      affect
      her
      do...they
      last
      version
      may
      be
      the
      truth...
      Then
      she
      told
      my
      friends
      that
      her
      friend
      got
      cheated
      (thats
      all)
      and
      now
      she
      Will
      not
      contacto
      her
      because
      she
      Will
      be
      un
      "recovery".

      methods,
      this
      year

      negative
      thoughts
      at
      least
      for
      now
      and
      try
      to
      eat
      garbage
      today.

      in
      the
      night
