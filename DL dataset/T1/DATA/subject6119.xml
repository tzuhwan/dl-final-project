      Gongrats
      on
      your
      weight
      loss
      that #8217;s
      amazing.
      For
      me
      it #8217;s
      the
      opposite.
      I #8217;m
      really
      skinny
      and
      at
      first
      I
      thought
      it
      was
      something
      I
      just
      made
      up
      in
      my
      head
      but
      over
      time,
      more
      and
      more
      people
      started
      pointing
      it
      out
      and
      clowning
      me
      for
      it.
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      people
      realize
      that
      making
      fun
      of
      someone
      for
      being
      really
      skinny
      has
      the
      same
      effect
      as
      making
      fun
      of
      someone
      for
      being
      overweight.
      So
      now
      I #8217;m
      extremely
      self
      conscious
      about
      myself.

      I
      can
      really
      relate
      to
      this
      except
      that
      I
      moved
      to
      a
      small
      town
      rather
      than
      a
      big
      city.
      I
      also
      went
      for
      community
      college.
      I
      was
      dealing
      with
      extreme
      depression
      and
      felt
      hopeless
      because
      I
      had
      lost
      all
      passion.
      I
      had
      3
      other
      roommates
      but
      2
      of
      them
      were
      already
      good
      friends
      and
      it
      felt
      too
      exclusive.
      The
      other
      kept
      to
      himself.
      Tbh
      I
      was
      completely
      lost,
      I
      sat
      in
      my
      room
      thinking
      of
      possible
      suicide
      and
      had
      no
      idea
      what
      I
      was
      gonna
      do.
      I
      ultimately
      decided
      to
      leave
      school
      and
      move
      back
      home.
      I
      was
      still
      upset
      when
      I
      got
      home
      but
      not
      to
      the
      extent
      that
      I
      was.
      This
      is
      not
      advice
      this
      is
      just
      what
      I
      chose
      to
      do
      and
      I #8217;m
      still
      dealing
      with
      severe
      depression.
      Hope
      things
      turn
      around
      for
      you.

      Hard
      to
      say
      I
      know
      a
      couple
      girls
      that #8217;s
      have
      said
      they
      enjoy
      when
      a
      guy
      plays
      with
      their
      hair
      and
      shit(enjoy
      in
      a
      romantic
      way).
      If
      you
      really
      like
      her
      it
      might
      be
      worth
      trying
      to
      get
      together.

      Yeah
      I
      flew
      into
      Florence
      and
      it #8217;s
      nothing
      like
      this.
      The
      airport
      is
      in
      a
      much
      more
      rural
      part.
      These
      buildings
      and
      cathedrals
      are
      nowhere
      near
      it.
      The
      view
      is
      still
      gorgeous
      not
      sure
      why
      anyone
      would
      feel
      the
      need
      to
      photoshop

      but
      she #8217;s
      taking
      all

      it #8217;s

      Yeah
      I
      need
      to
      work
      up
      the
      courage.
      I #8217;m
      just
      worried
      that
      it
      might
      ruin
      our
      friendship
      and
      I
      don #8217;t
      want
      that.
      There #8217;s
      been
      times
      where
      it
      seemed
      like
      she
      hinted
      that
      she
      had
      feelings
      for
      me
      idk.
      Her
      phone
      wallpaper
      is
      me
      and
      her
      together
      so
      other
      people
      think
      we #8217;re

      Yeah
      I
      know
      how
      that
      feels.
      I
      still
      try
      to
      keep
      in
      touch
      with
      friends
      that
      moved
      out
      of
      state.
      It
      can
      be
      hard
      but
      as
      long
      as
      u
      put
      in
      the
      effort
      then
      it #8217;s
      up
      to
      them
      whether
      or
      not
      they
      want
      to
      keep
      talking.
      That
      probably
      made
      no
      sense,
      I #8217;m
      very
      tired
      and
      suck
      at
      forming
      sentences.

      at

      I #8217;m
      not

      Maybe
      try
      and
      seem
      a
      little
      more
      into
      him
      like
      the
      way
      you
      act/talk
      with
      him.
      Idk
      you
      could
      try
      talking
      to
      him
      about
      it
      if
      that #8217;s
      something
      you #8217;re
      comfortable

      way
      best

      Hey
      man
      first
      off
      I
      just
      wanted
      to
      say
      I #8217;m
      really
      sorry
      about
      what
      you #8217;re
      going
      through
      and
      I
      hope
      things
      get
      better
      eventually.
      That #8217;s
      a
      rough
      situation
      I
      don #8217;t
      really
      feel
      qualified
      to
      give
      advice
      so
      I #8217;ll
      just
      throw
      an
      idea
      or
      two.
      If
      possible
      you
      could
      try
      and
      find
      time
      alone
      and
      just
      sit
      down
      and
      talk
      with
      him
      which
      I
      know
      might
      seem
      scary
      and
      not
      work
      cause
      that #8217;s
      why
      he
      left
      in
      the
      first
      place.
      You
      could
      also
      try
      just
      talking
      about
      how
      you
      feel
      about
      your
      friendship
      fading
      and
      avoid
      talking
      about
      depression/suicide.
      Like
      saying
      how
      much
      the
      friendship
      means
      to
      you
      and
      how
      you
      feel
      like
      it #8217;s
      starting
      to
      drift
      apart
      and
      you
      don #8217;t
      want
      to
      lose
      that.
      Or
      maybe
      even
      just
      sit
      with
      them
      regardless
      of
      how
      your
      friend
      is
      acting
      around
      you.
      Don #8217;t
      let
      one
      person
      ruin/weaken
      all
      the
      other
      friendships.
      Idk
      if
      any
      of
      this
      helped
      or
      gave
      you
      anything
      to
      think
      about.
      Hopefully
      things
      get
      better
      for
      you
      soon.

      Yes
      Im
      not
      sure
      where
      you #8217;re
      from
      but
      in

      it #8217;s
      called
      grief
      counseling
      I
      believe.
      They
      help
      you

      rough
      situations
      that
      your
      dealing
      with
      such
      as
      death.
      I
      went
      when
      a
      close
      friend
      of
      mine
      died
      while
      we
      were
      on
      a
      rock
      climbing
      trip.
      It
      helped
      me
      immensely.

      That #8217;s
      completely
      understandable.
      I
      know
      it
      can

      hard

      I
      would
      personally
      have
      a
      hard
      time
      doing
      it
      but
      if
      I #8217;ve
      learned
      anything
      it #8217;s
      that
      sometimes
      you
      have
      to
      make
      that
      first
      move.
      There #8217;s
      also
      the
      high
      chance
      that
      it #8217;s
      new
      to
      him
      and
      he
      doesn #8217;t
      know
      how
      to
      deal
      with
      it
      himself.
      If
      u
      guys
      were
      good
      friends
      I
      doubt
      he #8217;s
      doing
      it
      with
      intention
      of
      hurting
      you

      I
      recently
      went
      in
      April.
      I
      started
      in
      Venice
      and
      then
      onto
      Florence.
      It #8217;s
      a
      beautiful
      country
      and
      very
      easy
      to
      travel
      to
      as
      an
      English
      speaker.
      Venice
      is
      pretty
      much
      exactly
      how
      you
      would
      imagine
      and
      much
      more
      of
      a
      tourist
      city.
      If
      you
      go
      there
      I
      would
      recommend
      catching
      a
      water
      taxi
      from
      the
      airport,
      it
      enters
      through
      the
      canals
      and
      is
      absolutely
      breath
      taking.
      Avoid
      summer
      though(way
      too
      crowded).
      Florence
      was
      gorgeous
      and
      felt
      much
      more
      like
      a
      real
      city.
      Beautiful
      historical
      buildings
      everywhere.
      Definitely
      check
      out
      some
      of
      the
      many
      palaces.
      The
      David
      is
      also
      located
      in
      Florence
      and
      is
      also
      breathtaking.
      There #8217;s
      beautiful
      statues
      everywhere
      and
      it #8217;s
      an
      amazing
      place
      to
      travel
      to.
      I
      would
      highly
      recommend
      traveling
      there
      at
      some
      point
      in
      your
      life.
      If
      you
      have
      any
      questions,
      feel
      free
      to
      ask.

      a

      I

      still
      on
      the
      rebuilding
      process.

      So
      there #8217;s
      this
      girl
      I
      really
      like
      and
      I
      think
      she
      likes
      me
      but
      we
      live
      kinda
      far
      away
      so
      it
      makes
      things
      hard.
      We
      FaceTime
      for
      hours
      everyday
      and
      talk
      a
      lot.
      Anyways
      last
      night
      I
      had
      a
      dream
      that
      she
      sent
      me
      a
      snap
      saying
       #8220;I
      love
      you #8221;
      but
      then
      I
      woke
      up
      and
      checked
      to
      see
      when
      my
      last
      snap
      from
      her
      was
      and
      realized
      it
      never
      happened.
      The
      dream
      felt
      extremely
      real
      and
      I
      spent
      all
      day
      thinking
      about
      it.
      In
      conclusion
      my
      dreams
      can
      go
      fuck
      themselves.

      I #8217;ll

      beating

      the
      words
      are
      what
      usually
      stick
      with
      a
      person
      and
      can
      really
      damage
      someone #8217;s
      mental
      well-being.
      I #8217;m
      talking
      about
      genuinely
      hurtful
      words
      not
      just
      some
      shit
      people
      get
      quickly
      triggered
      by.

      So
      there #8217;s
      this
      girl
      I
      really
      like
      but
      we
      live
      in
      different
      states.
      We #8217;ve
      been
      talking
      for
      a
      few
      months
      but
      in
      the
      past
      month
      and
      a
      half
      we #8217;ve
      gotten
      really
      close.
      We
      share
      a
      lot
      of
      personal
      shit
      that
      we #8217;re
      going
      through
      and
      overall
      we #8217;re
      pretty
      open
      about
      our
      emotions.
      She #8217;s
      going
      through
      a
      lot
      and
      has
      attempted
      suicide
      twice
      before
      meeting
      me.
      The
      other
      night
      we
      were
      on
      FaceTime
      for
      about
      8
      hours(average
      for
      us)
      and
      things
      got
      really
      deep
      towards
      the
      end.
      She #8217;s
      really
      struggling
      with
      a
      lot
      and
      she
      feels
      alone.
      I
      really
      wish
      I
      could
      tell
      her
      that
      I
      love
      her
      and
      be
      able
      to
      be
      there
      for
      her
      completely.
      I #8217;ve
      never
      really
      felt
      this
      way
      about
      someone
      before.
      I #8217;ve
      had
      girlfriends
      in
      the
      past
      but
      I
      never
      felt
      like
      this.
      She #8217;s
      hinted
      that
      she
      really
      likes
      me
      a
      few
      times
      but
      never
      said
      it
      outright
      and
      there #8217;s
      always
      the
      chance
      that
      she
      doesn #8217;t
      have
      any
      feelings
      towards
      me
      and
      I #8217;m
      just
      overthinking
      it
      like
      usual.
      I
      feel
      like
      if
      I
      told
      her
      how
      I
      really
      felt
      it
      could
      possibly
      ruin
      our
      friendship.
      We
      both
      really
      need
      this
      friendship
      right
      now
      and
      she #8217;s
      said
      multiple
      times
      that
      if
      she
      had
      never
      met
      me,
      she #8217;d
      be
      in
      a
      really
      bad
      place
      and
      possibly
      not
      even
      alive
      anymore.
      Idk
      I #8217;ll
      wrap
      it
      up
      here,
      basically
      I
      love
      this
      girl
      a
      lot
      and
      I #8217;m
      scared
      to
      lose
      her.

      Yeah
      it
      did.
      I
      think
      I
      just
      have
      to
      work
      up
      the
      courage
      and
      grow
      some
      balls.
      We've
      talked
      about
      meeting
      up
      in
      person
      at
      some
      point
      this
      summer
      and
      we've
      talked
      about
      moving
      in
      together
      at
      some
      point
      but
      that's
      more
      of
      a
      dream
      than
      anything,
      even
      though
      she's
      completely
      serious
      about
      it.

      Ok
      bare
      with
      me.
      So
      I #8217;ve
      posted
      about
      her
      before
      but
      this
      is
      new.
      So
      last
      night
      we
      were
      on
      FaceTime(we
      live
      in
      different
      states)
      and
      she
      was
      deciding
      wether
      or
      not
      to
      tell
      me
      something.
      She
      said
      she
      hinted
      at
      it
      before
      but
      I
      couldn #8217;t
      figure
      it
      out.
      I
      knew
      it
      had
      to
      do
      with
      her
      beliefs
      regarding
      religion
      and
      spirituality.
      I
      guessed
      satanism
      first
      cause
      that
      was
      my
      best
      guess
      but
      she
      said
      no.
      So
      I
      guessed
      paganism
      next
      and
      she
      said
      that #8217;s
      really
      close.
      She
      then
      told
      me
      that
      she #8217;s
      Wiccan.
      Wicca
      is
      basically
      a
      little
      branch
      off
      of
      paganism.
      It
      has
      to
      do
      with
      witches,
      witchcraft,
      and
      magic.
      At
      first
      I
      wasn #8217;t
      sure
      what
      to
      say
      but
      I
      know
      that
      it #8217;s
      a
      big
      part
      of
      her
      life
      and
      I #8217;m
      pretty
      open
      about
      most
      things.
      I #8217;m
      cool
      with
      it
      like
      I
      think
      it #8217;s
      kinda
      interesting
      cause
      I #8217;ve
      never
      heard
      of
      it
      before.
      The
      fact
      that
      she
      was
      able
      to
      tell
      me
      also
      shows
      that
      she
      really
      trusts
      me
      and
      I #8217;m
      happy
      that
      she
      can
      be
      open
      about
      it
      now.
      She
      said
      most
      people
      either
      don #8217;t
      believe
      her
      or
      think
      she #8217;s
      crazy
      so
      she
      never
      talks
      about
      it.
      I #8217;m
      not
      one
      to
      judge
      cause
      I
      myself
      became
      very
      spiritual
      after
      the
      few
      years
      I
      spent
      experimenting
      and
      exploring
      with
      different
      psychedelic
      substances
      but
      that #8217;s
      a
      story
      for
      another
      time.

      tbh
      its
      kinda
      up
      to
      you.
      I've
      found
      theres
      certain
      ways
      to
      influence
      your
      trip.
      I'd
      highly
      recommend
      having
      a
      trip
      sitter,
      they
      should
      be
      someone
      you
      really
      trust
      and
      are
      comfortable
      being
      yourself
      around.
      Having
      a
      good
      trip
      sitter
      can
      be
      a
      life
      saver.
      It
      also
      depends
      on
      the
      setting
      whether
      that
      be
      in
      your
      room
      at
      night
      or
      outside
      on
      a
      nice
      warm
      day.
      If
      you're
      feeling
      like
      its
      a
      bad
      idea
      then
      don't
      take
      anything,
      but
      dont
      get
      that
      confused
      with
      feeling
      a
      little
      nervous
      because
      thats
      normal.
      Its
      important
      to
      try
      your
      best
      to
      stay
      calm
      and
      if
      you
      feel
      like
      doing
      something
      will
      help
      your
      trip
      go
      smoother
      than
      do
      it.
      For
      example
      one
      time
      when
      the
      shrooms
      started
      kicking
      in
      I
      felt
      like
      this
      one
      certain
      black
      and
      white
      blanket
      was
      radiating
      bad
      energy
      and
      was
      giving
      me
      negative
      vibes
      so
      I
      put
      it
      somewhere
      I
      couldn't
      see
      and
      my
      trip
      went
      smoothly.
      Ultimately
      its
      up
      to
      you
      and
      dont
      take
      anything
      without
      doing
      proper
      research
      and
      feeling
      prepared.

      So
      tonight
      I
      self
      harmed
      for
      the
      first
      time.
      I
      burned
      myself
      pretty
      badly
      all
      over
      my
      forearms.
      I
      was
      too
      scared
      of
      cutting
      and
      had
      no
      way
      to
      deal
      with
      the
      blood,
      also
      figured
      it #8217;d
      be
      easier
      to
      come
      up
      with
      a
      cover
      story
      about
      them.
      I #8217;m
      not
      totally
      sure
      why
      I
      did
      but
      it
      felt
      like
      the
      only
      way
      to
      cope
      with
      shit
      and
      I
      guess
      I
      was
      trying
      to
      focus
      the
      pain
      somewhere
      else.
      I #8217;m
      scared
      of
      where
      I #8217;m
      gonna
      go
      from
      here
      and
      I #8217;m
      not
      sure
      if
      it #8217;s
      something
      I
      can
      talk
      to
      my
      therapist
      about
      or
      if
      he #8217;d
      have
      to
      tell
      my
      parents
      and
      send
      me
      somewhere
      for
      help.
