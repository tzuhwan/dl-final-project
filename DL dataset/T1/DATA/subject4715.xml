      So
      earlier
      I
      looked
      at
      the
      source
      code
      for
      Scott's
      website
      and
      it
      just
      said
      no
      comment
      over
      and
      over
      in
      the
      first
      part.
      I
      dont
      know
      if
      it
      means
      anything
      but
      i
      thought
      i
      should
      bring
      it
      up
      in
      the
      subreddit
      anyway

      GTLive
      is
      streaming
      rn
      I
      dont
      know
      if
      its
      in
      full
      though,
      it
      maybe
      in
      two
      parts.
      Youtube
      is
      messing
      up
      with
      me
      though
      so
      not
      sure
      if
      it'll
      work
      for
      you
      or
      anythin.
      Worth
      a
      look?

      The
      only
      problem
      with
      it
      being
      the
      older
      brother
      is
      the
      height
      then.
      Like
      for
      example
      when
      you
      run
      to
      the
      doors
      or
      closet
      you
      seem
      to
      be
      pretty
      small
      like
      a
      child's
      size.
      Good
      idea
      though!
      It
      would
      make
      a
      lot
      of
      sense
      if
      the
      height
      matches
      up

      I
      think
      its
      where
      you
      go
      to
      reset
      your
      town.
      I
      havent
      done
      it
      myself
      yet
      though
      but
      there
      is
      a
      post
      on
      the

      it
      shud
      be
      close
      to
      the
      top
      but
      theres
      a
      full
      explanation
      on
      how
      to
      on

      Yes
      and
      no,
      if
      the
      items
      are
      things
      u
      cant
      buy
      again
      then
      just
      drop
      em
      off
      with
      a
      reliable
      friend
      until
      ur
      new
      town
      is
      set
      up.
      The
      money
      is
      worth
      it
      though
      if
      you
      get
      a
      good
      price,
      you
      can
      get
      your
      town
      appraised
      without
      having
      to
      sell
      it
      though
      if
      you
      want
      to!
      Just
      be
      careful
      when
      you
      do

      a
      podcast
      so

      assume
      iTunes,
      google

      places
      like
      that.
      Probably
      be

      as
      well
      at

      It #8217;s
      called
      Dragons
      in
      places
      (I
      think...
      it #8217;s
      on
      their
      twitter
      either
      way)

      Charlie
      is
      described
      as
      having
      brown
      hair
      in
      the
      books
      though
      and
      the
      girl
      had
      blonde
      hair
      (or
      at
      least
      that #8217;s
      what
      it
      looks
      like
      to
      me)
      and
      the
      style
      is
      very
      80s
      looking
      in
      the
      sense
      that
      it
      is
      curled
      in
      a
      specific
      way
      so
      I
      think
      it #8217;s
      more
      likely
      to
      be
      Susie
      than
      Charlie

      You
      should
      try
      Liberation
      as
      well
      if
      you
      liked
      3!
      It #8217;s
      set
      in
      America
      as
      well
      and
      the
      same
      time
      as
      3
      (maybe
      slightly
      later
      than
      the
      game)
      but
      it #8217;s
      in
      New
      Orleans
      with
      Aveline.
      If
      you
      have
      a
      ps3
      you
      can
      get
      it
      in
      the
      American
      Saga
      collection,
      that #8217;s
      how
      I
      got
      it.
      It #8217;s
      a
      really
      great
      game
      that
      a
      lot
      of
      people
      don #8217;t
      seem
      to
      acknowledge
      at
      all
      cuz
      it
      was
      a
      PSP
      exclusive
      at
      one
      point.

      it

      It #8217;s

      something
      you

      then
      you

      This
      sounds
      really
      stupid
      but
      me
      and
      a
      friend
      have
      been
      changing
      Disney
      song
      lyrics
      to
      fit
      to
      assassin #8217;s
      creed
      games
       #128514;.
      We
      have
      Mary
      Poppins
      for
      Syndicate
      (Evie
      is
      Mary,
      Jacob
      is
      Bert,
      the
      rooks
      are
      the
      other
      chimney
      sweeps),
      our
      fave
      song
      for
      that
      is
      Step
      In
      Time
      (it
      got
      weird
      very
      fast
      and
      involved
      Connor
      yelling
      where #8217;s
      Charles
      lee!?
      For
      one
      verse).
      For
      3
      though
      I
      actually
      find
      Pocahontas
      fits
      very
      well
      as
      she
      jumps
      from
      the
      waterfall
      at
      the
      beginning
      of
      the
      movie
      which
      looks
      a
      lot
      like
      a
      leap
      of
      faith.
      That
      and
      the
      whole
      movie
      reminds
      me
      of
      AC3

      It #8217;s
      probably
      just
      because
      there
      is
      no
      actual
      news
      about
      it
      now,
      it
      takes

      we
      heard
      was
      that
      it
      was
      going

      rewrites
      I #8217;d
      say
      there #8217;s
      probably
      just
      nothing

      So
      I #8217;ve
      tried
      to
      play
      the
      rivals
      songs
      for
      this
      week
      and
      every
      time
      I #8217;ve
      finished
      a
      song
      I #8217;m
      getting
      no
      crew
      XP
      and
      no
      player
      XP.
      I
      figured
      it
      could
      of
      been
      something
      with
      their
      servers
      last
      night
      (I
      live
      in
      England)
      since
      it
      was
      at
      the
      start
      of
      the
      challenge
      but
      when
      I #8217;ve
      tried
      again
      today
      it #8217;s
      still
      not
      working.
      I #8217;ve
      tried
      going
      onto
      the
      online
      tab
      as
      well
      and
      it
      keeps
      saying
      that
      the
      client
      failed
      to
      reach
      the
      server
      but
      the
      internet
      is
      fine
      since
      I
      was
      playing
      on
      overwatch
      just
      before
      switching
      games
      and
      had
      no
      problems
      with
      that.
      It
      also
      keeps
      loading
      the
      end
      of
      challenge
      screen
      and
      sending
      me
      to
      rivals
      when
      I #8217;m
      on
      the
      menu
      even
      though
      I #8217;ve
      already
      seen
      it.
      I
      did
      check
      the
      rivals
      tab
      before
      starting
      both
      nights
      and
      still
      having
      the
      same
      issue.
      It
      also
      keeps
      coming
      up
      with
       #8220;failed
      to
      connect
      to
      rock
      band
      servers #8221;
      when
      I #8217;m
      loading
      up
      the
      rivals
      tab
      but
      works
      if
      I
      click
      it
      again
      afterwards.
      I #8217;ve
      contacted
      customer
      support
      but
      any
      help
      fixing
      the
      issue
      or
      at
      least
      getting
      some
      kind
      of
      understanding
      would
      be
      a
      great
      help.
      Thanks

      I
      believe
      the
      stalls
      are
      on
      the
      ground
      floor
      and
      the
      circle
      is
      the
      balcony
      area
      above
      but
      there
      should
      be
      a
      map
      on
      the
      website
      of
      the
      arena
      that
      will
      show
      you
      the
      seating
      plan

      on

      by

      they #8217;ve

      sounds

      are
      carried

      go

      I #8217;m
      playing
      on
      Spyro
      2
      right
      now
      and
      the
      trophy
      Hypersonic
      is
      bugged
      for
      me.
      It
      just
      won #8217;t
      pop!
      I
      messed
      it
      up
      originally
      but
      then
      reloaded
      the
      level
      and
      did
      it
      fine
      but
      it
      didn #8217;t
      pop
      so
      I
      used
      a
      new
      save
      file
      to
      try
      and
      get
      it
      but
      still
      no
      luck.
      This
      sucks
      as
      I
      really
      want
      to
      platinum
      all
      the
      games
      and
      already
      have
      done
      for
      1
      but
      that
      one
      trophy
      (so
      far)
      is
      going
      to
      annoy
      me.

      Chris
      quoted
      it
      directly
      from
      the
      song,
      that
      episode
      was
      after
      Nate
      released
      the
      song.
      Not
      sure
      if
      it
      was
      after
      the
      album
      though.

      The
      dispatch
      email
      will
      come
      with
      a
      tracking
      link.
      The
      actual
      time
      for
      delivery
      differs,
      they
      should
      have
      some
      FAQs
      that
      will
      tell
      you
      the

      window
      on
      the
      CDBaby
      website
      if
      you
      look
      on
      there
      :)
      Edit:
      be
      prepared
      for
      those
      customs
      when
      the
      album
      actually
      arrived,
      it #8217;s
      gonna
      be
      a

      It
      will
      come
      from
      Royal
      Mail
      so
      you
      will
      get
      a

      through
      before
      the

      which

      tell
      you
      how
      much
      and
      how
      to
      pay.
      Just
      in
      case
      you
      don #8217;t
      know,
      I
      had
      to
      pay
      a
      lot
      for
      the
      customs
      when

      Do
      you
      mean
      on
      the
      app?
      If
      so
      you
      do
      have
      to
      buy
      them,
      yes.
      If
      it's
      on
      console
      or
      pc
      then
      no
      it
      should
      be
      there
      automatically.

      I
      understand
      where
      you're
      coming
      from.
      My
      self
      harming
      has
      been
      getting
      worse
      progressively
      over
      the
      last
      3
      years
      and
      recently
      it's
      gotten
      to
      a
      stage
      of
      using
      a
      craft
      knife
      to
      cut
      myself
      with.
      Every
      time
      I
      do
      it
      it
      gets
      lighter
      cuz
      I'm
      so
      scared
      about
      going
      too
      deep
      and
      people
      finding
      out.
      I
      had
      a
      friend
      who
      told
      me
      he
      used
      one
      before
      and
      ended
      up
      in
      a amp;e
      because
      of
      it.
      When
      I
      look
      at
      them
      and
      how
      shallow
      they
      are
      I
      end
      up
      doing
      more
      after
      a
      few
      hours
      but
      they're
      still
      getting
      lighter.
      But
      I
      know
      you
      can
      get
      past
      your
      troubles.
      Even
      if
      it
      takes
      a
      long
      time,
      I'm
      sure
      you
      can
      do
      it.
      I'm
      proud
      of
      you
      for
      still
      breathing
      today.
      Just
      keep
      trying
      to
      move
      forward,
      keep
      trying
      to
      jump
      over
      that
      pirhana
      plant
      to
      get
      to
      the
      flag
      and
      save
      the
      princess.
      You
      can
      get
      through
      this!
