      Every

      I
      just
      want
      to
      go
      out

      have

      friends
      to

      with.

      that
      I
      stay
      at
      home,
      it

      want

      a

      in
      my
      mouth
      more
      and
      more.
      Edit:
      Why
      do
      people
      come
      here
      just

      Trying
      to
      treat
      my
      crippling
      social
      anxiety.
      12
      months
      have
      now
      gone
      by.
      All
      I'm
      able
      to
      do
      now
      that
      I
      wasn't
      able
      to
      do
      before
      is
      shop
      at
      stores
      and
      pay
      at
      the
      cashier
      myself.
      12
      months...
      and
      that's
      all
      there
      is.
      I
      need
      a
      fucking
      job
      but
      I
      can't
      even
      have
      a
      fucking
      conversation
      with
      someone.
      No
      friends
      either.
      What's
      even
      the
      point
      of
      doing
      this
      if
      progress
      is
      so
      slow?
      I've
      been
      out
      of
      school
      for
      2
      years
      and
      still
      never
      had
      a
      job
      before.

      I

      time

      Everyday
      of
      being
      isolated
      and
      not
      having
      a

      makes
      me
      want
      to
      kill
      myself.
      I
      don't
      even
      know
      what
      a
      right
      therapist
      is

      Life,

      will
      fade
      away
      Drifting
      further

      Nothing

      I

      the

      to
      live
      Simply
      nothing
      more
      to
      give
      There
      is
      nothing
      more

      Need

      free
      Things
      not

      used
      to
      be
      Missing
      one
      inside

      me
      Deathly
      lost,
      this
      can't
      be
      real
      Cannot
      stand
      this
      hell
      I
      feel
      Emptiness
      is
      filling
      me
      To
      the
      point
      of
      agony
      Growing
      darkness
      taking
      dawn
      I
      was
      me,
      but
      now
      he's
      gone
      No
      one
      but
      me
      can
      save
      myself,
      but
      it's
      too
      late
      Now
      I
      can't
      think,
      think
      why
      I
      should
      even
      try
      Yesterday
      seems

      it
      never
      existed
      Death
      greets

      warm,
      now
      I
      will
      just

      it's
      corpse.
      Being
      alone
      is
      not
      fun
      and
      I
      don't
      know
      how
      anyone
      can
      justify
      it.
      Human
      beings
      are
      not
      meant
      to
      live
      life
      alone.

      Thanks.
      A
      lot
      of
      my
      depression
      stems
      from
      the
      fact
      that
      I'm
      alone
      though.
      Really
      the
      only
      thing
      that
      could
      make
      a
      big
      ass
      dent
      in
      my
      depression
      is
      having
      at
      least
      one
      person
      that
      I
      can
      hang
      out
      with.
      Being
      alone
      has
      literally
      been
      killing
      me
      for
      years
      now.

      I
      don't
      have

      so
      I
      don't

      what
      words
      to
      utter.
      Even
      if
      I
      figure
      that
      one
      out,
      I'd

      to

      The

      I've
      found
      a
      few
      meetups
      around
      me,
      but
      most
      of
      them
      is
      people
      that
      are
      in
      their
      40's
      or
      older.
      Big
      age
      gap.
      Even
      the
      board
      game
      ones
      don't
      look
      very
      good.
      I'm
      close
      to
      giving
      up
      on
      meetups.
      Thinking
      about
      joining
      group
      therapy
      for
      social
      anxiety.
      Idk
      what
      I'm
      gonna
      do
      if
      that
      doesn't
      work
      out.

      I
      live
      next
      to
      a
      big
      city
      in
      the
      US.
      Idk
      why
      the
      meetups
      aren't
      very
      good
      here.
      Been
      using
      Meetup.com.
      I
      feel
      like
      the
      meetups
      that
      look
      decent
      enough
      to
      join
      is
      still
      too
      scary.
      Group
      therapy
      seems
      like
      a
      better
      first
      step.
      Gain
      some
      confidence
      after
      doing
      that.
      Maybe
      make
      a
      friend.

      suicidal
      thoughts
      doesn't
      do
      much.
      I
      know
      why
      I
      have
      these
      feelings,
      but
      they're
      still
      there.

      Because
      people
      tend
      to
      freak
      out
      about
      that
      kind
      of
      thing
      these
      days.
      Especially
      if
      you're
      into
      firearms
      as
      a
      hobby.
      People
      just
      instantly
      think
      you're
      going
      to
      shoot
      up
      a
      school
      now.

      this

      Society
      is
      a
      joke.
      So
      many
      people
      are
      cruel,
      intentionally
      or
      unintentionally.
      That's
      not

      I've

      recently
      that
      I
      don't
      challenge
      my
      anxiety
      as
      much
      as
      I
      should.
      I
      don't
      really
      know
      what
      I
      can
      do
      everyday.
      I
      go
      to
      the
      store
      as
      often
      as
      I
      can,
      but
      that's
      at
      most
      3
      times
      a
      week.
      It's
      not
      good
      when
      I
      miss
      a
      day
      of
      exposure,
      I
      start
      to
      feel
      a
      bit
      like
      crap
      the
      following
      day.

      I
      am
      in
      the
      US
      but
      I
      honestly
      don't
      think
      it
      would
      matter
      where
      I
      lived.
      People
      seem
      to
      think
      sexism
      is
      okay
      when
      it's
      against
      a
      guy.

      know
      how
      anyone
      can
      fucking
      do
      this.
      It's

      eat
      healthy

      the
      wrong
      places.
      Never
      going

      in
      myself
      if
      it
      doesn't
      fucking
      go

      Just
