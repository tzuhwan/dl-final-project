      Something
      I
      wish
      I've
      never
      realized?
      That
      some
      of
      the
      things
      I'm
      learning
      now
      at
      uni
      won't
      be
      used
      in
      real
      life
      after
      the
      exam.
      Nothing
      demotivates
      me
      more
      from
      studying
      than
      that.
      Don't
      get
      me
      wrong,
      I
      love
      learning.
      I
      enjoy
      spending
      hours
      just
      hopping
      randomly
      around
      wikipedia
      but
      I
      just
      hate
      being
      required
      to
      learn
      and
      then
      tested
      on
      it.

      It's

      copper

      cause

      that
      can

      I
      hoard
      them
      cause
      they're
      useful
      as
      washers,
      spacers,

      Better
      version

      the
      song
      here.
      http://roguedarkjedi.com/AdamJensen.mp3
      Note:
      I
      didn't
      make
      this
      and
      this
      isn't
      my

      I
      just
      found
      a
      file
      called
      AdamJensen.mp3
      on
      my
      messy
      desktop
      and
      don't
      remember
      downloading
      it.
      Checked
      its
      metadata
      date
      and
      found
      that
      link
      in
      my
      history.
      Googling
      Adam

      Barbra
      Streisand
      brought
      me
      to
      the
      video
      which
      seems
      to
      be
      a
      different

      I
      wander
      around
      Skyrim
      and
      come
      across
      old
      forts,
      caves,
      and
      dungeons,
      etc.
      I'm
      afraid
      I
      might
      end
      up
      killing
      a
      vital
      NPC
      somewhere
      or
      making
      a
      faction
      permanently
      hostile
      to
      me.
      I
      also
      don't
      want
      to
      choose
      a
      side
      too
      soon
      cause
      it
      looks
      like
      I
      can
      join
      either
      the
      empire
      or
      the
      rebellion.
      For
      example,
      I've
      just
      arrived
      in
      Markarth
      and
      [I
      did
      the
      quest
      where
      you
      investigate
      the
      murder
      and
      now
      I
      end
      up
      a
      prisoner
      and
      have
      to
      escape.
      So
      of
      course
      I
      think
      these
      forsworn
      guys
      plan
      on
      overthrowing
      the
      Silver
      Bloods
      or
      something.
      I'm
      just
      worried
      that
      maybe
      if
      I
      go
      through
      with
      this,
      I
      end
      up
      missing
      out
      on
      quests
      from
      the
      other
      side.
      Not
      to
      mention
      I
      remember
      clearing
      a
      forsworn
      fort
      on
      the
      way
      to
      the
      city.](/spoiler)
      So
      is
      it
      safe
      to
      assume
      that
      everyone
      who
      is
      automatically
      hostile
      to
      you
      is
      safe
      to
      kill
      without
      consequences
      of
      missing
      out
      on
      quest
      lines?

      Wondering
      this
      as
      well.
      Is
      there
      a
      neutral
      choice
      where
      they
      make
      peace
      or

      choice
      where
      my
      Dovahkiin
      becomes
      the
      king
      of
      Skyrim?
      Kinda
      like
      choosing
      the
      independent
      New
      Vegas
      path
      in
      Fallout.

      I
      think
      it
      focuses
      too
      much
      on
      the
      1%
      lifestyle.
      I
      have
      the
      most
      fun
      at
      cheaper
      more
      "roots"
      oriented
      places.
      My
      experience
      with
      high
      end
      places
      like
      those
      is
      that
      they're
      cliquish
      and
      unapproachable.
      Great
      if
      you've
      got
      the
      money
      and
      the
      friends
      to
      go
      with
      you.
      Good
      that
      it
      mentions
      The
      Collective
      but
      it
      lacks
      other
      cool
      scenes
      like
      Saguijo
      (and
      this
      store
      down
      the
      road
      that
      sells
      500ml
      RH
      for
      P36),
      Last
      Home,
      bigskymind
      and
      Route
      196.
      I
      can
      easily
      go
      to
      any
      of
      those
      places
      on
      a
      friday
      night
      alone
      and
      run
      into
      people
      I
      know
      or
      make
      new
      friends.

      cooling
      down
      cycles
      of
      regular
      use
      can
      make
      the
      glass

      allowing
      the
      bulb
      to
      explode
      of
      mishandled.
      TLDR:
      It

      It's
      hard
      to
      explain
      depression
      but
      what
      I
      have
      is
      like
      a
      higher
      threshold
      for
      pleasure.
      Things
      that
      make
      me
      really
      happy
      still
      make
      me
      really
      happy
      but
      things
      that
      are
      supposed
      to
      make
      me
      regular
      happy
      don't
      make
      me
      happy
      anymore
      and
      that
      results
      in
      a
      lack
      of
      motivation
      to
      do
      anything.
      I
      don't
      feel
      pleasure
      from
      watching
      mediocre
      TV
      shows
      or
      playing
      most
      video
      games
      anymore.
      Imagine
      looking
      at
      a
      massive
      list
      of
      TV
      shows
      or
      games
      and
      going
      "there's
      nothing
      good
      to
      play
      or
      watch"
      but
      apply
      that
      to
      every
      activity
      in
      life.
      Eventually,
      it
      gets
      to
      the
      point
      that
      you
      don't
      even
      wanna
      leave
      the
      bed
      anymore.
      Different
      people
      react
      to
      that
      kind
      of
      experience
      differently
      though.
      Some
      are
      strong
      enough
      to
      pull
      out
      of
      it
      and
      stay
      ahead,
      others
      realize
      they
      have
      a
      problem
      and
      seek
      out

      In

      My

      95%
      of
      the
      time,
      it's
      the
      cable
      that
      breaks
      while
      the
      actual
      drivers/earbuds
      work
      fine.
      I'm
      into
      electronics
      so
      I
      know
      how
      to
      solder.
      That
      let
      me
      justify
      buying
      expensive
      earphones
      cause
      I
      can
      just
      re-cable
      them
      each
      time
      they
      break.
      I
      used
      to
      have
      a
      Sony
      pair
      that
      lasted
      4
      years
      but
      went
      through
      over
      10
      cables/jacks
      until
      the
      actual
      earbuds
      fell
      into
      water.
      For
      most
      people
      though,
      a
      long
      warranty
      will
      do.
      It
      makes
      sense
      for
      manufacturers
      because
      they
      can
      just
      recable
      the
      ones
      you
      send
      in
      easily.

      I
      heard
      they
      actually
      do
      ask
      some
      questions.
      The
      one
      I
      remember
      was
      "Did
      you
      let
      anyone
      else
      use
      your
      headphones?"
      and
      you
      should
      say
      that
      you're
      the
      only
      one
      who
      uses
      them
      because
      it's
      a
      personal
      warranty
      and
      lending
      it
      to
      people
      voids
      that.

      And
      I
      thought
      a
      lot
      of
      newspapers
      were
      named
      after
      the
      fast
      animal
      to
      emphasize
      the
      speed
      at
      which
      they
      report
      up
      to
      date
      news.
      Only
      figured
      it
      out
      when
      I
      encountered
      both
      words
      on
      the
      same
      day.

      [Here's
      a
      recording
      with
      my
      phone](https://soundcloud.com/analogdash/jazz-track)
      I'm
      an
      occasional
      jazz
      listener
      and
      I
      went
      to
      a
      show
      a
      week
      ago
      and
      they
      performed
      this.
      I
      listen
      to
      jazz
      every
      now
      and
      then
      but
      I
      can't
      place
      where
      I've
      heard
      this
      before

      it's
      driving
      me
      crazy.

      Okay,

      The
      40mm
      f/1.7
      is
      a
      nice
      lens
      and
      the
      viewfinder
      is
      pretty
      big.
      It's
      my
      go
      to
      all
      around
      RF.
      I
      had
      to
      replace
      the
      seals
      when
      I
      first
      got
      it
      and
      it
      was
      kinda
      hard
      to
      find
      a
      UV
      filter
      of
      the
      right
      diameter
      but
      other
      than
      that,
      it's
      been
      awesome!
      No
      meter
      though
      but
      it's
      fine,
      I've
      gotten
      used
      to
      Sunny16.

      You
      can
      get
      either
      Zinc
      Air
      or
      Alkaline
      cells.
      The
      Zinc
      Air
      cells
      have
      a
      defined
      life
      span
      whether
      you
      use
      it
      or
      not
      but
      maintain
      a
      steady
      voltage
      throughout.
      The
      Alkalines
      start
      off
      at
      a
      higher
      voltage
      then
      tapers
      down.
      It
      can
      start
      off
      overexposing,
      then
      perfect,
      then
      underexposing
      (or
      I
      think
      it's
      backwards?)
      and
      it
      can
      be
      a
      whole
      stop
      off.
      Shouldn't
      be
      too
      bad
      if
      you're
      shooting
      negatives.
      I'd
      rather
      not
      deal
      with
      that
      though
      so
      I
      just
      go
      manually.

      Hey
      /r/askelectronics!
      I'm
      trying
      to
      design
      a
      board
      for
      a
      guitar
      effects
      pedal.
      It's
      got
      TRS
      connectors,
      potentiometers
      and
      a
      DPDT
      switch
      but
      since
      they
      won't
      be
      mounted
      on
      the
      board
      itself,
      I
      was
      wondering
      how
      I
      could
      plot
      their
      pins
      separately.
      Here's
      what
      I'm
      working
      on.
      http://i.imgur.com/xVrz8eE.png
      Basically,
      I
      want
      to
      turn
      all
      the
      objects
      on
      the
      left
      into
      holes
      around
      the
      board
      that
      I
      can
      just
      wire

      Sorry
      if
      it's
      a
      dumb
      question
      but
      every
      value
      chart
      online
      has
      told
      me
      that
      "22
      or
      220"
      is
      22pf
      while
      "221"
      is
      220pf
      and
      yet
      4
      different
      branches
      of
      2
      different
      stores
      have
      tried
      to
      sell
      me
      a
      "220"
      capacitor
      when
      I
      asked
      for
      a
      220pf
      capacitor.
      When
      I
      specifically
      ask
      for
      a
      "221"
      capacitor,
      they
      either
      say
      they
      don't
      have
      any
      or
      that
      it's
      the
      same
      thing
      as
      a
      "220".

      Actually,
      they're
      all
      electronics
      parts
      stores
      and
      sell
      all
      kinds
      of
      DIY
      components
      and
      kits
      which
      is
      why
      I
      sort
      of
      trust
      them.
      I've
      never
      had
      a
      problem
      with
      the
      parts
      they
      provided
      until
      my
      current
      project
      (a
      guitar
      effects
      pedal)
      would
      cut
      off
      after
      a
      few
      seconds
      and
      I
      suspected
      my
      caps
      were
      too
      small.
      Strangely
      enough,
      the
      problem
      only
      occured
      on
      the
      protoboard.
      When
      I
      applied
      it
      to
      a
      PCB,
      it
      works
      okay,
      leading
      me
      to
      believe
      the
      parts
      are
      fine
      and
      long
      component
      legs
      on
      a
      protoboard
      just
      messed
      with
      the
      signal
      too
      much.

      Start
      a
      journal.
      Physical
      traits
      like
      voice
      and
      looks
      are
      easily
      saved
      in
      audio
      and
      photo/video
      but
      it's
      your
      personality
      that's
      most
      important.
      Unfortunately,
      there's
      no
      cookie
      cutter
      method
      for
      backing
      this
      up
      right
      now
      like
      taking
      a
      3D
      scan
      of
      yourself
      or
      recording
      yourself
      reciting
      the
      phonetic
      equivalent
      of
      "The
      quick
      brown
      fox".
      Any
      kind
      of
      objective
      "personality
      test"
      will
      have
      finite
      outcomes
      and
      even
      if
      it
      manages
      to
      nail
      down
      your
      general
      personality,
      it's
      the
      nuances
      that
      make
      us
      unique.
      The
      best
      way
      to
      preserve
      this
      is
      to
      provide
      whoever
      is
      trying
      to
      reconstruct
      you
      (when
      the
      technology
      becomes
      available)
      with
      as
      many
      viable
      data
      points
      as
      possible.
      Who
      we
      are
      is
      the
      result
      of
      every
      experience
      and
      memory
      we
      have
      and
      our
      individuality
      is
      expressed
      in
      how
      we
      each
      react
      to
      new
      stimuli
      using
      this
      knowledge.
      You'll
      want
      to
      save
      as
      many
      memories
      as
      you
      can
      for
      someone
      to
      rebuild
      you
      accurately.

      I've
      heard
      it
      a
      few
      times
      covered
      by
      80's
      cover
      bands
      but
      could
      never
      recall
      any
      lyrics
      to
      Google.
      Today,
      I
      thought
      I
      found
      it
      in
      A
      Flock
      of
      Seagulls'
      Space
      Age

      it
      was
      just
      the
      cascading
      guitar
      part
      that
      reminded
      me
      of
      it
      and
      while
      it
      was
      a

      tune,
      I
      remember
      that
      tune
      being
      sung.
      I
      hope
      this
      is
      enough
      to
      go
      on.
      I'm
      not
      even
      sure
      if
      I've
      ever
      heard
      the
      original
      before.
      I've
      been
      listening
      to
      more
      new
      wave
      hoping
      to
      come
      across
      it.
      haha!

      According
      to
      Machiavelli,
      every
      endeavor
      is
      a
      dichotomy
      of
      fortuna
      and
      virtu.
      Fortuna
      is
      the
      circumstance
      we
      live
      in.
      The
      environment
      we
      were
      born
      into.
      The
      things
      the
      universe
      throws
      at
      us
      that
      we
      have
      no
      control
      over.
      Virtu
      is
      our
      own
      personal
      strengths
      and
      will.
      Our
      ability
      to
      overcome
      obstacles.
      Our
      own
      actions
      and
      everything
      we
      can
      control.
      I
      realized
      that
      as
      long
      as
      I
      give
      100%
      of
      myself,
      I
      can
      die
      happy
      knowing
      I
      tried.
      Failure
      is
      only
      in
      giving
      up.

      My
      name
      is
      Alice,
      and
      i
      was
      sitting
      in
      the
      waiting
      room
      for
      my
      first
      appointment
      with
      a
      new
      dentist.
      I
      noticed
      his
      DDS
      diploma
      on
      the
      wall,
      which
      bore
      his
      full
      name.
      Suddenly,
      I
      remembered
      a
      tall,
      handsome,
      dark-haired
      boy
      with
      the
      same
      name
      had
      been
      in
      my
      high
      school
      class
      some
      30-odd
      years
      ago.
      Could
      he
      be
      the
      same
      guy
      that
      i
      had
      a
      secret
      crush
      on,
      way
      back
      then?
      Upon
      seeing
      him,
      however,
      I
      quickly
      discarded
      any
      such
      thought.
      This
      balding,
      gray-haired
      man
      with
      the
      deeply
      lined
      face
      was
      way
      too
      old
      to
      have
      been
      my
      classmate.
      After
      he
      examined
      my
      teeth,
      i
      asked
      him
      if
      he
      had
      attended
      Morgan
      Park
      High
      school
      .
      'Yes.
      Yes,
      i
      did.
      I'm
      a
      mustang,'
      he
      gleamed
      with
      pride.
      When
      did
      you
      graduate?'
      i
      asked.
      He
      answered,
      'in
      1985.
      Why
      do
      you
      ask?'
      'You
      were
      in
      my
      class!',
      I
      exclaimed.
      He
      looked
      at
      me
      closely.
      Then,
      that
      ugly,
      old,
      bald,
      wrinkled
      faced,
      fat-assed,
      gray-haired,
      decrepit
      son-of-a-bitch
      asked,
      What
      did
      you
      teach???

      My
      sister
      and
      I
      share
      a
      room
      with
      opposite
      beds.
      I'm
      the
      kind
      of
      person
      that
      gets
      cold
      easily
      while
      she
      tends
      to
      feel
      too
      warm.
      As
      a
      result,
      the
      thermostat
      of
      the
      AC
      is
      set
      to
      her
      favorite
      setting
      while
      I
      use
      a
      thin
      blanket.
      I
      started
      feeling
      a
      bit
      chilly
      recently
      so
      I
      dug
      out
      this
      old
      thick
      blanket
      we
      had
      at
      home.
      I
      even
      had
      to
      dust
      and
      wash
      it
      before
      I
      could
      use
      it.
      I
      had
      the
      best
      night
      of
      sleep
      after
      that,
      all
      comfy
      like
      a
      big
      toasty
      cinnamon
      bun.
      This
      happened
      over
      the
      weekend
      so
      I
      even
      got
      to
      sleep
      in.
      Now,
      my
      sister
      usually
      gets
      in
      bed
      earlier
      than
      me.
      The
      next
      evening,
      I
      notice
      she's
      taken
      MY
      blanket
      and
      is
      already
      wrapped
      up
      and
      asleep
      on
      her
      bed.
      I
      didn't
      want
      to
      take
      it
      from
      her
      cause
      she
      gets
      cranky
      if
      you
      try
      to
      wake
      her,
      but
      mostly
      because
      she's
      the
      kind
      of
      sweetheart
      who
      could
      get
      away
      with
      murder.
      But
      no
      way
      was
      she
      getting
      away
      with
      stealing
      my
      awesome
      blanket
      like
      a
      petty
      thief.
      So
      I
      pulled
      out
      the
      knob
      of
      the
      thermostat,
      reseated
      it
      a
      few
      notches
      down
      then
      raised
      the
      temperature
      back
      to
      "her
      setting".
      By
      morning,
      she
      had
      ditched
      the
      blanket
      and
      I
      was
      able
      to
      steal
      it
      back
      and
      recalibrate
      the
      thermostat.

      You're
      weak
      now.
      But
      you
      can
      be
      stronger
      in
      the
      future.
      Our
      bodies
      and
      minds
      are
      pliable.
      Routinely
      engaging
      in
      activites
      makes
      us
      better
      at
      those
      activities,
      and
      that
      is
      true
      both
      mentally
      and
      physically.
      In
      my
      case,
      I
      get
      anxious
      when
      I
      feel
      unprepared.
      To
      get
      over
      it,
      I
      started
      preparing
      myself.
      I
      work
      out
      to
      get
      stronger
      because
      physical
      power
      is
      useful.
      I
      practice
      situational
      awareness
      to
      keep
      mindful
      of
      whats
      going
      on.
      For
      example,
      crowded
      areas
      make
      me
      feel
      uneasy
      and
      being
      caught
      in
      a
      stampede
      or
      fire
      or
      collapsing
      building
      is
      one
      of
      my
      biggest
      fears.
      To
      keep
      on
      top
      of
      that,
      I
      always
      pay
      attention
      to
      where
      fire
      exits
      are,
      where
      possible
      fire
      risks
      might
      begin,
      and
      I
      choose
      to
      position
      myself
      in
      a
      crowd
      such
      that
      I
      have
      a
      clear
      escape
      path
      at
      any
      given
      moment.
      This
      allows
      me
      to
      get
      over
      my
      fears
      and
      I
      am
      able
      to
      enjoy
      one
      of
      my
      "incompatible"
      hobbies
      which
      is
      watching
      live
      music.
      If
      you
      feel
      that
      you
      are
      limited
      by
      something,
      remember
      that
      with
      enough
      time,
      effort,
      and
      determination,
      we
      are
      able
      to
      raise
      our
      limits.
      We

      Hey
      everyone,
      so
      I've
      used
      fitness
      apps
      in
      the
      past
      to
      track
      my
      activity
      but
      I
      didn't
      like
      bringing
      my
      phone
      with
      me
      for
      a
      jog
      or
      to
      the
      gym.
      I
      was
      wondering
      what
      watch
      apps
      work
      great
      without
      having
      the
      iPhone.
      Quite
      a
      few
      times
      have
      a
      left
      the
      house
      wanting
      to
      try
      a
      new
      app
      with
      just
      my
      watch
      only
      to
      be
      greeted
      by
      a
      screen
      telling
      me
      to
      start
      an
      activity
      in
      the
      phone
      first.
      I'm
      currently
      trying
      out
      Gym
      Log+
      and
      Gymaholic
      and
      I'm
      looking
      for
      a
      great
      C25k
      app.

      My
      biggest
      need
      right
      now
      is
      a
      C25k
      app
      or
      interval
      trainer
      app.
      All
      the
      ones
      in
      the
      app
      store
      that
      I've
      tried
      so
      far
      require
      the
      user
      to
      start
      the
      run
      on
      the
      iPhone
      and
      the
      watch
      just
      acts
      as
      a
      monitor.
      Even
      if
      I
      start
      the
      run
      on
      my
      phone
      then
      leave
      it
      at
      home
      (or
      turn
      off
      bluetooth)
      the
      watch
      app
      then
      stops
      working.

      lol
      kindness.
      Data
      integrity
      is
      one
      of
      their
      big
      selling
      points.
      80%
      of
      their
      profits
      come
      from
      20%
      of
      their
      clients
      which
      are
      businesses.
      Holding
      on
      to
      1TB
      of
      data
      that
      doesn't
      change
      is
      inconsequential
      for
      a
      platform
      that
      operates
      in
      the
      exabyte
      range.
      Even
      the
      $9.99
      I
      give
      them
      once
      is
      nothing
      compared
      to
      their
      $1
      Billion
      annual
      revenue.
      The
      utility
      I
      derive
      from
      such
      a
      low
      cost
      both
      to
      myself
      and
      the
      company
      is
      immense.
      Even
      if
      I
      actually
      am
      ripping
      them
      off
      and
      the
      operating
      costs
      of
      the
      service
      they
      provide
      me
      is
      greater
      than
      what
      I
      have
      paid,
      they've
      decided
      that
      the
      value
      they
      derive
      from
      being
      able
      to
      boast
      a
      100%
      data
      retention
      policy
      that
      results
      in
      consumer
      confidence
      is
      worth

      [Question]
      How
      to
      prevent
      iMessage/FaceTime
      activation?

      Every
      once
      in
      a
      while
      (and
      every
      time
      my
      phone
      is
      restarted),
      iOS
      asks
      me
      to
      verify
      my
      icloud
      password.
      Whether
      I
      type
      it
      in
      or
      dismiss
      the
      prompt,
      it
      turns
      out
      this
      is
      iOS
      trying
      to
      activate
      my
      iMessage
      and
      FaceTime
      (and
      failing).
      The
      thing
      is,
      I
      never
      use
      iMessage
      or
      Facetime
      and
      have
      them
      disabled
      in
      my
      settings.
      Turning
      on
      iMessage
      and
      FaceTime
      triggers
      activation
      but
      it
      fails
      as
      well.
      I
      assume
      it
      fails
      because
      I'm
      using
      a
      refurbished/second
      hand/unlocked
      iPhone.
      Either
      way,
      I
      still
      get
      charged
      an
      activation
      fee
      by
      my
      carrier.
      Is
      there
      a
      way
      to
      permanently
      disable
      iMessage
      and
      FaceTime
      so
      I
      stopped
      getting
      charged?
      I'd
      switch
      carriers
      but
      every
      carrier
      in
      my
      area
      has
      that
      charge.
      On
      an
      iPhone
      5S.
      iOS

      The
      activation
      always
      fails.
      I
      assume
      it's
      because
      I'm
      using
      an
      "unlocked"
      iPhone
      and
      apple
      isn't
      accepting

      which
      is
      from

      When
      you
      activate
      iMessage/FaceTime,
      the
      iPhone
      sends
      an
      SMS
      to
      Apple
      to
      verify
      your
      number.
      For
      many
      countries,
      it's
      free.
      But
      in
      some
      countries,
      Apple
      doesn't
      have
      a
      local
      number
      and
      so
      we
      are
      charged
      an
      international
      SMS
      fee.
      The
      problem
      with
      mine
      is
      that
      activation
      fails
      every
      time
      and
      every
      attempt
      results
      in
      a
      charge.

      Hijacking
      the
      top
      comment
      to
      expound
      on
      how
      Erap
      does
      it.
      In
      the
      Manila
      city
      hall,
      there's
      this
      cardboard
      box
      with
      a
      lid
      in
      front
      of
      Erap's
      office
      where
      the
      clerks
      would
      dump
      cash
      received
      as
      bribes
      from
      businesses
      based
      in
      Manila
      in
      exchange
      for
      favors,
      speedy
      bureaucracy,
      tax
      avoidance,
      etc.
      To
      buy
      their
      loyalty,
      the
      clerks
      are
      allowed
      to
      skim
      off
      the
      top
      of
      any
      bribes
      they
      receive.
      At
      the
      end
      of
      the
      day,
      Erap
      takes
      this
      box
      and
      goes
      to
      one
      of
      his
      regular
      casinos
      and
      gambles
      away
      all
      that
      cash
      while
      indulging
      himself.
      The
      cash
      of
      course
      ends
      up
      going
      back
      to
      him
      after
      the
      casino
      takes
      their
      own
      cut
      for
      laundering
      the
      money.

      My
      parents'
      experience:
      they
      were
      around
      12
      years
      old
      when
      Martial
      Law
      was
      declared
      and
      around
      26
      when
      Marcos
      was
      ousted.
      They
      didn't
      join
      any
      activist
      movements
      or
      communist
      organizations.
      Basically,
      kept
      their
      head
      down
      which
      was
      very
      easy
      to
      do.
      Both
      came
      from
      middle
      class
      families,
      got
      jobs
      right
      out
      of
      college
      working
      for
      the
      national
      airline
      which
      never
      saw
      a
      profit
      but
      the
      employees
      were
      well
      compensated.
      They
      made
      a
      lot
      of
      money
      and
      were
      able
      to
      use
      it
      to
      support
      a
      family.
      Their
      opinion
      of
      Marcos
      is
      that
      he
      did
      a
      good
      job
      keeping
      the
      nation
      in
      "order".
      The
      communists
      brought
      the
      violence
      upon
      themselves.
      They
      believe
      that
      Marcos
      did
      steal
      a
      lot
      of
      public
      money
      and
      squandered
      it.
      They
      witnessed
      it
      firsthand
      as
      employees
      of
      the
      national
      airline
      which
      the
      Marcoses
      used
      as
      their
      personal
      airline
      jet
      setting
      around
      the
      world.
      Entire
      sections
      of
      a
      747
      would
      be
      cordoned
      off
      for
      Imelda's
      dresses
      and
      shopping.
      They
      were
      fond
      of
      music
      and
      singing
      and
      would
      bring
      an
      entire
      rondalla
      (string
      ensemble)
      with
      them
      on
      the
      plane.
      The
      Marcoses
      would
      tip
      the
      crew
      in
      dollars.
      My
      parents
      agree
      the
      Philippines
      could
      be
      in
      a
      better
      place
      if
      Marcos
      didn't
      plunder
      the
      nation's
      wealth
      but
      they
      don't
      feel
      too
      bad
      about
      it
      because
      they
      had
      good
      jobs
      thanks
      to
      Marcos
      and
      experienced
      upward
      social
      mobility.

      mom

      of
      kidnappings
      and
      assassinations.
      Biggest
      targets
      were
      student
      leaders
      and
      journalists.
      Militarized
      police
      would
      storm
      the
      campus.
      Curfew
      was
      in
      effect
      and
      anyone
      outside
      at
      night
      would
      be
      accosted
      by
      the
      MetroCom.
      Bags
      would
      be
      searched
      and
      anyone
      possessing
      anti
      government
      propaganda
      like
      flyers
      or
      newspapers
      with
      stories
      critical
      of
      the
      government
      were
      arrested
      and
      interrogated.
      Even
      having
      long
      hair
      as
      a
      male
      will
      put
      you
      under
      suspicion.
      Writ
      of
      habeas
      corpus
      was
      suspended
      and
      so
      detainees
      would
      be
      kept
      indefinitely
      without
      family
      members
      knowing
      their
      whereabouts.
      Some
      would
      be
      released
      without
      harm,
      some
      would
      return
      after
      being
      tortured.
      Electric
      shock
      to
      genitals,
      fingernails
      pulled
      out,
      rape,
      stab
      wounds.
      Some
      would
      be
      found
      much
      later
      dead
      and
      wrapped
      in
      garbage
      bags
      on
      the
      side
      of
      the
      road.
      The
      act
      was
      called
      "salvage".
      Some
      have
      yet
      to
      be
      found,
      we
      call
      them
      "desaparecido".
      Other
      targeted
      activists
      would
      be
      gunned
      down
      in
      the
      city
      or
      in
      their
      cars.
      My
      professor
      didn't
      join
      the
      communists
      that
      took
      up
      arms.
      He
      continued
      to
      write
      privately/secretly.
