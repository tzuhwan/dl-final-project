      I
      flew
      to
      the
      island
      but
      my
      ps4
      controller
      didn't
      change
      color.
      Remained
      blue.
      I
      have
      seen
      my
      controller
      light
      up
      different
      colors
      in
      other
      games
      before.
      Hmm.

      This
      just
      happened
      to
      me...I
      did
      the
      howl
      and
      it
      sounded
      like
      a
      goat
      or
      something.

      I
      just
      played
      Disco
      and

      dance
      floors

      on

      Thought

      First
      time
      I
      tried
      today...(in
      disco),
      some
      ass
      kept
      killing
      me
      as
      I
      tried
      to
      complete
      the
      challenge.
      Then
      the
      2nd
      game,
      I
      waited
      for
      almost
      10
      minutes
      while
      2
      werewolves
      acted
      like
      idiots,
      sabotaging
      everybody's
      attempt
      to
      complete
      the
      challenge
      as
      they
      consistently
      walked
      across
      the
      piano.
      The
      only
      time
      I
      ever
      wished
      I
      could
      put
      a
      bullet
      in
      my
      teammates'
      head

      Got
      it...
      Finally.
      I
      jumped
      in
      there
      again...
      Waited
      patiently
      until
      somebody
      completed
      the
      challenge...
      Then
      I
      jumped
      in.
      Thankfully
      the
      person
      waiting
      in
      line
      after
      me
      waited
      for
      me
      to
      finish.
      Lol.
      Its
      the
      little
      things.

      She's
      always
      been
      one
      of

      No

      so
      much
      hatred.
      She's
      a
      fun
      skin
      who
      has
      very
      dynamic
      facial
      expressions.
      I
      have
      a

      I
      play

      Why

      I
      log

      Where
      the

      last
      20

      and
      I

      if

      kills

      Seems

      The
      only
      thing
      I

      was

      Just
      saw
      an
      official
      announcement
      in
      game.
      "The

      power
      has
      overwhelmed
      the
      playlists.
      Stay
      in-game

      witness
      the

      occurring
      at
      1pm
      ET
      (6pm
      UTC)."
      That
      means
      disco
      is
      fine.
      It's
      settled.

      I've

      this
      since
      this

      I

      I'm
      starting

      wonder
      if
      people

      trying

      bait
      people
      to

      You're
      right.
      I
      was
      starting
      at
      it...and
      it
      disappeared
      when
      I
      tried
      to
      go
      in.
      So
      I
      guess
      they're
      not
      giving
      anybody
      any
      other
      option.
      This
      whole
      thing
      is
      ridiculous.

      So
      used
      to
      respawn...

      Yeah,
      I
      had
      just
      unlocked
      Dire
      and
      I
      was
      really
      looking
      to
      leveling
      him
      up.
      The
      respawn
      gave
      me
      confidence
      and
      we
      really
      racked
      up
      the
      XP.
      I
      had
      the
      most
      fun
      ever
      in
      the
      game.
      I'm
      trying
      not
      to
      be
      depressed...
      but
      I
      am.

      Well
      they
      kept
      it
      long
      enough
      so
      they
      must
      have
      been
      ok
      with
      the
      high
      XP.
      The
      game
      was
      just
      really
      fulfilling..I
      always
      felt
      like
      I
      had
      a
      direct
      impact
      on
      the
      game
      when
      I
      flew
      over
      the
      entire
      map
      and
      grabbed
      dance
      floors
      so
      we
      would
      win.
      Now
      I'm
      back
      to
      just
      being
      a
      terrible
      builder,
      getting
      shot,
      and
      hoping
      I
      get
      revived...and
      getting
      200xp.
      I
      guess
      I'll
      adjust
      I
      just
      wish
      they'd
      have
      a
      respawn
      mode
      since
      we've
      gotten
      so
      used
      to
      it.
      I
      feel
      like
      A
      LOT
      of
      people
      are
      going
      to
      miss
      this.

      Totally
      bummed
      about
      the
      removal
      of
      disco/respawn.
      That
      was
      the

      I've
      had
      in
      the

      I
      hope
      they'll
      consider
      making
      a
      separate
      mode
      with
      the
      respawn.
      It
      was
      my
      pace..
      Much
      less
      stressful
      knowing
      you'll
      keep
      on
      living,
      and
      much
      more
      fun
      knowing
      you'll
      still
      be
      there
      to
      the
      very
      end.

      Same
      here.
      It
      works
      after
      exiting
      the
      game
      and
      going
      back
      in...
      But
      it
      breaks
      again.
      If
      you're
      playing
      with
      friends
      they
      can
      actually
      see
      you
      dancing...
      But
      you
      can't.
      And
      apparently
      it
      just
      infinitely
      dances.

      I
      really
      miss
      the
      rainbow.
      It
      was
      so
      beautiful
      after
      the
      darkness
      and
      our
      transcendent
      butterfly
      moment.
      I
      danced
      the
      flamenco
      in
      front
      of
      it
      the
      following
      morning.
      Then
      they
      took
      it
      from
      us
      like
      an
      evil
      god.
      I
      was
      like...WHY
      WOULD
      THEY
      TAKE
      THE
      RAINBOW
      AWAY.
      Cruel.

      Every

      I
      get
      killed
      and
      respawn
      in
      Disco
      Domination,
      the
      counter
      unfortunately
      resets
      back
      to
      0.
      Are
      others
      experiencing
      this
      problem?
      It
      really
      sucks
      because
      it
      obviously
      defeats
      the
      purpose.
      Hopefully
      it's
      just
      a
      bug
      and
      can
      be
      fixed.
      I
      really
      love
      this
      skin
      and

      Yeah,
      but
      you're
      in
      the
      same
      game.
      Even
      if
      it's
      only
      3
      kills,
      it'd
      be
      nice
      to
      hold
      on
      to
      the
      number
      throughout
      the
      game,
      regardless
      of
      being
      killed.
      Most
      of
      us
      get
      killed
      numerous
      times
      in
      Disco
      if
      you're
      playing
      aggressively.

      That's
      good
      to
      know.
      So
      they
      must
      know
      about
      this
      bug..I
      have
      the
      Ghost
      Portal
      and
      I
      never
      noticed
      any
      difference...there
      were
      always
      ghosts
      flying
      out
      of
      that
      thing.
      Obviously
      it
      became
      more
      noticeable
      after
      seeing
      a
      number.
      I
      would
      think
      since
      reactive
      skins
      are
      going
      to
      be
      a
      thing
      now,
      and
      Disco
      obviously
      has
      popularity
      (contrary
      to
      all
      the
      whining
      right
      now),
      so
      I
      think
      they
      will
      fix
      this.
      I
      don't
      see
      why
      they
      wouldn't.

      I
      didn't

      I
      love
      the
      redeployment
      feature.
      It's
      much
      easier
      to
      get
      around
      the
      map.
      I
      feel
      like
      most
      of
      the
      people
      that
      are
      complaining
      are
      the
      ones
      that
      were
      able
      to
      dominate
      before,
      only
      now
      they're
      being
      eliminated
      more
      because
      others
      have
      more
      of
      a
      chance
      to
      win
      and
      get
      to
      them.
      It
      levels
      the
      field
      more.
      IMO,
      most
      of
      the
      fun
      would
      be
      lost
      if
      the
      redeployment
      feature
      was
      removed.
      That's
      my
      2
      cents.

      I'm
      on
      PS4.
      It's
      been
      happening
      since
      the
      last
      update.
      Really
      annoying
      especially
      when
      you
      can
      see
      your
      friend's
      emotes...
      And
      they
      can
      see
      yours,
      but
      you
      can't
      see
      your
      own.
      And
      when
      you
      emote
      some
      of
      them
      go
      on
      forever
      (which
      doesn't
      usually
      happen
      in
      lobby)

      Yeah...I'm
      flying
      and
      hopping
      all
      over
      the
      dance
      floors
      trying
      to
      capture,
      defend
      and
      contest
      using
      rifts
      and
      balloons
      to
      get
      a
      win
      for
      32
      people..while
      eliminating
      5-7
      people,
      as
      well
      as
      getting
      killed
      multiple
      times
      (so
      we
      can
      ALL
      get
      higher
      XP)
      while
      I
      watch
      29
      of
      them
      respawning
      at
      the
      bloodbath
      over
      and
      over
      in
      the
      middle
      of
      the
      map.
      A
      place
      where
      I
      never
      go...
      Unless
      I
      have
      to
      because
      of
      everything
      I
      wrote...and
      we
      run
      out
      of
      time.
      Then
      we
      end
      up
      losing.
      Yeah,
      I
      would
      LOVE
      some
      XP
      incentive,
      because
      honestly
      my
      team
      hardly
      ever
      wins
      unless
      I
      do
      all
      the
      things
      mentioned.
      I
      feel
      like
      I'm
      doing
      all
      the
      work.

      Correction...
      redeploy
      works,
      but
      as
      soon
      as
      you
      deploy,
      you
      can't
      skydive,
      then
      redeploy.
      Once
      you
      deploy
      you
      have
      to
      land
      before
      redeploying.
      That's
      what
      I'm
      experiencing.

      In

      deployment
      works
      from
      a
      balloon
      (and
      from
      heights).
      Just
      tested
      this.
      But
      once
      you
      deploy,
      you
      can't
      skydive
      and
      then

      It
      always
      deploys.
      But
      once
      you've
      deployed,
      you
      can't
      "undeploy",
      skydive,
      go
      lower
      than
      redeploy
      again.
      Once
      you
      deploy
      the
      parachute
      that's
      it.
      You
      have
      to
      land
      before
      you
      can
      start
      the
      process
      again.
      That's
      the
      major
      difference
      that
      I've
      experienced.

      Accepted...and
      I
      totally
      understand
      that
      it's
      perfect
      for
      challenges.
      I've
      jumped
      in
      the
      middle
      of
      the
      map
      to
      complete
      challenges...
      But
      I've
      always
      put
      the
      win
      before
      the
      eliminations.
      I
      feel
      like
      if
      I'm
      spending
      the
      whole
      game
      in
      the
      middle
      of
      the
      map
      trying
      to
      complete
      challenges,
      I'm
      letting
      my
      team
      down.
      If
      we're
      winning
      by
      a
      large
      margin
      and
      I
      have
      to
      complete
      a
      challenge
      I
      will
      definitely
      go
      to
      the
      bloodbath.
      If
      it's
      a
      mode
      where
      everybody
      just
      fucks
      off
      and
      nobody
      cares
      about
      winning...
      I
      guess
      I'll
      stop
      caring
      so
      much.

      White
      wolf...
      That
      was
      the
      whole
      point.
      They

      we'd
      be
      getting
      snow
      while
      everybody

      It's
      much,
      much
      better.
      It's
      easier
      to
      get
      around,
      but
      doesn't
      seem
      quite
      as
      fast
      as
      before
      all
      the
      adjustments.
      Looks
      like
      they're
      trying
      to
      find
      some
      mid-ground.
      I'm
      satisfied
      with
      this.

      Interesting
      how
      I
      got
      downvoted
      to
      hell
      simply
      because
      I
      honestly
      didn't
      understand
      why
      everybody
      thought
      he
      was
      cheating.
      I
      don't
      watch
      a
      lot
      of
      streaming,
      and
      I
      play
      on
      PS4,
      so
      maybe
      that's
      why
      I'm
      not
      catching
      it.
      I
      would
      have
      just
      thought
      he
      was
      a
      really
      skilled
      player.

      You

      be
      able

      level
      up
      Dire

      I've
      seen
      it
      stated
      many
      times.
      They
      also
      wanted
      to
      give
      people
      something
      to

      There
      will
      be
      a
      lot
      of
      werewolves
      leveling
      up
      in
      season
      7.
      No

      I
      like
      the
      concept..
      It's
      fun,
      but
      it's
      also
      frustrating.
      I
      agree
      that
      it
      ruins
      games
      and
      should

      with

      more

      It's
      a
      huge
      risk
      in
      Team
      Rumble
      because
      you

      Missing
      the
      respawn.
      Completely
      destroys
      the
      game
      for
      me.
      Why
      can't
      they
      just
      leave
      a
      respawn
      mode??
      Many
      people
      only
      play
      these
      modes,
      especially
      for
      challenges
      and
      XP.
      You're
      guaranteed
      20
      minutes
      of
      playing
      and
      having
      fun
      no
      matter
      how
      many
      times
      you
      die.
      It's
      the
      most
      fun
      I've
      ever
      had
      in
      a
      game.
      Epic,
      what
      is
      the
      harm
      in
      just
      leaving
      a
      respawn
      mode
      permanently??
      A
      lot
      of
      us
      are
      getting
      used
      to
      this
      style
      of
      play
      and
      it's
      frustrating
      to
      pull
      it
      away.
      Edit:
      Why
      downvote
      this
      so
      it
      loses
      visibility?
      Why
      not
      let
      the
      thousands
      that
      surely
      feel
      this
      way
      have
      a
      mode
      that
      we
      all
      want
      to
      play
      permanently?
      Isn't
      that
      what
      this
      whole
      thing
      is
      about?

      I
      hope
      so!
      I
      loved
      Disco
      Domination
      as
      well.
      I
      think
      if
      they
      add
      dance
      floors
      (or
      another
      task)
      to
      Team
      Rumble
      it'll
      be
      even
      better.

      It

      3
      Team

      You

      I'm
      so
      glad
      this
      is
      getting
      visibility.
      It's
      my
      favorite
      mode.
      I
      hope
      Epic
      will
      consider
      just
      leaving
      this
      mode
      permanently.
      You
      can
      still
      have
      other
      LTMs.
      What's
      the
      harm
      in
      making
      it
      equal
      and
      permanent
      just
      like
      solo,
      duos
      and
      squads.
      Everybody
      knows
      it's
      perfect
      for
      challenges.
      It's
      the
      most
      fun
      I've
      had
      and
      it
      keeps
      me
      coming
      back
      every
      day.
      I
      hope
      Epic
      is
      hearing
      us.

      I
      have
      asked
      that
      same
      question
      to
      Courtney
      Brown,
      wondering
      if
      it's
      possible
      the
      RV'er
      could
      be
      remote
      viewing
      into
      an
      image/narrative
      bubble
      that
      exists
      in
      the
      target
      creator's
      head.
      He
      said
      that
      they
      do
      something
      in
      their
      procedure
      to
      try
      to
      clear
      out
      any
      possibility
      of
      that.
      Sometimes
      I
      wonder
      whether
      the
      remote
      viewer
      is
      picking
      up
      on
      the
      immediate
      future
      where
      they
      discuss
      with
      Courtney
      Brown
      what
      the
      results
      are.
      So
      the
      images
      from
      their
      future
      reveal
      that
      they
      inevitably
      have
      could
      be
      popping
      up
      in
      their
      head.
      Like
      a
      closed
      loop.
      Just
      an
      idea.

      I
      agree,
      but
      they'll
      probably
      bring
      it
      back
      soon.
      It
      doesn't
      seem
      like
      they
      ever
      have
      more
      than
      one
      team
      LTM
      at
      a
      time,
      and
      they
      probably
      wanted
      to
      show
      off
      the
      drift
      board
      and
      try
      something
      new.
      I
      just
      realized
      that
      they
      probably
      also
      figured
      it
      was
      safer
      to
      take
      out
      Team
      Rumble
      temporarily
      right
      at
      the
      end
      of
      the
      season
      when
      mostly
      all
      challenges
      were
      done.
      Many
      fought
      to
      make
      it
      permanent
      including
      myself
      and
      people
      have
      grown
      to
      depend
      on
      it
      for
      challenges,
      so
      I'm
      sure
      it'll
      be
      back
      soon.
      I'm
      a
      laid
      back,
      casual
      player,
      and
      It's
      all
      my
      friends
      and
      I
      usually
      play.

      There's

      Nobody

      Thanks
      for
      mentioning
      the
      autorun.

      have
      it
      set
      to
      Sprint
      by
      default,
      but
      it
      doesn't
      work.

      He

      Does
      it

      I'm

      suffers
      from
      the

      I
      fully
      expect
      to
      get
      down
      voted
      to
      hell.
      I
      understand
      the
      changes
      are
      controversial,
      and
      I
      understand
      why
      some
      are
      upset.
      But
      honestly...
      How
      is
      this
      update
      *so*
      bad
      that
      people
      don't
      want
      to
      play??
      There's
      enough
      about
      the
      game
      that's
      awesome
      and
      I've
      never
      had
      so
      much
      fun.
      Sure,
      the
      siphoning
      was
      great...but
      is
      it
      really
      "unplayable"?
      Is
      it
      really
      not
      fun
      anymore?
      Come
      on
      guys...
      Epic
      created
      a
      system
      where
      the
      developers
      have
      an
      open
      line
      of
      communication
      with
      it's
      players...but
      a
      monster
      was
      created.
      *We
      are
      that
      monster*.
      I
      am
      extremely
      thankful
      that
      I
      have
      a
      game
      that
      I
      love
      that
      I
      can
      play
      daily
      that
      keeps
      it
      fresh
      every
      week.
      I
      just
      wish
      everybody
      would
      just
      chill
      out
      and
      have
      fun.

      We've
      been
      asking
      for

      long..there's
      no
      reason
      to
      have
      them
      there.
      Something
      tells
      me
      they're
      there
      to
      stay.
      It
      seems
      to
      be
      just
      another
      thing
      everybody
      wants
      and
      complains
      about
      every

      and
      there's
      absolutely
      no
      logical
      reason
      for
      them
      to
      not

      auto
      redeploy

      Rumble.
      *NOBODY*

      What's
      the

      Could
      you

      they

      question,

      The
      aim
      on
      the
      blue
      SMG
      is
      crazy
      better
      than
      the
      P90
      and
      you
      can
      actually
      hit
      long
      distance
      with
      them
      (It's
      weak
      in
      long
      distance
      but
      it
      will
      reach
      them).
      I
      can
      only
      hit
      shots
      with
      the
      P90
      if
      they're
      close.

      I
      know
      it
      was
      tied
      to
      the
      concert,
      but
      he's
      popular
      and
      a
      fortnite
      player
      which
      I'm
      sure
      is
      making
      a
      lot
      of
      money
      off
      of
      people
      advertising
      for
      him
      by
      wearing
      his
      skin.
      I'm
      actually
      surprised
      this
      is
      getting
      downvoted
      heavily.
      I
      underestimated
      the

      of
      selfish
      children
      that
      get
      upset
      at
      even
      the
      thought
      of
      a
      precious
      rare
      skin
      getting
      re-released.
      They
      don't
      want
      anybody
      else
      to
      have
      the
      ability
      to
      have
      what
      they
      have.
      Time
      to
      grow

      Yes
      I

      we've
      had
      Team
      Rumble
      all
      season...why
      remove

      We've

      it.
      I
      have
      fun
      in
      Team
      Rumble.
      Most

      it's
      much
      less

      have
      been
      complaining
      about
      it
      since
      morning.
      I'm
      just
      like
      you
      and
      even
      though
      I
      will
      play
      Solos
      and
      Squads
      sometimes,
      I
      love
      the
      Team
      Rumble
      casual
      play
      better
      than
      anything.
      I'm
      actually
      amazed
      that
      as
      much
      as
      we've
      complained
      about
      Food
      Fight
      and
      how
      much
      we've
      campaigned
      for
      Team
      Rumble
      that
      they
      haven't
      figured
      out
      a
      way
      to
      make
      it
      permanent,
      and
      that
      they
      haven't
      decided
      to
      pull
      the
      plug
      on
      Food
      Fight
      yet
      today.
      I
      know
      they're
      listening...please
      stop
      taking
      the
      mode
      away
      that
      many
      of
      us
      play
      primarily
      and
      love.
      I
      couldn't
      care
      less
      about
      getting
      made
      fun
      of
      for
      enjoying
      it.
      My
      13
      year
      old
      son
      chooses
      Team
      Rumble
      primarily
      and
      he's
      an
      excellent
      player
      that's
      been
      playing
      since
      season
      1.
      Confidence
      issues
      keep
      him
      out
      of
      solos
      primarily,
      and
      it's
      toxic
      players
      that
      have
      conditioned
      him
      to
      think
      that
      only
      bots
      that
      can't
      play,
      play
      Team
      Rumble.
      It's
      a
      different
      type
      of
      play...and
      whether
      people
      want
      to
      admit
      it...many
      of
      us
      play
      much
      more
      psycho
      aggressive
      in
      this
      mode
      because
      we're
      not
      afraid
      to
      die...and
      that's
      the
      truth.

      The

      removed
      a

      a

      to

      Team
      Rumble
      back
      permanently.
      I

      that
      posted
      it
      and

      the

      removed
      it
      due
      to
      "redundancy".
      People

      The
      only
      thing
      we
      have
      close
      is
      Dire's
      sword
      back
      bling,
      which
      has
      turned
      into
      the
      go-to
      simple
      back
      bling
      when
      "nothing
      looks
      right."
      I've
      wanted
      to
      use
      this
      back
      bling
      many
      times,
      but
      I'm
      always
      turned
      off
      because
      of
      how
      high
      the
      backpack
      is.
      I
      agree
      with
      you...
      Let's
      get
      an
      option
      to
      remove
      that
      part
      altogether.
      I
      bet
      it
      would
      be
      popular.

      They
      seem
      to
      be
      determined
      to
      keep
      Food
      Fight
      in
      right
      now
      and
      keep
      Team
      Rumble
      out
      for
      some
      reason,
      no
      matter
      what
      we
      say.
      Maybe
      they
      really
      don't
      give
      a
      shit,
      and
      they're
      focusing
      on
      the
      Avengers
      mode?
      I'm
      honestly
      surprised
      Food
      Fight
      is
      still
      here
      with
      how
      vocal
      we've
      been.
      Maybe
      the
      whole
      time
      we
      thought
      they
      were
      listening
      to
      our
      feedback
      we
      were
      wrong?
      They
      have
      a
      chance
      to
      make
      the
      community
      much
      happier
      but
      they're
      choosing
      not
      to.
      Couldn't
      their
      servers
      possibly
      handle
      leaving
      it
      in
      as
      a
      permanent
      mode
      with
      all
      the
      money
      they're
      making
      from
      us?

      was
      what

      played

      I'm

      When
      is
      Team
      Rumble
      coming
      back?
      I
      still
      can't
      figure
      out
      a
      logical
      reason
      they
      would
      keep
      Food
      Fight
      in
      that
      everybody
      hates,
      and
      pull
      Team
      Rumble
      that
      people
      were
      getting
      used
      to
      for
      challenges
      and
      enjoying
      casual
      gameplay.
      So
      many
      including
      myself
      play
      this
      as
      their
      main
      mode.
      It
      should
      remain
      *permanent*
      along
      side
      Solo,
      Duos
      and
      Squads.
      You
      easily
      have
      millions
      covered
      by
      keeping
      both
      competitive
      and
      the
      casual
      players
      happy.
      We
      don't
      like
      Food
      Fight...isn't
      it
      clear?
      *It
      just
      doesn't
      make
      sense.*

      This

      And

      Team
      Rumble
      wasn't
      brought

      Edit:
      And....I

      realized
      they
      brought
      Team

      back!

      I'm
      experiencing
      this
      on
      PS4
      every
      game
      now.
      It
      was
      only
      in
      certain
      locations
      and
      periodically
      before.
      I
      can't
      slip
      stream
      without
      this
      happening.
      I
      feel
      like
      I'm
      playing
      badly
      rendered
      N64.

      Has
      anybody
      noticed
      that
      in
      Team
      Rumble
      the
      areas
      that
      have
      these
      hot
      spots
      have
      less
      chests.
      It
      doesn't
      necessarily
      make
      these
      areas
      better.
      I
      don't
      see
      any
      benefit
      in
      Team
      Rumble
      because
      it
      normally
      has
      100%
      chest
      spawn.
      For
      example,
      under
      normal
      circumstances,
      I
      will
      make
      out
      well
      in
      Happy
      Hamlet,
      but
      now
      we
      get
      less
      loot
      if
      it's
      lit
      up,
      not
      more.
      So,
      now
      after
      this
      latest
      update,
      4
      areas
      will
      technically
      have
      less
      loot.

      Seriously...they're
      not
      vaulting
      this
      thing.
      You're
      all
      wasting
      your
      breath.
      Epic
      has
      had
      this
      whole
      narrative
      planned
      out,
      and
      I'm
      sure
      as
      the
      season
      progresses,
      they'll
      be
      giving
      us
      ways
      of
      countering
      the
      metal
      guy..and
      at
      one
      point
      it'll
      be
      gone
      anyway
      and
      the
      story
      will
      eventually
      include
      another
      device
      for
      us
      to
      all
      fight
      over.
      Also,
      you
      need
      to
      realize
      that
      competitors
      troll
      this
      subreddit
      to
      cause
      division
      and
      fighting.
      Just
      be
      aware
      that's
      happening.
      So,
      please
      everybody...chill
      out
      and
      try
      to
      have
      some
      fun.
