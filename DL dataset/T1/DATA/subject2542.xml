      Dying
      while
      blindfolded/blind.
      I
      have
      an
      weird
      fear
      of
      going
      blind
      as
      in
      completely
      blind.
      I
      guess
      its
      less
      a
      way
      of
      dying
      but
      more
      of
      a
      circumstance.
      If
      I
      wanted
      to
      die,
      I
      would
      die
      tripping
      on
      acid,
      LSD
      or
      a
      drug
      of
      that
      nature

      I
      was
      maybe
      around
      3
      years
      old.
      I
      was
      in
      the
      park
      with
      my
      parents
      and
      my
      dad
      had
      helped
      me
      climb
      up
      a
      tree
      that
      was
      near
      the
      edge
      of
      the
      park.
      It
      was
      winter
      and
      I
      was
      wearing
      an
      ushanka
      hat,
      the
      hat
      with
      the
      big
      floppy
      ears.
      For
      some
      reason
      this
      park
      had
      anti
      climb
      fences
      around
      all
      the
      edges
      of
      the
      park,
      the
      tall
      ass
      fences
      with
      spikes
      or
      barbed
      wire
      on
      top.
      My
      mum
      was
      getting
      ready
      to
      take
      a
      pic
      of
      me
      in
      the
      tree
      when
      a
      bird
      flew
      right
      in
      my
      face
      and
      scared
      me.
      I
      fell
      backwards
      and
      can
      remember
      almost
      getting
      stabbed
      right
      in
      the
      head
      by
      the
      fence.
      My
      hat
      got
      caught
      on
      the
      top
      of
      fence
      and
      I
      cut
      myself
      behind
      my
      ear.
      My
      first
      memory
      and
      it
      is
      why
      I
      am
      scared
      of
      heights.
      There
      is
      also
      another
      memory
      from
      around
      the
      same
      time
      when
      i
      was
      also
      going
      to
      the
      park
      and
      I
      was
      on
      my
      scooter
      and
      I
      rode
      directly
      into
      a
      push
      and
      was
      stung
      in
      the
      eye/near
      the
      eye
      by
      a
      bee
      or
      wasp,
      can't
      remember
      that
      well.
      And
      yes,
      I
      am
      scared
      of
      bees/wasps
      too.

      A

      in

      I

      up
      doing
      stupid
      things
      like
      getting
      into
      fights
      or
      getting
      involved
      in
      gangs
      literally
      because
      they
      are
      bored
      and
      are
      dumb
      teenagers
      and
      don't
      see
      the
      consequences
      of
      their
      actions,
      but
      then
      they
      get
      belittled
      by
      people
      who
      don't
      give
      them
      a
      chance
      to

      Me
      and
      my
      friends
      are
      all
      trying
      to
      learn
      Korean
      together
      I'm
      a
      bit
      behind
      my
      friends
      on
      somethings
      but
      i
      have
      fully
      memories
      the
      Korean
      alphabet
      and
      most
      of
      the
      basic
      rules
      of
      grammar,
      which
      i
      think
      is
      a
      great
      achievements
      as
      we're
      all
      a
      bunch
      of
      dumb
      teenagers
      who
      are
      doing
      this
      cause
      we
      all
      like
      k-pop.
      Though
      I
      have
      also
      started
      learning
      about
      Korean
      culture
      as
      well.

      Honey!
      Revenge
      of
      the
      kids.
      After
      the
      Father
      shrunk
      the
      kids,
      they
      formed
      an
      army
      of
      tiny
      people
      and
      took
      their
      revenge.

      Nah,
      the
      UK.
      Mainly
      the
      south
      east
      of
      London
      itself.
      Lots
      of
      the
      rising
      knife
      crime
      that
      made
      a
      big
      commotion
      last
      year
      was
      caused
      by
      dumb
      teenagers
      but
      people
      painted
      them
      as
      violent.
      Which
      is
      true,
      but
      thats
      only
      a
      minority
      and
      most
      go
      on
      to
      regret
      it
