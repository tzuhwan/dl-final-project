      This
      game
      lately
      is
      making
      me
      so
      angry
      i
      just
      can't
      anymore.
      I
      play
      well
      it's
      just
      that
      i
      have
      unbelievably
      bad
      luck.
      I
      completely
      dominate
      an
      oponent
      who
      just
      plays
      like
      an
      absolute
      dick
      and
      he
      has
      me
      at
      fucking
      4-1.
      Courtois,
      Handanovic
      and
      TOTY
      Neuer
      haven't
      done
      jack
      shit
      in
      goal
      in
      the
      past
      few
      weeks.
      I
      have
      tried
      playing
      with
      different
      teams
      and
      nothing
      works.
      I
      just
      can't
      keep
      seeing
      my
      team
      lose
      anymore.
      I
      still
      win
      sometimes.
      But
      this
      season
      i
      am
      at
      1-1-6.
      The
      win
      i
      got
      after
      playing
      two
      games
      in
      seasons
      and
      it
      seemed
      like
      it
      might
      get
      better
      as
      i
      destroyed
      my
      oponent
      completely
      outskilling
      him
      with
      a
      4-0
      at
      the
      break
      (ragequit
      after).
      But,
      no,
      it's
      not
      better.
      In
      fact
      it's
      worse
      now.
      The
      game
      really
      seems
      to
      hate
      me
      and
      i
      can
      feel
      that
      every
      single
      second
      and
      with
      every
      touch
      and
      every
      moment.
      It
      just
      doesn't
      matter
      how
      good
      i
      play.
      I've
      been
      stuck
      in
      div5
      for
      what
      feels
      like
      ages
      barely
      managing
      to
      stay
      in.
      I
      am
      past
      literally
      crying
      as
      the
      game
      has
      taken
      away
      my
      most
      enjoyable
      way
      of
      relaxation.
      I
      love
      the
      game,
      i
      really
      do.
      I
      just
      wish
      it
      didn't
      hate
      me.
      Any

      I
      am
      quite
      good
      with
      wingers.
      I
      often
      manage
      to
      cut
      in
      really
      well
      and
      score
      some
      beautiful
      goals,
      which
      is
      why
      i
      got
      reus
      and
      cuadrado
      even
      though
      it's
      harder
      to
      get
      the
      team
      to
      100
      chem.
      I
      will
      change
      teams
      soon
      but
      the
      thing
      is
      that
      it
      doesn't
      feel
      like
      it's
      the
      teams.
      I
      might
      try
      your
      suggestions
      and
      see
      what
      they
      do.

      I'm
      thinking
      of
      building
      this
      team.
      It
      goes
      to
      100
      chem
      with
      the
      bpl

      I
      have
      reus
      and
      aguero
      as
      untradables
      so
      i
      would
      like
      to
      keep
      them
      in,
      but

      you
      have

      what
      would
      make
      this

      better,

      The
      problem
      is,
      Aguero
      is
      mainly
      the
      only
      striker
      I
      like,
      apart
      from
      Tevez
      whom
      I
      don't
      really
      know
      how
      to
      fit
      in
      this
      squad.
      I'm
      not
      sure
      why.
      I
      tried
      Lewandowski
      and
      I
      just
      couldn't
      score
      with
      him.
      Plus
      it
      would
      be
      kind
      of
      a
      waste
      to
      just
      have
      Aguero
      and
      not
      use
      him
      since
      I
      can't
      sell
      him.
      Anyway,
      I'm
      curious,
      what
      is
      the
      most
      fun
      formation
      you
      have
      played
      with?
      I
      thought
      I
      could
      experiment
      a
      little

      I
      understand
      now,
      thanks.
      I
      might
      try
      that
      formation
      at
      some
      point.
      Thanks
      for
      all
      the
      support.
      I
      want
      you
      to
      know
      that
      I
      eventually
      got
      relegated
      to
      div
      6
      and
      then
      won
      the
      title
      no
      losses.
      Currently
      in
      div
      5
      1-0-1
      record.
      I
      have
      no
      idea
      what
      happened
      but
      I
      hope
      it's

      I
      know
      there
      aren't
      a
      lot
      of
      people
      who
      have
      him,
      but
      if
      you
      do
      and
      are
      looking
      to
      seel
      then
      you
      should
      know
      something:
      I
      waited
      to
      sell
      him
      in
      order
      to
      get
      more
      money.
      Two
      weeks
      ago
      he
      went
      for
      3.5kk.
      I
      just
      saw
      one
      for
      2.3kk
      and
      I
      just
      have
      to
      ask
      WTF?
      Something
      must
      be
      seriously
      wrong
      with
      those
      who
      are
      trying
      to
      sell
      him.
      I've
      been
      watching
      and
      everytime
      someone
      puts
      him
      on
      the
      market
      they
      drop
      the
      price
      by
      100k-200k
      and
      the
      next
      one
      does
      the
      same.
      Do
      you
      want
      to
      lose
      money?
      Will
      he
      ever
      go
      up
      if
      you
      continue
      like
      this?
      Please
      just
      please
      let's
      all
      put
      him
      up
      for
      at
      least
      3kk.
      He
      is
      worth
      that
      money
      and
      he
      is
      rotting
      on
      my
      transfer
      list
      because
      I'm
      not
      losing
      1kk
      and
      neither
      should
      you

      I

      I'll

      take
      what
      I
      can
      get.
      It's

      if

      you

      happened
      to
      me
      lately

      it
      was

      bad

      It

      The
      image
      loaded
      slowly
      from
      top
      to
      bottom
      and
      i
      saw
      Ibarbo
      and
      Aubameyang
      first
      and
      I
      thought
      "it's
      quite
      sweaty,
      but
      nothing
      special"
      but
      then
      I
      saw
      ramos
      and
      the
      rest.
      I
      think
      being
      sweaty
      is
      a
      fair,
      but
      annoying
      way
      of
      playing,
      but
      since
      it's
      not
      the
      accused
      who
      decides
      if
      he's
      guilty,
      yes
      everyone
      playing
      against
      you
      hates
      you
      since
      the
      moment
      they
      see
      that
      team
      until
      the
      moment
      they
      die.
      When
      they
      see
      that
      team
      they
      just
      know
      they're
      not
      going
      to
      have
      fun
      playing
      that
      game.
      I'm
      not
      saying
      change
      it,
      but
      if
      you
      have
      things
      like
      shame,
      then
      you
      might
      wanna
      give
      that
      option
      some
      thought.

      So,
      a
      couple
      of
      weeks
      ago
      i
      started
      noticing
      how
      the
      community
      seems
      quite
      fond
      of
      this
      guy
      SpencerFC.
      Naturally,
      i
      started
      watching
      his
      videos
      and
      I
      found
      them
      very
      very
      enjoyable
      and
      here
      is
      why:
      1.
      He
      doesn't
      buy/promote
      coins.
      Now,
      I'm
      not
      against
      buying/promoting
      coins,
      but
      the
      general
      public
      is
      either
      strongly
      against
      it,
      or
      has
      no
      problem
      with
      it.
      Nobody
      is
      going
      to
      give
      you
      hate
      if
      you
      don't
      buy/promote,
      but
      they
      might
      if
      you
      do.
      Also,
      he's
      not
      strongly
      against
      buying/promoting
      either.
      He
      just
      ignores
      it
      and
      I
      think
      this
      makes
      both
      EA
      and
      the
      fans
      like
      him.
      2.
      He's
      good
      at
      the
      game.
      Currently
      in
      his
      wheel
      of
      fortune
      series
      he
      is
      in
      division
      one.
      He
      is,
      compared
      to
      other
      youtubers,
      quite
      good
      at
      what
      he
      does,
      considering
      that
      he's
      not
      using
      a
      full
      legend
      team
      or
      even
      a
      dream
      squad.
      3.
      He
      produces
      high
      quality
      content.
      His
      videos
      are
      straight
      forward,
      focused
      on
      the
      game
      and
      simply
      entertaining.
      His
      commentary
      isn't
      particularly
      outstanding,
      but
      it
      does
      make
      for
      a
      very
      pleasant
      experience
      for
      the
      viewer.
      When
      you
      watch
      his
      videos,
      you
      get
      what
      you
      come
      for.
      He
      doesn't
      just
      scream
      or
      bend
      over
      backwards
      for
      views.
      So,
      in
      conclusion,
      SpencerFC
      is
      in
      my
      opinion,
      after
      an
      objective
      analysis,
      one
      of
      the
      best
      fifa
      youtubers
      out
      there,
      which
      is
      why
      many
      people
      like
      him.
      What
      do
      you
      think
      about
      him?
      Also,
      what
      other
      fifa
      youtubers
      with
      great
      road
      to
      glory
      series
      do
      you
      watch?

      Just
      checked
      him
      out.
      He's
      really
      good
      at
      the
      game.
      I
      also
      like
      the
      fact
      that
      he
      adds

      I
      think
      so,
      too.
      I
      just
      thought
      I'd
      give
      my
      view
      as

      why
      we
      tend
      to
      do
      that.

      Hopefully
      they
      do
      that
      as
      well.
      But
      i
      don't
      think
      they
      did
      just
      yet
      so
      we
      shall
      see.
      If
      they
      don't
      I
      think
      this
      whole
      change
      might
      not
      be
      for
      the
      best,
      but
      who
      knows.
      If
      they
      do
      it's
      just
      a
      higher
      chance
      that
      this
      will
      all
      make
      the
      game
      better

      You're
      not
      completely
      wrong.
      But
      people
      say
      players
      will
      mostly
      go
      for
      the
      highest
      possible
      price,
      or
      at
      least
      close
      to
      that,
      as
      people
      look
      to
      get
      he
      most
      out
      of
      their
      players.
      Now
      that
      they
      can't
      buy
      coins,
      they
      will
      all
      look
      to
      sell
      at
      high
      prices.
      I
      honestly
      don't
      know
      what
      to
      think
      about
      all
      of
      this.
      I
      really
      hope
      it's
      a
      good
      change.
      But
      people
      just
      seem
      to
      flip
      out
      without
      even
      giving
      it
      a
      try.

      Of
      course
      that
      will
      also
      happen.
      I'm
      just
      hoping
      these
      two
      mentalities
      will
      cancel
      each

      out
      and
      prices

      be
      somewhere
      in
      the
      middle
      for
      most
      players
      leaving
      room
      for
      trading
      or
      something.
      We
      just
      have
      to
      wait
      and
      see.

      nice.
      I
      got
      Modric
      for
      11k
      by
      bidding
      when
      the
      smalles
      buy
      now
      price
      was
      17k.
      Not
      a
      very
      big
      win
      but
      I'll
      take
      it.
      Also,
      I
      too
      am
      playing
      happily
      with
      my
      many
      squads
      with
      lots
      of
      good
      players
      (most

      THANK
      YOU!
      Fucking
      hell
      I
      love
      the
      fact
      that
      i
      saw
      this
      post.
      That
      is
      exactly
      the
      mentality
      I
      want
      in
      a
      woman.
      Not
      as
      a
      concept,
      but
      word
      for
      word.
      It's
      actually
      insane
      how
      you
      seem
      to
      have
      the
      exact
      way
      of
      thinking
      I
      want
      to
      find
      in
      a
      girl
      some
      day.
      This
      actually
      gives
      me
      hope
      that
      such
      a
      girl
      even
      exists.
      Thank
      you
      and
      good
      luck.
      Also,
      if
      you
      ever
      find
      someone,
      even
      if
      it's
      in
      like
      a
      couple
      of
      years
      or
      so,
      if
      you
      remember,
      could
      you
      actually
      reply
      saying
      that
      you
      did?
      That
      would
      be
      awesome

      Too

      I
      like
      your
      perspective.
      To
      be
      honest
      that's
      how
      I
      see
      it,
      too.
      However,
      I
      would
      like
      the
      certainty
      of
      knowing
      that
      the
      relationship
      will
      grow
      and
      advance.
      What
      I
      wanted
      to
      say
      is
      that
      people
      don't
      often
      seem
      to
      want
      to
      let
      it
      grow.
      Or
      at
      least
      that's
      how
      it
      seems.
      I
      do
      have
      wonderful
      friends
      whom
      trust
      and
      love
      me.
      It's
      just

      things
      that
      doesn't

      Me
      too
      man.
      Currently
      struggling
      in
      div
      2.
      Managed
      to
      stay
      in
      though
      after
      all
      10
      games.
      4-0-6.
      i
      lost
      3
      games
      in
      a
      row.
      won
      3.
      lost
      another
      3.
      and
      finally
      barely
      won
      the
      last
      one
      2-1
      after
      being
      behind
      1-0.

      Oh,
      god
      really?
      Poor
      Reus.
      I
      actually
      haven't
      heard
      that
      before.
      Damn.
      This
      piece
      of
      knowledge
      is
      not
      only
      valuable,
      it's
      also
      connected
      to
      an
      event
      that
      is
      recent
      and
      still
      relevant.

      I
      personally
      love
      this

      very

      that

      I
      was
      watching
      kuroshitsuji
      the
      other
      day
      and
      one
      character
      sang
      "London
      bridge
      is
      falling
      down".
      It
      kinda
      caught
      my
      attention
      and
      I
      wanted
      to
      make
      some
      alterations
      to
      the
      lyrics.
      For
      instance
      the
      song
      went:
      "

      hagane
      ja
      magaru,

      to
      mean
      "Build
      it

      with

      and

      so
      so
      much.
      I
      used

      Turns

      it
      was
      a
      good
      idea
      to
      do
      that.

      it's

      or
      has

      it
      was
      only
      2
      players
      that
      didn't
      have
      different
      versions
      and
      when

      Looked
      it
      up
      in
      the
      searchbar
      and
      i
      can't
      find
      this
      question.
      Maybe
      it's
      a
      retarded
      question.
      If
      there
      is
      a
      post
      on
      this
      please
      link
      me
      to
      it.
      So,
      with
      FIFA
      16
      around
      the
      corner,
      I
      may
      want
      to
      sell
      my
      FIFA15
      if
      possible.
      However,
      if
      I
      remember
      correctly
      there
      was
      a
      serial
      number
      which
      I
      had
      to
      use
      when
      activating
      the
      game
      on
      my
      origin
      account.
      Would
      I
      also
      need
      to
      sell
      the
      account?
      Or
      can
      I
      just
      deactivate
      the
      game,
      which
      would
      in
      turn
      make
      the
      serial
      number
      reusable?
      Thanks
      in
      advance.

      right
      (you
      probably
      are...it

      We'll

      and
      see,

      those
      can't
      technically
      be
      scored.
      I
      know
      it's
      not
      implemented
      in-game,
      but
      still.

      So,
      I
      bought
      Fifa15
      and
      the
      game
      ran
      smoothly
      all
      year
      long
      with
      no
      problems,
      even
      being
      able
      to
      play
      it
      in
      window
      mode
      with
      hardly
      any
      lag.
      However,
      the
      with
      Fifa16
      demo
      I'm
      experiencing
      quite
      a
      bit
      of
      lag.
      It's
      still
      playable,
      but
      frustrating
      and
      I
      was
      wondering
      if
      there
      was
      a
      way
      to
      make
      it
      run
      like
      Fifa15.
      I've
      already
      set
      the
      fps
      limit
      to
      30.
      Also,
      i
      went
      to
      the
      control
      panel
      of
      my
      graphics
      card
      and
      changed
      the
      3D
      and
      battery
      settings
      to
      performance
      and
      the
      lag
      is
      still
      there.
      tldr;
      demo
      lags
      even
      though
      15
      runs
      perfectly,
      tried
      some
      things
      which
      didn't
      do
      much.
      help
      This
      is
      what
      I'm
      working
      with

      Try
      calling
      the
      second
      player
      and
      passing
      to
      him.
      If
      he
      has
      four/five
      star
      skills
      and
      you

      and
      take
      a
      shot/pass
      in
      the
      box.
      Or,
      just
      cross
      with
      2/3
      bars
      of
      power

      Yeah,

      A
      dollar
      is
      around
      4
      RON,
      so
      it
      would
      get

      about
      300
      RON
      for
      12
      000
      fifa
      points.
      Imagine
      paying
      $300
      for
      that
      shit...

      Not
      for
      them,
      it
      isn't.
      Consumables
      are
      basically
      pack
      fillers.
      They
      make
      sure
      your
      packs
      don't
      give
      you
      only
      players
      (unless
      it's
      a
      players
      only
      pack)
      so
      that
      your
      chance
      of
      getting
      a
      good
      pull
      is
      smaller.
      3
      rares
      in
      a
      basic
      7.5k
      pack
      does
      not
      guarantee
      3
      rare
      players,
      which
      means
      that
      you
      need
      to
      open
      more
      packs
      to
      get
      good
      players
      which
      means
      you
      need
      FIFA
      points,
      resulting
      in
      more
      money
      for
      EA
      $port$.
      EDIT:
      That
      being
      said,
      I
      personally
      like
      the
      concept
      of
      having
      to
      manage
      my
      team
      with
      consumables
      and
      it's
      only
      a
      problem
      in
      the
      beginning
      of
      the
      game.
      Still,
      I
      would
      say
      that
      there
      should
      be
      less
      consumables
      (or
      at
      least
      they
      should
      count
      club
      items,
      if
      not
      all
      consumables,
      separately
      and
      sell
      them
      in
      separate
      packs
      or
      something
      along
      those
      lines).

      work
      for
      you,
      try
      contacting

      I
      saw
      multiple
      posts
      regarding
      this
      in
      FIFA15
      and
      some
      people
      actually
      got
      packs
      or
      coins
      as
      compensation
      for
      it.
      Not
      sure
      if
      they
      got
      their
      catalogue
      fixed,
      though.

      So,
      I'm
      on
      a
      university
      network
      and
      several
      ports
      are
      blocked
      (i
      understand
      it's
      to
      prevent
      p2p
      connections)
      .
      However,
      this
      stops
      me
      from
      playing
      the
      game
      I
      love,
      FIFA.
      We
      are
      allowed
      to
      ask
      for
      several
      specific
      ports
      to
      be
      unblocked
      and
      I
      did,
      but
      it
      just
      didn't
      work.
      The
      ports
      are
      still
      blocked.
      I
      also
      tried
      using
      cyberghost
      but
      it
      doesn't
      seem
      to
      work
      work.
      Any
      ideas?
      Maybe
      another
      app
      I
      could
      use
      or
      some
      method
      to
      work
      around
      the
      system.

      it

      (don't

      you

      pokemon,
      then
      it
      immediately
      disappears?
      I
      got
      it
      from
      3
      steps
      to
      no
      steps
      then
      it
      finally
      appeared
      and
      as
      soon
      as
      i
      touched
      it,
      it
      disappeared
      without
      going
      into
      the
      catching
      sequence.
      Is
      there
      anything
      i
      can
      do
      to
      fix
      that
      in
      the
      future?
      If
      i
      had
      just
      hung
      around
      that
      place
      would
      it
      have
      reappeared?
      It
      was
      a
      fucking
      dragonair
      too

      I'll
      answer
      from
      a
      non-american
      perspective
      because
      it
      may
      be
      useful.
      You'll
      still
      have
      to
      wait
      for
      someone
      from
      the
      U.S.
      to
      get
      a
      more
      complete
      version.
      Basically,
      while
      afro-americans
      were
      slaves
      they
      suffered
      horrible
      abuse
      because
      of
      their
      status.
      We're
      talking
      rape,
      murder,
      beatings,
      torture,
      having
      your
      children
      sold
      off
      as
      slaves,
      etc.
      That
      word
      was
      used
      to
      refer
      to
      them,
      as
      you
      would
      refer
      to
      that
      thing
      you
      sit
      on
      in
      front
      of
      your
      table
      using
      the
      word
      "chair".
      I
      think
      that,
      in
      addition
      to
      the
      emotional
      weight
      of
      the
      word,
      having
      a
      huge
      stigma
      on
      it
      prevents
      society
      from
      normalizing
      treating
      afro-americans
      (or
      anybody
      for
      that
      matter)
      as
      less
      than
      human
      again
      (as
      well
      as
      fighting
      against
      the
      tendency
      to
      do
      so,
      at
      least
      in
      theory).
      I
      hope
      it's
      not
      too
      inaccurate
      and
      it
      helps
      at
      least
      a
      little.

      I've

      doing
      stand-up
      comedy.
      Open
      mics

      stuff.
      I've
      recently
      had
      my

      show
      with
      3
      other

      hoping
      it
      works

      I

      a

      Of

      there
      is
      a
      limited
      number
      of

      marines
      are
      having
      tons
      of
      trouble
      with
      haki-using
      individuals
      in
      the
      New
      World,
      but
      not
      many
      of
      them
      are
      to
      be
      found
      in
      the
      Paradise
      section,
      it
      would
      make
      sense
      to
      send
      almost
      every
      haki
      user
      in
      the
      marines
      in
      the
      New
      World.
      They
      may
      be
      drawn
      like
      random
      grunts,
      and
      they
      might
      not
      even
      be
      all
      that
      strong,
      only
      able
      to
      use
      haki.
      To
      my
      knowledge,
      it
      doesn't
      say
      anywhere
      that
      you
      have
      to
      be
      extremely
      strong
      to
      use
      some
      armament
      haki
      (and
      this
      makes
      some
      sense,
      since
      we
      know
      someone's
      haki
      can
      be
      weaker
      or
      stronger).
      If
      you
      look
      at
      haki
      as
      a
      skill
      (a
      very
      useful
      one
      that
      does
      make
      you
      stronger,
      but
      still
      a
      skill
      not
      a
      super-ultra
      special
      ability),
      it
      starts
      making
      more
      sense.

      Damn
      it
      was
      good.
      I'm
      really
      hopeful,
      especially
      with
      regards
      to
      the
      filler
      strategy.
      They
      have
      tons
      of
      stuff
      to
      expand
      upon
      since
      we
      are
      going
      rather
      fast
      in
      the
      manga
      and
      a
      lot
      of
      things
      (such
      as
      zoro's
      encounter
      with
      the
      slasher)
      are
      being
      left
      out.
      Developing
      the
      world
      by
      focusing
      attention
      to
      smaller
      details
      that
      can
      still
      provide
      interesting
      scenes
      and
      even
      some
      action
      is
      the
      proper
      way
      to
      handle
      fillers.
      I,
      for
      one,
      am
      very
      thankful
      to
      the
      new
      director
      for
      giving
      me
      hope
      for
      the
      anime
      and
      I
      truly
      hope
      they
      manage
      to
      keep
      up
      the
      amazing
      work.

      done
      any

      in

      but
      I'll
      check
      it
      out.
      We
      have
      some
      pretty
      funny
      comedians
      here
      actually.

      Wouldn't

      still
      put
      them
      in
      a

      a

      that

      that
      I'm

      any

      are

      I
      have
      consistently
      invested
      in
      creating
      healthier
      habbits
      and
      giving
      up
      on
      unhealthier
      ones
      (e.g.
      staying
      away
      from
      gaming
      completely
      for
      a
      while;
      currently
      doing
      it
      moderately
      and
      getting
      bored
      quickly).
      Generally
      doing
      work
      that
      I
      find
      important
      or
      fulfilling
      is
      another
      contributing
      factor.
      Completing
      tasks
      when
      I
      receive
      them
      and
      rarely
      postponing
      small
      tasks
      that
      don't
      require
      very
      specific
      contexts
      (e.g.
      I
      no
      longer
      pospone
      making
      calls
      or
      editing
      spreadsheets,
      etc.).
      Not
      interrupting
      working
      mood.
      I
      used
      to
      stop
      working
      as
      soon
      as
      I
      got
      the
      chance.
      Now
      when
      I
      contextually
      do
      some
      work
      (
      e.g.
      when
      I
      go
      to
      a
      class
      at
      University)
      I
      take
      it
      as
      an
      opportunity
      to
      keep
      working.
      Breaks
      are
      fine
      but
      they
      shouldn't
      be
      too
      long
      and
      should
      only
      be
      taken
      when
      necessary.

      in
      the
      interest
      of
      accuracy,
      you
      should
      know
      that
      theories
      need
      (usually
      pretty
      substantial)
      proof
      to
      be
      considered
      'theories'.
      The
      admittedly
      awesome
      things
      most
      people
      post
      here
      tend
      to
      have
      little
      to
      no
      evidence,
      thus
      not
      technically
      qualifying
      as
      'theories',
      but
      rather
      hypotheses
      and
      I
      believe
      that
      we
      should
      start
      calling
      them
      by
      their
      name.
      Maybe
      a
      flair
      can
      be
      added,
      i
      don't
      know...

      NAH
      He
      is
      a
      bit
      of
      an
      asshole
      for
      saying
      you
      don't
      understand
      because
      you're
      a
      girl,
      but
      that
      is
      not
      the
      issue
      you
      are
      focused
      on
      now.
      Fantasizing
      about
      random
      people
      is
      completely
      normal
      and
      as
      long
      as
      you
      never
      actually
      get
      the
      desire
      to
      cheat
      you're
      safe.
      However,
      being
      open
      about
      it
      with
      your
      partner
      is
      a
      difficult
      (although
      important
      and
      mature)
      step
      and
      I
      totally
      understand
      his
      frustration.
      He
      might
      be
      feeling
      like
      he's
      not
      enough
      for
      you
      and
      you
      fantasize
      because
      you're
      dissatisfied
      with
      him/
      the
      relationship/
      the
      sex,
      even
      though
      it's
      not
      likely
      the
      case.
      Still,
      you
      should
      be
      aware
      of
      these
      feelings,
      take
      them
      into
      account
      and
      thread
      lightly
      in
      the
      next
      discussion
      about
      it,
      making
      him
      realize
      that
      it's
      only
      natural
      and
      harmless,
      having
      nothing
      to
      do
      with
      his
      quality
      as
      a
      boyfriend.

      Yes,
      I
      agree,
      but
      I
      see
      a
      lot
      of
      posts
      here
      that
      fall
      into
      exactly
      that
      category:
      great
      ideas,
      but
      they
      provide
      little
      to
      no
      evidence
      and
      require
      further
      investigation
      (which
      I
      believe
      would
      be
      encouraged
      by
      a
      "hypothesis"
      flair)

      NTA,
      but
      please
      start
      looking
      for
      a
      job
      that
      treats
      you
      better.
      I'm
      not
      saying
      quit
      this
      one
      right
      away,
      I'm
      sure
      you
      need
      the
      money.
      Still,
      take
      the
      opportunity
      now
      that
      you
      don't
      NEED
      to
      be
      hired
      to
      look
      for
      a
      better
      job,
      as
      this
      gives
      you
      the
      chance
      to
      have
      higher
      standards.

      ESH.
      Your
      sister
      was
      a
      total
      jackass
      and
      telling
      her
      off
      right
      away
      was
      the
      right
      thing
      to
      do.
      However,
      in
      the
      world
      we
      live
      in
      you
      don't
      just
      kick
      family
      out
      like
      that.
      My
      advice
      is
      to
      ask
      her
      to
      come
      back
      in,
      provided
      she
      agrees
      to
      be
      careful
      about
      boundries
      and
      open
      to
      feedback
      on
      the
      issue
      when
      she
      steps
      out
      of
      line.
