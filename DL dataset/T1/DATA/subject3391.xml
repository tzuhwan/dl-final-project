      That
      episode
      was
      great,
      neatly
      wrapped
      up
      and
      the
      killer
      wasn't
      ridiculous
      but
      it
      still
      held
      shock
      value...
      Can't
      wait
      till
      next
      week,
      kinda
      questioning
      how
      dramatic/finale-esque
      it'll
      be
      though,
      considering
      the
      big
      reveal
      was
      this
      episode?

      Same

      thought

      didn't

      that
      he
      would
      do
      that
      in
      cold
      blood.
      Whatever
      motive
      that
      they
      might
      display
      in
      the
      next
      episode,
      still
      fairly
      sociopathic...

      What
      was
      the
      point
      of
      Ms.
      Grundy's
      plot
      line?
      Unless
      they
      reveal
      something
      next
      episode
      it
      seems
      pretty
      useless
      to
      have
      included
      it.
      I
      was
      really
      thinking
      that
      somehow
      she
      was
      involved
      in
      the
      whole
      fiasco?
      Especially
      seeing
      as
      she
      spent
      a
      lot
      of
      extra
      time
      with
      Jason
      apparently..

      I
      was
      once
      at
      a
      friends
      house
      the
      morning
      after

      7

      my
      friend's
      mother
      suggests
      putting
      on
      music.
      The
      speakers
      get
      switched
      on
      and
      the
      moaning
      sounds
      through
      the
      speakers,
      each
      of

      girls
      all
      approximately
      realize
      at
      the

      then
      the
      mother
      switches
      the
      speakers
      off
      and
      says:

      Hiya,
      I
      was
      just
      wondering
      if
      anyone
      had
      any
      good

      to
      improve
      my
      french
      paper
      2
      grade.
      On
      my
      mock
      I
      managed
      a
      7
      in
      paper
      1
      but
      a
      4
      in
      paper
      2,
      which
      brought
      my
      average
      down
      by
      a
      ton.
      I'd
      really
      like
      to
      score
      the
      extra
      points
      but
      I
      have
      trouble
      with
      writing
      in
      French
      (obviously)
      compared
      to
      my

      Bio
      for
      sure
      (I
      might
      be
      biased
      because
      I
      absolutely
      love
      the
      subject),
      but
      Sl
      Chem
      is
      a
      little
      harder
      I
      think.
      It
      depends
      on
      how
      much
      background
      you
      have
      in
      each
      subject
      and
      the
      way
      you
      like
      to
      look
      at
      things.
      Bio
      requires
      memorization
      of
      different
      names
      and
      processes
      (But
      at
      SL
      this
      is
      pretty
      minimal?),
      but
      chemistry
      requires
      a
      lot
      of
      understanding
      and
      discipline.
      Edit:
      Source;
      I
      got
      similar
      IGCSE
      Bio
      and
      Chem
      grades
      (A*
      and
      A)
      but
      I
      really
      despise
      SL
      Chem
      and
      really
      enjoy
      HL
      Bio...
      (Hope
      this
      helps!)

      For
      paper
      1,
      I'm
      reading
      over
      a
      bunch
      of
      texts
      annotated
      texts
      we've
      been
      doing
      over
      the
      last
      two
      years,
      also
      from
      the
      book.
      (I
      would
      recommend
      doing
      some
      HL
      texts,
      (not
      the
      literary
      ones,
      but
      the
      first
      couple
      in
      the
      HL
      papers,
      they're
      a
      lot
      trickier)..
      Also
      like
      i've
      been
      watching
      tv
      in
      french
      just
      because
      it
      helps
      my
      brain
      think
      in
      french?
      For
      paper
      2,
      learn
      the
      structures,
      then
      learn
      subject
      specific
      vocab
      and
      phrases
      like
      the
      other
      comment
      said..

      Ay
      thanks!
      I
      won't
      bother
      I
      think
      as
      long
      as
      it
      doesn't
      affect
      life
      after
      uni/during
      uni
