      What
      exactly
      does
      Marx

      when

      "Do

      For
      the
      first
      unit
      of
      our
      modern
      history
      HSC
      (higher
      school
      certificate,
      Australian
      equivalent
      to
      the
      SAT),
      we're
      studying
      the
      rise
      of
      Communism
      and
      early
      soviet
      government
      1917
      -
      1941.
      For
      me,
      being
      a
      Communist,
      this
      is
      a
      great
      way
      to
      gain
      some
      more
      support
      as
      history
      is
      in
      favour
      of
      Communism,
      especially
      in
      regards
      to
      the
      other
      political
      systems
      during
      the
      time
      we're
      studying.
      I'm
      quite
      good
      at
      history,
      and
      have
      given
      workshops
      to
      the
      entire
      class
      on
      subject
      such
      as
      World
      War
      One
      which
      we
      studied
      last
      term
      -
      usually
      presentations
      on
      google
      slides
      with
      memes
      that
      relate
      to
      the
      subject
      and
      then
      I
      verbally
      explain.
      I've
      been
      asked
      to
      give
      a
      presentation
      on
      Communism,
      ([here's
      what
      I've
      been
      working
      on](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1C-tKHLnk1rCAkECfVYEGneuvLX07klUrfc_o5YQmm4k/edit?usp=sharing)
      \-
      note
      that
      it
      won't
      be
      actually
      called
      "the
      idiot's
      guide
      to
      communism,
      that's
      just
      a
      placeholder
      for
      my
      real
      name)
      as
      I'm
      the
      only
      one
      with
      any
      real
      understanding
      of
      the
      subject
      aside
      from
      my
      teacher
      (and
      she
      referred
      to
      the
      Bourgeoisie
      as
      "middle
      class",
      which,
      as
      we
      all
      know,
      is
      not
      correct).
      The
      problem
      is
      that
      although
      around
      88%
      of
      my
      grade
      (163
      boys,
      in
      an
      all
      boys
      school)
      is
      left-leaning,
      a
      number
      of
      the
      kids
      in
      history
      are
      vehemently
      anti-communist.
      I
      hope
      that
      the
      presentation
      will
      change
      their
      minds,
      but
      that's
      a
      long
      shot.
      the
      subjects
      I'll
      be
      covering
      are:
      *
      Communist
      origins
      *
      Communist
      leaders/leading
      figures
      *
      Communist
      variants
      (Trotskyism,
      Stalinism,
      Marxism-Leninism,
      Maoism,
      Juche
      etc)
      *
      Communism
      compared
      to
      other
      ideologies
      *
      The
      exploitative
      nature
      of
      Capitalism,
      why
      Communism
      is
      inevitable
      *
      Communist
      theory/basic
      principles
      of
      Marxism
      *
      Communist
      history
      in
      the
      USSR
      1917
      -
      1921,
      Lenin,
      Trotsky,
      Stalin
      and
      WWII
      *
      Debunking
      anti-communist
      myths:
      Communism
      killed
      (insert
      number)
      +
      Holodomor
      and
      Kulaks,
      Communism
      only
      works
      in
      theory,
      "Communism
      doesn't
      let
      you
      have
      a
      toothbrush",
      the
      Gulags
      *
      How
      Communist
      governments
      work
      all
      and
      any
      feedback/criticism
      is
      appreciated.
      It's
      worth
      noting
      that
      I've
      only
      really
      considered
      myself
      to
      be
      truly
      Communist
      for
      about
      half
      a
      year
      or
      so,
      and
      only
      really
      found
      the
      strain
      I
      agree
      with
      recently,
      so
      any
      guidance
      would
      be
      also
      greatly
      appreciated.

      perhaps,
      but
      consider
      the
      position
      of
      the
      USSR
      at
      the
      time.
      An
      alliance
      with
      the
      western
      allies
      was
      much
      more
      preferable,
      but
      they
      had
      been
      turned
      down
      on
      every
      front.
      The
      Soviet
      Union,
      which
      was
      up
      until
      around
      the
      beginning
      of
      the
      30s
      and
      very
      much
      so
      throughout
      up
      until
      the
      50s,
      a
      backwards
      agrarian
      peasant
      society,
      was
      struggling
      with
      the
      herculean
      task
      of
      being
      able
      to
      repel
      and
      destroy
      a
      world
      power.
      They
      knew
      that
      Hitler
      was
      likely
      going
      to
      invade
      Poland
      first,
      and
      that
      they
      would
      be
      next
      if
      so.
      As
      a
      desperate
      attempt
      to
      stall
      the
      invasion,
      they
      created
      the
      pact,
      which
      was
      highly
      beneficial
      to
      Germany
      as
      it
      let
      them
      get
      some
      supplies
      that
      they
      *really*
      needed
      in
      order
      to
      conquer
      France,
      which
      infuriated
      Hitler,
      as
      they
      were
      relying
      on
      the
      people
      they
      considered
      "subhuman".
      In
      the
      pact,
      the
      Soviets
      forced
      the
      Nazis
      to
      at
      least
      try
      to
      adhere
      to
      a
      on-paper
      agreement
      of
      neutrality
      which
      they
      both
      knew
      was
      not
      going
      to
      last.
      And
      hey,
      the
      Soviets
      got
      to
      take
      back
      that
      land
      they
      ceded
      to
      Poland.
      Tl;Dr;
      they
      were
      desperate.
      What
      would
      you
      do?
      face
      invasion
      and
      lose,
      or
      make
      a
      deal
      with
      the
      devil
      and
      survive
      long
      enough
      to
      kill
      him?

      fair,
      but
      climate
      change
      wasn't
      really
      an
      issue
      when
      the
      USSR
      was
      around.
      Now
      that
      it
      is,
      Communist
      China
      is
      leading
      the
      front
      against
      it,
      which
      further
      drives
      home
      the
      point
      of
      this
      post.
      Even
      North
      Korea
      is
      enacting
      a
      massive
      nation-wide
      tree
      planting
      and
      anti-deforestation
      policy.
      America
      isn't
      doing
      that.

      well

      Reddit,
      from
      my
      experience,
      is
      supportive
      of
      the
      right
      (liberalism,
      conservatism),
      tolerates
      the
      left
      (democratic

      though
      mostly
      the

      left,
      probably
      because

      ...alright,
      this
      is
      only
      a
      meme,
      but
      I'll
      elaborate
      on
      my
      opinions
      regarding
      Israel
      and
      Palestine.
      The
      Israeli
      treatment
      of
      Palestinians
      is
      deplorable.
      I
      believe
      that
      religion
      doesn't
      necessarily
      mean
      that
      Jews
      should
      get
      to
      create
      and
      enforce
      what
      is
      essentially
      an
      apartheid
      ethnostate
      in
      their
      homeland,
      although
      If
      they
      just
      want
      to
      live
      there
      peacefully
      with
      the
      Arabs
      then
      that
      is
      perfectly
      fine.
      The
      Palestinians,
      who've
      lived
      there
      for
      thousands
      of
      years,
      have
      an
      equal
      or
      more
      of
      a
      right
      to
      the
      land
      there
      than
      the
      Israelis,
      as
      I
      said
      before,
      religion
      doesn't
      mean
      you
      get
      a
      free
      pass.
      Either
      way,
      Israel
      will
      have
      to
      answer
      for
      their
      treatment
      of
      Palestinians
      one
      day.
      Personally,
      I
      think
      the
      best
      solution
      is
      the
      abolition
      of
      Israel
      and
      international
      recognition
      of
      Palestine
      as
      the
      legitimate
      state.
      That
      doesn't
      mean
      that
      the
      Jews
      or
      Israelis
      there
      have
      to
      pack
      up
      and
      go
      back
      to
      Europe
      or
      something,
      just
      that
      Israel
      should
      apologise
      and
      pay
      reparations
      to
      the
      Palestinians
      and
      the
      two
      should
      live
      there
      peacefully.

      Comrade,
      don't
      forget
      what
      we're
      actually
      fighting
      for.
      The
      splendour
      of
      the
      Soviet
      Union
      or
      Mao's
      China
      are
      great
      and
      all,
      but
      we
      need
      to
      remember
      the
      great
      goal
      of
      classlessness,
      moneylessness
      and
      statelessness.
      It's
      important
      to
      stay
      vigilant
      and
      remember
      that
      liberalism,
      as
      tempting
      as
      it
      is
      to
      stay
      cooped
      up
      in
      the
      little
      bubble,
      retreat
      back
      into
      blissful
      reactionary
      ignorance,
      is
      a
      farce.
      A
      fallacy
      to
      distract
      us;
      a
      trial
      we
      must
      overcome.
      The
      great
      goal
      will
      take
      a
      long
      time
      to
      achieve,
      and
      we
      will
      probably
      not
      live
      to
      see
      it.
      But
      we
      can
      live
      to
      see
      the
      revolution.
      We
      will
      live
      to
      see
      the
      revolution.
      Until
      then,
      keep
      telling
      those
      around
      you
      of
      those
      slight
      little
      things
      that
      are
      better
      than
      liberalism
      -
      healthcare
      for
      all?
      what
      about
      housing
      or
      food
      for
      all?
      wage
      equality?
      what
      about
      worker's
      co-operatives?
      And,
      above
      all,
      remember
      this:
      no
      one
      is
      immune
      to
      propaganda.
      Not
      even
      you.
      Keep
      your
      guard
      up.
      All
      the
      best,
      comrade.

      Marx's
      analysis
      of
      the
      capitalist
      mode
      of
      production
      is...
      thorough.
      Extremely
      thorough.
      He
      takes
      the
      parts
      we
      know
      and
      even
      the
      things
      we
      don't
      know
      we
      know
      and
      breaks
      them
      down
      to
      their
      cores
      to
      understand
      them
      and
      how
      they
      operate
      as
      well
      as
      how
      it
      came
      to
      be
      like
      that.
      He
      is
      difficult
      to
      understand,
      I
      had
      to
      look
      up
      the
      meanings
      of
      a
      few
      words,
      and
      a
      lot
      of
      the
      time
      you
      need
      to
      reread
      passages
      before
      you
      understand
      what
      they
      mean.
      However,
      you
      feel
      really
      smart
      when
      you
      do,
      like
      you've
      just
      unlocked
      some
      secret
      knowledge
      that
      society
      doesn't
      want
      you
      to
      know.
      For
      reference,
      I
      consider
      myself
      a
      Juche
      Communist.
      This
      is
      just
      doing
      my
      homework,
      I
      guess.

      Your
      profile
      is
      full
      of
      tired
      anti-communist
      tropes
      as
      expected
      from
      someone
      who
      thinks
      they
      know
      communism
      but
      clearly
      has
      never

      vaguely

      of

      outside

      but
      one
      question:
      why
      do
      you
      keep
      reiterating
      the
      fact
      you
      have
      sex?
      Why
      do
      you
      keep
      telling
      other
      people
      to
      do
      it?
      Are
      you
      insecure,
      or...?

      Holodomor
      was
      a
      famine
      caused
      by
      bad
      weather
      in
      1931-32
      which
      was
      further
      worsened
      by
      Kulaks
      (rich
      peasants),
      who
      hoarded
      grain
      and
      intentionally
      burned
      crops
      and
      slaughtered
      livestock
      to
      resist
      collectivisation.
      The
      Nazis
      perpetuated
      this
      as
      an
      intentional
      genocide
      (Fraud,

      despite
      no

      and
      the
      Soviet
      Famine
      of
      1932-33:

      Reply
      to
      Ellman,
      pg.
      628,
      631).
      In
      response,
      Stalin
      sent
      those
      responsible
      for
      the
      famine
      (the
      kulaks)
      to
      the
      Gulag.
      The
      "10
      million"
      number
      is
      inaccurate,
      as
      it
      is
      only
      an
      alleged
      source,
      and
      shouldn't
      be
      trusted.
      Furthermore,
      soviet
      population
      data
      suggests
      that
      Stalin
      killed
      around
      1-2
      million,
      or
      2-5
      million
      if
      you
      count
      Holodomor.

      hero
      Well
      he
      singlehandedly
      beat
      the
      Nazis
      and
      brought
      the
      USSR
      from
      feudal
      society
      to
      the
      space
      age,
      it's
      pretty
      hard

      him
       gt;vast
      majority
      of
      scholars
      have
      concluded
      the
      Holodomor
      was
      an
      intentional
      genocide,
      and
      Stalin
      was
      a
      murderous
      monster
      that's
      a
      massive
      generalisation.
      Can
      you
      prove
      it?
      Remember,
      numerous
      authors
      of
      the
      Black
      Book
      of
      Communism
      have
      denounced
      the
      book,
      so
      that
      doesn't
      count!
       gt;an
      economic
      system
      that
      has
      literally
      NEVER
      A)
      worked,
      and
      B)
      didn't
      end
      in
      the
      deaths
      of
      thousands
      and
      millions.
      hi
      yes
      are
      you
      aware
      of
      the
      slave
      trade?
      You
      know,
      the
      thing,
      created
      by
      capitalism,
      which
      killed
      500
      million
      people,
      i.e.
      five
      times
      as
      many
      people
      as
      the
      highest
      estimates
      of
      communist
      deaths?
      and
      even
      then
      that's
      literally
      *one*
      of
      the
      capitalist
      mass
      killings?
      In
      comparison
      to
      which
      one
      is
      more
      deadly,
      Communism
      pales
      in
      comparison
      to
      Capitalism.
       gt;comparing
      communism
      to

      valuable.
      The
      problem
      was
      that
      he
      was
      really
      bad
      at
      running
      a

      valuable,

      China
      hasn't

      since

      Hm.
      Oh,
      and
      one
      more
      parting
      note:
      If
      Communism
      was
      never
      implemented
      in
      Russia,
      then
      they
      would
      never
      have
      industrialised
      and
      would
      then,
      therefore,
      be
      steamrolled
      by
      the
      Nazis
      when
      they
      came.
      With
      the
      full
      power
      of
      Russia's
      resources,
      this
      superpower
      Nazi
      Reich
      is
      able
      to
      squash
      Britain
      and
      unleash
      the
      Kreigsmarine
      against
      the
      USA,
      a
      piece
      of
      cake
      now
      that
      they
      have
      practically
      infinite
      men
      and
      resources
      now
      that
      they
      have
      Russia.
      But
      that
      didn't
      happen,
      because
      the
      Communists
      rapidly
      industrialised
      the
      USSR
      and
      began
      preparations
      for
      the
      war
      against
      Germany
      in
      1929.
      Joseph
      Stalin
      is
      the
      only
      reason
      you're
      still
      speaking
      English.
      He
      did
      some
      bad
      things,
      sure,
      but:
      "Every
      human
      being
      who
      loves
      freedom
      owes
      to
      the
      Red
      Army
      more
      than
      he
      will
      be
      able
      to
      pay
      in
      a
      lifetime!"

      work
      to
      please
      the
      rich,
      in
      never-ending
      debt
      and
      misery,
      distracted
      by
      gifs
      of
      puppies
      and
      rainbows
      and
      memes
      that
      make
      us
      forget
      the
      awful
      world
      we
      live
      in
      where
      18
      million
      starve
      to
      death
      every
      year
      and
      food
      rots
      in
      the
      bin
      because
      no
      one
      could
      afford
      to
      buy
      it.
      In
      such
      a
      world
      like
      this,
      death
      is
      a
      relief.
      We've
      looked
      at
      the
      past
      and
      realised
      how
      wrong
      we
      were
      about
      the
      Cold
      War.
      We
      wish
      we
      could
      go
      back,
      and,
      seeing
      as
      we
      have
      no
      future
      and
      nothing
      to
      lose,
      we're
      gonna
      do
      it;
      or
      die
      trying.

      Perhaps.

      nothing
      will
      change
      if
      we
      do

      It

      this
      is
      Enver
      Hoxha,
      the
      leader
      of
      Communist
      Albania
      from
      1946
      until
      his
      death
      in
      1985.
      He
      was
      a
      leader
      of
      the
      Anti-Fascist
      resistance
      during
      WWII
      against
      first
      the
      Italians
      and
      then
      the
      Nazis.
      After
      the
      Communists
      won
      the
      1946
      elections,
      his
      policies
      radically
      changed
      the
      face
      of
      Albania,
      including
      abolishing
      the
      authoritarian
      monarchy
      under
      King
      Zog
      and
      working
      to
      abolish
      Albania's
      heavily
      patriarchal
      society
      (as
      in
      to
      the
      point
      where
      the
      law
      stated
      that
      in
      the
      event
      of
      a
      murder
      the
      murderer
      was
      punished
      less
      if
      the
      person
      they
      murdered
      was
      a
      woman.)
      The
      communist
      party
      held
      free
      elections
      in
      1991,
      which
      they
      won
      again,
      but
      were
      forced
      to
      call
      another
      election
      in
      1992,
      which
      they
      lost.
      The
      1996
      elections
      had
      to
      be
      rigged
      in
      order
      to
      stop
      them
      from
      winning
      again.

      Communism,

      is
      a
      spooky
      scary
      ideal
      of
      the
      Russians.
      It's

      that
      we
      want
      the
      highest
      quality

      "Reactionary

      brigadiers
      most
      of

      who
      don't
      actually
      answer
      the
      question
      asked.
      You're
      not
      expected
      to
      worship
      Lenin,
      but
      a
      lot
      of
      us
      do,
      because,
      well,
      it's
      pretty
      easy
      to
      see
      why.
      An

      theorist
      and
      activist
      who
      actually
      accomplished
      something
      noteworthy.
      Criticising
      us
      of
      being
      elitists
      is
      fair,
      it's
      something
      all
      socialists
      need
      to
      be
      aware
      and
      watchful

      but

      Your
      opinion
      is...
      unique,
      but
      I
      assure
      you
      it's
      pretty
      obvious
      when
      someone
      is
      trolling.
      They're
      not
      exceptionally
      good
      at
      hiding
      it,
      it's
      usually
      something
      along
      the
      lines
      of
      "communism
      doesn't
      work
      lol"
      or
      something
      something
      100
      million,
      typical
      liberalism.
      I
      agree,
      perhaps
      it
      would
      be
      beneficial
      to
      be
      slightly
      more
      lenient
      with
      those
      that
      genuinely
      want
      to
      learn
      about
      Communism.
      Paranoia
      isn't
      the
      word
      I
      would
      use
      though,
      more
      like
      vigilance.
      You
      probably
      know
      how
      easily
      capitalism
      can
      infiltrate
      and
      no
      one
      is
      immune
      to
      its
      propaganda.
      I
      assure
      you,
      we
      don't
      want
      to
      keep
      reddit
      safe
      for
      ~~parasites~~
      advertisers,
      and
      a
      lot
      of
      us
      are
      openly
      critical
      of
      u/spez
      and
      reddit
      in
      general.
      I
      suppose
      on
      a
      sub
      like
      LSC,
      which
      is
      basically
      just
      an
      anti-capitalist
      circle
      jerk
      that
      mutes
      all
      criticisms
      of
      communism
      -
      something
      people
      like
      Mao
      warned
      us
      not
      to
      do.
      Trust
      me,
      I'm
      actually
      banned
      there
      permanently
      on
      my
      other
      account
      and
      on
      r/communism
      from
      some
      comments
      I
      made
      back
      when
      I
      was
      still
      finding
      my
      way
      through
      the
      political
      landscape
      about
      a
      year
      ago
      and
      had
      a
      some
      fascist
      and
      capitalist
      apologies.
      I
      made
      this
      one
      specifically
      to
      circumvent
      those
      bans...
      As
      for
      r/Communism101,
      I
      think
      those
      mods
      just
      kind
      of
      expect
      those
      that
      answer
      questions
      to
      be
      well-read
      experts
      or
      at
      least
      knowledgeable
      enough
      to
      answer
      detailed,
      complex

      There
      was
      a
      youtube
      video
      about
      [Wall-e
      as
      sociological
      storytelling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1-vPQKwXbY),
      and
      in
      the
      video
      the
      guy
      points
      out
      how
      Idiocracy
      is
      a
      really
      bad
      example,
      one
      that
      pits
      the
      blame
      for
      the
      consequences
      of
      capitalism
      on
      individuals
      rather
      than
      the
      system.
      It's
      well
      worth
      a
      watch
      (the
      video,
      not
      idiocracy).

      In
      my
      business
      studies
      class
      we
      learned
      that
      competition
      makes
      stuff
      cheap,
      but
      also
      that
      mergers
      are
      extremely
      profitable
      and
      businesses
      always
      strive
      to
      make
      a
      monopoly,
      among
      other
      things.
      Go
      figure.

      As
      Noam
      Chomsky
      says,
      We
      can
      be
      pessimistic,
      give
      up,
      and
      help
      ensure
      that
      the
      worst
      will
      happen.
      Or
      we
      can
      be
      optimistic,
      grasp
      the
      opportunities
      that
      surely
      exist,
      and
      maybe
      help
      make
      the
      world
      a
      better
      place.
      We
      are
      the
      next
      generation.
      Most
      famous
      political
      leaders
      started
      when
      they
      were
      our
      age.
      We
      should
      too.

      As
      a
      Juche
      tankie
      it's
      fun
      watching
      you
      guys
      turn
      left
      after
      this
      debate,
      showing
      maturity
      rather
      than
      doubling
      down
      and
      defending
      him.
      You're
      more
      intelligent
      than
      the
      most
      of
      the
      right
      wing,
      I'll
      give
      you
      that
      much.
      If
      you're
      interested
      in
       #381;i #382;ek's
      work,
      there's
      also
      some
      other
      leftist
      thinkers
      you
      should
      check
      out,
      like
      Noam
      Chomsky
      and
      Richard
      D.
      Wolff.
      If
      you
      want
      something
      to
      read,
      then
      try
      *The
      Communist
      Manifesto*
      if
      you
      haven't
      already
      or
      *State
      and
      Revolution*
      By
      Lenin
      -
      both
      are
      only
      around
      \~70
      pages
      long.
      You
      could
      also
      try
      something
      by
      Marx,
      Engels,
      Lenin
      or
      Even
      Mao
      -
      Hegel's
      *The
      Science
      of
      Logic*
      is
      also
      pretty
      good
      backdrop
      to
      these
      kinds
      of
      works.
      If
      you
      really
      want
      to
      understand
      the
      basis
      of
      Leftist
      thought
      from
      the
      roots,
      then
      you
      should
      try
      reading
      *Das
      Kapital,*
      it's
      longer
      than
      the
      bible
      but
      it
      provides
      a
      comprehensive
      insight
      to
      Marxist
      analysis
      of
      the
      world.
      Welcome
      aboard,
      comrades!

      ahahahaha,
      no.
      Things
      in
      modern
      Russia
      are
      much
      worse
      than
      they
      were
      in
      the
      USSR.
      After
      the
      collapse,
      one
      in
      every
      ten
      children
      went
      homeless.
      There
      were
      around
      a
      million
      excess
      deaths
      in
      the
      first
      year
      alone,
      and
      the
      new
      capitalist
      government
      was
      so
      unpopular
      that
      there
      were
      pro-communist
      riots
      often
      in
      the
      first
      few
      years
      after
      the
      collapse.
      The
      1996
      election
      had
      to
      be
      rigged
      in
      order
      to
      stop
      the
      communists
      from
      winning,
      and
      now
      [66%
      of
      Russians
      regret
      the
      fall
      of
      the
      USSR.](https://www.rt.com/russia/446894-ussr-nostalgia-russia-survey/)
      Similar
      things
      happened
      in

      countries

      Well
      the
      thing
      is,
      Hitler
      committed
      Genocide.
      The
      Israelis
      just
      treat
      the
      Palestinians
      as
      second
      class
      citizens,
      similar
      to
      that
      of
      apartheid
      in
      South
      Africa
      or
      the
      US,
      not
      Nazi
      Germany,
      although
      the
      Jews
      were
      treated
      badly
      while
      they
      were
      still
      alive.

      Stalin
      was
      elected
      to
      the
      CSPU
      three
      times
      in
      a
      row,
      [1937](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1937_Soviet_Union_legislative_election),
      [1946](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1946_Soviet_Union_legislative_election)
      and
      [1950](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1950_Soviet_Union_legislative_election).
      Stalin
      is
      credited
      with
      many
      things,
      one
      of
      which
      was
      the
      creation
      of
      the
      USSR,
      which
      he
      outlined
      in
      an
      essay
      titled
      "[Marxism
      and
      the
      National
      Question](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1913/03.htm)".
      He
      also
      instigated
      collectivisation
      in
      the
      USSR,
      which
      ensured
      that
      the
      1932-33
      famine
      was
      the
      last
      naturally-occurring
      in
      Eastern
      European
      history
      (there
      were
      famines
      in
      1941-44
      as
      a
      result
      of
      the
      siege
      of
      Leningrad,
      and
      a
      drought
      in
      south-west
      RFSR
      in
      1947
      as
      an
      aftershock
      from
      WWII).
      Stalin
      also
      instigated
      a
      massive
      industrial
      increase
      in
      the
      USSR
      to
      prepare
      for
      WWII
      almost
      a
      decade
      before
      any
      country
      recognised
      Nazism
      to
      be
      a
      threat.
      This
      saw
      industry
      rise
      800%
      and
      the
      USSR
      became
      the
      fastest
      growing
      economy
      in
      the
      world,
      unaffected
      by
      the
      Great
      Depression,
      [to
      the
      point
      where
      people
      fled
      to
      the
      USSR
      to
      escape
      the
      west](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression#Soviet_Union).
      Stalin
      also
      sent
      support
      to
      any
      communist
      movement
      in
      the
      world,
      in
      China,
      Korea,
      a
      limited
      role
      in
      Yugoslavia
      and
      Albania,
      East
      Germany,
      Hungary,
      Romania,
      Bulgaria
      and
      Poland
      (but
      not
      to
      Greece
      because
      Truman
      threatened
      to
      nuke
      him).
      Stalin
      also
      led
      the
      most
      progressive
      country
      in
      the
      world
      at
      the
      time,
      where
      women
      were
      given
      equal
      status
      to
      men
      in
      almost
      every
      facet
      of
      life,
      something
      unheard
      of
      in
      the
      rest
      of
      the
      world.

      a
      "dictatorship

      This

      of

      That's
      why
      even
      in

      what

      Castro
      was
      pretty
      liberal
      when
      it
      came
      to
      communist
      leaders.
      Cuba
      was
      only
      slightly
      more
      controlling
      than
      Communist
      Albania,
      the
      country
      that
      was
      basically
      a
      libertarian's
      wet
      dream
      seeing
      as
      it
      made
      gun
      ownership
      mandatory.
      There
      were
      around
      ~4,000
      political
      executions
      at
      the
      time
      of
      the
      revolution,
      (not
      counting
      the
      Black
      Book
      of
      Communism
      because
      its
      authors
      have
      stated
      that
      the
      death

      but
      that's

      If
      the

      was
      the

      dead
      in
      the
      American
      revolution?
      a

      Yes,
      there
      are
      cases
      like
       #211;scar

      very
      small
      political
      minority
      in
      Cuba
      -
      75
      people
      out
      of
      11
      million.
      Is
      the
      treatment
      of
      him
      by
      the
      Cuban
      government
      justified?
      if
      his
      claims
      are
      true,
      no.
      Marxists
      have
      a
      deep
      disdain
      for
      liberals
      like
      him,
      but
      he
      probably
      shouldn't
      have
      been
      "beaten
      and
      burned".
      Nevertheless,
      he
      was
      a
      counter-revolutionary
      and
      a
      criminal.

      Well,
      I
      just
      think
      of
      what
      Noam
      Chomsky
      says:
       gt;We
      have
      two
      choices.
      We
      can
      be
      pessimistic,
      give
      up,
      and
      help
      ensure
      that
      the
      worst
      will
      happen.
      Or
      we
      can
      be
      optimistic,
      grasp
      the
      opportunities
      that
      surely
      exist,
      and
      maybe
      help
      make
      the
      world
      a
      better
      place.
      We
      have
      to
      hope
      and
      believe
      that
      we
      will
      make
      the
      world
      a
      better
      place.
      Or
      kill
      them
      trying.

      I
      don't
      know
      if
      you're
      Australian,
      but
      I
      am,
      and
      let
      me
      tell
      you
      what
      we
      know
      about
      him.
      In
      Australia,
      Ned
      Kelly
      is,
      by
      and
      large,
      respected
      and
      revered
      as
      a
      hero
      of
      the
      everyman,
      a
      sort
      of
      robin-hood
      type
      character,
      as
      OP
      noted.
      You
      see,
      if
      you
      don't
      know
      too
      much
      about
      him,
      I'll
      summarise
      his
      life
      story:
      Ned
      Kelly
      was
      an
      Irish-Australian
      Bushranger
      (similar
      to
      that
      of
      a
      highwayman)
      in
      the
      mid
      to
      late
      19th
      century,
      operating
      primarily
      in
      rural
      Victoria,
      in
      South-East
      Australia.
      See,
      in
      the
      times
      when
      people
      were
      coming
      to
      "settle"
      Australia,
      not
      much
      of
      Australia's
      land
      was
      actually
      arable.
      All
      the
      best
      land
      had
      been
      taken
      by
      "Squatters"
      (re:
      Kulaks),
      and
      in
      order
      to
      make
      sure
      a
      good
      75%
      of
      the
      population
      didn't
      starve,
      the
      government
      stepped
      and
      implemented
      a
      sort
      of
      rudimentary
      land
      redistribution
      program
      to
      make
      sure
      some
      of
      the
      poorer
      settlers
      had
      a
      way
      to
      make
      a
      living
      farming.
      However,
      the
      Squatters
      gave
      up
      only
      the
      worst
      land,
      and
      as
      a
      result,
      people
      like
      Kelly's
      family
      struggled
      immensely.
      This
      wasn't
      helped
      by
      the
      extreme
      racism
      Irish
      people
      faced
      at
      the
      time,
      enforced
      almost
      by
      law
      with
      the
      local
      police
      forces.
      Kelly
      ended
      up
      going
      to
      Jail
      for
      a
      number
      of
      years
      on
      the
      crime
      of
      being
      accused
      of
      stealing
      a
      horse
      (and
      some
      bush
      ranging
      activities
      they
      didn't
      have
      evidence
      for),
      forcing
      his
      family
      and
      mother
      to
      suffer
      immensely,
      as
      he
      was
      the
      main
      provider
      for
      the
      family.
      After
      he
      got
      out,
      he
      was
      determined
      to
      live
      an
      honest
      life,
      which
      was
      hard,
      as
      people
      would
      often
      try
      to
      pick
      fights
      with
      the
      large
      Ned
      Kelly,
      with
      his
      fiery
      red
      beard
      and
      all.
      Eventually,
      things
      snapped
      -
      a
      police
      officer
      tried
      to
      have
      his
      way
      with
      his
      sister,
      and
      one
      thing
      led
      to
      another;
      and
      the
      policeman
      had
      a
      bullet
      hole
      in
      his
      hand.
      Quickly
      working
      to
      patch
      up
      the
      wound,
      Kelly,
      his
      mother
      and
      the
      officer
      agreed
      to
      never
      speak
      of
      the
      incident.
      The
      officer
      lied.
      Seeing
      no
      other
      option,
      Kelly
      fled
      -
      his
      brother
      and
      some
      friends
      joined
      him,
      forming
      "the
      Kelly
      gang".
      They,
      unlike
      other
      bushrangers,
      sought
      to
      fight
      for
      revenge
      against
      the
      squatters.
      They
      stole
      horses
      and
      sheep,
      giving
      them
      to
      poorer
      settlers;
      robbed
      banks
      and
      stations,
      and
      when
      they
      did,
      they
      locked
      up
      the
      men
      in
      a
      shed
      usually,
      while
      the
      women
      and
      children
      were
      kept
      in
      the
      arguably
      much
      more
      comfortable
      station
      house
      or
      some
      other
      room.
      Afterwards,
      they
      redistributed
      some
      of
      the
      money
      to
      the
      people
      they'd
      troubled
      and
      bought
      drinks
      for
      the
      men
      -
      as
      well
      as
      destroying
      documents
      that
      bound
      poor
      settlers
      to
      unfair
      contracts
      with
      squatters.
      There
      were
      many
      firefights
      with
      police
      officers,
      and
      in
      order
      to
      counter
      this,
      the
      gang
      wore
      -
      get
      this
      -
      bulletproof
      makeshift
      cast
      iron
      armour
      made
      of
      stolen
      ploughshares.
      Seriously,
      look
      it
      up.
      Dude
      looked
      like
      iron
      man.
      This
      culminated
      with
      the
      shootout
      at
      stringybark
      creek,
      where
      all
      of
      gang
      perished
      except
      for
      Kelly,
      who
      fought
      until
      the
      brutal
      and
      bloody
      end.
      He
      was
      shot
      in
      the
      knees
      twice
      with
      a
      shotgun.
      Kelly
      was
      hung
      in
      Melbourne
      Jail,
      much
      to
      the
      protest
      of
      the
      public
      -
      a
      petition
      of
      200,000
      signatures
      called
      for
      his
      release,
      or
      at
      least,
      sparing
      from
      the
      death
      sentence.
      In
      the
      end,
      he
      was
      hung.
      His
      last
      words
      were
      "such
      is
      life,"
      which
      translates
      to
      "Welp,
      fuck
      it."
      In
      Australia,
      Kelly
      is
      seen
      as
      a
      local
      hero.
      He
      is
      symbol
      of
      the
      power
      the
      people
      have
      over
      the
      government,
      a
      person
      torn
      down
      by
      life
      over
      and
      over
      again
      with
      the
      unfair
      and
      unjust
      world
      around
      him,
      and
      reacting
      subsequently
      to
      it.
      [Sound
      Familiar?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin)
      From
      a
      marxist
      perspective,
      Kelly
      is
      a
      rogue
      proto-revolutionary,
      whose
      actions,
      although
      effective
      against
      the
      capitalist
      class
      and
      having
      profound
      effects
      towards
      the
      working
      class
      he
      sought
      to
      "avenge",
      they
      have
      little
      effect
      in
      changing
      the
      system
      that
      caused
      such
      injustices.
      Either
      way,
      Kelly
      stands
      as
      proof
      that
      even
      a
      small
      organised
      force
      can
      have
      great
      impacts
      on
      the
      state
      and,
      moreover,
      the
      capitalist
      institution.
      Ned
      Kelly
      is
      immortalised
      as
      a
      hero
      of
      The
      Australian
      Proletariat,
      and
      Australians
      across
      the
      country
      look
      up
      to
      him,
      that
      even
      though
      he's
      gone,
      his
      revolutionary
      spirit
      lives
      on.
      As
      we
      say:
      It's
      a
      thousand
      like
      Ned
      Kelly,
      who'll
      hoist
      the
      flag
      of
      stars!

      well
      you
      see
      back
      then
      in
      the
      60s
      people
      really
      didn't
      know
      shit
      about
      space.
      Since
      women
      had
      different
      anatomy
      to
      men
      (wombs
      and
      all),
      they
      theorised
      that
      maybe
      women
      would
      react
      differently
      to
      space
      than
      men,
      and
      the
      only
      way
      to
      find
      out
      would
      be
      to
      put
      one
      in
      space.
      So
      they
      did.
      Turns
      out,
      space
      doesn't
      give
      a
      shit.

      If
      its
      any
      consolation,
      regular
      garden-variety
      predator
      drones
      are
      pretty
      weak
      in
      aircraft
      terms.
      Most
      are
      driven
      by
      prop
      engines,
      the
      most
      numerous
      of
      which
      are
      feeble
      115hp
      4-cylinder
      engines
      that
      barely
      manage
      to
      hit
      215
      Km/H.
      For
      reference,
      a
      plane
      from
      the
      1930s
      could
      easily
      defeat
      one
      in
      a
      dogfight.
      That's
      not
      so
      much
      a
      death
      from
      above,
      more
      so
      a
      flying
      Cessna.
      The
      US
      army
      is
      not
      nearly
      as
      strong
      as
      you
      think
      it
      is.
      Sweden,
      Iran
      and
      Australia
      have
      all
      defeated
      the
      US
      fairly
      easily
      in
      war
      games.
      An
      organised
      and
      armed
      mass
      of
      workers
      should
      easily
      have
      a
      chance.

      Cultural
      Revolution.
      Mao's
      theory
      argued
      that
      the
      revolution
      must
      continue
      even
      after
      the
      capitalists
      are
      defeated,
      in
      order
      to
      root
      out
      "pro-capitalist
      remnants"
      in
      society.
      Internalised
      capitalism
      and
      capitalist
      ways
      of
      thinking
      is
      so
      deeply
      rooted
      in
      our
      subconscious
      that
      we
      don't
      even
      realise
      it,
      and
      allowing
      it
      to
      persist
      can
      lead
      to
      revisionism.
      Things
      like
      valuing
      yourself
      based
      on
      how
      much
      you
      can
      produce,
      how
      much
      things
      cost,
      etc.
      That
      is
      why
      we
      need
      a
      complete
      and
      constant
      revolution
      to
      stamp
      out
      revisionism
      and
      internalised
      capitalism
      to
      ensure
      that
      socialism
      stays
      and
      stays
      for
      good,
      allowing
      to
      complete
      its
      transformation
      into
      communism.

      regularly.

      Yeah,
      the
      manifesto
      isn #8217;t
      really
      overall
      a
      in-and-out
      explanation
      of
      communism,
      it #8217;s
      just
      supposed
      to
      be
      a
      sort
      of
      PowerPoint
      presentation
      of
      communism
      that
      explains
      the
      very
      basics,
      if
      that
      makes
      sense.
      Das
      Kapital
      is
      the
      one
      that
      goes
      into
      deep
      explanation
      about
      the
      exploitative
      and
      unsustainable
      nature
      of
      capitalism,
      but
      that
      book
      is
      like
      2,000
      pages
      long
      lol

      if
      you #8217;re

      it
      goes
      more

      It's

      what
      of

      or
      similar

      Is

      I
      just
      think
      it's
      disturbing
      when
      in
      an
      imperialist
      war
      of
      brutal
      and
      bloody
      conflict
      that
      resulted
      in
      millions
      upon
      millions
      of
      dead
      civilians
      the
      only
      thing
      you
      Americans
      care
      about
      is
      whether
      or
      not
      you
      won.
      Who
      cares
      about
      all
      the
      dead
      kids
      or
      lives
      you
      ruined
      just
      so
      you
      could
      control
      some
      scrap
      of
      land
      in

      all
      that
      matter
      is
      your
      win
      rate.
      I

      Yes,
      and
      they
      chose
      to
      be
      socialist.
      Google
      People's
      Republic
      of
      Korea.
      After
      Japan
      left
      and
      before
      the
      soviets
      and
      America
      arrived
      Korea
      chose
      to
      organise
      itself
      into
      a
      socialist
      country.
      America
      came
      and
      declared
      them
      illegal
      (because
      America
      can
      do
      that,
      apparently)
      and
      the
      remnants
      of
      that
      government
      went
      north
      and
      were
      hosted
      by
      the
      USSR.
      And,
      well,
      yeah.
      That's
      what
      a
      revolution
      is.
      I
      suppose
      the
      13
      colonies
      were
      directly
      rebelling
      against
      Britain,
      then,
      weren't
      they?
      After
      all,
      you
      could
      just,
      you
      know,
      stop
      playing
      world
      police
      and
      let
      people
      be.
      Just
      a
      thought.

      That

      in
      1912.
      Stalin
      was

      and
      the

      Still

      The
      thing
      is,
      that
      actually
      happened.
      It
      was
      in
      1912,
      and
      Stalin
      was
      in
      his
      thirties
      at
      the
      time
      (being
      born
      in
      1878),
      and
      the
      girl
      was
      13...
      however,
      this
      was
      only
      one
      year
      under
      the
      legal
      age
      of
      consent
      in
      Imperial
      Russia.
      Still
      kinda
      fucked
      up
      though,
      it's
      one
      of
      the
      details
      about
      Stalin's
      life
      us

      I
      can
      answer
      for
      Mao.
      Mao
      was
      an
      excellent
      philosopher,
      not
      so
      much
      a
      leader.
      Mao
      himself
      knew
      this,
      stating
      that
      he
      wasn't
      really
      much
      for
      government
      planning
      or
      economics
      etc,
      which
      is
      why
      he
      stepped
      down
      in
      1960,
      letting
      Zhou
      Enlai
      take
      over
      instead
      (but
      staying
      as
      party
      chairman.)
      Mao
      is
      remembered
      for
      his
      contributions
      to
      Marxism,
      which
      are
      many
      and
      great.
      He's
      able
      to
      take
      super
      complex
      ideas
      and
      break
      them
      down
      to
      be
      easy
      to
      digest
      and
      understand,
      using
      his
      own
      metaphors
      and
      such
      to
      help
      the
      reader
      understand
      him.
      Stalin
      does
      the
      same
      thing,
      I've
      heard
      someone
      call
      him
      "the
      Bob
      Ross
      of
      Communism"
      purely
      because
      of
      how
      easy
      it
      is
      to
      understand
      him
      and
      how
      he
      writes.
      Obviously
      we
      don't
      think
      these
      guys
      were
      perfect.
      They
      weren't,
      and
      they
      knew
      it-
      Mao
      ruthlessly
      criticised
      himself
      and
      Stalin
      hated
      when
      people
      tried
      to
      paint
      his
      failures
      as
      successes.
      Stalin
      was
      neither
      a
      sinner,
      not
      was
      he
      a
      saint;
      as
      I
      like
      to
      say.
      Oh,
      by
      the
      way,
      no
      one
      actually
      uses
      the
      term
      "Stalinism".
      Not
      even
      Stalin
      himself
      did
      (he
      actually
      refused
      to.)
      the
      term
      usually
      used
      is
      Marxism-Leninism.

       gt;anarchists
      Oof,
      that's
      rough
      buddy.
      You
      said
      you
      read
      a
      lot
      of
      theory,
      and
      don't
      worry
      it
      happens
      even
      on
      the
      communist
      side
      -
      I
      once
      had
      someone
      try
      to
      convince
      me
      that
      Stalin
      was
      a
      counterrevolutionary
      imperialist,
      which
      is,
      unfortunately,
      the
      predominant
      belief
      in
      Australia.
      Ugh.
      Anyway,
      if
      you
      read
      theory
      then
      that's
      a
      sure
      fire
      way
      to
      know
      that
      you're
      in
      the
      right,
      but
      we
      must
      always
      be
      aware
      and
      willing
      to
      learn
      and
      critique
      ourselves,
      which
      helps
      to
      convince
      people
      -
      "contentious
      self-criticism
      is
      what
      sets
      our
      party
      apart"
      (Mao).
      One
      advantage
      we
      have
      over
      anarchists
      is
      history
      and
      the
      actual
      practice
      of
      Marxism,
      where
      people
      who
      literally
      lived
      under
      Stalin
      still
      think
      he
      wasn't
      terrible.
      We
      have
      to
      point
      out
      the
      successes
      of
      our
      past
      as
      well
      as
      critique
      them,
      because
      if
      we
      do
      too
      much
      of
      one
      we
      will
      be
      seen
      as
      propagandists,
      but
      if
      we
      do
      too
      much
      of
      the
      other
      we
      will
      be
      seen
      as
      if
      we
      are
      bringing
      about
      the
      apocalypse.
      It
      is
      important
      to
      be
      confident,
      and
      always
      remember
      that
      we
      communists
      have
      a
      history
      that
      proves
      us
      right
      -
      it's
      not
      always
      a
      clean
      history,
      but
      it's
      enough
      to
      let
      us
      know
      that
      we
      march
      on
      the
      correct
      path
      towards
      freedom
      from
      capitalism.
      Oh,
      and
      saying
      MLs
      are
      "red
      fascists"
      is
      just
      as
      ridiculous
      as
      saying
      Antifa
      are
      fascists.

      And
      Stalin
      hated
      his
      cult
      of
      personality:
      "*In
      the
      1930s
      Stalin
      made
      several
      speeches
      that
      diminished
      the
      importance
      of
      individual
      leaders
      and
      disparaged
      the
      cult
      forming
      around
      him,
      painting
      such
      a
      cult
      as
      un-Bolshevik;
      instead,
      he
      emphasized
      the
      importance
      of
      broader
      social
      forces.
      Stalin's
      public
      actions
      seemed
      to
      support
      his
      professed
      disdain
      of
      the
      cult:
      Stalin
      often
      edited
      reports
      of
      Kremlin
      receptions,
      cutting
      applause
      and
      praise
      aimed
      at
      him
      and
      adding
      applause
      for
      other
      Soviet
      leaders.*"
      (By
      1938
      he
      got
      used
      to
      it
      and
      just
      kinda
      rolled
      with
      it
      though).

      delight
      at

      millions

      he

      that
      smug
      little
      smile.

      him
      look

      a

      I
      don't
      think
      Liberals
      are
      that
      terrible.
      Everyday
      ones,
      at
      least.
      Hatred
      of
      liberals
      is
      largely
      derived
      from
      frustrated
      love
      -
      you
      wish
      they
      knew
      what
      you
      do,
      you
      wish
      they
      understood
      how
      the
      system
      is
      rigged
      against
      them,
      you
      wish
      they
      weren't
      so
      gullible
      and
      had
      a
      shred
      of
      class
      consciousness.
      But
      they
      refuse
      and
      mindlessly
      obey
      whatever's
      told
      to
      them.
      Except
      the
      fuckers
      on
      r/neoliberal,
      they
      get

      What
      I've
      been
      doing
      lately
      is
      writing
      down
      my
      thoughts
      on
      Marxism,
      particularly
      as
      they
      would
      be
      applied
      to
      Australia,
      where
      I
      live.
      I've
      decided
      to
      start
      posting
      them
      here
      so
      the
      30
      people
      who
      follow
      me
      here
      have
      something
      to
      look
      at.
       #8203;
      Australia
      cannot
      make
      a
      peaceful
      transition
      towards
      Socialism.
      The
      1975
      coup
      by
      the
      imperial
      US
      forces
      has
      taught
      us
      that
      we
      are,
      without
      a
      slightest
      doubt,
      an
      American
      vassal
      state.
      The
      current
      democratic
      system
      is
      useful
      for
      driving
      support
      to
      the
      cause,
      but
      we
      are
      as
      naive
      as
      the
      anarchists
      if
      we
      think
      that
      we
      can
      dissolve
      the
      capitalist
      state
      in
      our
      current
      situation
      peacefully.
      Revolution
      is
      the
      only
      solution.
      There
      is
      no
      other
      alternative.

      eh,
      I
      suppose
      on
      a
      government
      it
      depends
      on
      a
      case-by-case
      basis.
      A
      government's
      best
      interest
      is
      always
      *supposed*
      to
      be
      you,
      because
      they're,
      you
      know,
      the
      government.
      That's
      what
      they
      do.
      Whereas
      a
      company's
      best
      interest
      is
      always
      profit.
      *Never*
      you.
      The
      problem
      that
      (inevitably)
      arises
      is
      when
      a
      business
      extends
      its
      power
      to
      a
      government
      and
      fills
      said
      government
      with
      people
      that
      suit
      its
      interests,
      rather
      than
      yours.

      The
      idea
      of
      "voting
      with
      your
      dollars"
      is
      impossible
      as
      in
      a
      modern
      late-stage
      capitalist
      society
      companies
      like
      nestle
      have
      an
      oligopoly
      -
      or
      monopoly
      -
      on
      certain
      areas
      of
      commerce,
      meaning
      that
      it
      is
      quite
      difficult
      if
      not
      impossible
      -
      or
      at
      the
      very
      least
      unfeasible
      -
      to
      resist
      giants
      such
      as
      nestle.
      And
      we
      already
      established
      the
      fact
      that
      the
      current
      government
      administration
      is
      allowing
      GEO
      to
      do
      this,
      and
      doesn't
      care
      about
      what
      GEO
      does
      because
      of
      the
      very
      stance
      you've
      taken
      -
      that
      government
      shouldn't
      interfere
      in
      business.
      Here's
      an
      idea
      -
      overthrow
      the
      current
      government
      (republicans
      and
      democrats)
      and
      abolish
      the
      capitalist
      system,
      replacing
      it
      with
      a
      socialist
      one
      and
      adopt
      socialist
      policies
      regarding
      border
      security.
      No
      more
      dead
      kids
      at
      the
      border.
      (oh,
      and
      by
      the
      way,
      neither
      socialism
      nor
      communism
      can
      be
      boiled
      down
      to
      "expansion
      of
      government".
      It's,
      uh,
      much
      more
      complicated
      than
      that.)

      yeah,

      gulag
      prisoners
      were
      criminals,

      Not
      people
      fleeing

      And
      they
      got

      When

      Entered
      high
      school
      in
      year
      7
      in
      2014,
      went
      through
      that
      without
      much
      happening
      (apart
      from
      getting
      depression,
      becoming
      a
      fascist,
      then
      reading
      Marx
      and
      becoming
      a
      communist),
      starting
      a
      youtube
      channel
      and
      growing
      it
      to
      1.2k
      subscribers,
      getting
      a
      job
      for
      the
      first
      time,
      having
      a
      girl
      confess
      to
      me,
      and
      more
      or
      less
      growing
      from
      a
      lonely
      12
      year
      old
      to
      a
      slightly
      less
      lonely
      teenager.
      Now,
      I'm
      only
      three
      months
      away
      from
      doing
      my
      HSC
      exams
      and
      going
      to
      university.
      I
      wonder
      when
      this
      game
      will
      come
      out...?
      I
      hope
      sometime
      soon.
      It'll
      give
      me
      something
      to
      do
      in
      the
      meantime
      while
      I
      pursue
      the
      ways
      I
      wanna
      change
      this
      world
      for
      the
      better.

      That's
      the
      great
      thing.
      The
      PRC
      has
      maintained
      a
      planned
      economy
      with
      open
      foreign
      markets,
      so
      when
      the
      next
      collapse
      inevitably
      happens
      china
      will
      be
      (mostly)
      fine.
      China
      reaps
      the
      few
      benefits
      of
      global
      capitalism
      whilst
      still
      maintaining
      socialism
      -
      in
      a
      sense
      they're
      playing
      the
      capitalists
      at
      their
      own
      game.
      (I
      think,
      please
      correct
      me
      if
      I'm
      wrong)

      That
      is
      true,
      but
      the
      United
      States
      Army
      is
      nowhere
      near
      as
      powerful
      as
      it
      once
      was
      and
      the
      US
      refuses
      to
      admit
      it.
      In
      the
      early
      2000s
      the
      US
      staged
      some
      war
      games
      with
      Iran
      on
      a
      potential
      invasion
      of
      Iran
      -
      and
      lost
      by
      a
      landslide.
      In
      fact,
      the
      US
      spent
      several
      million
      dollars
      re-staging
      the
      games
      to
      certain
      conditions
      so
      they
      won.
      The
      same
      thing
      happened
      when
      a
      Swedish
      submarine
      singlehandedly
      defeated
      three
      US
      carriers,
      or
      when
      the
      Australian
      Army
      was
      able
      to
      defeat
      the
      US
      on
      even
      ground.
      These
      are
      nations
      nowhere
      near
      as
      powerful
      as
      china,
      a
      nuclear
      power
      with
      a
      billion
      citizens
      and
      one
      of
      the
      greatest
      armies
      on
      earth.
      If
      there
      should
      be
      a
      war
      between
      the
      People's
      Republic
      of
      China
      and
      the
      United
      States
      of
      America,
      there
      will
      be
      losses,
      yes,
      but
      I
      predict
      the
      PLA
      will
      win
      by
      a
      landslide.

      I
      used
      to
      be
      a
      proto-fascist
      reactionary,
      and
      then
      about
      a
      year
      (and
      a
      half?)
      ago
      I
      decided
      to
      read
      the
      communist
      manifesto
      on
      iBooks
      for
      kicks.
      I
      found
      myself
      agreeing
      with
      Marx's
      words,
      and
      from
      then
      on
      they
      stuck
      with
      me.
      Right
      now
      I'm
      working
      on
      how
      Communism
      would
      be
      applied
      to
      my
      country,
      Australia.

      Congratulations,
      you
      made
      every
      communist
      to
      ever
      exist
      die
      on

      people
      think
      the
      GOP
      is
      communist??
      Are
      they
      not
      aware
      that
      the
      USSR
      collapsed
      30
      years
      ago?
      Did
      they
      forget
      how
      the
      US
      government
      forced
      the
      USSR
      to
      collapse??
      That
      they
      bombed
      Yugoslavia
      out
      of
      existence?
      And
      that
      they
      continue
      to
      try
      to
      starve

      Well
      that's
      okay,
      I
      was
      never
      really
      much
      for
      shooters
      either,
      I
      preferred
      racers..
      although
      I
      do
      enjoy
      War
      Thunder.
      The
      games
      I
      mentioned
      are
      all
      role-playing
      games,
      I.e.
      Strategy
      and
      adventure
      with
      magic
      and
      stuff
      (although
      Mother
      3
      and
      the
      earthbound/mother
      series
      as
      a
      whole
      does
      have
      some
      aspects
      where
      quick
      reactions
      are
      required)
      and
      are
      mostly
      very
      plot-heavy,
      but
      not
      like
      so
      much
      so
      it
      drains
      away
      from
      the
      gameplay.
      There's
      also
      Dead
      Cells,
      if
      you
      want,
      but
      that's
      more
      of
      a
      run-jump
      hack
      and
      slash
      type
      game,
      like
      Mario,
      but
      he
      runs
      a
      lot
      faster
      and
      has
      a
      sword.
      I
      just
      mentioned
      it
      because
      motion
      twin,
      the
      game
      studio
      that
      made
      it,
      is
      a
      worker
      co-op.

      *a

      Trans

      The

      point
      of

      If

      Ignore

      Like
      how
      the
      USA
      rigged
      the
      1975
      Australian
      Elections.
      Or
      Staged
      a
      coup
      in
      Chile
      in
      1972
      to
      get
      rid
      of
      Salvador
      Allende,
      replacing
      him
      with
      a
      murderous
      dictator.
      Or
      how
      **in
      1996
      the
      Americans
      rigged
      the
      Russian
      elections
      to
      specifically
      stop
      the
      communist
      party
      from
      winning,
      doing
      the
      same
      thing
      in
      Albania
      in
      1992
      and
      literally
      bombing
      Yugoslavia
      out
      of
      existence.**
      karma's
      a
      bitch
      ain't
      it?
      Stop
      focusing
      on
      trump.
      Focus
      on
      the
      conditions
      created
      by
      the
      destructive
      tag
      team
      of
      neoliberalism
      and
      conservatism
      that
      led
      to
      trump
      becoming
      a
      viable

      in

      Golly

      I
      wonder

      has
      anything
      to
      do
      with
      the
      fact
      that
      they've
      historically
      been
      forced
      to
      work
      in
      finance
      because
      Christians
      deemed
      that
      work
      "unclean"
      which
      then
      made
      them
      rich
      Also,
      so
      what
      if
      it's
      true?
      You
      don't
      need
      to
      point
      it
      out.
      You're

      Communism.
      No,
      really.
      More
      often
      than
      not
      people
      tend
      to
      agree
      with
      the
      idea
      that
      workers
      should
      be
      entitled
      to
      100%
      of
      the

      they
      create

      profits,

      investments/expenses

      isn't

      After
      all,
      workers
      made
      that
      money
      -
      why
      shouldn't
      they
      get
      it?

      be

      what
      do
      you
      think
      taxes
      are
      for?
      We
      want
      to
      build
      a
      society
      where
      people

      in

      where
      candidates
      are

      And
      where
      did
      he
      get

      The

      "not
      knowing"
      isn't
      good
      enough,
      asshole.
      You're
      the
      cunts
      who:
      1)
      threatened
      to
      nuke
      the
      USSR
      if
      they
      supported
      the
      Communists
      against
      the
      Fascists
      in
      the
      greek
      civil
      war
      2)
      Waited
      until
      one
      day
      before
      the
      Soviets
      declared
      war
      on
      Japan
      to
      commit
      nuclear
      genocide,
      twice,
      all
      in
      the
      name
      of
      1-upping
      the
      Soviets
      only
      for
      Japan
      to
      surrender
      to
      them
      one
      day
      before
      they
      surrendered
      to
      you
      3)
      tried
      to
      abolish
      the
      self-organised
      people's
      republic
      of
      Korea,
      installed
      a
      fascist
      dictator
      in
      the
      south
      and
      then
      tried
      to
      nuke
      the
      remainder
      of
      the
      PRK
      50
      times
      but
      instead
      settling
      for
      massacring
      a
      third
      of
      the
      entire
      population
      of
      Korea
      and
      bombing
      them
      so
      hard
      the
      soil
      turned
      infertile,
      before
      *then*
      trying
      to
      sabotage
      them
      again
      when
      famine
      ravaged
      the
      region
      in
      the
      90s
      4)
      tried
      to
      start
      a
      war
      with
      China
      after
      the
      Communists
      won
      5)
      tried
      to
      start
      nuclear
      war
      with
      the
      Soviet
      Union
      on
      three
      seperate
      occasions,
      one
      of
      which
      you
      deliberately
      put
      nukes
      in
      Turkey
      and
      played
      the
      victim
      when
      the
      Soviets
      put
      nukes
      in
      Cuba
      in
      response
      6)
      staged
      a
      coup
      in
      Iran
      in
      1956
      7)
      Supported
      the
      genocidal
      rule
      of
      French
      Indochina
      and
      waged
      a
      fourteen
      year
      genocide
      against
      the
      Vietnamese,
      Laotians
      and
      Cambodians,
      before
      deciding
      to
      pay
      Pol
      Pot
      to
      pretend
      to
      be
      communist
      and
      turning
      a
      blind
      eye
      when
      he
      enacted
      genocide,
      leaving
      the
      PLA,
      Viet
      Kong
      and
      Pathet
      Lao
      to
      clean
      up
      the
      combined
      mess
      of
      the
      CIA
      and
      Khmer
      Rouge
      8)
      tried
      (and
      failed)
      to
      invade
      Cuba
      9)
      supported
      the
      banana
      republics
      systemic
      oppression
      of
      Central
      America
      by
      staging
      coups
      whenever
      they
      tried
      to
      have
      legitimate
      elections
      10)
      staged
      a
      "constitutional
      coup"
      in
      Australia
      to
      remove
      the
      prime
      minister
      because
      he
      thought
      "yo,
      maybe
      Australia
      shouldn't
      be
      an
      American
      puppet"
      11)
      Supported
      terrorists
      in
      the
      Middle
      East
      purely
      because
      they
      were
      against
      the
      Soviets,
      "intervened",
      and
      ended
      up
      killing
      more
      people
      than
      the
      soviets
      and
      terrorists
      combined
      12)
      facilitated
      the
      downfall
      of
      the
      USSR,
      causing
      male
      life
      expectancy
      to
      fall
      almost
      15
      years,
      make
      one
      in
      ten
      children
      homeless,
      48
      million
      people
      unemployed,
      and
      cause
      3
      million
      excess
      deaths
      in
      the
      first
      year
      alone
      and
      then
      rigged
      the
      1996
      Russian
      elections
      to
      make
      sure
      it
      stayed
      that
      way
      (and
      you
      wonder
      why
      over
      66%
      of
      Russians
      want
      communism
      back)
      13)
      rigged
      the
      1992
      Albanian
      elections
      to
      make
      sure
      they
      stayed
      capitalist
      even
      after
      the
      communist
      party
      won
      in
      a
      landslide
      14)
      bombed
      Yugoslavia
      out
      of
      existence
      15)
      staged
      a
      coup
      in
      Libya
      16)
      tried
      to
      start
      a
      nuclear
      war
      with
      North
      korea
      17)
      even
      this
      year,
      tried
      to
      start
      a
      coup
      in
      Venezuela.
      And
      this
      isn't
      even
      a
      complete
      list.
      I'm
      sure
      you
      and
      your
      family
      are
      wonderful
      people
      who
      would
      *never*
      condone
      such
      murderous
      actions.
      But
      your
      actions
      as
      a
      country
      are
      inexcusable.
      "not
      knowing"
      isn't
      good
      enough.

      The
      Soviet
      Union
      tried
      to
      start
      an
      Anti-Fascist
      pact
      with
      Britain,
      France
      and
      Poland
      in
      the
      years
      leading
      up
      to
      World
      War
      II,
      but
      all
      of
      them
      refused,
      forcing
      the
      Soviets
      -
      who
      were
      in
      the
      final
      stages
      of
      their
      15-year
      effort
      to
      prepare
      for
      World
      War
      II
      -
      to
      sign
      a
      non-aggression
      pact
      with
      Nazi
      Germany
      as
      a
      last-ditch
      attempt
      to
      stave
      off
      the
      war
      in
      the
      east.
      The
      Nazis
      -
      convinced
      that
      the
      soviets
      were
      desperate
      and
      viewed
      them
      as
      an
      inferior
      species
      -
      attacked
      Poland
      and
      Western
      Europe
      instead
      while
      the
      soviets
      sat
      back
      smugly
      saying,
      "I
      told
      you
      so."
      Fast
      forward
      to
      the
      end
      of
      the
      war
      and
      the
      Soviets
      have
      nearly
      singlehandedly
      wiped
      the
      floor
      with
      the
      Nazis.
      As
      per
      post-war
      agreements,
      the
      Soviets
      agreed
      to
      attack
      the
      Japanese
      90
      days
      after
      victory
      over
      Germany.
      America
      Nuked
      Hiroshima
      one
      day
      before
      the
      Soviets
      were
      to
      attack.
      Although,
      in
      a
      surprise
      "no
      u",
      Japan
      brushed
      off
      the
      attack
      on
      Hiroshima
      as
      just
      another
      bombing
      raid
      as
      they
      didn't
      know
      it
      was
      an
      atomic
      bomb
      that
      did
      it
      -
      and
      surrendered
      to
      the
      Soviets
      *two
      days
      before*
      they
      surrendered
      to
      America.

      WELL:
      Laos
      won
      the
      civil
      war.
      Hooray!
      now
      it's
      time
      to
      do
      the
      socialis-
       #8203;
      wait.
      Laos
      is
      a
      third
      world
      country.
      They
      don't
      have
      any
      industry.
      In
      Laos,
      "means
      of
      production"
      means
      water
      buffalo
      and
      wooden
      ploughs.
      Landlords
      don't
      really
      exist,
      at
      least,
      not
      enough
      for
      people
      to
      appreciate
      being
      liberated
      from
      them.
      Most
      people
      still
      practice
      subsistence
      farming.
      Laos
      has
      no
      capitalism.
      So
      therefore,
      there
      can't
      be
      any
      socialism
      yet.
      Well
      shit.
      So,
      that's
      where
      Laos
      is
      now.
      They're
      currently
      building
      the
      "capitalism"
      part,
      like
      Lenin's
      NEP.
      When
      the
      time
      comes,
      they'll
      make
      the
      transition
      towards
      Socialism.

      That #8217;s

      Most

      subs
      lean
      very
      hard
      to

      is
      not

      I
      will
      defend
      that
      notion
      until
      my
      dying
      breath)
      and
      downvote
      anything
      that
      presents
      something
      other
      than
      that.
      For
      example:
      pro-HK
      protestor
      photos
      get
      thousands
      of
      upvotes
      on
      r/pics,
      but
      a
      photo
      of
      a
      pro-motherland
      protest
      in
      HK
      will
      get
      downvoted
      and
      you
      declared
      a
      Chinese
      shill.
      However,
      there
      are
      legitimate
      leftists
      on
      here
      where
      the
      opposite
      is
      true,
      although
      they
      mostly
      hang
      out
      on
      places
      like
      r/CTH,
      r/Socialism
      or
      r/Communism
      etc.

      Okay,
      that #8217;s
      good.
      That
      is
      a
      left-wing
      political
      stance.
      Not
      all
      of
      reddit
      supports
      that,
      however.
      If
      you
      go
      onto
      a
      mainstream
      reddit
      sub
      like
      r/politicalhumor
      the
      general
      trend
      is
       #8220;hm
      yes
      it
      sounds
      good
      but
      how
      will
      you
      fund
      it?? #8221;
      Not
      only
      that,
      but
      while
      support
      for
      trump
      is
      limited
      strictly
      to
      right
      wing
      subs,
      support
      for
      liberal
      politicians
      that
      don #8217;t
      support
      this

      (Joe

      Buttegieg,
      John
      Delaney,

      Socialism
      -
      a
      system
      of
      government
      where
      the
      workers
      control
      the
      means
      of
      production
      in
      most
      major
      industries,
      represented
      by
      a
      vanguard
      party
      in
      government.
      The
      country
      uses
      a
      planned
      economy
      and
      democratic
      centralism
      to
      elect
      individuals
      to
      office,
      be
      it
      from
      the
      party
      or
      as
      independent
      candidates.
      Major
      industries
      are
      nationalised
      and
      owned
      by
      the
      combined
      workers,
      represented
      by
      the
      government.
      Socialism
      is
      the
      transition
      stage
      towards
      Communism.
      Liberalism
      -
      a
      capitalist
      system
      of
      government
      where
      the
      economy
      and
      most
      if
      not
      all
      means
      of
      productions
      is
      privately
      owned
      by
      individuals.
      While
      socially
      progressive,
      liberalism
      is
      economically
      conservative.
      The
      people
      are
      represented
      by
      elected
      officials
      in
      office
      by
      multi-party
      democratic
      liberalism.
      The
      government
      acts
      as
      a
      warden
      of
      the
      economy
      rather
      than
      a
      controller,
      leaving
      it
      vulnerable
      to
      collapse.
      Privatised
      economy
      means
      individual
      capitalists
      have
      more
      control
      over
      the
      people
      than
      the
      government.

      I
      thought
      the
      development
      of
      capitalism
      was
      a
      worldwide
      thing,
      especially
      considering
      we #8217;re
      reaching
      the
      point
      where
      it #8217;s
      going
      to
      literally
      devour
      the
      world.
      Though
      it
      is
      true
      that
      some
      countries
      aren #8217;t
      even
      close
      to
      capitalist
      development,
      I
      think
      America
      is
      pretty
      far
      down
      there
      too.

      The
      soviets
      (and
      Stalin
      personally)
      initially
      encouraged
      the
      communists
      to
      make
      a
      deal
      with
      the
      nationalists
      and
      form
      a
      united
      front
      against
      the
      Japanese,
      which
      the
      communists
      and
      nationalists
      promptly
      replied
      with
       #8220;fuck
      that #8221;.
      After
      the
      PLA
      successfully
      won
      in
      1949,
      the
      Soviet
      attitude
      changed
      and
      they
      began
      sending
      support,
      seeing
      Communist
      China
      as
      an
      opportunity
      to
      build
      a
      powerful
      ally,
      supplying
      a
      lot
      of
      guns/tanks/aircraft
      under
      lend-lease,
      as
      well
      as
      Soviet
      military
      and
      economic
      advisors.
      Personally,
      though,
      Stalin
      and
      Mao
      did
      not
      like
      each
      other
      -
      they
      met
      once,
      and
      Mao
      thought
      Stalin
      gave
      off
      an
       #8220;air
      of
      superiority #8221;,
      while
      Stalin
      thought
      Mao
      was
      a
      bit
      too
      much
      of
      an
      idealist,
      rather
      than
      Stalin,
      who
      favoured
      practicality.

      Republic
      of

      elections

      Any

      can
      run
      for
      office,
      and
      voting
      is
      mandatory.
      Individuals
      run
      for
      five
      year
      terms,
      where
      they
      then
      must
      stand
      for
      re-election
      -
      even
      Kim
      Jong-Un
      had
      to
      contest
      his
      seat
      111th
      Paektusan.
      While
      all
      political
      parties
      are
      allied
      with
      each
      other
      (the
      main
      3
      being
      the
      Worker #8217;s
      Party
      of
      Korea,
      the
      Korean

      in
      the

      change
      things
      -
      parties
      lose
      or
      win
      seats,
      just
      like
      other
      democracies.
      And
      as
      for
       #8220;this
      stage
      of
      communism #8221;,
      well:
      Communism
      is
      statelessness,
      classlessness
      and
      moneylessness.
      How
      it
      works
      is
      this:
      1.
      Workers
      seize
      state
      power
      in
      a
      revolution.
      The
      communist
      party
      operates
      government
      and
      state
      power
      on
      behalf
      of
      the
      workers.
      2.
      The
      state
      is
      used
      to
      safeguard
      the
      worker #8217;s
      revolt
      until
      world
      communism
      is
      achieved.
      This
      stage
      is
      called
      Socialism.
      3.
      One
      world
      communism
      is
      achieved
      and
      the
      revolution
      has
      been
      spread
      the
      world
      over,
      states
      and
      national
      barriers,
      classes
      and
      gradually,
      the
      money
      form,
      are
      abolished.
      Communism
      has
      been
      realised.
      Since
      world
      communism
      has
      not
      been
      realised
      yet,
      there
      is
      still
      a
      need
      for
      the
      socialist
      state
      to
      exist.
      Hence
      why
      the
      DPRK
      is
      vigilantly
      militant
      against..
      external
      aggressors.

      Yes
      I
      am
      Australian.
      Anyway:
      The
      DPRK
      and
      human
      rights
      is..
      difficult.
      They #8217;re
      a
      closed
      country,
      because
      they
      don #8217;t
      want
      certain
      information
      (particularly
      relating
      to
      the
      Defense
      of
      the
      country)
      getting
      out
      and
      certain
      information
      getting
      in,
      particularly
      the
      corporate
      totalitarianism
      of
      South
      Korea,
      or
      American
      Neoliberalism.
      That
      said,
      it
      makes
      it
      difficult
      to
      defer
      between
      what #8217;s
      anti-Korean
      propaganda
      and
      what #8217;s
      actually
      true.
      For
      example,
      the
      idea
      that
      everyone
      has
      to
      get
      the
      same
      haircut
      as
      Kim
      Jong-Un
      floated
      around
      in
      the
      early
      2010s,
      followed
      by
      another
      story
      that
      no
      one
      else
      was
      allowed
      to
      get
      his
      haircut
      -
      but
      was
      disproven
      when
      two
      Australian
      men
      traveled
      to
      the
      DPRK
      to
      get
      a
      haircut
      and
      found
      out
      that
      neither
      of
      those
      things
      were
      true.
      Additionally,
      many
      reports
      stating
      that
      certain
      DPRK
      officials
      had
      been
      executed
      in
      various
      elaborate
      James
      Bond
      villain
      style
      methods,
      from
      being
      torn
      to
      pieces
      by
      dogs
      to
      executed
      by
      anti-aircraft
      guns
      -
      only
      for
      these
      officials
      to
      show
      up,
      alive
      and
      well,
      sometimes
      literally
      the
      next
      day.
      In
      fact,
      if
      you
      think
      about
      that
      anti-aircraft
      thing
      for
      more
      than
      a
      few
      minutes
      and
      do
      some
      research
      of
      the
      DPRK #8217;s
      air
      forces
      -
      they
      don #8217;t
      even
      have
      any
      anti-aircraft
      guns,
      they
      mostly
      use
      surface-to-air
      missiles.
      Even
      if
      they
      had,
      say,
      AA
      guns
      mounted
      on
      battleships,
      why
      on
      earth
      would
      they
      go
      out
      of
      the
      way
      to
      execute
      someone
      with
      a
      battleship?
      Even
      so,
      there
      is
      no
      denying
      there
      are
      some
      issues
      in
      the
      DPRK
      -
      one
      incident
      that
      comes
      to
      mind
      was
      in
      2016
      when
      an
      American
      College
      Student
      named
      Otto
      Warmbier
      traveled
      to
      the
      DPRK
      for
      fun,
      went
      into
      restricted
      territory
      and
      stole
      a
      poster
      of
      Kim
      Jong-il,
      a
      big
      no-no
      in
      the
      DPRK.
      He
      was
      caught,
      arrested,
      tried
      and
      sentenced
      to
      15
      years #8217;
      imprisonment,
      before
      being
      released
      in
      2017
      following
      negotiations
      with
      the
      US.
      However,
      while
      imprisoned
      there
      he
      suffered
      an
      unspecified
      neurological
      injury
      and
      fell
      into
      a
      coma
      he
      never
      recovered
      from.
      The
      Koreans
      looked
      after
      him
      before
      handing
      him
      over
      to
      the
      US
      in
      July
      2017
      before
      dying
      six
      days
      later.
      How
      he
      got
      that
      injury
      in
      the
      first
      place
      is
      unknown,
      which
      obviously
      raises
      questions
      on
      whether
      or
      not
      he
      was
      tortured
      -
      there
      were
      no
      injuries
      on
      him,
      and
      he
      died
      from
      lack
      of
      oxygen
      to
      his
      brain.
      Something
      happened
      there.
      We
      don #8217;t
      know
      what.
      (The
      DPRK
      later
      paid
      $501m
      in
      damages.)
      On
      the
      other
      hand,
      there #8217;s
      a
      free
      40
      minute
      documentary
      titled
      [ #8220;Loyal
      Citizens
      of
      Pyongyang
      in
      Seoul #8221;](https://youtu.be/ktE_3PrJZO0),
      which
      details
      what
      life
      in
      the
      DPRK
      is
      like
      compared
      to
      the
      south
      using
      accounts
      from
      people
      who
      were
      born
      and
      raised
      in
      the
      DPRK
      but
      for
      some
      reason
      or
      another
      are
      forcibly
      being
      detained
      in
      the
      South.
      It #8217;s
      worth
      a
      watch
      and
      covers
      the
      human
      rights
      issue
      in
      detail.
      Tl;Dr,
      it #8217;s
      complicated
      but
      there #8217;s
      no
      denying
      some
      sketchy
      things
      have
      gone
      down
      on
      the
      other
      side
      of
      the
      DMZ.
      If
      I
      were
      you
      I #8217;d
      take
      the
      Koreans #8217;
      word
      for
      it.
      Oh,
      and
      think
      twice
      next
      time
      you
      hear
      a
      claim
      about
      North
      Korea.

      I
      suppose
      it #8217;d
      make
      an
      okay
      low-altitude
      SPAA..
      but
      it
      doesn #8217;t
      have
      that
      much
      of
      an
      elevation
      angle
      if
      I
      remember
      correctly.
      This
      thing
      is
      basically
      an
      M2A2
      with
      one
      turret,
      so
      I
      imagine

      could
      be
      useful
      but
      only
      in

      It #8217;s
      kind
      of
      disappointing
      the
      selection

      vehicles,
      especially
      after
      the
      50s

      heavy
      tanks,
      or
      the

      -
      how
      does
      a
      Type
      74
      with
      a
      120mm
      gun
      sound?
      It #8217;s
      good
      to
      see
      the
      iconic
      ones
      like
      the
      Gongchen
      Tank
      (Chi-Ha

      or
      Type

      course
      Type
      59
      and
      Type
      62
      -
      but
      this
      isn #8217;t
      all
      they
      could #8217;ve
      done.
      It

      been
      so
      much
      more

      then

      Maybe
      it #8217;s
      because
      Taiwan
      is
      only
      recognised
      as
      a
      legitimate
      state
      by
      14
      countries?
      And
      for
      all
      intents
      and
      purposes,
      Taiwan #8217;s
      case
      as
      a
      sovereign
      state
      stands
      as
       #8220;kind-of-but-not-really #8221;?
      To
      me
      this
      stands
      in
      the
      same
      vein
      and
      Gaijin
      not
      putting
      the
      Nazi
      flag
      for
      German
      vehicles.
      Obviously
      it
      should
      historically
      be
      there,
      but
      Germany
      doesn #8217;t
      allow
      it.
      Similarly,
      the
      PRC
      would
      like
      to
      maintain
      its
      image
      as
      the
      legitimate
      China
      it #8217;s
      spent
      the
      last
      70
      years
      building.
      I
      think
      the
      Nationalist
      flag
      should
      be
      there
      for
      lower-tier
      vehicles
      historically
      used
      by
      Nationalist
      China
      before
      the
      communist
      revolution,
      but
      I
      don #8217;t
      really
      see
      it
      as
      anything
      to
      get
      too
      worked
      up
      about.
      It #8217;s
      just
      a
      flag,
      after
      all.

      Hell
      of
      a
      way
      to
      dodge
      the
      question
      but
      okay
      Listen
      you #8217;re
      coming
      at
      this
      assuming
      you
      need
      those
      things
      in
      order
      to
      be
      free.
      You #8217;re
      also
      assuming
      the
      PRC
      doesn #8217;t
      have
      those.
      You
      guys
      have
      liberal
      democracy,
      they
      have
      centralised
      democracy.
      This
      isn #8217;t
      hard
      to
      understand
      because
      it #8217;s
      one
      of
      the
      most
      basic
      principles
      of
      communism,
      but
      if
      your
      head
      wasn #8217;t
      so
      far
      up
      Chiang
      Kai-Shek #8217;s
      Asshole
      you #8217;d
      know.
      As
      for
      freedom
      of
      speech,
      the
      PRC
      is
      tolerant
      enough
      to
      let
      neo-fascist
      parties
      exist
      (although
      they
      can #8217;t
      run
      for
      office,
      thank
      god),
      whereas
      Taiwan
      doesn #8217;t
      have
      any
      communist
      parties.
      Interesting.
      As
      for
      Japan,
      I #8217;m
      not
      confident
      enough
      to
      speak
      on
      politics
      there.
      As
      for
      South
      Korea,
      I
      don #8217;t
      like
      the
      idea
      of
      living
      under
      a
      corporate
      dictatorship
      where
      the
      government
      can #8217;t
      go
      more
      than
      five
      years
      without
      having
      the
      president
      do
      something
      illegal.
      Besides,
      you #8217;re
      from
      Taiwan.
      You
      guys
      chose
      to
      be
      capitalist.
      You
      can
      still
      buy
      the
      Taiwanese
      roundels
      and
      flags
      with
      GE.
      Isn #8217;t
      that
      exactly
      the
      kind
      of
      free-market
      stuff
      you
      guys
      want?

      cowards
      they
      send.
      Not
      even
      brave
      enough
      to
      go
      without
      a
      mask.

      And
      this
      is
      where
      every
      stereotype
      of
      communism
      is
      wrong.
      We
      know.
      We
      know
      about
      the
      Gulags.
      We
      know
      about
      the
      great
      purge
      and
      Tiananmen
      Square
      and
      the
      Xinjiang
      Region
      and
      all
      the
      other
      extrajudicial
      action
      taken
      against
      people
      who
      didn #8217;t
      deserve
      it.
      What
      we
      also
      see,
      however,
      is
      a
      shitload
      of
      bullshit
      that
      is
      objectively
      much
      worse
      than
      what
      we #8217;ve
      done.
      For
      example,
      Nationalist
      China
      repeatedly
      letting
      its
      own
      people
      starve
      to
      death
      for
      forty
      consecutive
      years,
      killing
      more
      than
      the
      PRC
      ever
      did
      -
      proving
      that
      Taiwan
      really
      is
      the
      only
      piece
      of
      land
      the
      KMT
      is
      fit
      to
      govern.
      Or
      the
      US
      sending
      advisors
      to
      the
      Hong
      Kong
      protests
      -
      what
      do
      you
      think
      would
      happen
      if
      China
      sent
      advisors
      to
      Black
      Lives
      Matter?
      It
      extends
      further
      than
      that,
      too.
      In
      2018
      Edward
      Maduro
      was
      re-elected
      in
      Venezuela
      and
      in
      January
      of
      this
      year
      opposition
      leader
      Juan
      Guaido
      tried
      to,
      with
      the
      full
      assistance
      of
      VP
      Mike
      Pence,
      stage
      a
      coup
      against
      him,
      continuing
      the
      US #8217;s
      long
      history
      of
      tearing
      down
      any
      government
      that
      refuses
      to
      bow
      to
      them,
      including
      in
      Korea,
      Greece,
      Iran,
      Iraq,
      Afghanistan,
      Vietnam,
      China,
      Australia,
      France,
      Libya,
      Cuba,
      the
      USSR,
      East
      Germany,
      Albania,
      and
      many,
      many
      more.
      Not
      only
      that,
      but
      the
      bloody
      legacy
      of
      the
      Banana
      Republics,
      colonialism
      and
      imperialism,
      the
      neo-imperialism.
      The
      fact
      that
      people
      still
      starve
      on
      the
      streets
      in
      the
      richest
      country
      on
      earth
      is
      wrong.
      Of
      course,
      China
      is,
      as
      liberal
      corporate
      shills
      say,
      problematic.
      Even
      so,
      if
      WW3
      goes
      down
      tomorrow,
      catch
      me
      defecting
      to
      the
      PLA
      instantly
      bc
      there
      is
      no
      way
      in
      hell
      I #8217;m
      siding

      So
      let
      me
      get
      this
      straight
      You
      support
      what
      communism
      did
      to
      your
      country
      And,

      if

      of
      citizens

      I..
      see.
      Well,
      that
      second
      paragraph
      is
      a
      whole
      lot
      of
      shit
      I #8217;m
      not
      even
      gonna
      bother
      trying
      to
      disprove
      Oh,
      by
      the
      way,
      Stalin
      didn #8217;t
      invent
      Gulags.
      They
      were
      originally
      called
       #8220;Katorgas #8221;
      and
      they
      first
      started
      popping
      up
      in
      the
      late
      1600s
      as
      penal
      colonies.
      Kinda
      like
      how
      Britain
      deported
      prisoners
      to
      Australia.
      Stalin
      escapes
      from
      Katorgas
      several
      times
      before
      the
      revolution.

      Hey
      my
      meme
      got
      shared
      again
      Remember
      kids,
      the
      Anarchists
      are
      absolutely
      unbearable
      and
      wrong
      about
      a
      lot
      of
      things
      but
      now
      is
      no
      time
      to
      pick
      our
      allies.
      A
      United
      Front
      is
      easily
      the
      best
      way
      to
      combat
      fascism
      and
      the
      oncoming
      capitalist
      climate
      extinction
      that
      we
      all
      face.
      The
      earth
      doesn #8217;t
      give
      a
      shit
      about
      our
      ideologies,
      so
      we
      should
      put
      aside
      our
      differences
      maybe
      just
      this
      once
      and
      unite
      against
      a
      common
      enemy.
      The
      debates
      can
      wait
      after
      we #8217;ve
      stopped
      climate
      change.
      For
      now,
      the
      enemy
      of
      my
      enemy
      is
      my
      friend.

      1945.
      It
      was
      led
      by
      Kim
      Il-Sung
      and,
      after
      American
      forces
      declared
      the
      government
      illegal
      (because

      do
      that,
      apparently)
      the
      PRK
      fled
      from
      Seoul
      north
      to
      Pyongyang,

      That #8217;s
      the
      key
      difference
      between
      communists
      (who
      support
      China)
      and
      the
      anarchists
      (I.e.
      Antifa,
      who
      support
      HK
      -
      also
      trotskyists).
      When
      a
      communist
      decides
      to
      support
      a
      movement,
      we
      analyse
      it
      on
      the
      basis
      of
      the
      movement #8217;s
      foundations:
      1)
      what
      is
      the
      movement
      a
      response
      to?
      2)
      what
      is
      the
      goals
      of
      the
      movement?
      3)
      who
      is
      leading/involved
      the
      movement,
      in
      classist
      terms?
      Why?
      4)
      what
      is
      the
      contextual
      situation
      of
      the
      movement?
      And
      so,
      with
      that
      analysis
      in
      mind,
      Communists
      support
      China
      as
      the
      HK
      riots
      are
      officially
      a
      response
      to
      the
      extradition
      bill
      but
      *unofficially*
      a
      response
      two
      decades
      of
      declining
      HK
      importance.
      In
      1949,
      HK
      made
      up
      40%
      of
      China #8217;s
      GDP.
      Now,
      largely
      in
      part
      to
      massive
      social
      and
      economic
      reforms
      by
      Mao
      Zedong,
      Deng
      Xiaoping
      and
      Xi
      Jinping,
      HK
      only
      comprises
      2%
      of
      China #8217;s
      GDP.
      Now,
      of
      course,
      a
      city
      declining
      in
      economic
      prosperity
      is
      nothing
      new.
      The
      logical
      step
      would
      be
      to
      just
      move
      to
      Dongguan
      or
      Shenzhen
      in
      mainland
      China,
      cities
      that
      are
      literally
      just
      up
      the
      road.
      But
      they
      won #8217;t
      do
      that.
      Why?
      Because
      when
      they
      were
      part
      of
      the
      British
      Empire
      they
      were
      important.
      China
      is
      low
      status,
      and
      they
      are
      high
      status.
      The
      British
      told
      them
      so.
      And
      their
      grandparents
      told
      their
      parents
      and
      they
      told
      the
      HK
      protestors.
      This
      is
      the
      climax
      of
      millennials
      realising
      that
      they #8217;re
      not
      the
      jade
      of
      the
      empire,
      they #8217;re
      Chinese.
      They #8217;re
      not
      any
      more
      special
      than
      any
      other
      city
      in
      China.
      It #8217;d
      be
      like
      San
      Francisco
      protesting
      against
      the
      US
      two
      decades
      after
      being
      released
      from
      the
      Japanese
      Empire.
      But
      no,
      apparently,
      life
      is
      not
      worth
      living
      if
      you
      don #8217;t
      get
      a
      50sqft
      apartment
      with
      a
      Filipino
      maid.
      And
      so,
      Communists
      determine
      that
      the
      HK
      movement
      is
      not
      a
      movement
      of
      the
      workers
      -
      especially
      considering
      that
      they
      oftentimes
      commit
      actions
      that
      are
      contradictory
      to
      the
      interests
      of
      the
      workers.
      So,
      they
      support
      China.
      Anarchists
      on
      the
      other
      hand
      support
      anything
      that
      opposes
      government,
      so
      they
      support
      HK.
      I
      cannot
      stress
      enough
      that
      this
      movement
      is
      not
      left-wing.
      Neoliberal
      colonial
      LARPing
      is
      not
      leftist.
      Yes,
      the
      anarchists
      support
      them
      but
      these
      are
      the
      guys
      who #8217;ve
      had
      about
      four
      revolutions
      and
      haven #8217;t
      succeeded
      once.
      So,
      to
      quote
      It #8217;s
      always
      sunny
      in
      Philadelphia:
       #8220;Disregard
      that
      Frank,
      it #8217;s
      a
      bunch
      of
      Neoliberal
      bullshit #8221;

      Yes..
      yes
      it
      does.
      The
      workers
      do
      the
      work.
      They
      create
      and
      sell
      products
      and
      services,
      generating
      money
      for
      the
      business.
      Since
      they
      make
      the
      money,
      it
      should
      belong
      to
      them.
      Consider
      a
      gold
      mine:
      the
      boss
      does
      not
      mine
      the
      gold,
      the
      boss
      does
      not
      mill
      the
      gold,
      nor
      does
      he
      process
      or
      sell
      the
      gold,
      but
      for
      some
      reason
      the
      gold
      belongs
      to
      him.
      Or,
      Amazon #8217;s
      Jeff
      Bezos.
      He
      does
      not
      work
      the
      factory
      floor.
      He
      does
      not
      supervise
      the
      production
      of
      products,
      he
      does
      not
      drive
      the
      trucks
      to
      ship
      the
      products
      or
      make
      sure
      the
      website
      is
      still
      working.
      But
      by
      some
      weird
      alchemy,
      all
      the
      money
      for
      this
      business,
      which
      is
      created
      by
      workers
      and
      workers
      alone,
      belongs
      to
      him.

      Most
      Wehrmacht
      Soldiers
      were
      just

      -
      as
      I

      they

      Even

      doesn #8217;t
      excuse
      their

      You
      mean,
      like,
      economic
      recessions?
      It #8217;d
      be
      worth
      a
      shot.
      Economic
      conditions
      obviously
      play
      a
      major
      role
      in
      convincing
      people
      to
      support
      us.
      With
      the
      nature
      of
      Capitalism,
      there
      are
      always
      going
      to
      be
      people
      who
      will
      be
      at
      the
      bottom,
      who
      will
      be
      the
      most
      severely
      affected
      by
      material
      conditions.
      They
      are
      easy
      to
      convince
      because
      of
      that,
      more
      open
      to
      the
      idea
      that
      there
      is
      a
      way
      out
      for
      them
      and
      everyone
      else.
      During
      recessions,
      class
      lines
      become
      blatantly
      obvious
      -
      proletarians
      are
      the
      most
      severely
      affected,
      whereas
      the
      bourgeoisie
      are
      seldom
      hurt
      -
      there
      are
      more
      people
      on
       #8220;the
      bottom #8221;,
      more
      vulnerable,
      the
      illusion
      of
      capitalist
      freedom
      and
      security
      is
      destroyed.
      During
      this
      time,
      it #8217;d
      be
      moronic
      to
      pass
      up
      the
      opportunity
      to
      radicalise
      people.
      We
      could
      show
      them
      how
      they #8217;re
      being
      exploited,
      why
      and
      how
      it
      happened,
      and
      how
      such
      things
      are
      impossible
      under
      Socialism.

      Alright:
      Reasons
      for
      the
      Collapse
      of
      the
      USSR
      are
      many
      and
      not
      that
      simple.
      The
      main
      points
      you
      should
      focus
      on
      for
      you
      essay
      are:
      -
      the
      effects
      of
      Brezhnev #8217;s
       #8220;Era
      of
      Stagnation #8221;
      on
      the
      Soviet
      economy
      -
      the
      short-sightedness
      of
      Gorbachev #8217;s
      policies
      of
      Glasnost,
      Perestroika
      and
      Democratziya
      -
      the
      effects
      of
      the
      Afghan
      War
      -
      lack
      of
      unity
      in
      the
      Communist
      Party,
      split
      between
      support
      for/against
      Gorbachev
      (particularly
      after
      1987)
      -
      the
      role
      of
      Reagan,
      forcing
      the
      USSR
      to
      stay
      in
      Afghanistan
      and
      support
      the
      Saur
      Government
      while
      the
      USA
      supported
      Islamic
      terrorists
      (including
      Osama
      Bin
      Laden)
      -
      Post-Soviet
      support
      for
      the
      USSR
      -
      there
      are
      countless
      videos,
      articles
      and
      other
      media
      that
      indicate
      just
      how
      much
      the
      populace
      of
      the
      former
      USSR
      long
      for
      its
      return.
      You
      should
      be
      able
      to
      find
      them
      relatively
      easily.
      -
      The
      Times
      where
      the
      Socialist
      System
      succeeded
      under
      Stalin
      (and,
      to
      an
      extent,
      under
      Kruschev),
      it #8217;s
      strengths,
      advantages
      over
      capitalism,
      and
      mistakes
      made
      by
      the
      Soviet
      leaders
      Hope
      this
      helps

      Sorry
      comrades,
      I
      had
      to
      go
      graduate
      high
      school.
      I
      decided
      not
      to
      plug
      my
      channel
      because,
      well,
      as
      Jacksfilms
      put
      it
      -
       #8220;if
      you #8217;re
      promoting
      your
      own
      channel
      in
      the
      comments,
      well
      it #8217;s
      not
      really
      a
      comment
      anymore #8221;.
      [This
      one](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6sFuUD13dV7a9-7BlQQNPg?view_as=subscriber)
      is
      my
      main
      channel
      -
      mostly
      games,
      and
      [this
      one](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3U6iIrqhrRTeltrxeUMllA)
      is
      my
      second
      -
      Right
      now
      it's
      just
      a
      few
      communist
      memes,
      but
      I
      hope
      to
      turn
      it
      into
      a
      Hbomberguy-esque
      communist
      channel.

      crews
      would
      usually
      find
      T-26,
      T-28,
      T-70
      etc.
      However,
      on
      the
      rare
      occasions
      a
      T-34
      or
      KV-1
      (or
      dare
      I
      say,
      KV-2)
      tank
      was
      encountered
      the
      response
      from
      the
      Germans
      was
      usually
      a
      panicked
       #8220;OH
      GOD
      WHY
      ISNT
      IT
      DYING
      *SHOOT
      IT
      FASTER*
      ***AAAAAHHHHH!!!*** #8221;
      A
      good
      example
      of
      this
      is
      the
      Battle
      of
      Raseinai,
      where
      a
      lone
      KV-2
      held
      its
      own
      against
      an
      entire
      panzer
      division
      for
      a
      full
      day,
      unsupported,
      before
      getting
      knocked
      out.
      Early
      on
      though,
      the
      T-34
      and
      KV-1
      respectively
      weren #8217;t
      very
      good
      tanks,
      suffering
      from
      a
      number
      of
      teething
      problems
      as
      a
      result
      of
      the
      Soviets
      being
      forced
      to
      favour
      quantity
      over
      quality.
      Fortunately,
      these
      problems
      were
      designed
      to
      be
      remedied
      relatively
      easily
      with
      field
      repairs,
      and
      so
      weren #8217;t
      really
      that
      much
      of
      a
      concern.
      Much
      of
      the
      KV-1 #8217;s
      faults
      were
      ironed
      out
      with
      the
      KV-1S,
      and
      the
      T-34-85
      mod.
      1944
      fixed
      much
      of
      the
      problems
      in
      the
      earlier
      T-34
      models.
      The
      IS-2
      mod.
      1944,
      in
      my
      opinion,
      is
      the
      pinnacle
      of
      Soviet
      heavy
      tank
      engineering.
      It
      could
      easily
      stand
      against
      even
      the
      toughest
      German
       #8220;big
      cats #8221;,
      even
      though
      it
      mostly
      fought
      Panzer
      IV
      tanks
      and
      fortress
      installations.
      Obviously,
      these
      were
      no
      match
      for
      the
      122mm
      D-25T

      Estonia
      was

      The
      difference
      being
      the
      Americans
      tend
      to
      do
      it
      more
      secretly.
      Living
      in
      Australia,
      sure
      -
      we #8217;re
      not
      *directly*
      controlled
      by
      America
      -
      but
      our
      media
      and
      press
      is
      owned
      by
      Americans.
      US
      military
      bases
      don #8217;t
      directly
      control
      the
      army,
      but
      they
      do
      heavily
      influence
      it.
      American
      corporations
      don #8217;t
      control
      the
      government,
      by
      lobbyists
      heavily
      influence
      it
      to
      suit
      their
      needs
      -
      and
      the
      needs
      of
      the
      US.
      We
      are,
      for
      all
      intents
      and
      purposes,
      an
      American
      puppet.
      Sure,
      the
      soviets
      did
      some
      bad
      things.
      Maybe
      annexing
      the
      Baltics
      was
      one
      of
      them.
      But
      at
      least
      they
      don #8217;t
      stage
      illegal
      wars
      and
      coups
      wherever
      they
      feel
      like
      it.
      Like
      that
      time
      in
      1975
      the
      CIA
      remover
      Gough
      Whitlam
      from
      power
      and
      replaced
      him
      with
      someone
      they
      liked
      -
      all
      because
      he
      opposed
      American
      control
      over
      us.
      At
      least
      the
      soviets
      didn #8217;t
      do
      that.

      As
      an
      Australian
      Communist,
      I
      feel
      you.
      We #8217;re
      essentially
      an
      American
      puppet
      and
      the
      amount
      of
      sinophobic
      fear
      mongering
      is
      sickening.
      The
      Americans
      are
      the
      epitome
      of
      r/selfawarewolves.
      Everything
      is
      bad
      evil
      fascism,
      unless
      they #8217;re
      the
      ones
      doing
      it.
      I
      am
      looking
      forward
      to
      seeing
      the
      US
      faceplant
      into
      another
      economic
      collapse
      and
      see
      the
      PRC
      emerge
      victorious
      in
      the
      current
      trade
      war.

      Personally
      I
      think
      in
      the
      future
      we #8217;ll
      rely
      on
      public
      transport
      a
      lot
      more
      -
      buses,
      trams
      and
      trains
      will
      be
      the
      commonplace
      standard,
      while
      cars
      and
      trucks
      will
      still
      exist,
      albeit
      in
      much
      less
      numbers
      than
      now.
      Like
      you #8217;d
      use
      public
      transportation
      to
      get
      to
      and
      from
      work,
      or
      to
      go
      out
      or
      whatever
      -
      basically
      it #8217;d
      be
      your
      main
      mode
      of
      transportation.
      If
      you
      need
      to
      get
      somewhere
      specific,
      you #8217;d
      use
      a
      car
      or
      something
      like
      that.

      FYI,
      you
      don #8217;t
      need
      to
      do
      crime
      to
      get
      guns
      in
      Australia.
      While
      fully
      automatic
      weapons
      are
      banned
      (no
      Kalashnikov
      pattern
      rifles
       #128532;),
      you
      can
      still
      get
      a
      semi-automatic
      rifle
      with
      certain
      permits
      and
      certain
      conditions.
      Handguns
      are
      banned
      (unless
      your
      job
      requires
      you
      to
      have
      one,
      i.e.
      security
      guard),
      and
      Shotguns
      are
      also
      allowed,
      again,
      with
      certain
      conditions.
      On
      the
      plus
      side,
      you
      don #8217;t
      need
      a
      license
      for
       #8220;antique
      rifles #8221;,
      i.e.
      anything
      designed
      before
      January
      1
      1900
      (excluding
      revolvers).
      Which
      fortunately
      means
      Mosin
      rifles
      are
      fair
      game.
      We
      don #8217;t
      have
      a
      SRA
      chapter
      here,
      but

      I
      said
      that
      in
      another
      comment,
      this
      is
      mostly
      memeing
      seeing
      as
      guns
      aren #8217;t
      exactly
      as
      common
      here
      and
      the
      average
      person
      probably
      doesn #8217;t
      know
      how
      to
      get
      one.
      I
      certainly
      didn #8217;t
      until
      I
      became
      a
      communist.
      I
      thought
      you
      had
      to
      do
      some
      black
      magic
      voodoo
      shit
      to
      get
      one

      Thanks,
      Comrade.
      I
      also
      think
      it #8217;d
      be
      best
      for
      everyone
      that
      even
      in
      organising
      communist
      militia
      we
      should
      be
      as
      clean
      and
      legal
      as
      possible.
      Who
      knows,
      maybe
      we
      could
      get
      some
      Category
      C
      rifles
      if
      we
      set
      up
      an
      Australian
      SRA
      and
      call
      it
      a
      collector #8217;s
      organisation.
      Even
      so,
      it #8217;s
      better
      off
      staying
      as
      within
      the
      law
      as
      possible.

      I #8217;ve
      read
      a
      lot
      of
      bad
      takes
      on
      communism
      on
      this
      site.
      A
      lot
      of
      them
      are
      incredibly
      bad,
      people
      who
      either
      have
      no
      idea
      what
      communism
      is
      or
      think
      that
      it
      is
      something
      despite
      having
      no
      evidence
      whatsoever
      to
      back
      themselves
      up.
      But
      this
      This
      is
      the
      dumbest
      shit
      I #8217;ve
      ever
      read
      The
      fact
      that
      another
      conscious
      human
      being
      typed
      out
      these
      words
      boggles
      the
      mind
      It
      puzzles
      me
      further
      that
      you
      thought
      your
      little
      remark
      was
      smart
      enough
      to
      post
      online
      I
      am
      nonreligious
      but
      this
      comment
      has
      made
      me
      question
      wether
      or
      not
      there
      is
      a
      god
      and
      why
      in
      fuck
      he
      would
      he
      allow
      someone
      to
      say
      something
      so
      utterly
      wrong,
      so
      completely
      devoid
      of
      substance,
      so
      fully
      incorrect
      -
      your
      stupidity
      prompts
      questions
      more
      valuable
      than
      your
      own
      words.
      I
      am
      not
      a
      religious
      or
      spiritual
      person,
      nor
      am
      i
      an
      atheist,
      but
      if
      such
      a
      moronic
      take
      as
      yours
      can
      be
      allowed
      to
      be
      uttered
      then
      I
      am
      assured
      There
      is
      no
      god

      the

      unlawfully
      invaded
      another
      country
      on
      one
      hand.
       #8203;
      The
      Soviet
      Union
      supported
      popular
      uprisings
      and
      liberation
      movements.
      The
      United
      States
      supported
      literal
      fascists.

      The
      Soviet
      invasion
      of
      Hungary
      and
      Czechoslovakia
      was
      bad.
      However,
      the
      Soviets
      supporting
      the
      Viet
      Cong
      against
      the
      genocidal
      actions
      of
      the
      US
      army
      is
      good.
      The
      Soviets
      supporting
      democratically-elected
      Salvador
      Allende
      is
      good.
      The
      US
      supporting
      fascist
      dictator
      Augusto
      Pinochet's
      coup
      is
      bad.
      The
      Soviet
      supporting
      Fidel
      Castro
      overthrowing
      slavery
      in
      Cuba
      is
      good.
      The
      US
      supporting
      Batista
      trying
      to
      reinstate
      slavery
      in
      Cuba
      is
      bad.
      The

      African
      National
      Congress
      against
      the

      Regime

      and
      the
      US
      supporting
      the
      Apartheid
      Regime
      is
      bad.
      The

      supporting
      the
      Pathet
      Lao
      against
      an
      Absolute
      Monarchy
      is

      crimes
      to
      reinstate
      a
      dictator

      Saur
      Revolution
      against
      the
      Muhadijeen
      is
      good,
      and
      the
      US
      supporting
      *literal
      fucking
      terrorists
      -*
      the
      same
      terrorists
      that
      betrayed
      you,
      bombed
      the
      twin
      towers
      and
      committed
      or
      inspired
      untold
      numbers
      of
      terrorist
      attacks
      across
      the
      world
      -
      is
      bad.
      This
      is
      not
      a
      "one
      side
      supported
      a
      coup
      but
      other
      side
      also
      support
      coup,
      therefore
      both
      sides
      bad".
      You
      are
      falsely
      assuming
      that
      all
      ideas
      and
      ideologies
      are
      good
      because
      they're
      in
      charge
      and
      legal.
      They're
      not.
      Apartheid
      was
      legal.
      The
      Holocaust
      was
      legal.
      Slavery
      was
      legal.
      Under
      your
      logic,
      it's
      bad
      for
      the
      USSR
      to
      support
      uprisings
      against
      those
      things.
      This
      is
      the
      USA
      supporting
      nothing
      short
      of
      fascism
      in
      an
      attempt
      to
      "own
      the
      commies",
      and
      the
      USSR
      supporting
      literally
      any
      political
      movement
      that
      aimed
      to
      do
      literally
      anything
      else,
      case
      in
      point,
      their
      support
      for
      non-communist
      movements
      in
      Africa
      against
      white
      minority
      governments.
      Throughout
      the
      cold
      war,
      both
      the
      USSR
      and
      USA
      did
      bad
      things
      in
      their
      war
      against
      each
      other.
      But
      to
      turn
      a
      blind
      eye,
      shift
      the
      blame
      or
      deny
      the
      gigantic
      amount
      of
      atrocities
      committed
      by
      the
      United
      States
      compared
      to
      the
      Soviet
      Union
      is
      to
      show
      that
      you
      are
      either
      historically
      illiterate,
      ignorant,
      or
      supportive
      of
      the
      atrocities
      committed
      by
      the
      US
      -
      or
      all
      three.
      Knowing
      Americans,
      you
      probably
      are.

      as
      well
      as
      invading
      other
      countries
      and
      subjugating,
      killing
      and
      starving
      millions
      more.
      Communists
      brought
      up
      their
      lands
      from
      ruins,
      supported

      they
      could
      to
      make
      life
      better
      for
      everyone.
      While
      they
      did
      kill
      some
      people
      -
      fascists
      -
      they
      overall
      did
      things
      for
      the
      greater
      good.
      Fascists
      would
      not

      that.
      Fascists
      have
      done
      everything
      in
      their
      power
      to
      make
      life
      hell
      on

      All
      Fascists
      deserve
      death.

      a
      few
      disagreements
      on
      when
      WW2

      it
      was
      1937,
      when
      Japan
      invaded

      Others
      say
      1939,
      when
      Germany
      invaded
      Poland.
      Some
      say
      it
      was
      1941,
      when
      Germany
      invaded
      the
      USSR.
      No

      says

      Mozambique
      is
      a
      country
      on
      the
      east
      coast
      of
      Africa.
      It
      was
      ruled
      as
      a
      colony
      of
      Portugal
      while
      the
      latter
      was
      a
      fascist
      dictatorship,
      becoming
      free
      in
      1975.
      It
      became
      a
      Marxist-Leninist
      state
      that
      same
      year,
      but
      fell
      into
      a
      bloody
      civil
      war
      between
      the
      government
      and
      far-right
      white
      supremacist
      militias
      backed
      by
      Apartheid
      South
      Africa
      in
      1978
      until
      1990,
      which
      largely
      drained
      the
      country
      and
      destroyed
      its
      infrastructure.
      It
      never
      fully
      recovered
      and
      the
      Marxist
      Government
      collapsed
      in
      1992.

      Well,
      obviously
      it
      wasn't
      Communist
      -
      Communism
      is
      classlessness,
      statelessness,
      moneylessness
      etc,
      it's
      something
      the
      world
      achieves,
      not
      one
      country.
      However,
      I
      do
      staunchly
      believe
      that
      the
      USSR
      was
      socialist.
      [Towards
      a
      new
      Socialism](http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/socialism_book/new_socialism.pdf)
      explains
      this
      quite
      well.
      Even
      so,
      we
      all
      agree
      that
      the
      USSR
      was
      way
      better
      than
      the
      US.

      alignment?
      Well,
      you'll
      see.
      I'm
      graduated
      from
      High
      School
      now,
      but
      in
      my
      Modern
      History
      there
      were
      a
      few
      outspoken
      students
      with
      clear
      political
      alignments
      -
      myself
      included.
      These
      were
      mostly
      kept
      to
      Modern
      History,
      as
      we
      studied
      the
      USSR
      and
      Cold
      War
      there
      were
      clear
      political
      factions
      in
      the
      class.
      Now
      in
      History
      there
      was
      this
      guy
      who
      was
      quiet
      but
      well
      spoken
      -
      he
      didn't
      align
      with
      any
      faction
      in
      particular,
      he
      just
      kept
      to
      the
      classwork.
      He
      was
      a
      nice
      kid,
      relatively
      well
      liked
      by
      everyone.
      He
      never
      got
      involved
      in
      political
      discussions,
      but
      one
      day
      in
      History
      we
      tried
      to
      test
      him.
      In
      Modern
      History
      there
      were
      four
      main
      class
      factions
      -
      we'll
      call
      them
      "Warsaw
      Pact",
      which
      meant
      me,
      the
      class
      Communist,
      my
      DemSoc
      friend
      and
      other
      left-leaning
      classmates,
      "NATO",
      which
      meant
      an
      almost-but-not-quite-alt-right
      guy
      and
      his
      followers,
      and
      the
      "Non-Aligned
      Movement",
      which
      was
      everyone
      who
      was
      just
      in
      the
      class
      to
      pass
      it
      and
      didn't
      care
      about
      politics
      -
      which
      included
      our
      centrist
      friend.
      One
      day,
      we
      were
      taking
      the
      [Political
      Compass
      test](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t amp;rct=j amp;q= amp;esrc=s amp;source=web amp;cd=1 amp;cad=rja amp;uact=8 amp;ved=2ahUKEwjLtIm1oPrkAhUBjeYKHcewApYQFjAAegQIBxAC amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.politicalcompass.org%2F amp;usg=AOvVaw0qAyb0N-s-SkKCIHDME8k2)
      and
      comparing
      our
      scores,
      and
      decided
      to
      test
      our
      centrist
      friend.
      Now,
      he
      didn't
      identify
      as
      a
      centrist
      -
      he
      didn't
      identify
      as
      anything.
      Nevertheless,
      we
      made
      him
      take
      the
      test.
      Lo
      and
      behold,
      his
      score
      was
      almost
      perfectly
      centrist
      -
      he
      scored
      dead
      set
      in
      the
      center,
      only
      one
      pixel
      to
      the
      left.
      How
      one
      even
      achieves
      such
      a
      result
      is
      beyond
      me
      -
      my
      DemSoc
      friend
      and
      I
      thought
      it
      just
      translated
      to
      "not
      having
      a
      political
      opinion".
      He
      had
      no
      strong
      feelings
      one
      way
      or
      another,
      literally.
      According
      to
      him,
      "yeah,
      people
      should
      get
      healthcare
      and
      stuff
      but
      like
      if
      people
      wanna
      get
      rich,
      so
      be
      it,
      you
      know?"
      He
      didn't
      think
      Antifa
      were
      Nazis,
      although
      he
      didn't
      approve
      of
      their
      use
      of
      violence.
      He
      identified
      as
      Neutral
      on
      the
      subject
      of
      WW1
      and
      the
      Russian
      Civil
      War,
      but
      sided
      with
      the
      Allies
      in
      WW2,
      as
      a
      true
      anti-extremist
      centrist
      -
      "didn't
      the
      soviets
      do
      some
      war
      crimes
      too?"
      "Well
      yes,
      they
      did
      some,
      but
      the
      Nazis
      did
      way
      more
      and
      way
      worse
      ones"
      "Oh
      okay"
      This
      kid
      was,
      for
      all
      intents
      and
      purposes,
      the
      true
      centrist
      to
      rule
      them
      all.
      "Yeah,
      trump's
      bad,
      but
      like
      didn't
      hillary
      do
      some
      bad
      stuff
      too?"
      "Well,
      yes,
      she
      did.
      They're
      both
      corpratist
      cunts."
      "Yeah,
      I
      thought
      so."
      Whenever
      someone
      proclaims
      themselves
      to
      be
      centrist,
      I
      will
      always
      think
      back
      to
      him.
      Centrism
      doesn't
      mean
      "dae
      Antifa
      are
      the
      real
      nazis",
      it
      means
      "Healthcare
      is
      cool,
      but
      it
      should
      be
      economically
      feasible,
      you
      know?"

      Japan
      hated
      the
      Nazis
      too,
      and
      only
      really
      allied
      with
      them
      for
      military
      reasons.
      There
      are
      several
      accounts
      of
      Japanese
      officials
      giving
      away
      thousands
      of
      Visas
      to
      European
      Jews.
      In
      fact,
      pretty
      much
      every
      member
      of
      the
      Axis
      completely
      disregarded
      the
      notion
      of
       #8220;Aryan
      Superiority #8221;
      and
      Jewish
      degeneracy,
      even
      going
      so
      far
      as
      to
      refusing
      to
      hand
      over
      Jews
      in
      their
      territories.
      This
      doesn #8217;t
      excuse
      the
      Japanese
      war
      crimes,
      though.

      No,
      this
      fucker
      is
      from
      everyone #8217;s
      favourite
      British
      colony:
      Hong
      Kong!
      He
      also
      claims
      that
      the
      1959
      famine
      killed
      45
      million
      people
      (about
      10m
      above
      what
      most
      historians
      estimate),
      and
      that
      it
      was
      entirely
      Mao #8217;s
      fault.
      Some
      have
      described
      his
      book
      on
      the
      famine
      as
       #8220;bent
      on
      proving
      a
      preconceived
      bias
      rather
      than
      a
      legitimate
      historical
      analysis #8221;,
      so
      I
      think
      that #8217;s
      all
      you
      really
      need
      to
      know
      about
      him.

      rise
      up).
      So
      as
      we
      can
      see
      here,
      this
      sub
      has
      an
      overwhelming
      right-wing
      slant
      (liberalism
      is
      not
      left,
      fight
      me).
      There
      is
      also
      a
      considerable
      centrist
      (Social
      Democrat)
      populace
      as
      well.
      The
      most
      prominent
      left-wing
      ideology
      is
      Communism/Socialism,
      and
      this
      sub
      has
      a
      considerable
      amount
      of
      libertarians
      as
      well.
      There
      were
      a
      few
      strange
      ones,
      like
      that
      one
      guy
      who
      went
      on
      about
      the
      USS
      Liberty
      and
      wanted
      to
       #8220;gas
      the
      k**** #8221;,
      calling
      Boomers
       #8220;blue-pulled
      cucks #8221;,
      whatever
      that #8217;s
      supposed
      to
      mean,
      and
      advocated
      for
      punishing
      people
      for..
      masturbating.
      Basically
      a
      really
      anti-Semitic
      Puritan.
      There
      were
      a
      few
      Nazis,
      one
      guy
      who
      unironically
      claimed
      to
      be
      a
      monarchist,
      two
      who
      answered
      as
       #8220;anarcho-primitivist #8221;,
      an
      AnCap
      and
      some
      guy
      who
      said
      he
      was
      an
      Anarchist
      NazBol.
      How
      those
      ideologies
      would
      work
      together
      is
      beyond
      me,
      but
      alright.
      I
      think
      the
      best
      response,
      imo,
      was
      someone
      who
      said
       #8220;Imma
      make
      Mao
      Zedong
      look
      like

      There #8217;s
      a
      difference:
      Anarchists
      want
      to
      abolish
      government
      in
      favour
      of
      communal
      citizens #8217;
      councils,
      essentially.
      Rather
      than
      one
      overarching
      centralised
      government,
      there #8217;s
      communities
      with
      their
      own
      mini-governments
      that
      work
      together
      on
      the
      basis
      of
      mutual
      assistance
      and
      sharing.
      There
      is
      no
      state
      -
      no
      borders,
      no
      military,
      and
      unlike
      communism,
      no
      centralised
      government.
      This
      is
      a
      stark
      contrast
      to
      Communists,
      who
      believe
      in
      Centralised
      Government
      in
      what
      is
      initially
      an
      Authoritarian
      State,
      but
      as
      Communism
      spreads
      all
      over
      the
      world,
       #8220;withers
      away #8221;
      until
      the
      state
      is
      abolished.
      At
      the
      end,
      after
      the
      transition
      from
      Socialism
      is
      completed,
      when
      Communism
      has
      been
      achieved,
      there
      is
      still
      a
      centralised
      government,
      but
      large
      amounts
      of
      Autonomy
      has
      been
      granted
      to
      individuals
      -
      such
      as
      the
      formation
      of
      democratic
      workers #8217;
      councils.
      In
      comparison,
      right-wing
      libertarians,
      as
      I
      understand
      them,
      only
      want
      less
      government
      as
      they
      believe
      that
      less
      government
      interference
      of
      the
      free
      market
      will
      bring
      greater
      prosperity..
      for
      some
      reason.
      A
      stark
      contrast
      to
      left
      libertarians,
      who
      advocate
      for
      a
      socialist
      government
      but
      greater
      degrees
      of
      worker
      autonomy
      (collectivisation,
      workers #8217;
      councils).
      Indeed,
      less
      government
       #8800;
      further
      left,
      but
      Communism
      is
      not
      further
      left
      from
      Anarchism.

      Indonesia
      had
      a
      socialist
      thing
      going,
      but
      then
      they
      got
      crushed..
      Yeah,
      it #8217;s
      pretty
      disappointing.
      Lenin
      hoped
      the
      Australian
      Labor
      party
      would
      one
      day
      be
      more
      like
      a
      Labour
      Party
      in
      the
      sense
      of,
      like,
      the
      Albanian
      Party
      of
      Labour
      but
      instead
      they
      just
      went
      full
      SocDem.
      I
      still
      think
      we
      Australians
      can
      break
      away
      from
      American
      influence
      if
      we
      try.
      Socialism
      is
      possible,
      it
      just
      needs
      a
      bit
      more
      time,
      although
      getting
      our
      largely
      apolitical
      population
      to
      care
      about
      overthrowing
      the
      bourgeoisie
      is
      gonna
      be
      a
      challenge.

      does
      he

      During

      and
      70s
      Mao
      Zedong
      of

      encouraged
      peasant
      communities
      to
      exact
      revenge
      against
      landlords
      by
      forcibly
      seizing
      land
      for
      themselves
      and
      refusing
      to
      pay
      rent.
      Some
      50,000
      landlords
      died
      because
      of
      this,
      and
