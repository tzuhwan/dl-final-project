      I'm
      on
      mobile
      so
      I
      apologize
      for
      formatting.
      Also
      it's
      long.
      Potentially
      triggering
      for
      self
      harm
      and
      suicide
      ideation.
      I'm
      terrified
      of
      putting
      this
      on
      here
      but
      I'm
      so
      lost
      and
      desperate.
      My
      psychologist
      has
      said
      he
      thinks
      my
      dad
      is
      a
      narcissist
      based
      on
      what
      I've
      told
      him
      and
      I
      agree,
      but
      it's
      really
      hard
      to
      say
      that.
      It's
      like
      my
      dad
      is
      two
      different
      people,
      but
      no
      matter
      which
      side
      he's
      showing
      he
      manipulates
      emotions,
      reactions,
      and
      actual
      memories.
      He
      thinks
      nothing
      is
      his
      fault
      and
      it's
      everyone
      else.
      He
      doesn't
      seem
      to
      realize
      he's
      doing
      this
      but
      has
      complained
      about
      my
      mom
      doing
      the
      same
      things.
      She's
      a
      different
      story.
      Anyway,
      I'm
      30
      but
      have
      been
      hit
      financially
      and
      unable
      to
      stabilize
      my
      mental
      health
      and
      life
      so
      I've
      been
      living
      with
      him
      for
      about
      2
      years.
      I'm
      living
      on
      eggshells.
      He/it's
      worse
      even
      when
      I've
      told
      him
      I'm
      suicidal
      and
      self
      harming,
      he
      shows
      compassion
      and
      then
      completely
      changes
      and
      will
      make
      it
      all
      about
      him
      and
      his
      feelings
      and
      deny
      mine.
      He's
      begun
      crying
      when
      he's
      upset
      and
      I
      very
      much
      care
      about
      taking
      care
      of
      other
      people's
      feelings.
      I'm
      back
      to
      hating
      him
      but
      I
      can't
      confront
      him
      because
      he'll
      just
      turn
      it
      against
      me
      and
      I'm
      also
      afraid
      he'll
      threaten
      or
      do
      suicide.
      He
      said
      years
      ago
      he's
      thought
      about
      it
      and
      tasted
      his
      gun
      before
      but
      can't
      do
      that
      to
      his
      kids.
      I
      don't
      see
      how
      he
      can
      be
      so
      blind
      to
      himself
      and
      everyone
      around
      him.
      I'm
      tired
      of
      living
      like
      this
      and
      feel
      like
      I'm
      going
      to
      explode.
      Any
      advice
      as
      to
      how
      to
      handle
      talking
      to
      him
      about
      stuff?
      I
      usually
      just
      shut
      down
      because
      I
      go
      into
      spiraling
      loops
      of
      explosive
      emotions.

      I'm
      sorry
      if
      this
      is
      the
      wrong
      sub,
      I'm
      just
      an
      incredibly
      awkward
      person
      with
      very
      little
      social
      skills
      in
      some
      situations.
      This
      situation
      is
      uncomfortable
      and
      crazy
      for
      me.
      A
      gentleman
      gave
      me
      his
      number
      when
      I
      was
      shopping,
      he's
      an
      employee
      there
      and
      he
      seemed
      really
      nice.
      I've
      not
      texted
      him
      in
      two
      days
      because
      I'm
      honestly
      scared
      and
      have
      no
      idea
      what
      to
      do
      in
      this
      situation.
      I'm
      not
      good
      at
      communicating
      or
      reading
      social
      cues.
      I
      have
      no
      idea
      how
      to
      flirt
      or
      recognize
      it,
      I
      just
      be
      sincere
      in
      what
      I
      say
      and
      do.
      I've
      been
      obsessing
      over
      this
      and
      my
      mental
      health
      is
      taking
      a
      blow
      because
      I'm
      so
      out
      of
      my
      element.
      I'm
      sorry,
      I
      have
      no
      idea
      what
      I
      should
      do.
      I
      have
      someone
      who
      is
      pressuring
      me
      like
      it's
      no
      big
      deal.
      To
      me
      it
      is
      a
      big
      deal.
      Anyway,
      what
      should
      I
      do?
      Any
      advice?

      I #8217;m

      Add

      trying

      benefits
      and
      my

      problems
      and
      I #8217;m
      spiraling
      into
      a
      depression
      I #8217;m
      scared
      I
      won #8217;t
      come
      out
      of.
      I #8217;m
      trying
      to
      find
      a
      job
      that #8217;ll
      work
      with
      my
      mental
      health,
      that
      pays
      well,
      and
      gives
      me
      benefits.
      I #8217;m
      in
      a
      situation
      at
      home
      that
      I
      hate
      and
      getting
      a
      job
      will
      start
      me
      in
      the
      right
      direction.
      But
      it #8217;s
      so
      difficult
      to
      find
      a
      good
      job
      that
      checks
      all
      the
      boxes.
      I
      don #8217;t
      even
      know
      what
      jobs
      would
      work
      for
      me
      but
      I #8217;m
      applying
      to
      many.
      Now
      I #8217;m
      rambling.
      Anyway,
      I
      have
      no
      one
      to
      talk
      to
      so
      I
      thought
      I #8217;d
      vent
      here
      or
      maybe
      even
      ask
      for
      ideas
      on
      where
      to
      find
      jobs
      that
      might
      be
      good
      for
      me.
      Thanks.

      Yeah
      I
      check
      it
      everyday
      and
      have
      applied
      to
      jobs.
      I #8217;m
      just
      having
      trouble
      identifying
      jobs
      that #8217;ll
      work
      for
      me.
      I
      may
      have
      to
      look
      outside
      the
      perimeter
      of
      my
      town.
      Thank
      you.

      His

      I
      have
      OCD,
      BPD
      traits,
      anxiety,
      and
      depression.
      Whenever
      I
      start
      a
      new
      job
      I
      immediately
      want
      to
      quit
      because
      my
      mental
      health
      goes
      out
      of
      control
      and
      makes
      everything
      miserable
      as
      to
      where
      I #8217;m
      constantly
      holding
      back
      anxiety
      attacks.
      I #8217;m
      trying
      to
      find
      a
      job
      that
      doesn #8217;t
      do
      this
      to
      me
      but
      no
      luck
      so
      far.
      My
      old
      job
      worked
      with
      me
      on
      this
      but
      was
      too
      far
      away
      without
      enough
      lay
      to
      continued
      my
      new
      jobs
      have
      not
      been
      accommodating
      with
      my
      mental
      health.
      I
      feel
      like
      I #8217;m
      constantly
      on
      the
      brink
      of
      going
      insane
      and
      I
      actually
      want
      to
      let
      loose,
      to
      give
      in.
      I
      guess
      this
      is
      mostly
      a
      rant

      I
      am
      on
      medication,
      three
      types
      and
      Xanax
      too
      to
      help
      with
      anxiety
      attacks.
      I
      can
      tell
      that
      it
      helps
      but
      I #8217;m
      still
      struggling
      a
      lot.
      I #8217;ll
      be
      talking
      again
      to
      my
      psychiatrist
      and
      psychologist
      in
      about
      2
      weeks
      and
      see
      what
      they
      say.
      I
      guess
      part
      of
      my
      anxiety
      is
      constantly
      seeing
      if
      I #8217;m
      alone
      in
      it
      and
      seeking

      just
