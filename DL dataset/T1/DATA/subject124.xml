      Like
      others
      said,
      it's
      not
      particularly
      fast.
      But
      two
      years
      ago
      that's
      about
      what
      I
      swam,
      and
      now
      I
      can
      swim
      a
      33
      in
      breaststroke
      (age
      13).
      Basically
      what
      I'm
      saying
      is
      that
      anyone
      can
      improve,
      and
      that's
      what's
      important.

      This
      looks
      so

      Just
      go
      in
      gradually.
      At
      first,
      your
      body
      won't
      be
      used
      to
      swimming
      and
      it
      may
      seem
      hard
      to
      finish
      even
      a
      couple
      of
      laps.
      Don't
      let
      that
      get
      to
      you.
      As
      to
      the
      actual
      swimming,
      I
      have
      no
      idea
      how
      extensive
      your
      training
      was.
      If
      you
      have
      a
      hard
      time
      with
      teqnuiqe,
      just
      take
      a
      personal
      trainer
      for
      some
      time.
      If
      your
      teqnuiqe
      is
      good
      then
      just
      focus
      on
      swimming
      laps
      and
      gradually
      up
      your
      endurance.
      And
      most
      importantly,
      enjoy
      swimming
      because
      it's
      super
      fun!

      Swimming
      doesn't
      build
      up
      a
      lot
      of
      actual
      muscle
      mass,
      but
      it
      does
      increase
      your
      strength
      by
      a
      lot.
      That
      being
      said,
      if
      you
      only
      want
      to
      be
      able
      to
      lift,
      then
      lift.
      Swimming
      altogether
      builds
      your
      upper
      body
      strength
      while
      not
      endangering
      it,
      so
      I
      would
      always
      recommend
      it
      as
      a
      sport.
      But
      at
      the
      end
      you
      can
      do
      whatever
      you
      want.

      about
      the
      obesity,
      don't

      If
      you
      continue
      swimming
      it'll
      start
      disappearing
      as

      First
      of
      all,
      talk
      to
      your
      coach.
      Coaches
      have
      usually
      faced
      all
      the
      normal
      and
      common
      stuff
      in
      swimmers.
      Do
      what
      your
      coach
      recommends.
      If
      it
      still
      doesn't
      change
      after
      a
      long
      time,
      see
      a
      doctor.
      It
      could
      be
      many
      things,
      but
      it's
      probably
      better
      to
      be
      sure.

      Don't
      do
      it.
      As
      a
      breaststroke
      swimmer,
      there's
      already
      enough
      pressure
      on
      my
      knees.
      Adding
      fins
      to
      that
      is
      absolutely
      terrible.
      Hurt
      my
      knees
      really
      badly
      and
      I
      could
      hardly
      swim
      for
      two
      to
      three
      days.
      Absolutely
      wouldn't
      recommend.

      Listening
      to
      my
      teacher.
      Now,
      don't
      get
      me
      wrong
      -
      most
      times
      it's
      very
      important
      to
      listen
      to
      your
      teacher.
      But
      this
      was
      a
      special
      circumstance.
      In
      seventh
      grade,
      I
      had
      joined
      a
      professional
      swimming
      team
      and
      was
      swimming
      18
      hours
      a
      week.
      On
      top
      of
      that,
      I
      had
      school
      and
      other
      necessary
      activities,
      aka
      sleeping
      and
      eating.
      So
      I
      had
      no
      time
      to
      meet
      up
      with
      friends
      from
      my
      class.
      That
      didn't
      bother
      me
      much,
      because
      I
      still
      spent
      time
      with
      them
      in
      school,
      and
      the
      swim
      training
      connected
      me
      with
      kids
      ny
      age
      who
      shared
      my
      interest,
      and
      I
      still
      had
      a
      pretty
      good
      social
      life.
      But
      my
      teacher
      told
      me
      that
      I
      should
      be
      wary
      of
      my
      choices,
      because
      being
      a
      teenager
      is
      a
      one
      time
      experience,
      and
      in
      her
      opinion
      I
      shouldn't
      spend
      that
      much
      time
      swimming.
      It
      was
      supposed
      to
      be
      just
      an
      opinion,
      and
      she
      was
      really
      supportive
      of
      my
      choice
      to
      join
      the
      swim
      team,
      but
      after
      she
      said
      that
      I
      started
      second
      guessing
      myself,
      and
      it
      took
      me
      a
      couple
      of
      months
      to
      pull
      myself
      from
      the
      endless
      spiral
      of
      "I
      don't
      have
      a
      social
      life
      because
      of
      swimming,
      but
      I
      can't
      stop
      swimming
      because
      it's
      my
      passion."
      Lesson
      learned:
      don't
      always
      listen
      to
      your
      elders,
      especially
      if
      they're
      not
      talking
      from
      a
      place
      of
      experience.

      True,
      but
      what's
      even
      more
      impressive
      is
      when
      you
      learn
      to
      do
      it
      fast.
      I
      can
      solve
      it
      in
      about
      30
      seconds,
      and
      I'm
      still
      super
      impressed
      if
      someone
      can
      do
      it
      in
      25.

      Also,
      if
      you
      decide
      I'm
      "worthy"
      of
      looking
      through

      you'll

      have
      a

      at
      all
      because
      I
      didn't
      realise
      how
      bad
      it
      looked
      and
      impacted
      my
      meme.
      But
      this
      meme
      blew
      up
      and
      instead
      of
      doing
      a
      little
      bit
      of
      investigation,
      people
      like
      you
      immediately
      throw
      hate
      at
      new
      users.
      No

      only
      people
      who
      are
      old
      on

      post
      good

      game,
      a
      record
      which
      was
      only
      broken
      last
      month
      by
      minecraft,
      it
      doesn't
      get
      enough
      love,
      and
      somepeople
      even
      say
      that
      it's
      a
      bad
      game
      because
      it's
      old.
      Excuse
      me,
      but
      your
      opinion
      doesn't
      matter
      to
      me,
      and
      it's
      a
      shit
      opinion
      anyway.

      Starting
      again
      Yeah,
      that's
      sure
      to
      bring
      some
      confusion
      to
      anybody
      who
      is

      in
      survival
      mode?

      File

      It's
      not
      his
      choice
      if
      you
      move
      to
      a
      different
      lane.
      If
      you
      had
      been
      constantly
      bothering
      other
      swimmers
      and
      you
      swam
      slower

      him,
      as
      well
      as
      not
      letting
      swimmers
      pass,
      then
      he
      would
      have
      been
      within
      his
      rights
      to
      *politely*
      ask
      you
      to
      move.

      that

      I
      swim
      every
      day
      (prof
      swimmer)
      Unless
      you
      have
      some
      allergy
      to
      chlorine,
      you
      should
      be
      fine.
      But
      make
      sure
      to
      wash
      yourself
      well
      after
      each
      training
      session.
      Other
      (common)
      health
      issues
      are
      ear
      infections
      (which

      built
      for
      swimming)
      Other
      than
      that,
      just
      don't
      push
      yourself
      too
      much
      and
      have

      I'm
      a
      teenager
      so
      as
      of
      right
      now,
      I'm
      not
      training
      on
      the
      level
      of
      older
      swimmers.
      Right
      now,
      I
      have
      7
      training
      sessions
      a
      week.
      Every
      day,
      Sunday
      through
      Friday,
      I
      have
      a
      3
      hour
      training
      session
      which
      includes
      1
      hour
      of
      fitness
      outside
      the
      pool
      and
      two
      hours
      swimming.
      In
      addition
      to
      that,
      on
      Wednesdays
      I
      have
      morning
      training,
      which
      is
      and
      additional
      hour
      of
      fitness
      from
      6:00-7:00
      am.
      Competition
      wise,
      I
      have
      about
      1-2
      swim
      meets
      a
      month,
      but
      some
      times
      there
      are
      none
      and
      some
      times
      there
      are
      more.
      That's
      about
      it

      I'm
      not
      trying
      to
      sound
      un-helpful,
      but
      I'm
      not
      sure
      this
      is
      the
      correct
      sub
      reddit
      to

      What
      you're
      looking
      for
      isn't
      a
      swimming
      tip
      but
      psychological
      advice,
      and
      I
      don't
      expect
      many
      people
      here
      can
      help
      that
      much...
      If
      it
      helps,
      you
      should
      probably
      try
      to
      learn
      how
      to
      swim
      and
      float
      on
      your
      back,
      and
      then
      you
      can
      always
      be
      sure
      you
      won't
      drown
      when
      you're
      face
      down,
      while
      also
      keeping
      your
      face
      out
      of
      the
      water.
      That
      way
      you
      won't
      be
      frightened
      of
      drowning
      while
      you're
      swimming,
      and
      you'll
      learn
      how
      to
      combat
      this
      phobia.
      Hope
      I
      helped!

      Technically
      yes,

      you

      a
      real
      instructor
      then
      that
      would
      be
      great,
      but
      if
      not
      you
      can
      just
      ask
      for
      help
      from
      your
      wife
      or
      a
      friend.
      I
      know
      you
      said
      that
      you
      took
      some
      adult
      lessons
      and
      they
      didn't
      work,
      but
      now
      that
      you
      have
      a
      purpose
      in
      mind,
      and
      a
      new
      instructor,
      it
      may
      be
      better.
      That's
      my
      opinion
      at
      least.

      Oh
      am
      I?
      Says
      the
      person
      who
      goes
      out
      of
      his
      way
      just
      to
      send
      hate
      to
      someone
      else
      for
      no
      reason,
      then
      proceeds
      to
      remove
      his
      post
      out
      of
      shame,
      but
      still
      reacts
      to
      this
      post
      to
      seem
      like
      a
      better
      person.
      Well,
      I
      don't
      care
      of
      it's
      not
      an
      insult
      to
      me,
      you're
      spreading
      hate
      over
      reddit
      for
      no
      reason
      so
      I
      take
      it
      personally.
      If
      you
      hadn't
      wanted
      to
      get
      so
      much
      hate
      back
      maybe
      you
      shouldn't
      have
      posted
      hate
      in
      the
      first
      place.

      Well,
      at
      least
      I
      don't
      try
      spreading
      hate
      for
      no
      particular
      reason
      on
      the
      Internet.
      If
      it
      makes
      you
      happy
      making
      other
      people
      unhappy,
      have
      a
      nice
      time
      in
      hell.
      Because
      for
      some
      reason,
      you're
      all
      high
      and
      mighty.
      You
      can
      tell
      people
      whatever
      you
      want
      in
      a
      condescending
      way,
      and
      don't
      give
      a
      fuck
      that
      behind
      that
      post
      there's
      a
      person.
      You
      don't
      seem
      to
      realise
      that
      protecting
      a
      stranger
      that
      I
      don't
      know
      is
      so
      much
      better
      than
      telling
      random
      people
      that
      they're
      losers
      and
      are
      bad
      at
      whatever
      they
      do.
      You
      seem
      like
      the
      kind
      of
      person
      that
      bullies
      kids
      smaller
      than
      you
      in
      school,
      and
      grows
      up
      to
      be
      an
      abusive
      and
      terrible
      parent.
      That
      is,
      if
      some
      girl
      (or
      guy)
      is
      enough
      of
      a
      moron
      to
      fall
      for
      you.
      Have
      fun
      making
      people's
      lives
      bad,
      while
      I
      try
      to
      make
      them
      better.
      And
      then
      people
      like
      you
      are
      surprised
      that
      others
      are
      afraid
      of
      voicing
      themselves
      on
      open
      platforms.
      Well,
      excuse
      me
      for
      being
      a
      good
      person,
      I'm
      sure
      you
      don't
      have
      many
      of
      those
      in
      your
      life.
      You
      haven't
      earned
      them.
