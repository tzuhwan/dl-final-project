      I

      software.
      use

      add
      into
      Google
      Chrome
      and
      Microsoft
      word

      It
      will
      recommend
      auto-correction
      and
      as
      well
      as
      grammar
      correction.
      They
      also
      have
      an
      Android
      keyboard
      that
      you
      can
      use
      for

      and
      writing
      mail
      in
      your
      phone.
      It
      is
      very
      helpful.
      I
      also
      use
      my
      phone
      to
      record
      all
      the
      Calls
      and
      also
      use
      it
      in
      meeting.
      keep
      a
      small
      note
      pad
      with
      you
      all
      time
      to
      take
      notes.

      But
      the
      students
      have
      claimed
      that
      it
      is
      a
      MSF
      flag
      that
      looks
      similar
      to
      Pakistan
      national
      flag.
      The
      College
      governing
      body
      chairman
      AK
      Tharuvayi
      reportedly
      said
      that
      MSF
      flag
      was
      held
      upside
      down
      which
      made
      it
      look
      like
      Pakistan's
      national
      flag.
      He
      also
      said
      that
      the
      procession
      was
      held
      on
      a
      holiday
      and
      assured
      probe
      in
      the
      matter
      on
      Monday.
      However,
      BJP
      has
      alleged
      that
      terrorists
      have
      sneaked
      into
      the
      college
      campus.

      In

      they

      to
      give

      the

      is
      that

      It

      You

      a
      person
      who
      believes
      in
      human
      sacrifice
      God
      ,
      if
      he
      is
      brought

      in
      a
      culture
      where
      human
      sacrifice
      is
      considered
      divine.

      It's
      my
      belief.
      That's
      the
      beauty
      of
      Hinduism
      there
      is
      no
      wrong
      way
      to
      achieve
      Nirvana.
      The
      path
      every
      one
      choose
      is
      different.
      Every
      Hindu
      I
      know
      eats
      beef
      in
      my
      state
      in
      India.
      Even
      we
      go
      to
      temple
      after
      eating
      beef.
      For
      me,
      it's
      no
      sin.

      Have
      you
      heard
      about
      animal
      sacrifices
      in
      the
      temple.
      we
      use
      to
      sacrifice
      goats,
      sheep
      and
      other
      domestic
      animals
      to
      the
      God,
      even
      human
      sacrifice
      was
      also
      given
      to
      the
      gods
      but
      it
      is
      banned
      now
      in
      India.
      It's
      been
      only
      50
      since
      it
      is
      banned.
      As
      I
      said
      is
      there
      not
      defined
      rules
      to
      follow
      in
      Hinduism.
      The
      path
      you
      choose
      to
      follow
      is
      up
      to
      you.

      I
      don't
      agree
      with
      you.
      Kerala
      people
      view
      is
      different
      than
      that
      of
      all
      other
      states
      in
      India.
      Even
      if
      you
      consider
      North
      and
      South
      India
      it
      is
      also
      different.
      That
      is
      what
      makes
      us
      vibrate
      and
      unique
      for
      the
      rest
      of
      the
      world.
      I
      can't
      say
      your
      belief
      is
      wrong,
      neither
      you
      have
      the
      right
      to
      call
      my

      See
      it
      depends
      up
      the
      path
      you
      choose.
      If
      you
      are
      a
      follower
      of
      Krishna
      /
      Rama
      .the
      followers
      believe
      in
      Ahimsa,
      But
      if
      you
      are
      following
      Goddess
      Durga
      were
      Followers
      are
      giving
      animal
      /
      human
      sacrifice.
      Some
      followed.
      Of
      Shiva
      Aghori,
      they
      consume
      Human
      meat
      /cannibalism.
      It
      does
      not
      mean
      that
      you
      can
      kill
      animals
      for
      fun.
      There
      must
      be
      a
      purpose
      for
      it
      .
      If
      you
      kill
      an
      animal
      it
      should
      be
      for
      your
      survival.
      In
      Hinduism,
      every
      life
      even
      if
      it
      is
      a
      plant
      or
      animal
      it
      is
      equal.
      So
      killing
      a
      plant
      for
      harvest
      and
      killing
      an
      animal
      for
      food
      is
      the
      same.

      Seriously
      you
      think
      Killing
      a
      plant
      and
      an
      animal
      is
      not
      even
      close
      to
      being
      equivalent.
      I
      have
      nothing
      to
      say,
      brother.
      So
      you
      are
      saying
      that
      no
      animal
      sacrifices
      in
      Hinduism/
      Human
      sacrifice
      ??
      wow
      I
      am
      Hindu
      and
      I
      eat
      whatever
      u
      want
      .
      No
      one
      can
      question
      it.
      My
      faith
      and
      my
      believes.
      I
      don't
      think
      there
      is
      a
      special
      diet
      a
      Hindu
      should
      eat.

      I
      also
      have
      very
      poor
      short
      term
      memory
      .
      I
      can't
      memorize
      long
      numbers.
      Difficult
      to
      learn
      other
      people's
      name.
      I
      think
      it
      is
      common
      for
      dyslexic
      people.
      But
      dyslexia
      varies
      from
      people
      to
      people.
      Always
      try
      to
      overcome
      this
      with
      tactics.
      Like
      when
      I
      am
      working
      I
      used
      to
      record
      conversations,
      phone
      calls,detail
      checklist,
      etc.
      So
      that
      I
      don't
      forget
      anything.
      The
      advantage
      we
      have
      today
      is
      technology
      so
      we
      have
      to
      use
      it
      wisely
      to
      overcome
      it.

      Q1.
      after
      finding
      out
      I
      had
      dyslexia
      I
      gave
      me
      a
      great
      relief.
      Increased
      my
      confidence.
      Q2.Not
      all
      workplace
      is
      healthy
      for
      dyslexia,
      My
      last
      job
      was
      also
      very
      stressful.
      Q4.Even
      I
      had
      some
      issue
      like
      that,
      It
      more
      of
      a
      memory
      thing.
      When
      we
      forget
      something(like
      in
      a
      conversation,
      activity,
      incidents)
      our
      brain
      will
      automatically
      fill
      the
      gap
      with
      made-up
      ones.
      Q
      5,6,7
      Few
      of
      things
      you
      mentioned
      are
      common
      for
      some
      dyslexics,
      But
      if
      you
      have
      trouble
      seeing
      things
      should
      consult
      with
      an
      eye
      specialist.
      Q
      8,
      Answer
      is
      you
      have
      already
      found
      it.
      This
      subreddit
      is
      the
      biggest
      dyslexic
      community
      I
      have
      found
      online.
      You
      can
      post
      anything

      want

      people
      in
      this
      Subreddit
      will
      help
      you.
      Q9.it
      is
      very
      stress
      full.

      .But
      your
      emotions
      and
      fear
      took
      control
      .
      Lucid
      dreams
      are
      very
      realistic
      and
      vivid
      in
      nature
      than
      normal
      dreams.
      In
      case
      it
      happens
      again
      and
      you
      don't
      want
      to
      go

      offer
      her
      some

      case
      you
      are
      in
