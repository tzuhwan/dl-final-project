      I
      have
      never
      agreed
      with
      someone
      more.
      My
      mom
      also
      bought
      me
      dresses
      and
      wanted
      me
      to
      do
      things
      with
      my
      hair,
      like
      curling
      and
      straightening(I
      eventually
      just
      cut
      it
      all
      off).
      I
      wanted
      to
      run
      and
      play
      in
      the
      mud
      and
      scream.
      Even
      now
      she
      gets
      mad
      at
      me
      cause
      I
      wear
      a
      sports
      bra
      24/7
      instead
      of
      the
       #8220;expensive #8221;
      normal
      ones
      she
      buys.
      If
      I #8217;m
      gonna
      start
      running
      I
      don #8217;t
      need
      to
      deal
      with

      It #8217;s
      absolutely
      insane,
      then
      she

      bra
      strap
      peaks

      Ok,
      first
      time
      posting
      ever,
      so
      if
      I
      do
      anything
      wrong
      let
      me
      know.
      I #8217;ve
      been
      a
      tomboy
      my
      whole
      life.
      I
      used
      to
      be
      really
      comfortable
      in
      my
      own
      skin,
      but
      my
      parents
      started
      telling
      me
      that
      my
      boyfriend
      wants
      a
      real
      lady,
      and
      that
      I
      need
      to
      change
      my
      personality
      or
      he #8217;ll
      break
      up
      with
      me.
      Also,
      they
      try
      to
      guilt
      trip
      me
      into
      wearing
      really
      girly
      clothes,
      and
      that
      is
      just
      not
      who
      I
      am.
      My
      boyfriend
      is
      a
      really
      nice
      guy,
      and
      I
      think
      we #8217;re
      doing
      well
      in
      our
      relationship.
      I
      have
      known
      him
      for
      11
      years,
      despite
      having
      only
      dated
      him
      for
      a
      year.
      We
      are
      both
      18,
      and
      heading
      to
      the
      same
      college
      in
      the
      fall.
      Even
      though
      my
      bf
      hasn #8217;t
      said
      anything,
      should
      I
      still
      make
      an
      effort
      to
      be
      more
       #8220;lady
      like #8221;?
      I
      really
      love
      him,
      and
      I
      wouldn #8217;t
      want
      him
      to
      lose
      interest,
      but
      I
      also
      can #8217;t
      stand
      normal
      fancy
      or
      girly
      stuff.
      Is
      this
      just
      my
      parent
      making
      me
      doubt
      myself?
      What
      should
      I
      do?
      TL;DR:
      Parents
      say
      my
      boyfriend
      wants
      a
      girly
      girl,
      I
      am
      super
      confused

      and
      I
      typically
      wear
      pretty
      baggy
      clothes,
      despite
      having
      a
      fairly
      feminine
      figure.
      People
      would
      always
      call
      me
      out
      on
      my
      sexuality
      and
      whether
      I
      wanted
      to
      look
      like
      a
      boy
      or
      not.
      Also
      have
      a
      very
      Christian
      family,
      and
      my
      brother
      is
      somewhat
      sexist.
      I #8217;m
      a
      tomboy,
      like,
      get
      over
      yourselves
      .
      So
      yeah,
      I
      feel
      you
      290%,
      and
      i
      day
      do
      whatever
      you
      want,
      it #8217;s

      Yeah,
      I
      mean
      I
      have
      stretch
      marks
      on
      the
      outsides
      of
      my
      thighs.
      I
      got
      them

      Yes
      I
      hate
      them
      too!
      Although
      it
      sort
      of
      depends,
      if
      I #8217;m
      home
      with
      my
      parents
      I #8217;m
      barely
      breathing
      because
      I
      want
      to
      be
      able
      to
      hear
      whatever
      they #8217;re
      doing.
      I
      was
      cutting
      some
      paper
      once
      and
      didn #8217;t
      realize
      my
      mom
      was
      home.
      She
      yelled
      my
      name
      from
      down
      the
      hall,
      and
      was
      far
      too
      close
      for
      how
      loud
      she
      yelled.
      It
      scared
      me
      so
      bad
      that
      the
      knife
      slipped
      and
      I
      ended
      up
      slicing
      into
      my
      thumb.
      When
      I #8217;m
      with
      friends
      though,
      as
      long
      as
      it #8217;s
      not
      right
      next
      to
      me
      I #8217;m
      usually
      fine

      Well
      I
      agree
      with
      100%,
      I
      may
      be
      biased
      since
      I #8217;m
      going
      into

      enforcement,

      I #8217;ve

      of

      to
      back
      up
      my

      so
      don #8217;t

      If

      EDIT:
      I #8217;ve
      been
      made
      aware
      that
      I
      got
      some
      firearm
      terminology
      incorrect
      by
      a
      nice
      person
      in
      the
      comment
      section.
      I #8217;m
      not
      going
      to
      change
      it
      where
      I #8217;ve
      typed
      it,
      but
      I
      know
      it #8217;s
      wrong.
      Hi
      there,
      I #8217;m
      a
      18F,
      going
      to
      college
      in
      a
      month
      to
      study
      criminology,
      and
      after
      that
      I
      plan
      to
      go
      to
      police
      academy
      and
      serve
      in
      a
      specific
      city
      in
      a
      mid
      western
      state
      in
      the
      US.
      I #8217;ve
      interviewed
      two
      cops,
      taken
      a
      criminology
      course
      from
      a
      Seargent,
      and
      I #8217;ve
      gone
      on
      a
      4
      hour
      ride
      along.
      I
      also
      have
      a
      fairly
      tough
      workout
      regimen,
      but
      it
      could
      probably
      do
      with
      some
      updates
      to
      make
      it
      harder.
      I #8217;ve
      also
      learned
      how
      to
      shoot
      4
      different
      guns,
      9mils,
      22mils,
      45mils,
      and
      an
      AR-15.
      Can
      I
      get
      some
      advice
      on
      anything
      else
      I
      can
      do
      to
      be
      ready
      for
      my
      career?
      I
      would
      appreciate
      it
      very
      much.

      Oh
      ok,
      thank
      you,
      I
      was
      using
      the
      terminology
      my
      dad
      used
      when
      he
      taught
      me
      to
      shoot,
      and
      I
      didn #8217;t
      think
      to
      double
      check.
      Thanks
      for
      the
      advice,
      I #8217;m
      sure
      I #8217;ll
      learn
      more
      when
      I
      get
      to
      police
      academy
      as
      well.

      Thank
      you,
      but
      I
      do
      have
      to
      ask,
      I
      have
      been
      recommended
      this
      major
      from
      people
      I
      have
      asked.
      Some
      cousins
      of
      mine
      work
      in
      law
      enforcement,
      and
      some
      officers
      I #8217;ve
      interviewed
      say
      criminal
      justice
      or
      psychology.
      Is
      it
      really
      useless
      and
      I #8217;ve
      just
      gotten
      bad
      advice?

      Thank
      you,
      this
      is
      the
      biggest
      advice
      I #8217;ve
      gotten
      from
      people
      I #8217;ve
      asked
      face
      to
      face,
      and
      it
      does
      help
      to
      have
      it
      ingrained.
      As
      of
      yet,
      I #8217;ve
      never
      even
      gotten
      a
      traffic
      ticket,
      and
      the
      only
      time
      I #8217;ve
      even
      been
      questioned
      by
      police
      was
      when
      I
      was
      in
      an
      accident
      that
      was
      he
      other
      persons
      fault
      (they
      hit
      me
      while
      I
      was
      stopped
      at
      a
      stop
      sign).
      Thank
      you
      so
      much!

      Hi,
      I #8217;m
      not
      op,
      but
      I
      was
      scrolling

      advice
      and
      stopped
      on
      yours.

      Thank
      you!
      I #8217;ve
      been
      active,
      with
      a
      fairly
      consistent
      musculature
      for
      most
      my
      life.
      I #8217;m
      actually
      worried
      now
      though
      since
      I #8217;m
      going
      to
      college,
      that
      my
      workout
      won #8217;t
      be
      as
      consistent,
      so
      if
      you
      have
      any
      specific
      workouts
      you #8217;d
      recommend,
      if
      be
      super
      grateful,
      thanks!

      Well
      as
      a
      girl
      who
      grew
      up
      with
      two
      parents,
      I
      was
      actually
      closer
      to
      my
      dad.
      I
      may
      have
      grown
      up
      slightly
      unfeminine,
      and
      slightly
      violent,
      but
      I
      am
      still
      perfectly
      fine
      and
      not
      rude,
      so
      suck
      it

      First
      time
      posting
      on
      the
      sub,
      on
      mobile,
      all
      that
      stuff.
      I
      need
      help.
      2
      nights
      ago
      I
      was
      feeling
      lower
      than
      usual
      and
      cut
      semi
      deep
      vertical
      lines
      into
      the
      tops
      of
      my
      thighs.
      Usually
      this
      wouldn #8217;t
      be
      a
      problem,
      I
      have
      scars
      like
      that
      on
      my
      arms
      and
      thighs
      and
      hips
      already.
      My
      mom
      just
      told
      me
      that
      we #8217;re
      going
      to
      a
      water
      amusement
      park
      in
      a
      week
      and
      a
      half.
      I
      always
      wear
      shorts
      anyway,
      but
      if
      they
      move
      at
      all
      while
      I #8217;m
      on
      a
      ride
      everyone #8217;s
      going
      to
      notice.
      The
      people
      I #8217;m
      going
      with
      have
      no
      clue
      that
      I
      intentionally
      cut,
      and
      while
      I
      can
      make
      excuses
      about
      the
      scars
      and
      the
      occasional
      mark,
      these
      are
      too
      obvious.
      Does
      anyone
      know
      a
      way
      to
      make
      things
      like
      that
      heal
      faster,
      or
      something
      I
      can
      use
      to
      semi
      cover
      it
      or
      anything?
      My
      mom
      will
      kill
      me
      if
      she
      knows
      about
      my
      issues.
