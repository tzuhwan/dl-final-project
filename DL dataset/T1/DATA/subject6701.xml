      We #8217;ve
      been
      dating
      a
      little
      over
      a
      year.
      I #8217;ve
      brought
      up
      the
      subjects
      of
      pet
      names
      and
      him
      never
      giving
      me
      compliments
      anymore.
      It
      didn #8217;t
      help
      and
      I #8217;m
      nervous
      to
      bring
      up
      the
      other
      stuff.

      My
      doctor
      put
      me
      on
      zyprexa
      last
      year
      and
      I
      quickly
      gained
      about
      60
      pounds.
      I #8217;ve
      never
      gained
      weight
      like
      that
      before.
      I
      went
      from
      being
      about
      120
      to
      almost
      180!
      I
      stopped
      taking
      it
      but
      the
      damage
      was
      done.
      NONE
      of
      my
      clothes
      fit
      anymore
      and
      I
      went
      from
      being
      super
      self
      confident
      to
      hating
      my
      appearance
      and
      feeling
      uncomfortable
      in
      my
      own
      body.
      I
      started
      eating
      less,
      cut
      out
      soda,
      and
      started
      drinking
      more
      water
      and
      FINALLY
      it #8217;s
      starting
      to
      pay
      off!
      I
      went
      to
      the
      doctor
      the
      other
      day
      and
      I #8217;ve
      dropped
      down
      to
      155!
      I #8217;m
      not
      where
      I
      want
      to
      be
      yet
      but
      I #8217;m
      relieved
      that
      I #8217;m
      getting
      smaller
      again
      and
      can
      fit
      into
      some
      of
      my
      clothes.

      I
      think
      everyone
      should
      be
      aware
      of
      the
      negative
      side
      effects
      of
      medications
      PRIOR
      to
      taking
      them.
      This
      drug
      also
      causes
      diabetes,
      which
      several
      here
      have
      confirmed
      getting
      as
      a
      result
      of
      their
      use
      of
      it.
      I
      didn #8217;t
      get
      it
      but
      it
      scares
      me
      to
      think
      I
      could
      have
      had
      I
      continued.
      Diabetes
      is
      another
      SERIOUS
      disease.
      The
      depression
      and
      worthlessness
      I #8217;ve
      come
      to
      deal
      with
      as
      a
      result
      of
      the
      weight
      gain
      are
      NOT
      cohesive
      with
      maintaining
      a
      healthy/stable
      lifestyle!
      I #8217;m
      glad
      I
      could
      warn
      others
      to
      be
      wary
      of
      this
      specific
      medication
      by
      sharing
      my
      awful
      experience
      and
      I
      wish
      I
      had
      fully
      understood
      the
      risk
      prior
      to
      taking
      it
      myself.
      I
      could
      have
      saved
      myself
      from
      this
      depression
      and
      not
      wasted
      my
      money
      on
      a
      medication
      that
      ultimately
      made
      me
      SICKER.
      Just
      because
      we
      are
      ill
      doesn #8217;t
      mean
      we
      should
      be
      uninformed
      of
      a
      medication #8217;s
      side
      effects
      because
      it
      means
      it
      we
      may
      not
      take
      it.
      Smh.
      This
      opinion
      is,
      by
      my
      view,
      part
      of
      a
      very
      concerning
      and
      antiquated
      issue.

      ALSO
      I
      got
      thoroughly
      and
      explicitly
      warned
      about
      the
      risks
      of
      taking
      Lithium
      were
      I
      to
      become
      pregnant
      but
      the
      negative
      side
      effects
      of
      Zyprexa
      on
      ME
      were
      kept
      from
      me...
      how
      is
      this
      right
      or
      fair.
      It
      seems
      to
      suggest
      the
      doctors
      care
      more
      about
      unborn
      fetuses
      than
      they
      do
      full
      grown
      women.
      Fuck
      that
      too!
      They
      should
      warn
      you
      about
      EVERYTHING.
      Not
      what
      they
      pick
      and
      choose.
      Absolute
      bullshit.

      Do
      the
      nightmares
      ever
      go
      away?

      I
      was
      a
      victim
      of
      abuse
      at
      the
      hands
      of
      my
      ex
      boyfriend.
      2014-2015
      then
      he
      went
      to
      prison
      for
      it
      but
      it
      happened
      again
      in
      2018
      upon
      his
      release
      from
      prison.
      He
      is
      back
      in
      prison
      now
      with
      false
      imprisonment
      and
      battery
      charges.
      The
      problem
      is,
      since
      this
      happening,
      I
      have
      nightmares
      all
      the
      time.
      I #8217;ll
      dream
      that
      he #8217;s
      standing
      over
      me
      with
      a
      knife
      or
      a
      gun
      while
      I #8217;m
      still
      in
      bed
      asleep.
      I #8217;ll
      also
      dream
      of
      me
      trying
      as
      hard
      as
      I
      can
      to
      get
      back
      into
      contact
      with
      him.
      I
      write
      hundreds
      of
      letters
      in
      my
      dreams
      and
      search
      every
      where
      for
      him.
      When
      I
      finally
      (in
      some
      of
      the
      dreams)
      find
      him,
      he
      is
      horribly
      mean.
      I
      myself
      up
      crying
      from
      most
      of
      these
      dreams
      and
      I #8217;m
      in
      a
      poor
      mood
      for
      the
      remainder
      of
      the
      day,
      sometimes
      multiple
      days
      after.
      My
      question
      is
      has
      anyone
      else
      experienced
      this?
      What
      if
      anything
      can
      I
      do?
      Will
      it
      ever
      stop?

      I
      just
      came
      back
      from
      the
      store
      buying
      bandages.
      I
      don #8217;t
      ever
      buy
      blades.
      I
      just
      break
      apart
      my
      old
      shaving
      razors
      (and
      sanitize
      them)
      they
      cut
      a
      lot
      easier
      for
      whatever
      reason.
      Sometimes
      too
      easy.
