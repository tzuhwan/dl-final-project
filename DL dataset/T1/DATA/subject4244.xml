      everyone
      uses
      this
      as
      a

      when
      you
      tell
      people
      you
      don #8217;t
      want
      kids.
      I
      agree
      with
      you
      I
      was
      a
      reckless
      child.
      Little
      snot
      rockets
      can
      be
      annoying.
      I
      wanted
      kids
      for
      a
      while
      but
      the
      more

      Just
      got
      put
      on
      antidepressants
      for
      the
      second
      time
      about
      a
      week
      ago.
      It
      takes
      a
      few
      weeks
      for
      your
      body
      to
      get
      used
      to;
      especially
      the
      first
      few
      days
      when
      you
      up
      the
      dosage
      it
      feels
      like
      you
      have
      the
      stomach
      flu.
      3-4
      weeks
      you #8217;ll
      notice
      results.
      Hang
      in
      there,
      whatever
      you #8217;re
      going
      through
      it #8217;ll
      get
      better.
      Life
      can
      be
      stressful
      and
      a
      couple
      months
      ago
      there
      was
      a
      trend
      going
      around
      saying,
       #8220;yeah
      antidepressants
      and
      medications
      are
      good
      but
      have
      you
      tried: #8221;
      Sometimes
      you
      try
      everything
      and
      nothing
      works
      so
      you
      get
      medicated.
      Don #8217;t
      be
      ashamed
      and
      stick
      to
      your
      prescription!!

      Depending
      on
      whether
      or
      not
      you
      have
      a
      set
      budget
      or
      if
      money
      isn't
      an
      issue
      might
      as
      well
      go
      ahead
      and
      get
      the
      best
      hardware
      so
      you
      don't
      have
      to
      constantly
      upgrade.
      I've
      heard
      mixed
      reviews
      on
      the
      20xx
      series
      cards,
      the
      2060
      in
      particular,
      a
      lot
      of
      people
      have
      already
      had
      their
      cards
      go
      bad
      or
      were
      defective.
      But
      if
      you
      buy
      new
      you
      get
      a
      warranty.
      If
      you're
      thinking
      about
      getting
      a
      new
      card
      I'd
      just
      go
      with
      a
      2060.
      Mass-produced
      technology
      parts
      aren't
      all
      going
      to

      and
      if
      you're
      looking
      at
      getting
      a
      1660Ti
      might
      as
      well
      spend
      the
      extra
      $70
      for
      a
      card
      that
      performs
      about
      20%
      better
      according

      :)
      Shamus
      had
      been
      walking
      through
      the
      Eternal
      Garden
      for
      a
      while
      now,
      exploring
      the
      different
      features
      it
      had
      to
      offer:
      the
      bright,
      green
      vegetation,
      the
      fully
      blossomed
      colorful
      flowers,
      and
      the
      diverse
      species
      of
      animals
      that
      lived
      in
      the
      Garden.
      He
      lived
      in
      a
      village
      in
      the
      Garden
      in
      a
      nice
      valley
      but
      had
      never
      gotten
      the
      opportunity
      to
      explore
      the
      Garden
      in
      depth.
      Shamus
      usually
      stayed
      close
      to
      his
      village
      since
      he
      was
      still
      a
      growing
      teen.
      He
      had
      been
      exploring
      for
      a
      few
      hours
      and
      had
      just
      walked
      through
      a
      vibrant
      forest
      with
      large
      maple
      trees
      with
      a
      creek
      that
      slivered
      through
      the
      forest.
      Though
      seeing
      many
      small
      animals
      and
      hearing
      many
      birds
      in
      the
      forest,
      as
      Shamus
      reached
      the
      border
      he
      neglected
      the
      wildlife
      becoming
      distant
      as
      he
      reached
      the
      edge
      of
      the
      forest
      into
      a
      new
      area
      of
      the
      Garden.
      Tired
      and
      looking
      to
      take
      a
      break,
      Shamus
      turned
      a
      corner
      behind
      a
      small
      stone
      wall
      and
      sat
      down
      on
      a
      tree
      stump.
      He
      noticed
      this
      area
      was
      a
      bit
      dark
      and
      eerie
      compared
      to
      the
      rest
      of
      the
      Garden
      he
      had
      explored
      so
      far.
      Not
      eating
      in
      a
      while,
      he
      noticed
      deep
      blue
      mushrooms
      growing
      on
      both
      the
      grass
      and
      in
      the
      stump
      right
      beside
      him.
      Feeling
      hungry,
      Shamus
      was
      instantly
      intrigued
      by
      these
      mushrooms.
      He
      plucked
      one
      from
      the
      tree
      stump
      and
      held
      it
      in
      his
      hand.
      The
      mushroom
      was
      a
      few
      inches
      long
      and
      the
      head
      was
      quite
      a
      few
      inches
      wide;
      the
      fungi
      taking
      up
      the
      entirety
      of
      his
      palm.
      He
      popped
      it
      in
      his
      mouth
      and
      chewed.
      The
      dry,
      bitter
      taste
      was
      not
      satisfying,
      but
      there
      was
      nothing
      else
      to
      eat.
      Shamus
      chewed
      up
      the
      mushroom,
      swallowed
      it,
      and
      was
      surprisingly
      full.
      He
      decided
      to
      sit
      on
      the
      stump
      for
      a
      little
      while
      longer
      before
      continuing
      his
      exploration
      throughout
      the
      Garden.
      All
      of
      a
      sudden,
      an
      uneasy
      feeling
      in
      his
      stomach
      and
      sensed
      a
      different
      feeling
      he
      had
      never
      felt
      before.
      This
      induced
      Shamus
      into
      a
      panic,
      as
      he
      quickly
      stood
      up
      and
      took
      a
      few
      steps
      forward
      from
      behind
      the
      stone
      wall
      to
      see
      where
      he
      should
      walk
      next.
      But
      this
      feeling
      was
      so
      overwhelming
      he
      forgot
      which
      direction
      he
      had
      come
      from.
      As
      he
      turned
      around,
      he
      noticed
      a
      thick
      vine
      moving
      up
      the
      stone
      wall.
      He
      followed
      the
      vine
      up
      the
      wall,
      only
      to
      be
      looking
      up
      at
      the
      face
      of
      an
      extremely
      frightening
      creature;
      a
      fierce
      monster
      with
      a
      disfigured
      alicorn,
      horns,
      and
      deep,
      red
      eyes
      gazing
      right
      back
      at
      Shamus.
      This
      beast
      had
      such
      large,
      sharp
      teeth
      and
      not
      all
      of
      them
      fit
      in
      its
      mouth
      with
      the
      mouth
      being
      fully
      closed.
      Sensing
      Shamus's
      fear,
      one
      foot
      of
      this
      monstrosity
      began
      to
      slink
      toward
      Shamus.
      Then
      another
      foot.
      This
      beast
      had
      come
      off
      of
      the
      wall
      entirely
      at
      this
      point
      and
      stood.
      This
      monstrosity
      was
      twice
      as
      tall
      as
      Shamus
      and
      very
      lean.
      Under
      his
      chin
      was
      a
      bunch
      of
      smooth,
      clean
      gray
      fur.
      Caught
      in
      a
      daze,
      Shamus
      took
      a
      rapid
      glance
      around
      him
      and
      noticed
      the
      many
      graves
      that
      had
      been
      there
      for
      hundreds
      of
      years
      and
      immediately
      knew
      he
      was
      in
      a
      bad
      place
      of
      the
      Garden
      and
      needed
      to
      escape.
      Shamus
      began
      to
      run.
      The
      beast
      behind
      him
      let
      out
      a
      deep
      roar
      that
      echoed
      throughout
      the
      surrounding
      areas
      and
      sent
      flocks
      of
      birds
      to
      retreat.
      Shamus
      took
      off
      in
      the
      direction
      he
      was
      facing,
      an
      area
      of
      light
      brush
      and
      smaller
      trees,
      feeling
      the
      thumps
      in
      the
      ground
      of
      the
      beast
      chasing
      after
      him.
      Dodging
      and
      weaving
      around
      fallen
      trees
      and
      trunks
      with
      the
      beast
      in
      toe,
      Shamus's
      breathing
      became
      heavy
      and
      he
      was
      running
      out
      of
      energy,
      his
      mouth
      parched
      from
      dehydration.
      But
      he
      kept
      running
      as
      fast
      as
      he
      can.
      The
      beast
      swatted
      at
      Shamus
      from
      behind
      and
      caught
      a
      hold
      of
      his
      jacket,
      dragging
      Shamus
      closer
      to
      him.
      He
      wrapped
      his
      claws
      around
      Shamus
      and
      suspended
      him
      10
      feet
      in
      the
      air,
      right
      in
      front
      of
      his
      muzzle.
      Looking
      death
      in
      the
      face,
      Shamus
      felt
      the
      heavy
      exhales
      of
      the
      beast,
      encumbering
      him
      with
      humid
      bursts
      of
      gases
      exhausted
      by
      the
      beast.
      For
      being
      small
      and
      agile,
      Shamus
      was
      able
      to
      slip
      out
      of
      his
      thick
      wool
      jacket
      and
      landed
      on
      the
      ground,
      with
      his
      hat
      bouncing
      on
      the
      ground
      right
      beside
      him.
      Shamus
      took
      off
      again,
      in
      the
      distance
      he
      heard
      lots
      of
      water
      movement
      and
      realized
      he
      was
      coming
      to
      the
      edge
      of
      a
      cliff.
      To
      his
      right,
      he
      noticed
      a
      river
      turning
      into
      a
      waterfall.
      To
      his
      left,
      he
      caught
      a
      glimpse
      of
      a
      valley
      with
      a
      river
      where
      the
      waterfall
      was
      pouring
      into.
      With
      the
      beast
      right
      behind
      him,
      he
      knew
      he
      had
      to
      evade
      this
      devilish
      freak,
      and
      there
      was
      only
      one
      way
      to
      do
      that:
      jump.
      With
      the
      beast
      right
      behind
      him,
      Shamus
      took
      a
      few
      long
      lunges
      before
      throwing
      himself
      off
      the
      cliff.
      He
      could
      hear
      the
      beast's
      heavy
      breathing
      as
      if
      it
      was
      an
      arm's
      length
      away,
      which
      it
      was.
      As
      he
      leaped
      off
      the
      cliff,
      the
      beast
      swatted
      at
      Shamus
      one
      more
      time
      but
      wasn't
      willing
      to
      jump
      after
      him.
      On
      the
      way
      down,
      Shamus
      saw
      his
      village
      he
      lived
      in.
      A
      60
      foot
      drop
      into
      the
      river
      knocked
      the
      wind
      out
      of
      Shamus,
      and
      he
      was
      unable
      to
      function
      properly.
      He
      was
      just
      being
      carried
      by
      the
      current
      at
      this
      point
      and
      eventually
      drifted
      close
      to
      a
      river
      bank
      when
      he
      noticed
      an
      arm
      catch
      onto
      him
      and
      pull
      him
      out
      of
      the
      water.
      He
      passed
      out
      following
      this.
      After
      coming
      to,
      he
      was
      very
      weak
      and
      in
      a
      bed.
      His
      grandmother
      Aileen
      asked
      where
      he
      had
      been.
      He
      told
      her
      what
      happened,
      and
      she
      replied
      that
      it
      was
      all
      nonsense.
      He
      had
      just
      eaten
      poisonous
      mushrooms
      and
      had
      a
      bad
      experience
      because
      he
      took
      the
      mushrooms
      alone
      and
      it
      was
      his
      first
      time
      so
      he
      didn't
      know
      how
      to
      react.
      Aileen
      went
      on
      to
      explain
      that
      the
      Eternal
      Forest
      is
      a
      utopia.
      There
      are
      small
      villages
      and
      the
      Garden
      has
      plenty
      of
      resources
      that
      never
      run
      out.
      Everyone
      is
      safe
      in
      the
      Garden.
      Everyone
      is
      at
      peace.
      Aileen
      told
      Shamus
      he
      was
      going
      to
      be
      okay,
      handing
      him
      a
      cup
      of
      water,
      which
      Shamus
      gulped
      down
      quickly
      from
      having
      a
      parched
      mouth
      and
      being
      dehydrated.
      She
      advised
      him
      to
      not
      go
      alone
      the
      next
      time
      he
      wanted
      to
      explore
      the
      Garden.
      Nobody
      has
      found
      the
      edge
      of
      the
      Garden;
      there
      was
      much
      more
      to
      explore.
      Shamus
      was
      eager
      to
      go
      delve
      deeper
      into
      the
      Garden
      in
      a
      different
      area,
      but
      decided
      to
      get
      some
      rest
      for
      now.

      Just
      remember
      that
      conversation
      is
      a
      two-way
      street
      and
      there #8217;s
      so
      many
      people
      you
      can
      converse
      with.
      Sometimes
      the
      conversation
      with
      someone
      will
      be
      dry
      because
      they
      can #8217;t
      hold
      a
      conversation.
      The
      goal
      is
      to
      just
      keep
      the
      conversation
      rolling.
      If
      you
      don #8217;t
      know
      what
      to
      say
      try
      to
      observe
      your
      surroundings
      and
      comment
      on
      it
      or
      ask
      a
      question
      about
      something
      in
      or
      around
      the
      establishment
      Bottom
      line
      some
      people
      you
      connect
      with
      and
      some
      people
      you
      don #8217;t.

      Going
      to
      the
      gym
      was
      hard
      for
      me
      because
      I #8217;m
      a
      big
      dude
      but
      don #8217;t
      lift
      heavy
      because
      I
      just
      got
      into
      working
      out.
      At
      first
      I
      felt
      like
      people
      were
      staring
      at
      me
      and
      judging
      me
      but
      when
      I #8217;d
      actually
      take
      a
      break
      or
      finish
      a
      set
      I #8217;d
      look
      around
      and
      notice
      nobody
      gave
      a
      fuck
      as
      to
      what
      I
      was
      doing.
      Observe
      your
      surroundings
      when
      you
      start
      to
      get
      anxious
      and
      you #8217;ll
      notice
      everyone
      is
      minding
      their
      own
      business.
      If
      there #8217;s
      one
      person
      in
      the
      place
      staring

      you
      that #8217;s
      their
      problem
      if
      they
      want
      to
      judge
      you.
      They #8217;re
      wasting
      their
      own
      time
      looking
      you
      up

      college
      has
      been
      a
      shit
      show

      I
      self
      harmed
      for
      the
      first
      time
      in
      January,
      then
      a
      couple
      more
      times
      in
      a
      February,
      then
      again
      in
      March,
      and
      then
      again
      on
      Sunday
      night
      I
      definitely
      have
      a
      drinking
      problem,
      and
      school
      gives
      me
      a
      lot
      of
      anxiety
      and
      anticipation
      because
      I
      don #8217;t
      know
      how
      well
      I #8217;m
      going
      to
      end
      up
      doing.
      I
      like
      getting
      drunk
      to
      pass
      the
      time.
      Sometimes
      I
      get
      too
      drunk
      and
      look
      in
      the
      mirror
      and
      just
      hate
      what
      I
      see,
      have
      a
      small
      mental
      breakdown/panic
      attack,
      and
      I #8217;ll
      cut
      myself
      to
      feel
      better.
      It
      gives
      me
      this
      high
      that
      ends
      my
      attack
      I
      saw
      a
      psychiatrist
      about
      6
      weeks
      ago
      and
      was
      prescribed
      antidepressants
      and
      I #8217;m
      seeing
      a
      therapist
      in
      May.
      I #8217;m
      still
      young
      and
      live
      with
      my
      mom
      back
      home
      and
      she
      knows
      I #8217;ve
      been
      a
      bit
      depressed
      but
      she
      has
      no
      idea
      what #8217;s
      really
      been
      going
      on.
      My
      sister
      struggled
      with
      self
      harm
      when
      we
      were
      both
      in
      high
      school
      and
      my
      mom
      was
      sympathetic
      about
      it,
      but
      I
      don #8217;t
      want
      her
      to
      know
      it #8217;s
      a
      struggle
      another
      one
      of
      her
      kids
      is
      going
      through
      When
      I
      cut,
      alcohol
      is
      involved.
      If
      anyone
      has
      any
      advice
      on
      how
      to
      cut
      drinking
      and
      stop
      cutting
      please
      comment,
      this
      shit
      is
      getting
      scary,
      my
      antidepressants
      aren #8217;t
      helping,
      and
      I
      just
      want
      to
      feel
      better
