      It's
      worth
      it
      to
      note
      that
      these
      are
      aggregate
      win
      rates,
      not
      win
      rates
      at
      the
      time.
      When
      the
      Azir
      is
      at
      100
      games,
      they
      still
      have
      to
      pull
      up
      their
      35%
      winrate
      from
      when
      they
      were
      learning
      him.
      So
      that
      likely
      means
      that
      you're
      winning
      a
      whole
      lot
      more
      than
      52%
      of
      your
      games.

      Except
      Scarra
      is
      mid

      now,
      and
      doesn't

      I
      haven't
      set
      up
      my
      flair
      yet,
      but
      I'm
      a
      low
      diamond
      Azir
      player,
      and
      I
      actually
      disagree
      with
      most
      people
      here.
      Zed
      is
      actually
      a
      particularly
      easy
      matchup
      for
      Azir.
      You
      outrange
      his
      W-E-Q
      poke,
      as
      long
      as
      you
      position
      correctly
      in
      lane,
      and
      he
      is
      unable
      to
      gap
      close
      effectively
      on
      you.
      The
      2
      keys
      to
      this
      lane
      are
      1:
      avoiding
      poke,
      and
      2:Keeping
      him
      in
      front
      of
      you,
      and
      not
      behind
      you,
      at
      all
      times.
      You
      completely
      out
      poke
      Zed
      with
      the
      comet
      build,
      and
      its
      important
      that
      you
      poke
      him
      as
      much
      as
      possible
      to
      maintain
      a
      somewhat
      even
      priority
      in
      mid
      lane,
      so
      that
      you
      can
      effectively
      follow
      Zed
      to
      help
      your
      Jungler
      for
      skirmishes.
      What
      I
      mean
      by
      keep
      Zed
      in
      front
      of
      you,
      is
      that
      you
      always
      want
      to
      have
      an
      out
      with
      your
      E
      and
      your
      Q.
      When
      Zed
      ults
      you,
      he
      will
      appear
      directly
      behind
      you,
      meaning
      that
      you
      can
      consistently
      use
      your
      own
      ultimate
      to
      CC
      him
      before
      he
      can
      use
      an
      ability,
      and
      W-E
      yourself
      to
      escape.
      Your
      W-E
      is
      the
      same
      length
      or
      longer
      than
      the
      Zed's
      W,
      and
      he
      can't
      follow
      you,
      as
      he
      has
      been
      pushed
      even
      further
      with
      your
      ultimate.
      Surviving
      Zed's
      ultimate
      with
      minimal
      damage
      remove's
      Zed's
      ability
      to
      kill
      you
      without
      jungler
      help,
      gaining
      you
      priority
      in
      lane,
      as
      you
      rely
      on
      ultimate
      much
      less
      than
      Zed
      does.

      I
      disagree
      entirely.
      Don't
      Ult
      Zed
      back
      into
      your
      tower,
      he
      can
      just
      escape
      with
      W,
      and
      kill
      you
      while
      he's
      at
      it!
      When
      Zed
      ults,
      you
      ult
      too,
      and
      you
      time
      it
      so
      that
      you
      shove
      him
      towards
      his
      own
      tower,
      and
      immediately
      dash
      away.
      Zed
      cannot
      gap
      close
      back
      onto
      you
      without
      both
      flash
      and
      W
      if
      you
      used
      just
      W-E,
      and
      if
      you
      used
      the
      full
      W-E-Q,
      Zed
      can't
      even
      catch
      up
      with
      a
      summoner
      spell.

      You
      don't
      need
      to
      rush
      Zhonya
      man,
      Zed
      won't
      be
      ulting
      you
      in
      teamfights,
      you
      have
      too
      much
      crowd
      control.
      Seeker's
      armguard
      is
      often
      enough
      to
      deter
      Zed
      from
      ulting
      you,
      and
      if
      you
      are
      far
      enough
      ahead
      that
      he
      has
      to
      ult
      you
      instead
      of
      the
      ADC,
      then
      grabbing
      just
      a
      stopwatch
      is
      enough
      to
      win
      a
      key
      fight.
      If
      you
      still
      need
      Zhonyas,
      you
      can
      most
      of
      the
      time
      delay
      it
      until
      your
      3rd
      item,
      after
      oblivion
      orb
      at
      least.

      Yep,
      you're
      gonna
      suck
      when
      you
      start.
      I
      would
      suggest
      learning
      Azir
      on
      electrocute,
      as
      it
      teaches
      you
      how
      to
      properly
      poke
      in
      lane.
      Most
      of
      Azir's
      difficulty
      actually
      comes
      from
      positioning,
      and
      not
      combos,
      so
      theres
      not
      really
      a
      set
      of
      combos
      you
      need
      to
      be
      able
      to
      pull
      off.
      The
      one
      thing
      I
      think
      you
      need
      to
      be
      able
      to
      do
      is
      the
      Shurima
      shuffle,
      as
      it's
      the
      only
      way
      to
      set
      up
      ganks
      for
      your
      jungler.

      I

      I
      mean,
      you're
      going
      to
      have
      to
      be
      more
      specfic.
      Every
      champ
      has
      a
      different
      threat
      range,
      and
      a
      different
      position
      you
      need
      to
      be
      in,
      at
      least
      in
      lane.
      When
      it
      comes
      to
      teamfight,
      you
      always
      need
      to
      position
      your
      frontline
      (or
      any
      champion
      tbh)
      between
      you,
      and
      the
      enemy
      threats.
      One
      video
      that
      helped
      me
      with
      positioning
      was
      this:
      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwE9wPwHCuU
      It's
      not
      Azir
      specific,
      but
      positioning
      is
      not
      champion
      specific,
      so
      it
      will
      help
      you.
      The
      one
      other
      thing
      I
      would
      say,
      is
      that
      Azir
      is
      uniquely
      squishy
      among
      mages,
      his
      base
      stats
      are
      just
      really
      low,
      and
      he
      has
      no
      self
      peel
      outside
      of

      you

      to
      roaming

      you
      if

      is
      to
      follow
      at
      a

      and
      take
      the
      shorter,
      longer

      Absolutely
      its
      possible.
      Azir
      is
      actually
      really
      good
      right
      now,
      because
      he
      has
      severable
      favorable
      matchups
      in
      the
      mid
      lane
      right
      now
      like
      Lissandra
      and
      Galio.
      As
      to
      how
      long
      it
      will
      take,
      riot
      Blastoise
      recently
      posted
      the
      mastery
      curve
      for
      Azir.
      It
      takes
      about
      75
      games
      to
      reach
      a
      50%
      wr
      with
      the
      champion,
      but
      thats
      an
      average,
      and
      you
      could
      get
      there
      faster
      if
      you
      are
      effective
      with
      your
      practice.
      The
      thing
      about
      learning
      a
      champion
      like
      Azir,
      is
      that
      in
      the
      long
      term,
      it's
      a
      good
      investment
      of
      your
      time.
      He
      won't
      be
      nerfed
      if
      he
      doesn't
      see
      extensive
      play
      in
      competitive,
      because
      he
      already
      sits
      at
      such
      a
      low
      winrate.
      If
      you
      learn
      Azir
      now,
      it
      will
      pay
      dividends
      in
      the
      future.
      Also,
      he's
      like,
      hella
      fun.

      You're
      mostly
      correct,
      but
      you
      did
      make
      a

      push,
      but
      I
      think

      you
      would

      more
      quickly
      back
      towards
      you.

      One
      of
      Azir's
      strengths
      is
      his
      safety
      because
      of
      the
      w
      e
      q
      combo.
      With
      proper
      wave
      and
      vision
      control
      you
      honestly
      should
      never
      die
      to
      a
      gank,
      especially
      against
      Nunu
      Talon
      who
      lack
      strong
      gap
      closers.
      With
      proper
      vision
      control,
      you
      can
      punish
      roams
      by
      shoving
      into
      tower,
      and
      getting
      a
      plate.
      If
      you
      help
      your
      teammates
      to
      not
      die
      from
      Talon
      Nunu,
      using
      danger
      and
      retreat
      pings,
      you
      can
      gain
      an
      advantage,
      build
      seekers,
      and
      start
      applying
      pressure
      on
      talon.
      You
      asked
      how
      do
      you
      play
      when
      your
      behind
      against
      talon,
      unfortunately
      the
      answer
      is
      that
      you
      dont.
      If
      Azir
      dies
      in
      lane
      he
      becomes
      useless
      until
      Nashors,
      and
      you
      cant
      help
      your
      team
      against
      a
      snowballing
      mid
      laner.
      The
      only
      way
      you
      win
      from
      behind
      is
      by
      not
      getting
      behind
      in
      the
      first
      place.

      Try
      leaving
      soldiers
      behind
      you
      over
      the
      side
      wall
      if
      you
      have
      the
      mana!
      Simple
      and
      easy
      escape.
      Also
      remember
      that
      if
      you're
      behind,
      you
      don't
      need
      to
      ward
      the
      pixel
      brush,
      the
      side
      brush
      is
      often
      good
      enough,
      and
      you
      can
      ward
      those
      safely.
      Lastly,
      if
      you
      shove
      the
      wave
      correctly,
      you
      shouldn't
      miss
      out
      on
      any
      cs
      as
      you
      place
      your
      pink
      in
      the
      pixel
      brush,
      simply
      shove
      the
      wave,
      then
      head
      back
      to
      your
      tower,
      and
      walk
      in
      from
      the
      jungle
      entrance.
      You're
      right,
      if
      you
      don't
      know
      where
      Talon
      is
      you
      can't
      walk
      into
      the
      jungle
      unless
      you're
      willing
      to
      use
      your
      ult
      to
      save
      yourself.
