      Is
      co
      sleeping
      ok?
      Him
      and
      I
      broke
      up
      10
      months
      ago.
      He
      moved
      out
      while
      I
      was
      at
      work.
      It
      was
      a
      brake
      because
      I
      was
      having
      melt
      downs
      over
      repeatedly
      dealing
      with
      his
      problem
      of
      women.
      He
      was
      staying
      at
      his
      work
      and
      said
      I
      could
      trust
      him
      there
      and
      we
      would
      get
      therapy.
      That
      brake
      turned
      into
      a
      full
      brake
      up.
      He
      started
      dating
      a
      coworker
      who
      worked
      all
      summer
      with
      him.
      It #8217;s
      a
      small
      town
      community.
      My
      parents
      friends
      ended
      up
      telling
      me,
      then
      my
      cousin.
      Her
      told
      boss.
      She
      has
      not
      been
      nice
      to
      me
      at
      all
      since
      end
      October.
      He
      brought
      her
      around
      our
      two
      children.
      And
      is
      co
      sleeping.
      He
      belittled
      me
      as
      mother
      and
      makes
      her
      seem
      better
      then
      me.
      He
      did
      not
      allow
      me
      to
      have
      much
      to
      do
      with
      his
      son.
      He #8217;s
      hardly
      seen
      our
      children
      for
      6
      months
      and
      now
      college
      is
      out
      he
      wants
      them
      all
      the
      time
      and
      won #8217;t
      see
      them
      without
      her.
      She
      just
      now
      got
      ahold
      of
      me
      after
      all
      this
      time
      and
      said
      she
      only
      just
      found
      out
      he
      was
      engaged.
      What
      in
      the
      hell?

      I
      just
      don #8217;t
      feel
      it #8217;s
      a
      girlfriends
      place
      to
      be
      in
      bed
      with
      our
      children.
      This
      relationship
      came
      about
      very
      fast
      and
      there
      are
      still
      things
      to
      work
      out
      such
      as
      cutting
      emotional
      ties
      and
      how
      to
      parent
      them.
      I
      feel
      she
      should
      back
      off
      of
      the
      children.
      I
      don #8217;t
      care
      he
      is
      dating.
      What
      has
      happened
      to
      me,
      may
      happen
      with
      her.
      I
      don #8217;t
      approve
      of
      the
      sleeping
      thing.
      I
      have
      an
      older
      child
      and
      no
      I
      never
      did
      that.
      Nor
      would
      I
      now.
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      it #8217;s
      right.
      I #8217;m
      told
      I #8217;m
      being

      I
      am
      the
      custodial
      parent.
      I #8217;m
      the
      only
      parent
      on
      my
      two
      daughters
      birth
      certificates.
      There
      father
      has
      chosen
      not
      to
      be
      on
      them.
      I #8217;m
      not
      sure
      why
      really.
      One
      daughter
      is
      3,
      the
      other
      is
      2.
      The
      father
      sees
      them
      about
      once
      a
      week,
      or
      less.
      No
      support
      is
      paid.
      Him
      and
      I
      were
      together
      5
      years
      before
      he
      walked
      out
      on
      my
      for
      a
      much
      younger
      coworker.
      Him
      and
      I
      had
      a
      parenting
      plan
      before
      she
      was
      in
      the
      picture.
      At
      first
      she
      was
      around
      my
      behind
      my
      back.
      Once
      she
      finely
      spoke
      with
      me
      after
      7
      months,
      she
      claimed
      she
      didn #8217;t
      know
      he
      was
      engaged,
      and
      would
      slow
      down
      with
      the
      child
      and
      not
      be
      around
      them
      anymore
      tell
      the
      time
      is
      right.
      Since
      then
      my
      wishes
      have
      not
      been
      respected
      whatsoever
      by
      this
      women.
      I
      have
      also
      be
      told
      that
      she
      and
      the
      father
      share
      a
      bed
      with
      the
      children
      if
      there
      is
      an
      overnight.
      I
      consider
      this
      highly
      inappropriate.
      Even
      in
      the
      beginning
      of
      his
      and
      my
      relationship,
      his
      son
      had
      his
      own
      room
      and
      bed.
      I
      also
      had
      the
      mother #8217;s
      permission
      before
      meeting
      the
      child.
      He
      had
      my
      sons
      fathers
      permission.
      I #8217;m
      being
      told
      my
      requests
      are
      unreasonable.
      I #8217;ve
      been
      doing
      my
      best
      to
      fallow
      unmarried
      fathers
      rights
      for
      him.
      But
      as
      the
      sole
      caretaker/supporter
      of
      these
      two
      little
      girls
      I #8217;m
      tired
      of
      not
      having
      my
      wishes
      respected
      my
      them.
      This
      new
      woman
      about
      8
      years
      younger
      then
      us,
      she #8217;s
      currently
      in
      college
      to
      become
      and
      elementary
      teacher.
      I
      feel
      that
      not
      my
      right
      as
      there
      mother
      are
      being
      violated
      but
      also
      I
      feel
      the
      code
      of
      ethics
      for
      teachers
      has
      been
      violated
      as
      well.
      Above
      all,
      teachers
      must
      demonstrate
      integrity,
      impartiality
      and
      ethical
      behavior
      in
      the
      classroom
      and
      in
      their
      conduct
      with
      parents,
      coworkers
      and
      children.
      I
      don #8217;t
      know
      really
      what
      i
      should
      do
      regarding
      this.
      Is
      it
      something
      I
      can
      do
      anything
      legally
      about?
      Or
      have
      an
      officer
      speak
      to
      her
      about?
      So
      the
      I #8217;ve
      been
      told
      to
      file
      child
      abuse
      because
      of
      the
      sleeping
      in
      bed
      with
      my
      children.
      Or
      stop
      all
      visits
      with
      the
      father
      since
      he
      isn #8217;t
      in
      the
      birth
      certificates
      anyway,
      and
      hasn #8217;t
      done
      anything
      to
      be
      on
      them.
      I
      just
      want
      her
      to
      leave
      my
      children
      alone
      tell
      things
      are
      more
      settled
      down
      and
      there
      father
      and
      I
      are
      on
      better
      terms.
      I #8217;m
      at
      my
      wits
      end
      with
      all
      of
      this.

      I #8217;ve

      is
      right.
      Since
      then
      my
      wishes
      have
      not
      been
      respected
      whatsoever
      by
      this
      women.
      I
      have
      also
      be
      told
      that
      she
      and
      the
      father
      share
      a
      bed
      with
      the
      children
      if
      there
      is
      an
      overnight.
      I
      consider
      this
      highly
      inappropriate.
      Even
      in
      the
      beginning
      of
      his
      and
      my
      relationship,
      his
      son
      had
      his
      own
      room
      and
      bed.
      I
      also
      had
      the
      mother #8217;s
      permission
      before
      meeting
      the
      child.
      He
      had
      my
      sons
      fathers
      permission.
      I #8217;m
      being
      told
      my
      requests
      are
      unreasonable.
      I #8217;ve
      been
      doing
      my
      best
      to
      fallow
      unmarried
      fathers
      rights
      for
      him.
      But
      as
      the
      sole
      caretaker/supporter
      of
      these
      two
      little
      girls
      I #8217;m
      tired
      of
      not
      having
      my
      wishes
      respected
      my
      them.
      This
      new
      woman
      about
      8
      years
      younger
      then
      us,
      she #8217;s
      currently
      in
      college
      to
      become
      and
      elementary
      teacher.
      I
      feel
      that
      not
      my
      right
      as
      there
      mother
      are
      being
      violated
      but
      also
      I
      feel
      the
      code
      of
      ethics
      for
      teachers
      has
      been
      violated
      as
      well.
      Above
      all,
      teachers
      must
      demonstrate
      integrity,
      impartiality
      and
      ethical
      behavior
      in
      the
      classroom
      and
      in
      their
      conduct
      with
      parents,
      coworkers
      and
      children.
      I
      don #8217;t
      know
      really
      what
      i
      should
      do
      regarding
      this.
      Is
      it
      something
      I
      can
      do
      anything
      legally
      about?
      Or
      have
      an
      officer
      speak
      to
      her
      about?
      So
      the
      I #8217;ve
      been
      told
      to
      file
      child
      abuse
      because
      of
      the
      sleeping
      in
      bed
      with
      my
      children.
      Or
      stop
      all
      visits
      with
      the
      father
      since
      he
      isn #8217;t
      in
      the
      birth
      certificates
      anyway,
      and
      hasn #8217;t
      done
      anything
      to
      be
      on
      them.
      I
      just
      want
      her
      to
      leave
      my
      children
      alone
      tell
      things
      are
      more
      settled
      down
      and
      there
      father
      and
      I
      are
      on
      better
      terms.
      I #8217;m
      at
      my
      wits
      end
      with
      all
      of
      this.

      It #8217;s
      not
      at
      all
      that
      I
      don #8217;t
      like
      her.
      I
      don #8217;t
      know
      her.
      We
      don #8217;t
      have
      a
      custody
      agreement.
      I
      fully
      support
      them
      in
      very
      way
      shape
      and
      form.
      I #8217;ve
      given
      him
      the
      paternity
      affidavits
      and
      everything.
      I #8217;ve
      done
      everything
      to
      get
      him
      on
      the
      birth
      certificates.
      I #8217;ve
      even
      given
      him
      Iowa #8217;s
      cohabitation
      outline
      to
      fill
      out.
      It
      being
      done
      behind
      my
      back
      bothers
      me.
      Our
      children
      didn #8217;t
      even
      have
      time
      to
      adjust.
      In
      the
      beginning
      I
      asked
      to
      please
      stop
      and
      wait
      a
      few
      months.
      She
      was
      around
      the
      children
      right
      away.
      One
      child
      stopped
      using
      the
      bathroom
      and
      went
      fully
      back
      into
      diapers.
      I
      was
      told
      by
      her
      doctor
      it
      was
      anxiety.
      She #8217;s
      just
      now
      using
      the
      potty.
      To
      me,
      about
      now
      is
      when
      the
      girlfriend
      should
      be
      getting
      to
      know
      them.
      It #8217;s
      about
      8,
      9
      months
      in.
      I #8217;m
      still
      letting
      the
      children
      see
      him.
      All
      he
      does
      is
      see
      them
      a
      few
      hours
      a
      week
      then
      drops
      them
      off
      anymore.

      As
      for
      our
      parenting
      plan,
      I
      have
      not
      stopped
      abiding
      by
      it.
      He
      has.
      We
      agreed
      on
      how
      to
      handle
      significant
      others
      before
      we
      tried
      for
      children.
      Our
      original
      agreement
      says
      he
      gets
      3
      days
      a
      week,
      would
      help
      with
      needs.
      I
      agreed
      no
      child
      support
      would
      be
      filed
      or
      anything
      like
      that.
      A
      lawyer
      told
      me
      stop
      visitation.
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      that #8217;s
      right
      at
      all.

      We
      live
      in
      Iowa.
      I
      have
      spoke
      to
      a
      lawyer.
      I
      was
      told
      to
      stop
      contact.
      I
      have
      not
      because
      that #8217;s
      fully
      unfair.
      I #8217;m
      not
      being
      controlling
      at
      all.
      I
      want
      our
      parenting
      guidelines
      to
      be
      upheld.
      And
      I
      want
      my
      wishes
      to
      be
      respected
      as
      there
      mother.
      I #8217;m
      fallowing
      what
      we
      had
      set.
      He #8217;s
      has
      broken
      his
      own
      agreement.
      I #8217;m
      not
      happy
      about
      that.
      Things
      need
      to
      be
      consistent.
      I
      raise
      the
      girls
      100%
      on
      my
      own
      beside
      when
      he
      chooses
      to
      see
      them.
      So
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      I #8217;m
      being
      controlling
      and
      vindictive
      by
      wanting
      him
      to
      stick
      to
      our
      agreement
      of
      how
      we
      would
      handle
      things
      with
      our
      children.
      If
      he
      kept
      his
      part
      like
      I
      have,
      then
      I
      wouldn #8217;t
      be
      asking
      any
      of
      this
      in
      the
      first
      place

      Your
      are
      right.
      What #8217;s
      stopping
      me
      is
      that
      they

      already
      lost
      so
      much
      time
      with
      him,
      because
      he
      was
      going

      town
      so
      much
      to

      They
      are
      so
      happy
      to
      see
      him.
      I
      really
      don #8217;t

      to

      out

      me
      though

      not

      them
      raised
      to
      think
      that
      it #8217;s
      ok
      to
      be
      dishonest,unfaithful
      and
      to
      brake
      peoples
      trust.

      My
      son
      is
      13.
      I
      Never
      wanted
      children
      again
      because
      of
      how
      hard
      pregnancy
      is
      on
      my
      body
      due
      to
      medical
      conditions
      and
      how
      fast/painful.
      My
      ex
      husband
      didn #8217;t
      help.
      Years
      later
      I
      got
      pregnant
      the
      first
      time
      I
      had
      sex
      with
      my
      two
      daughters
      father.
      I
      miscarried
      because
      of
      having
      an
      iud
      replaced
      and
      a
      midwifes
      horrible
      judgement.
      Down
      the
      road
      we
      agreed
      to
      try.
      Took
      us
      a
      year
      to
      get
      me
      pregnant
      again.
      10
      years
      difference,
      then
      I
      got
      pregnant
      right
      away.
      11
      year
      difference
      between
      oldest
      and
      youngest.
      13,3,2
      are
      the
      ages.
      The
      girls
      father
      ended
      up
      walking
      out
      on
      me
      and
      was
      not
      truthful
      about
      why
      or
      anything
      about
      it.
      I
      don #8217;t
      get
      child
      support
      and
      there
      father
      doesn #8217;t
      see
      them
      unless
      it
      works
      around
      his
      new
      girlfriend
      he
      basically
      left
      me
      for.
      Now
      my
      son
      helps
      babysit,
      gets
      up
      with
      them
      at
      night
      if
      need
      be.
      Everything.
      I #8217;m
      glad
      the
      age
      gap
      is
      so
      big
      because
      of
      how
      much
      help
      he
      is.
      He
      sees
      his
      father
      and
      step
      mother
      on
      weekends,
      his
      step
      sister
      is
      his
      age
      so
      he
      gets
      time
      to
      fully
      be
      13
      and
      not
      have
      to
      help
      with
      his
      sisters.
      Because
      of
      the
      age
      gap
      I
      think
      the
      3
      of
      them
      will
      have
      a
      closer,
      better
      adult
      life
      because
      of
      there
      dynamics.

      My
      two
      daughters
      father
      is
      a
      non
      custodial
      parent.
      If
      you
      don #8217;t
      have
      arguments
      worked
      out
      with
      the
      courts
      I
      have
      studied
      up
      on
      it.
      I #8217;ve
      looked
      into
      brith
      certificates,
      custody
      work
      sheets
      even
      to
      a
      cohabitation
      agreement
      so
      all
      party #8217;s
      are
      happy.
      Not
      one
      is
      filled
      out.
      Your
      not
      rightless
      but
      there
      is
      more
      power
      over
      you.
      This
      is
      only
      my
      situation
      but
      who
      I
      want
      around
      them
      is
      always
      disrespected.
      I
      do
      have
      legal
      right
      to
      keep
      them
      from
      anyone
      who
      comes
      around
      them
      without
      my
      permission.
      I
      let
      him
      do
      it
      but
      don #8217;t
      clam
      on
      taxes
      unless
      it #8217;s
      100%
      ok
      and
      no
      worries
      of
      court.
      Protect
      yourself.
      Most
      women
      suck.
      If
      you
      want
      I
      have
      tons
      on
      fathers
      rights.
      I #8217;ve
      watch
      his
      son
      be
      kept
      and
      asked
      to
      sign
      his
      right
      away.
      Never.
      I
      saw
      that
      pain.
      If
      you
      can
      get
      your
      50%.

      I #8217;m
      just
      trying
      to
      find
      out
      how
      this
      would
      go
      in
      court.
      I
      don #8217;t
      believe
      anything
      like
      this
      should
      be
      so
      difficult
      since
      I #8217;m
      not
      keeping
      the
      kids
      from
      there
      father
      or
      his
      family.
      Only
      the
      new
      girlfriend
      who
      has
      crossed
      lines
      to
      where
      I
      think
      her
      being
      away
      from
      them
      is
      in
      there
      best
      interest.
      The
      father
      and
      his
      family
      won #8217;t
      see
      the
      children
      without
      her
      or
      help
      support
      them?
      They
      say
      I #8217;m
      withholding
      them.
      I
      have
      repeatedly
      said
      come
      get
      them?
      But
      no
      girlfriend
      for
      now.
      I
      just
      want
      things
      to
      be
      worked
      out
      and
      settled
      first.
      This
      new
      girlfriend
      needs
      to
      respect
      boundaries.

      Am
      I
      braking
      any
      laws?
      What
      would
      be
      the

      of
      this,
      if

      how
      would
      this
      situation
      be
      viewed?
      I #8217;m
      not
      withholding
      them.
      So
      I
      don #8217;t
      understand
      why
      they
      don #8217;t
      see
      the
      children
      without
      some
      girlfriend.
      Why
      would
      his
      mother
      get
      a
      lawyer
      to
      see
      the
      kids
      but
      not
      for
      her
      own
      son?
      She
      can
      get
      the
      children
      at
      anytime,
      she
      is
      just
      refusing
      not
      too.
      I
      have
      no
      idea
      how
      this
      would
      be

      It #8217;s
      almost
      been
      a
      year.
      Honestly
      I #8217;m
      worse.
      My
      engagement
      ring
      is
      still
      on.
      I
      cry
      everyday.
      He #8217;s
      all
      I
      want.
      He
      won #8217;t
      even
      look
      at
      me
      when/if
      he
      gets
      our
      kids.
      Everything
      is
      a
      nightmare.
      He
      wasn #8217;t
      good
      to
      me
      in
      our
      relationship.
      I
      took
      care
      for
      him
      during
      legal
      matters.
      When
      he
      was
      out
      he
      would
      cheat.
      He
      would
      even
      talk
      to
      other
      girls
      in
      front
      of
      me.
      The
      new
      girlfriend
      is
      a
      girl
      he
      met
      at
      the
      job
      my
      father
      and
      I
      got
      him.
      I
      hear
      about
      her
      off
      and
      on
      all
      last
      summer.
      Tell
      the
      day
      he
      picked
      a
      fight
      and
      walked
      out...
      it
      was
      a
       #8220;brake #8221;.
      Then
      the
      distance
      started.
      He
      even
      stood
      me
      up.
      He
      always
      had
      to
      to
      go
      the
      the
      restaurant
      for
      this
      or
      that.
      More
      and
      more
      rudeness.
      Tell
      one
      day
      he
      got
      mad
      about
      taxes,
      then
      he
      told
      me
      about
      her
      in
      a
      cruel
      manor.
      Everything
      moved
      so
      fast.
      He
      just
      kept
      saying
      horrible
      things.
      I #8217;m
      a
      fat
      cunt
      a
      bad
      mom
      everything.
      Then
      he
      got
      mad
      again
      and
      said
      he
      had
      our
      children
      around
      her
      behind
      my
      back.
      Anymore
      he
      always
      uses
      our
      daughters
      to
      hurt
      me
      with
      this
      new
      girlfriend.
      I #8217;ve
      asked
      for
      closure
      or
      an
      explanation.
      He
      said
      I
      just
      don #8217;t
      deserve
      one.
      Our
      relationship
      was
      dead?
      Dead?
      The
      night
      before
      he
      left
      we
      had
      sex
      multiple
      times
      and
      we
      were
      finished
      making
      honeymoon
      plans.
      He
      was
      soooo
      in
      love.
      Then
      next
      day
      our
      relationship
      was
      dead?
      Huh!?
      I
      had
      asked
      about
      one
      girl
      a
      few
      times
      all
      summer.
      But
      apparently
      I
      was
      delusional
      as
      his
      mother
      put
      it.
      He
      took
      a
      lot
      of
      my
      things
      he
      wanted
      and
      anything
      that
      could
      be
      questioned
      while
      I
      was
      at
      work.
      He
      made
      me
      pack
      up
      the
      rest.
      He
      made
      me
      pack
      his
      clothes
      shoes?
      Any
      time
      we
      talk
      it #8217;s
      my
      chick
      this
      my
      chick
      that.
      Come
      Christmas
      a
      box
      for
      him
      was
      in
      my
      parents
      trash.
      My
      mom
      already
      googled
      it.
      Moon
      magic???
      He
      got
      her
      a
      ring.
      He
      sent
      her
      fucking
      ring
      to
      my
      parents!!
      He
      knows
      I
      bring
      in
      there
      mail?
      He
      lied
      to
      me
      about
      it.
      Said
      a
      friend
      had
      him
      get
      it.
      Nope.
      It
      was
      for
      her.
      Took
      her
      2
      months
      to
      get
      a
      ring.
      Took
      me
      5
      years.
      What
      a
      slap
      in
      the
      face.
      In
      February
      I
      think
      I
      had
      to
      work
      tell
      4
      Am.
      I
      asked
      him
      to
      keep
      the
      kids.
      He
      couldn #8217;t.
      He
      was
      going
      to
      the
      symphony.
      I
      asked
      him
      our
      whole
      relationship
      to
      come
      with
      me.
      I
      even
      bought
      a
      beautiful
      white
      dress.
      He
      even
      yelled
      at
      me
      that
      he
      would
      never
      go,
      shut
      up
      it
      wasn #8217;t
      his
      thing.
      Now
      he #8217;s
      taking
      her.
      Even
      social
      media.
      He #8217;s
      blasting
      pictures
      of
      her.
      In
      almost
      8
      years
      only
      one
      or
      two
      of
      me....
      any
      boundaries
      we
      had
      set
      for
      our
      children
      are
      violated.
      She
      said
      to
      me
      the
      only
      time
      she
      cares
      to
      even
      talk
      to
      me,
      she
      didn #8217;t
      know
      he
      was
      engaged?
      In
      a
      small
      town...at
      a
      gossipy
      mom
      and
      pop
      shop????
      Bullshit.
      I
      heard
      about
      this
      chick
      before
      he
      left
      me.
      He
      most
      definitely
      had
      been
      cheating
      but
      both
      can #8217;t
      admit
      it.
      To
      this
      day
      he
      still
      is
      ghosting
      me.
      If
      she
      isn #8217;t
      around
      he
      won #8217;t
      see
      his
      kids.
      He
      doesn #8217;t
      support
      them.
      He
      wont
      do
      anything.
      He
      treats
      me
      like
      a
      one
      night
      stand
      not
      his
      ex
      fianc #233;.
      Even
      his
      family
      acts
      different.
      Everyone
      treats
      her
      better.
      I #8217;m
      accused
      of
      keeping
      the
      kids
      from
      him.
      I #8217;ve
      said
      repeatedly
      I #8217;m
      not
      keeping
      the
      kids,
      come
      get
      them.
      But
      since
      I
      tried
      all
      summer
      to
      find
      a
      middle
      ground
      and
      both
      didn #8217;t
      work
      with
      me.
      This
      new
      girlfriend
      doesn #8217;t
      need
      to
      be
      around
      the
      kids
      tell
      we
      have
      a
      middle
      ground
      because
      this
      back
      and
      forth
      is
      stupid.
      She #8217;s
      the
      only
      issue
      anyway?
      We
      should
      be
      able
      to
      parent
      without
      her
      needing
      an
      opinion
      or
      anything
      else.
      I #8217;ve
      even
      been
      told
      how
      he
      will
      discuss
      things
      about
      our
      children
      with
      her?
      Excuse
      me?
      I
      don #8217;t
      remember
      her
      being
      in
      bed
      with
      us
      when
      we
      made
      the
      kids?
      Or
      in
      the
      room
      when
      I
      delivered
      them?
      Last
      I
      knew
      she
      has
      not
      legal
      right
      to
      the
      children?
      The
      children
      are
      not
      her
      business.
      It #8217;s
      to
      where
      his
      own
      mom
      says
      she
      will
      get
      a
      lawyer
      because
      I #8217;m
      keeping
      them?
      Mind
      you
      she
      won #8217;t
      babysit,
      she
      didn #8217;t
      help
      me
      pay
      for
      her
      own
      sons
      lawyer
      but
      now
      she #8217;s
      going
      too?
      When
      all
      she #8217;s
      got
      to
      do
      is
      drive
      2
      minutes
      and
      she #8217;s
      here?
      It #8217;s
      just
      not
      fair.
      Not
      at
      all.
      I
      was
      not
      treated
      that
      way
      with
      his
      son?
      I
      was
      word
      for
      word
      told
      to
      not
      fucking
      worry
      about
      his
      son.
      This
      all
      sucks.
      What
      sucks
      more
      is
      how
      much
      I
      still
      love
      him.
      I
      hate
      wondering
      why
      I
      wasn #8217;t
      good
      enough.
      Why
      he
      hates
      me.
      If
      he
      was
      just
      so
      unhappy
      why
      didn #8217;t
      he
      tell
      me
      instead
      of
      ghosting
      me?
      Is
      he
      truly
      that
      happy
      or
      for
      whatever
      reason
      likes
      to
      hurt
      me?
      After
      all
      this
      time
      together,
      everything
      together.
      He
      can #8217;t
      even
      look
      at
      me
      now.i
      feel
      so
      used.
      I
      don #8217;t
      know
      why
      he
      was
      even
      with
      me.
      He
      will
      never
      give
      me
      answers,
      and
      it
      just
      brakes
      my
      heart
      because
      I
      did
      whatever
      he
      asked
      or
      needed.
      Now
      he
      says
      we
      have
      nothing
      to
      talk
      about?
      How?
      We
      have
      a
      lot
      to
      talk
      over.
      He #8217;s
      so
      busy
      making
      me
      the
      bad
      guy
      and
      worried
      about
      this
      chick
      he
      doesn #8217;t
      even
      say
      hey
      how
      are
      the
      kids.
      It
      makes
      me
      think
      everyone
      would
      be
      happy
      if
      I
      just
      disappeared.
      New
      mommy
      is
      perfect.
      I #8217;m
      so
      crushed.
      Why
      couldn #8217;t
      it
      be
      me?
      Everything
      I
      ever
      wanted
      she
      is
      getting.
      I
      trusted
      him.
      I
      love
      him.
      And
      she
      doesn #8217;t
      give
      to
      fucks.
      I
      view
      her
      has
      a
      monster
      for
      what
      has
      happened.
      For
      her
      actions
      in
      this.
      I
      just
      keep
      having
      brake
      downs.
      Nothing
      gets
      better.
      Ever.
      During
      all
      this
      my
      home
      was
      even
      robbed.
      I #8217;ve
      lost
      everything.
      Depression
      isn #8217;t
      even
      the
      right
      word
      for
      the
      pain
      anymore.
      I #8217;m
      a
      person
      who
      hates
      being
      touched.
      This
      man
      is
      the
      Only
      one
      I #8217;ve
      ever
      had
      touch
      me
      and
      be
      perfectly
      fine
      with.
      No
      anxiety.
      I
      reached
      out
      the
      other
      day
      trying
      to
      talk
      to
      him.
      He
      shut
      that
      down
      fast.
      If
      he
      just
      said
      it #8217;s
      going
      to
      be
      alright
      I
      would
      have
      felt
      so
      much
      better.
      Not
      one
      comforting
      word.
      Just
      kicked
      down
      more.
      Someone
      who
      was
      going
      to
      be
      his
      wife,
      he
      can #8217;t
      even
      say
      a
      kind
      word
      too.
      I
      would
      give
      anything
      to
      cuddle
      up
      and
      fall
      asleep
      hearing
      his
      heartbeat
      again.
      That #8217;s
      gone
      forever
      now.
      He
      hates
      me
      and
      is
      never
      coming
      home..
      I
      build
      my
      life
      around
      him.
      I #8217;m
      devoted
      to
      him.
      I
      can
      pray
      and
      pray
      but
      he #8217;s
      gone.
      I
      don #8217;t
      understand
      asking
      me
      to
      marry
      him
      or
      our
      children
      if
      this
      is
      it.
      Knowing
      I #8217;ll
      never
      feel
      his
      warmth
      or
      arms
      around
      me
      again
      kills
      me.
      Im
      never
      going
      to
      be
      the
      same
      again.
      I
      trusted
      him.
      I
      love
      him.
      He #8217;s
      my
      soulmate,
      my
      world.
      A
      life
      without
      him
      seems
      horrible.
      But
      it #8217;s
      my
      future.

      My
      house
      sitter
      is
      gone,
      and
      his
      story
      is
      off.
      So
      I
      was
      wondering
      about
      this.

      I

      I
      have
      nothing
      right
      now.
      I
      have
      24
      cents
      in
      my
      bank.
      My
      home
      was
      robbed.
      I
      miss
      work
      because
      I
      had
      manic
      episodes.
      My

      dad
      bounced
      my

      I #8217;m

      I
      need
      help
      so

      He #8217;s
      gone.
      He #8217;s
      never
      going
      to
      hold
      me
      again.
      He
      will
      never
      love
      me
      again
      if
      he
      ever
      did
      at
      all.
      I
      did
      so
      much.
      Gave
      so
      much.
      I
      have
      him
      all
      of
      me.
      He
      made
      me
      feel
      normal.
      Made
      the
      screaming
      in
      my
      mind
      stop
      when
      he
      held
      me.
      We
      agreed
      to
      help
      each
      other.
      He #8217;s
      doing
      so
      well
      now.
      I #8217;m
      just
      an
      empty
      shell.
      Up
      until
      the
      last
      month
      or
      so
      I #8217;ve
      hid
      how
      sick
      really
      am.
      I #8217;ve
      known
      once
      our
      last
      child
      was
      born.
      I
      almost
      bled
      out.
      Sometimes
      I
      can #8217;t
      even
      walk
      and
      I
      don #8217;t
      even
      have
      him
      to
      take
      my
      hand.
      I
      messaged
      him
      the
      other
      day.
      All
      he
      said
      was
      he
      won #8217;t
      talk
      to
      me
      unless
      it #8217;s
      about
      our
      children.
      He
      won #8217;t
      even
      see
      his
      children
      anymore
      basically.
      I #8217;m
      sick
      sad
      and
      alone.
      He
      promised
      he
      would
      take
      care
      of
      me.
      I
      trusted
      him.
      He
      took
      everything
      I
      had
      to
      give
      and
      left.
      I
      don #8217;t
      even
      know
      why.
      Crying
      while
      shivering
      from
      my
      medicine
      wishing
      he
      was
      here.
      But
      he
      will
      never
      be
      again.
      No
      one
      deserves
      this
      pain
      or
      loneliness.

      It #8217;s
      just
      bad

      On

      note
      there #8217;s
      always
      complications.
      At
      17
      I
      was
      fired
      for
      it.
      A
      year
      ago
      my
      fianc #233;
      ghosted
      me
      his
      coworker.
      Deep
      story
      with
      that
      but
      I
      should
      have
      been

      to
      trust
      him
      at
      work
      or
      all
      places.
      It
      just
      doesn #8217;t
      mix
      well
      somewhere.

      I
      feel
      the
      same
      way
      all
      the
      time.
      Mostly
      because
      i
      think
      if
      i
      just
      went
      away
      everyone
      would
      have
      what
      they
      want.
      All
      I
      want
      to
      do
      is
      feel
      sharp
      glide.
      Seeing
      the
      blood
      let
      me
      know
      I
      was
      alive.
      If
      I
      get
      hurt
      or
      if
      I
      were
      to
      cut
      myself
      I
      could
      bleed
      out
      right
      now.
      I #8217;m
      sorry
      you
      feel
      this
      way
      too.
      Only
      one
      other
      ever
      knew
      what
      this
      was
      like.
      I
      devoted
      my
      life
      to
      that
      person
      and
      they
      left
      me.
      I
      spend
      my
      birthday
      last
      month
      crying
      in
      bed
      because
      I
      wanted
      to
      hurt
      myself.
      All
      I
      needed
      for
      that
      person
      to
      tell
      me
      everything
      will
      be
      ok
      but
      he
      won #8217;t
      talk
      to
      me
      really.
      I
      don #8217;t
      want
      to
      hurt
      anymore.
      I
      don #8217;t
      want
      to
      see
      them
      giving
      someone
      else
      everything
      I
      wanted.
      It #8217;s
      a
      day
      to
      day
      struggle
      for
      me
      as
      well.
      I
      feel
      your
      pain
      and
      i
      hope
      you
      are
      able
      to
      heal
      and
      find
      the
      person
      who
      will
      take
      the
      pain
      away
      like
      mine
      did
      at
      one
      point.
      You
      deserve
      to
      be
      happy
      and
      not
      feel
      this
      way.
      No
      one
      should
      feel
      this
      much
      pain
      and
      so
      alone.
      I
      know
      I #8217;ll
      be
      alone.
      He #8217;s
      gone
      and
      isn #8217;t
      coming
      home
      this
      time.
      I
      hope
      you
      never
      have
      that.
      Best
      wishes
      and
      pray
      someday
      you
      can
      wake
      up
      each
      day
      to
      someone
      and
      know
      you
      will
      never
      have
      to
      face
      any
      kind
      of
      pain
      alone.
