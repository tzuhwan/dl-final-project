      As
      a
      Dutchman
      myself,
      I
      say
      it's
      about
      darn'
      time.
      It's
      beyond
      embarrassing
      we're
      branded
      as
      a

       gt;Once
      again.
      Why
      is
      this
      country
      in
      the
      EU?
      No
      one
      really
      knows.
      Apparently,
      nowadays
      it's
      more
      important
      to
      keep
      countries
      in
      the
      EU
      at
      all
      cost
      trying
      not
      to
      offend
      them
      too
      much
      than
      it
      is
      to
      actually
      defend
      what
      the
      EU
      is
      supposed
      to
      be
      about.
      The
      irony
      of
      it
      all
      is,
      that
      the
      longer
      the
      EU
      allows
      this
      kinda
      behaviour
      (attacking
      [journalists](https://www.politico.eu/article/polands-pis-law-and-justice-party-aims-to-regulate-journalists-media-after-the-election/),
      [judges](https://euobserver.com/justice/145685),
      [gays](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/poland-lgbt-free-zones-homophobia-hate-speech-law-justice-party-a9013551.html))
      to
      continue,
      the
      bigger
      the
      chance
      the
      EU
      will
      split
      into
      a
      two-speed
      union,
      which
      is
      what
      Poland
      (and
      other
      EE
      countries)
      do
      not
      want.
       gt;There
      isn't
      supposed
      to
      be
      a
      committee
      to
      value
      respect
      to
      human
      rights
      before
      letting
      anyone
      in?
      Yes,
      every
      country
      has
      to
      meet
      the
      [Copenhagen
      criteria](https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/policy/glossary/terms/accession-criteria_en)
      if
      it
      wants
      to
      join
      our
      Union.
      The
      sad
      thing
      is,
      the
      moment
      a
      country
      actually
      joins,
      no
      one
      gives
      a
      shit
      about
      those
      criteria
      anymore
      and
      they
      can
      do
      whatever
      they
      want.
      Those
      criteria
      are
      just
      a
      bar
      to
      *enter*
      our
      Union.
      Once
      they're
      in,
      they
      don't
      matter
      anymore.

      I
      agree
      that
      generalization
      is
      not
      great/helpful
      At
      what
      point
      does
      something
      stop
      being
      a
      generalization,
      though?
      PiS
      has
      [46%](https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/poland/)
      support
      in
      the
      polls.
      Over
      half
      of
      'm
      believe
      gays
      are
      the
      *single
      biggest
      threat*
      to
      the
      country,
      and
      I
      bet
      the
      other
      half
      sees
      'm
      as
      the
      second
      or
      third
      biggest
      threat.
      I
      think
      it's
      safe
      to
      say
      that
      almost
      half
      the
      country
      sees
      gays
      as
      a
      threat.
      Hardly
      a
      generalization
      anymore.
      No,
      Poland
      has
      a
      problem
      in
      the
      gay
      department
      and
      calling
      it

      is
      only
      adding

      that

      Well,
      Guardian
      is
      fake
      news,
      according
      to
      Brexiteers,
      so
      it's
      probably
      not
      true
      then.
      Either
      that
      or
      Boris
      "The
      Hulk"
      Johnson
      gets
      intimidated
      by
      a
      tiny
      country's
      PM,
      which
      would
      be
      rather
      embarrassing
      for
      a
      superpower
      like
      the
      UK.
      I
      also
      like
      to
      take
      the
      opportunity
      to
      recall
      that
      Boris
      called
      us
      a
      bunch
      of
      [Nazis](https://www.politico.eu/article/boris-johnson-compares-eu-to-nazi-superstate-brexit-ukip/)
      and
      didn't
      take
      it
      back.
      Maybe
      there's
      the
      problem.

      Of
      course,
      he
      should.
      A
      PM
      with
      balls
      would
      face
      the
      crowd.
      Especially
      someone
      who
      identifies
      himself
      with
      the
      Hulk.
      But
      this
      is
      all
      set
      up
      to
      play
      the

      which
      is
      an
      essential
      part
      of
      the
      populist
      playbook.
      Now
      they
      can
      blame
      the
      EU
      and
      that
      was
      always
      the
      point
      of
      having
      Boris
      as
      a
      PM.
      Brexiteers
      want
      to
      crash
      out
      of
      the
      EU
      one
      way
      or
      another
      and
      blame
      the
      EU
      for
      it.
      Everything
      that
      happens
      now
      with
      Boris
      as
      PM
      must
      be
      seen
      in
      that

      How
      the
      fuck
      did
      we
      get
      here?
      Besides
      wanting
      to
      arrest
      MPs
      and
      judges,
      they

      regulate
      [journalists](https://www.politico.eu/article/polands-pis-law-and-justice-party-aims-to-regulate-journalists-media-after-the-election/)
      and

      [gays](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/poland-lgbt-free-zones-homophobia-hate-speech-law-justice-party-a9013551.html)
      and
      shit
      on
      other
      minorities.
      And
      that's
      just
      the
      beginning.
      It
      should
      be
      noted
      that
      PiS
      has
      almost
      [half](https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/poland/)
      of
      the

      so
      it's
      not
      a
      minor
      or
      temporary
      problem.
      Half
      of
      the
      country
      agrees
      with
      this.
      This

      is

      and
      deeply
      embedded
      in
      Polish
      society.
      The
      more
      pertinent
      question
      to
      me
      is
      not
      how
      the
      fuck
      they
      got
      there,
      but
      how
      the
      fuck
      do
      we
      get
      rid
      of
      it?
      There
      should
      be
      no
      place
      for
      countries
      like
      this
      in
      the
      EU.
      And
      I'll
      keep
      on
      saying
      it
      till
      things
      change
      for
      the
      good.

      She's
      EPP,
      so
      it
      was
      to
      be
      expected.
      I'm
      disgusted
      by
      the
      attitude
      that
      the
      EU
      must
      be
      held
      together
      at
      all
      cost,
      even
      if
      it
      means
      going
      against
      everything
      it's
      supposed
      to
      stand
      for
      and
      allowing
      de
      facto
      autocratic
      regimes
      to
      rise
      up.
      It
      makes
      me
      sick
      that
      I'm
      part
      of
      such
      a
      Union.
      And
      it's
      only
      getting
      worse
      and
      worse
      by
      the
      day.

      then.
      I'm
      not

       gt;So
      therewas
      no
      "other"
      Poland
      -
      only
      passing
      stage
      Yes,
      and
      that's
      when
      they
      joined
      the
      EU.
      During
      that
      passing
      stage.
      Which,
      as
      it
      seems,
      was
      all
      a
      sham.
      A
      farce.
      You
      deceived
      and
      betrayed
      the
      rest
      of
      us.
       gt;but
      the
      aim
      was
      getting
      rich
      Yes,
      and
      that
      was
      the
      (only,
      or
      at
      least
      main)
      reason
      for
      them
      to
      join
      the
      EU.
       gt;There
      is
      no
      "other"
      Poland.
      Yes,
      and
      that's
      exactly
      why
      there
      is
      no
      place
      for
      it
      in
      the
      EU.
      So
      we
      have
      a
      problem.
      I,
      for
      one,
      do
      not
      want
      to
      be
      part
      of
      a
      union
      with
      countries
      like
      this
      in
      it.
      And
      I
      can
      assure
      you,
      [I'm
      not
      the
      only
      one](https://eu2019.fi/en/backgrounders/rule-of-law).
      Far
      from
      it.
      Either
      Poland
      changes
      and
      starts
      playing
      by
      EU's
      rules
      (which,
      according
      to
      you,
      it
      will
      never
      do),
      or
      it
      should
      be
      forced
      out
      of
      our
      union.
      Cause
      what's
      happening
      now,
      can't
      go
      on.
      Sooner
      or
      later
      it
      will
      lead
      to
      a
      clash.
      And
      I
      hope
      it
      will
      be
      sooner
      rather
      than
      later.
      You
      can
      be
      autocratic
      and
      nationalistic
      outside
      the
      EU
      all
      you
      want.

      get

      a
      leech...
      I've
      always
      said

      will
      stop
      loving
      the
      EU
      the
      moment
      they
      will
      have
      to
      start
      coughing
      up
      dough.
      Your
      "support"
      for
      the
      EU,
      isn't
      really
      about
      the
      EU
      and
      I
      hope
      the
      rest
      of
      the
      EU
      will
      finally
      start
      realizing
      this.
      The
      moment
      you
      will
      have
      to
      pay,
      is
      the
      very
      moment
      support
      for
      the
      EU
      will
      drop
      drastically.
       gt;If
      we
      leave
      it
      will
      probably
      be
      Italy
      and
      afterwards
      Spain...
      Fine
      with
      me.
      I
      wouldn't
      care
      if
      the
      EU
      collapsed.
      Even
      though
      I'm
      pro-EU,
      it's
      not
      sacred
      to
      me.
      We
      can
      start
      over
      with
      a
      new
      and
      improved
      Union.
      Without
      autocratic
      countries.
      As
      a
      matter
      of
      fact,
      Poland
      could
      serve
      as
      a
      perfect
      buffer
      between
      the
      democratic
      West
      and
      autocratic
      Russia.

      Please
      take
      Hungary
      with

      it

      really

      that
      in

      You
      wouldn't

      Yet,
      you
      do
      whatever
      you
      want
      anyway.
      That's
      my
      whole
      point.
      But
      it
      will
      never
      get
      that
      far.
      I
      think
      we
      can
      both
      agree
      that
      Poland
      will
      never
      be
      a
      net
      contributor.
      It
      will
      leave
      before
      that
      happens.
      Cause
      -
      as
      you
      yourself
      stated
      correctly
      -
      it
      has
      always
      been
      about
      the
      money.
      The
      moment
      you
      will
      have
      to
      actually
      *give*
      money,
      is
      the
      moment
      the
      EU
      will
      lose
      its
      purpose
      to
      your
      country.
      And
      then
      you'll
      leave.
      Hopefully.
      We're
      a
      cash
      cow.
      And
      that's
      it.
      There
      is
      no
      need
      for
      Poland
      to
      stay
      in
      the
      EU,
      once
      it
      has
      to
      start
      paying.
      I'm
      really
      glad
      your
      economy
      is
      booming.

      If

      opposition
      MPs,
      they
      can
      do
      it
      now.
      Except
      that
      this
      would
      be
      something
      the

      arresting

      would
      be
      a

      far.

       gt;The
      EU
      is
      in
      reality
      an
      economic
      alliance
      that
      saves
      this
      continent
      from
      US
      and
      China
      domination.
      Then
      why
      do
      we
      have
      a
      Treaty
      with
      democratic
      values?
      I'm
      ok
      with
      an
      economic
      alliance,
      but
      we
      don't
      need
      an
      EU
      for
      that.
      But
      as
      long
      as
      we
      have
      an
      EU,
      I
      will
      keep
      bitching
      about
      it,
      cause
      those
      "lofty"
      values
      are
      important
      to
      me.
      If
      it's
      all
      about
      the
      economy,
      we
      should
      get
      rid
      of
      the
      EU,
      which
      will
      lead
      to
      a
      two-speed
      Europe
      (a
      democratic
      part
      and
      an
      autocratic
      part),
      which
      is
      what
      countries
      like
      Poland
      [don't
      want](https://www.euractiv.com/section/future-eu/news/polands-kaczynski-warns-two-speed-europe-leads-to-breakdown/)
      either.

      That's
      how
      a
      lot
      of
      autocrats
      start.
      They
      present
      themselves
      as
      progressive
      reformers
      with
      respect
      for
      the
      rule
      of
      law
      and
      democratic
      values.
      That's
      how
      they
      get
      elected
      and
      build
      a
      base.
      It
      goes
      well
      for
      a
      while,
      but
      over
      time,
      they
      change.
      Hungary
      is
      another
      prime
      example
      of
      it.
      Orb #225;n
      used
      to
      be
      a
      democrat.
      Venezuela
      is
      another
      example.
      Not
      all
      autocrats
      are
      like
      that,
      though.
      At
      least
      Duterte
      was
      honest
      about
      it
      from
      the
      get-go.

      Dream

      Are

      If
      the

      Farage

      The
      UK
      not
      leaving
      will
      do
      *more*
      damage
      to
      the
      EU
      than
      the
      UK
      leaving.
      And
      the
      EU
      knows
      this
      by
      now.
      It
      took
      a
      while
      for
      them
      to
      see
      it,
      but
      they
      know.
      There
      is
      no
      master
      plan
      behind
      this.
      Most
      MEPs
      want
      the
      UK
      out
      asap
      and
      be
      done
      with
      it.
      The
      only
      reason
      it
      hasn't
      happened
      yet,
      is
      cause
      the
      UK
      keeps
      fucking
      up.
      That's
      it.
      There's
      no
      deeper,

      It's
      still
      ongoing.
      What,
      you
      think
      those
      hate
      campaigns
      stopped?
      Haha.
      Being
      an
      independent
      judge
      in
      Poland
      is
      probably
      one

      the
      toughest
      jobs
      in
      the
      world
      right
      now.
      And
      yes,
      this
      is
      happening
      in
      the
      European
      Union,
      so-called
      "defender"
      of
      democratic
      values.

      She'd

      Brexit
      hasn't

      Don't

      Brexit
      still

      The

      Right
      now,
      we
      simply
      cannot
      know,
      cause
      the

      I'm
      not
      disputing
      any
      of
      that.
      I'm
      just
      saying
      Brexit
      hasn't
      happened
      yet,
      so
      no
      one
      of
      us,
      including
      Bloomberg,
      can
      tell
      what
      impact
      it
      will
      have.
      Cause
      it
      is
      yet
      to
      happen.
      Edit:
      Boris
      said
      he
      has
      a
      master
      plan.
      Companies
      listen
      to
      that
      rhetoric
      and
      act
      upon
      it.
      If
      Boris
      doesn't
      have
      a
      plan
      -
      which
      is
      wht
      I
      think
      is
      the
      case
      -
      then
      sooner
      or
      later
      you
      wil
      see
      an
      impact.

      Yes,
      if
      Brexit
      would
      happen.
      There's
      no
      deal.
      A
      no-deal
      Brexit
      is
      no
      deal
      either.
      There
      was
      a
      deal,
      but
      the
      UK
      doesn't
      want
      it
      and
      Parliament
      voted
      that
      no-deal
      is
      not
      an
      option

      and
      Boris
      doesn't
      seem
      to
      have
      a

      No
      one
      knows
      what's
      going
      to
      happen.
      No
      one
      has
      a
      clue.
      I'm
      not
      saying
      you're
      wrong,
      but
      right
      now
      the
      Brexit
      is
      such
      a
      shitshow
      that
      no

      really
      knows
      anymore
      what
      is
      going
      to
      happen.
      If
      there
      was
      a
      plan,
      maybe
      then
      we
      can
      tell
      how
      business
      will
      respond.
      But
      there
      isn't.
      There's
      nothing.

      There

      Probably
      due
      to
      lack
      of
      (media)
      attention.
      They
      didn't
      get
      a
      lot
      of
      attention
      over
      here
      either.
      Most
      of
      the
      attention
      went
      to
      the
      "surge"
      of
      the
      far-right
      and
      regular
      parties,
      who
      see
      them
      as
      competition.
      It's
      hard
      to
      fight
      that
      as
      a
      new
      party.
      Almost
      impossible.
      Shame,
      if
      you'd
      ask
      me,
      cause
      pan-European
      parties
      are
      the
      next
      step
      in
      our
      Union.
      Another
      option
      is
      to
      have
      two
      votes
      in
      EP
      elections;
      one
      for
      a
      party
      in
      my
      own
      country,
      and
      one
      for
      someone
      outside
      my
      country.
      That
      way
      we
      *have*
      to
      get
      involved
      in
      what's
      going
      on
      beyond
      our
      national
      borders.
      Cause
      right
      now,
      EP
      elections
      are
      basically
      still
      national
      elections.

      Oh,
      Trump's
      gonna
      win
      in

      No

      Democrats
      don't
      have
      an
      answer.
      And
      he's
      already
      hinting
      for
      a
      third
      term.

      his

      the

      an

      without
      a
      spine.
      After
      McCain
      died,
      it
      became
      Trump's
      party.
      McCain's
      closest
      friends
      and
      allies
      within
      the
      GOP
      are
      now
      Trump's
      biggest
      defenders.
      And
      that
      won't
      change
      once
      he's
      gone.
      He
      completely
      reformed
      the
      GOP.
      Or
      to
      be
      more
      precise,
      he
      turned
      the
      party
      into
      what
      its
      voters
      always
      wanted
      it
      to
      be.
      Trump
      is
      just
      a
      symptom.
      Trump's
      GOP
      is
      how
      the
      GOP
      will
      be
      for
      decades
      to
      come.

      Exactly,
      he
      can't
      even
      capitalize

      US
      economy
      has
      been
      growing
      for
      ten
      years.
      That
      started
      under
      Obama,
      who
      inherited
      a
      crisis.
      But
      Trump
      voters
      actually
      believe
      Obama
      wrecked
      the
      economy
      and
      Trump
      is
      the
      one
      who
      fixed
      it.
      Trump
      voters,
      not
      all,
      but
      a
      lot,
      have
      a
      different
      view
      on
      reality.
      Look,
      I
      hope
      you're
      right,
      but
      I
      have
      a
      hard
      time
      believing
      it.
      Even
      if
      the
      economy
      crashes,
      they
      will
      blame
      the
      Democrats
      for
      it.
      Or
      the
      media.
      Trump
      is
      *already*
      doing
      that
      and
      his
      supporters
      swallow
      it.
      Bush
      was
      a
      "normal"
      Republican.
      Trump
      isn't.
      Different
      times.
      What
      applied
      to
      Bush,
      does
      not
      apply
      to
      Trump.

      Neither
      is
      going
      to
      happen,
      though.
      The
      EU
      doesn't
      have
      the

      or
      the

      with
      their
      dictatorial
      tendencies
      out
      of
      themselves.
      It
      would
      be
      a
      first
      if
      that
      happened.
      And
      they
      won't
      leave
      out
      of
      themselves
      as
      long
      as
      the
      EU
      is
      profitable
      to
      them.
      No,
      the
      best
      (and
      perhaps
      only)
      option
      is
      for
      other
      countries
      to
      leave
      the
      EU
      and
      start
      over
      with
      a
      new
      union
      without
      autocratic
      regimes.
      Thank
      goodness
      the
      UK
      is
      still
      a
      democracy.
      Some
      countries
      in
      the
      EU
      could
      learn
      a
      thing
      or
      two
      from
      this

      It's
      the
      same
      shit
      with
      every
      alt-right/national-populist
      politician
      all
      around
      the
      globe.
      All
      these
      morons
      are
      the
      same
      and
      use
      the
      same
      retarded
      rhetoric;
      everyone
      who
      isn't
      with
      them,
      is
      an
      enemy
      and
      a
      far-left
      lunatic.
      It's
      because
      they
      view
      the
      world
      in
      black
      and
      white.
      There
      are
      no
      grey
      scales,
      no
      in-betweens,
      there's
      no
      room
      for
      compromise.
      They
      can't
      fathom
      anything
      more
      than
      "us"
      and
      "them".
      That's
      their
      world.
      It's
      straight
      out
      of
      the
      alt-right
      playbook
      and
      part
      of
      the
      victim
      mentality
      of
      which
      they
      all
      suffer
      from;
      they
      cannot
      make
      a
      point
      without
      blaming
      anyone
      but
      themselves.
      Projecting
      is
      part
      of
      it,
      too.
      It's
      a
      global
      pest.
      We
      have
      'm
      over
      here
      (Netherlands)
      as
      well.
      The
      only
      difference
      is
      that
      they're
      stuck
      at
      about
      20%
      of
      the
      votes.

      in
      laatdunkende

      dit
      klimaatmeisje.
      Als

      zal
      het

      wel

      Nee,
      dit

      is
      eigenlijk
      te
      stupide
      om

      Dat

      Good.
      More
      PiS
      means
      more
      troubles
      with
      the
      EU,
      which
      is
      a
      great
      thing,
      cause
      that
      will
      inevitably
      lead
      to
      a
      great
      clash,
      where
      things
      will
      *have*
      to
      change
      one
      way
      or
      another.
      I
      hope
      they'll
      get
      at
      least
      50%
      of
      the
      votes,
      which
      will
      give
      them
      the
      power
      to
      basically
      do
      what
      they
      want.
      Maybe
      then
      the
      EU
      will
      finally
      wake
      the
      fuck
      up
      and
      start
      smelling
      the
      authoritarian
      coffee.
      Also,
      great
      job,
      opposition...

      Yes,
      it's
      a
      disgrace,
      but
      it
      was
      corrected
      by
      the
      highest
      court.
      So
      the
      rule
      of
      law
      is
      still
      intact
      and
      so
      is
      democracy.
      There
      are
      a
      couple
      of
      countries
      in
      the
      EU
      that
      could
      learn
      a
      thing
      or
      two
      from
      this.

       gt;In
      the
      EU,
      some
      countries
      are
      more
      equal
      than
      others.
       gt;
      Just
      saying
      that
      the
      standard
      for
      when
      that
      is
      deemed
      so
      offending
      as
      to
      warrant
      a
      rejection
      isn #8217;t
      the
      same
      for
      candidates
      from
      all
      countries.
      I
      might
      hope
      so.
      It
      would
      be
      rather
      foolish
      if
      there
      weren't
      different
      standards
      because
      countries
      *within*
      the
      EU
      use
      different
      standards
      *themselves*.
      Some
      countries
      are
      sliding
      into
      authoritarian
      regimes
      as
      we
      speak,
      most
      prominently
      reflected
      in
      a
      complete
      lack
      of
      respect
      for
      the
      rule
      of
      law.
      So,
      some
      countries
      in
      the
      EU
      are
      (way)
      more
      democratic
      than
      others.
      It
      would
      be
      rather
      weird
      to
      treat
      them
      the
      same.
      If
      they
      don't
      like
      that,
      they
      should
      work
      on
      it.
      If
      they
      want
      to
      be
      treated
      equally,
      they
      should
      start
      acting
      like
      equal
      partners
      (which,
      by
      the
      way,
      is
      what
      they
      promised
      to
      do
      when
      they
      signed
      up
      for
      the
      Union).

      Look,
      if
      the
      Belgian
      Commissioner
      is
      corrupt,
      he

      Of
      course,
      no
      doubt
      about
      that.
      Same
      for
      my
      own
      country's
      Commissioner.
      If
      he

      corrupt
      or
      otherwise
      compromised,
      he/she
      should
      be
      booted.
      All
      I'm
      saying
      is
      there's
      a
      different
      level
      of

      countries
      have

      to
      the
      different
      standards
      and
      systems
      they
      uphold.
      And
      that
      affects
      the
      whole
      political
      spectrum
      of
      a
      country,
      from
      the
      mayor
      of
      the
      tiniest
      village
      up
      to
      the
      Commissioner
      in
      the
      EU.
      And
      besides
      that,
      people
      [do](https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/belgian-commissioner-pick-faces-corruption-probe/)
      give
      a
      shit
      about
      the

      Yeah,
      that's
      what
      I
      was
      about
      to
      say.
      Some
      good
      governmental
      fearmongering
      going
      on
      in
      those
      parts.
      But
      hey,
      we're
      talking
      about
      the
      part
      of
      Europe
      where
      they
      view
      gays
      as
      one
      of
      the
      biggest
      threats
      as
      well.

      It's
      not
      just
      a
      British
      problem,
      though.
      This
      is
      happening
      over
      here
      as
      well.
      And
      in
      other
      countries,
      too.
      I
      think
      it's
      mostly
      due
      to
      getting
      rid
      of
      political
      correctness.
      I'm
      not
      entirely
      against
      that,
      cause
      a
      lot
      of
      problems
      have
      been
      ignored
      due
      to
      policor
      behavior.
      But
      right
      now,
      it
      feels
      like
      we're
      swinging
      to
      the
      other
      side
      of
      the
      pendulum,
      where
      -
      certain
      -
      politicians
      feel
      they
      can
      say
      whatever
      they
      want,
      whenever
      they
      want
      and
      use
      whatever
      words
      they
      feel
      like,
      without
      thinking
      about
      the
      consequences.
      I
      wouldn't
      mind
      a
      little
      bit
      more
      decency
      in
      politics,
      but
      I
      fear
      that's
      not
      really
      going
      to
      happen
      any
      time
      soon.

      Then
      it
      still
      should
      be
      against
      the
      current
      Israeli
      government,
      and
      not
      against
      Jews.
      I
      myself
      am
      very
      critical
      of
      the
      Netanyahu-government
      as
      well,
      but
      I
      don't
      have
      a
      beef
      with
      Jews.
      Two
      different
      things
      and
      the
      fact
      that
      you
      can't
      make
      that
      distinction
      yourself,
      is
      telling.
      It's
      even
      more
      troubling
      that
      your
      president
      can't
      tell
      the
      difference.
      But
      hey,
      he's
      PiS,
      so
      I
      wouldn't
      expect
      anything
      else.
      We
      all
      know
      they're
      not
      the
      smartest
      people

      First
      of
      all,
      most
      climate
      scientists
      believe
      that
      human
      activities
      are
      the
      [main
      cause](https://www.science.org.au/learning/general-audience/science-climate-change/3-are-human-activities-causing-climate-change),
      by
      far.
       gt;Most
      of
      the
      observed
      recent
      global
      warming
      results
      from
      human
      activities
      Climatic
      warming
      or
      cooling
      arises
      from
      changes
      in
      the
      flows
      of
      energy
      through
      the
      climate
      system
      (Figure
      1.1)
      that
      can
      originate
      from
      a
      number
      of
      possible
      driving
      factors.
      The
      main
      drivers
      that
      have
      acted
      over
      the
      last
      century
      are:
       gt;
      -
      increases
      in
      atmospheric
      CO2
      and
      other
      long-lived
      greenhouse
      gases
      (methane,
      nitrous
      oxide
      and
      halocarbons)
       gt;
      -
      increases
      in
      short-lived
      greenhouse
      gases
      (mainly
      ozone)
      changes
      to
      land
      cover
      (replacement
      of
      darker
      forests
      with
      paler
      croplands
      and
      grasslands)
       gt;
      -
      increases
      in
      aerosols
      (tiny
      particles
      in
      the
      atmosphere)
       gt;
      -
      solar
      fluctuations
      (changes
      in
      the
      brightness
      of
      the
      sun)
      volcanic
      eruptions.
       gt;
      Of
      these,
      solar
      fluctuations
      and
      volcanic
      eruptions
      are
      entirely
      natural,
      **while
      the
      other
      four
      are
      predominantly
      caused
      by
      human
      influences.
      The
      human-induced
      drivers
      have
      been
      dominant
      over
      the
      past
      century**
      (Figure
      3.4).
      Changes
      in
      greenhouse
      gas
      concentrations,
      dominated
      by
      CO2,
      caused
      a
      large
      warming
      contribution.
      Some
      of
      this
      has
      been
      offset
      by
      the
      net
      cooling
      effects
      of
      increased
      aerosol
      concentrations
      and
      their
      impact
      on
      clouds.
      Black
      carbon
      or
      soot
      has
      probably
      exerted
      a
      smaller,
      warming
      influence.
      The
      net
      effect
      of
      all
      aerosol
      types
      including
      soot
      remains
      hard
      to
      quantify
      accurately.
      Among
      the
      natural
      influences,
      the
      effect
      of
      changes
      in
      the
      brightness
      of
      the
      Sun
      has
      been
      very
      small
      (Box
      3.1).
      Volcanic
      influences
      are
      highly
      intermittent,
      with
      major
      eruptions
      (such
      as
      Pinatubo
      in
      1991)
      causing
      significant
      cooling
      for
      a
      year
      or
      two,
      but
      their
      average
      effects
      over
      the
      past
      century
      have
      been
      relatively
      small.
      Second
      of
      all,
      even
      it
      was

      It

      I
      believe
      you're
      right,
      but
      Boris's
      Tories
      are
      swinging
      more
      and
      more
      towards
      national-populism
      these
      days,
      and
      those
      people
      don't
      really
      care
      about
      any
      of
      that.
      But
      tbh,
      I'm
      not
      sure
      either
      anymore.

      for

      called
      the

      an
      "witch-hunt,"
      and
      blamed
      "internationalist"
      pro-migration
      forces.
      He
      confirmed
      Tr #243;cs #225;nyi's

      an

      with

      radio.
      This
      is
      the
      same
      Kov #225;cs
      who
      said

      does
      not
      have
      an
      independent
      judiciary.
      Finland,
      the
      country
      that
      ranks
      [3rd](http://data.worldjusticeproject.org/#/groups/FIN)
      on
      the
      global
      [rule
      of
      law

      Third.
      Whereas
      Hungary
      is
      [not
      even](http://data.worldjusticeproject.org/#/groups/HUN)
      in
      the
      top
      50.
      And
      regionally
      speaking,
      it
      ranks
      even
      last.
      Yet,
      according
      to
      Fidesz,
      it's
      the
      Fins
      who
      fuck
      up
      in
      the
      justice
      department.
      I've
      said
      it
      on
      r/europe
      many,
      many
      times
      and
      I'll
      state
      it
      here
      as
      well;
      Hungary
      does
      not
      belong
      in
      the
      European
      Union.
      I'll
      go
      even
      further,
      Orb #225;n's
      Hungary
      will
      bring
      the
      EU
      down.
      And
      that
      authoritarian
      moron
      will
      blame
      the
      rest
      of
      us
      for
      it.

       gt;It
      was
      reported
      on
      Sunday
      that
      Mr
      Johnson
      phoned
      the
      Queen
      to
      personally
      apologise
      for
      the
      embarrassment
      caused
      by
      the
      crushing
      Supreme
      Court
      ruling
      that
      he
      had
      acted
      unlawfully
      when
      he
      advised
      the
      monarch
      to
      suspend
      Parliament
      for
      five
      weeks
      -
      advice
      which
      she
      was
      obliged
      to
      accept.
      Only
      people
      who
      believe
      they
      were
      wrong,
      apologize.
      If
      you
      don't
      think
      you
      did
      anything
      wrong,
      you
      don't
      apologize.
      But
      in
      public,
      Johnson
      stated
      that
      he
      strongly
      disagrees
      with
      the
      Supreme
      Court's
      decision
      and
      even
      suggested
      that
      a
      US-style
      system
      of
      [political
      appointment](https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-supreme-court-ruling-should-lead-to-consequences-says-boris-johnson/)
      for
      judges
      might
      be
      necessary.
      So
      he
      wants
      to
      get
      rid
      of
      judges
      because
      he
      doesn't
      like
      their
      judging.
      This
      is
      as
      populist
      as
      it
      gets.
      I've
      heard
      numerous
      people
      on
      here
      state
      that
      "it's
      all
      an
      act"
      and
      Boris
      "is
      actually
      intelligent
      and
      has
      a
      plan"
      and
      more
      of
      that
      nonsense.
      Boris
      is
      a
      national-populist
      *pur
      sang*
      and
      has
      the
      authoritarian
      tendencies
      that,
      apparently,
      always
      come
      along
      with
      that
      bullshit.
      If
      you
      still
      don't
      see
      that
      by
      now,
      I'm
      afraid
      you're
      blind.

      Lmao.
      But
      I
      highly
      doubt
      it's
      true.
      Instant
      edit:
      apparently,
      police
      caught
      a
      shoplifter
      who
      carried
      this
      little
      bird
      on
      his
      shoulder
      while
      getting
      arrested.
      Police
      didn't
      have
      a
      cage
      to
      put
      it
      in,
      so
      they
      put
      him
      in
      a
      cell
      with
      some
      water
      and
      bread.
      Police
      put
      the
      picture
      on
      Instagram,
      but
      without
      the
      black
      bar.
      The
      bird
      is
      a
      [lovebird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lovebird),
      a
      kind
      of
      parrot.

      Just
      like
      he
      says
      it.
      Neither
      Poland
      nor
      Hungary
      give
      a
      single
      shit
      about
      EU
      values.
      It's
      why
      they
      don't
      belong
      in
      the
      EU.
      They
      joined
      the
      EU
      solely
      for
      the
      free
      money,
      but
      now
      they
      are
      almost
      at
      a
      point
      where
      they
      don't
      need
      it
      anymore.
      Or
      well,
      not
      as
      much
      as
      they
      used
      to.
      So
      it's
      thank
      you
      very
      much
      for
      the
      free
      money,
      you
      can
      fuck
      off
      now.
      It's
      how
      they
      roll.
      I
      wish
      more
      people
      would
      see
      and
      acknowledge
      this
      in
      the
      EU.
      But
      they
      don't.
      People
      are
      blind.
      Or
      perhaps
      they
      just
      don't
      want
      to
      see
      it,
      cause
      god
      forbid
      we
      actually
      start
      doing
      something
      about
      it.
      Also,
      here's
      a
      friendly
      reminder
      that
      Hungary
      ranks
      [57th](http://data.worldjusticeproject.org/#/groups/HUN)
      on
      the
      global
      [rule
      of
      law
      index](http://data.worldjusticeproject.org/).
      Regionally
      speaking,
      it
      ranks
      even
      last,
      below
      Bulgaria
      and
      Romania.
      If
      nothing
      changes,
      Hungary
      and
      Poland
      will
      take
      the
      EU
      down
      (and
      blame
      the
      rest
      of
      us
      for
      it).
      But
      maybe
      that's
      not
      such
      a
      bad
      thing.

      That's
      exactly
      why
      I
      prefer
      coalitions
      over
      2-party
      systems.
      Over
      here,
      Greens
      surged
      as
      well
      in
      last
      elections.
      And
      that's
      a
      good
      thing,
      cause
      climate
      change
      is
      one
      of
      the
      most
      pressing
      matters
      of
      our
      time.
      That's
      not
      just
      left-wing
      crazy
      talk.
      Even
      the
      Pentagon
      acknowledges
      it
      these
      days.
      But
      when
      it
      comes
      to
      immigration,
      they're
      rather
      naive.
      I'm
      not
      against
      all
      immigration,
      as
      some
      leaders
      in
      Europe,
      but
      (some)
      Greens
      over
      here
      wouldn't
      mind
      even
      more
      immigrants
      than
      we're
      already
      getting.
      And
      that's
      what
      most
      people
      just
      do
      not
      want.
      But
      having
      them
      in
      a
      coalition
      with
      center/center-right
      parties
      that
      are
      tougher
      on
      immigration,
      will
      balance
      things
      out
      (they're
      in
      the
      opposition
      over
      here
      btw).

      what
      they
      knew
      about
      the
      french
      revolution.
      It
      was
      pretty
      hilarious.
      That's
      not
      the
      same
      thing.
      You
      just
      throw
      out
      numbers
      without
      any
      evidence.
      Without
      a
      source,
      other
      than
      your
      own
      University
      experience
      about
      a
      totally
      different
      subject,
      which
      proves
      exactly...
      nothing.
      Was
      it
      peer-reviewed?
      Can
      I
      look
      it
      up?
      That's
      what
      I
      thought.
      I'm
      only
      saying
      it's
      ridiculous
      to
      claim
      that
      only
      5%
      knows
      about
      it.
      Prove
      me
      wrong.
      You're
      the
      one
      claiming
      it.
      Burden
      of
      proof
      lies
      upon
      you.

      Those
      articles
      show
      that
      a
      third
      know
      nothing
      about
      the
      Holocuast.
      So
      I'm
      guessing
      two-thirds
      do
      know
      about
      it.
      First
      of
      all,
      that's
      (way)
      more
      than
      5%.
      Second
      of
      all,
      this
      is
      a
      poll
      conducted
      in
      *Europe*,
      not
      in
      the
      Netherlands.
      People
      in
      the
      Netherlands
      are
      generally
      well
      aware
      about
      the
      Holocaust.
      And
      this
      poll
      [didn't
      even
      ask](https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2018/11/europe/antisemitism-poll-2018-intl/)
      people
      in
      the
      Netherlands
      about
      it.
      It
      proves
      nothing
      about
      the
      situation
      in
      the
      Netherlands
      regarding
      both
      the
      Holocaust
      and
      the
      confederate
      flag.

       gt;You

      But
      he
      was
      [cleared](https://euobserver.com/institutional/146114)
      of
      the
      first
      accusation
      of

      and
      fraud:
       gt;Reynders
      has

      wrongdoing
      and
      a
      Brussels
      prosecutor
      on
      Friday
      shelved
      the
      first
      inquiry,
      citing
      a
      lack
      of
      evidence.
      These
      new
      accusations
      are
      made
      by
      the
      same
      guy
      that
      made
      the
      first
      accusations.
      It
      also
      seems
      that
      some
      Flemish
      politicians/parties
      [insist](https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2019/08/25/n-va-vindt-voordracht-didier-reynders-onaanvaardbaar-siegfrie/)

      from
      Flanders
      as
      Commissioner
      and
      can't
      stand

      a
      French-speaking
      politician
      might
      get
      the
      job.
      One
      way
      or
      another,
      it
      should
      be
      looked

      thoroughly.

      Not
      by
      a

      Not

      Because
      people
      who
      fare
      well,
      just
      don't
      want
      to
      have
      a

      to
      break
      the
      law
      for
      that
      to
      happen.
      Which
      would
      probably
      lead
      to
      more
      court
      troubles,
      but
      that's
      not
      our
      problem.
      That's
      a
      domestic
      issue
      for
      the
      UK.
      There
      are
      some
      [escape](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-49612757)
      routes,
      though.
       gt;There
      are
      two
      scenarios
      in
      which
      Mr
      Johnson
      would
      not
      have
      to
      request
      an
      extension:
       gt;
      -
      MPs
      approve
      a
      Brexit
      deal
      in
      another
      meaningful
      vote
      (remember
      them?)
      -
      MPs
      vote
      in
      favour
      of
      leaving
      the
      EU
      without
      a
      deal
       gt;
      In
      either
      of
      these
      scenarios,
      Mr
      Benn's
      law
      would
      not
      force
      any
      Brexit
      extension
      to
      be
      requested.
      So
      it
      could
      still
      happen.
       gt;then
      what?
      No
      one
      knows.
      We're
      in
      the
      dark.
       gt;Personally
      I'm
      tired
      of
      this
      and
      I'd
      like
      to
      see
      Brexit
      happen
      soon,
      even
      without
      a
      deal.
      Most
      of
      us
      are,
      but
      it's
      not
      really
      up
      to
      us.
      The
      EU
      did
      all
      it
      could.
      And
      then
      some.

      Exactly
      this.
      I'd
      go
      even
      further
      and
      get
      rid
      of
      current
      members
      who
      don't
      play
      by
      the
      rules.
      That's
      what
      cleaning
      is
      about;
      you
      get
      rid
      of
      the
      dirt.
      And
      there's
      a
      lot
      of
      dirt
      in
      the
      EU
      right
      now.
      After
      that's
      done,
      we
      should
      introduce
      a
      mechanism
      that
      makes
      sure
      that
      countries
      that
      join
      the
      EU
      *will
      keep
      on
      playing
      by
      EU's
      rules
      once
      they're
      in
      it*.
      Besides
      that,
      there's
      a
      realistic
      chance
      that
      my
      country
      will
      block
      Serbia's
      accession
      anyway.
      Just
      a
      little
      over
      a
      year
      ago,
      our
      PM
      (along
      with
      Macron)
      stated
      he
      doesn't
      want
      [any
      expansion](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/18/no-time-soon-eu-dashes-membership-hopes-of-balkan-states-enlargement-sofia-summit)
      any
      time
      soon.
      And
      people
      over
      here
      see
      what's
      happening
      with
      Hungary
      right
      now.
      No
      one
      over
      here
      wants
      another
      one
      of
      those
      in
      the
      EU.
      What
      Orb #225;n
      wants
      really
      does
      not
      matter
      over
      here.
      Not
      one
      single
      bit.
      Zilch.
      Nada.
      Nothing.

      Sadly,
      we
      live
      in
      a
      populist
      era.
      Facts
      don't
      matter
      anymore.
      It's
      all
      about
      gut-feeling.
      It
      doesn't
      matter
      how
      simple
      you
      make
      it
      for
      people
      to
      understand.
      They
      don't
      read
      it,
      they
      don't
      wanna
      read
      it
      and
      even
      if
      they
      read
      it,
      they
      will
      call
      it
      fake.
      Once
      they're
      in
      their
      conspiratorial
      bubble,
      it's
      pretty
      much
      near
      impossible
      to
      get
      'm
      out
      of
      it.
      People
      being
      misinformed
      is
      one
      of
      the
      most
      pressing
      matters
      of
      our
      time.
      The
      age
      of
      information
      turned
      out
      to
      be
      the
      age
      of
      disinformation
      and
      I'm
      afraid
      we've
      only
      seen
      the
      very
      beginning
      of
      it.
      Just
      wait
      till
      deepfake
      really
      kicks
      in
      and
      becomes
      mainstream
      and
      [easy
      to
      use](https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/2/20844338/zao-deepfake-app-movie-tv-show-face-replace-privacy-policy-concerns).

      I'm
      not
      saying
      you're
      entirely
      wrong,
      but
      I'm
      using
      the
      word
      in
      the
      way
      most
      of
      us
      (including
      media,
      politicians
      and
      the
      common
      man)
      use
      it
      in
      our
      daily
      language.
      Your
      definition
      of
      'populism'
      is
      not
      the
      same
      as
      our
      current
      usage
      of
      it.
      Again,
      not
      saying
      you're
      wrong,
      but
      we
      use
      the
      word
      in
      a
      different
      manner
      nowadays.
      It
      kinda
      reminds
      me
      of
      what
      our
      PM
      said
      after
      last
      elections:
       #8220;After
      Brexit
      and
      the
      American
      election,
      the
      Netherlands
      has
      said
      no
      to
      *the
      wrong
      kind
      of
      populism*, #8221;

      What
      makes
      you
      think
      the
      long-term
      effects
      of
      Brexit
      will
      be
      positive
      for
      the
      UK?
      That's
      highly
      uncertain.
      No
      one
      really
      knows,
      tbh.
      Most
      economists
      believe
      [it
      won't
      be
      positive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_effects_of_Brexit#Long-term_impact_on_the_UK_economy).
      So
      claiming
      things
      will
      be
      better
      in
      the
      long
      run
      is
      based
      on
      pretty
      much
      nothing
      but
      your
      gut-feeling.
      And,
      of
      course,
      the
      EU
      will
      suffer
      as
      well.
      Everyone
      suffers
      from
      Brexit,
      especially
      with
      a
      no-deal.
      But
      more
      than
      the
      UK?
      That's
      highly
      debatable
      as
      well.
      And
      it's
      not
      so
      much
      about
      suffering
      at
      this
      point
      anymore.
      There's
      just
      little
      confidence
      in
      the
      rest
      of
      the
      EU
      anymore
      that
      the
      UK
      will
      reach
      consensus
      on
      how
      to
      leave.
      And
      your
      first
      argument
      about
      the
      poor
      families,
      you
      can
      use
      that
      argument
      on
      pretty
      much
      any
      government
      spending
      (military,
      farmers,
      health
      care).
      If
      you're
      gonna
      make
      that
      argument,
      you
      need
      to
      look
      at
      the
      bigger
      picture
      and
      total
      spendings
      (look
      at
      [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/ddk24h/britain_paid_150m_a_week_to_europe_not_350m_as/f2ivnnd/)
      comment);
      the
      contribution
      to
      the
      EU
      is
      nothing
      compared
      to
      other
      spendings.
      Even
      more
      so
      when
      you
      consider
      it's
      not
      money
      thrown
      away
      since
      the
      UK
      gets
      a
      lot
      back
      for
      it
      as
      well.

      Why
      should
      *we*
      be
      the
      *only*
      ones
      "opening

      Why
      does
      it
      *always*
      have
      to
      be
      us?
      What
      does
      that
      even
      mean?
      Does
      it
      mean
      I
      have
      to
      accept
      authoritarian
      and
      anti-gay
      behavior?
      It
      goes
      both
      ways
      these
      days.
      A
      growing
      number
      of
      Eastern
      Europeans
      regard
      countries
      in
      the
      Western
      part
      of
      Europe
      as
      failed
      societies
      due
      to
      immigration
      and
      multi-culturalism.
      I
      don't
      feel
      any
      obligation
      to
      "open
      up".
      And
      I
      definitely
      don't
      see
      the
      West
      as
      the
      "bad
      guy"
      who
      has
      the
      sole
      responsibility
      to
      overcome
      the
      clear
      division
      between
      East
      and
      West.
      I'm
      sick
      and
      tired
      of
      being
      blamed
      for
      that.

       gt;But
      the
      affair
      shows
      how
      those
      with
      ties
      to
      Trump
      and
      his
      administration
      were
      pursuing
      business
      deals
      in
      Ukraine
      that
      went
      far
      beyond
      advancing
      the
      president #8217;s
      personal
      political
      interests.
      It
      also
      raises
      questions
      about
      whether
      Trump
      allies
      were
      mixing
      business
      and
      politics
      just
      as
      Republicans
      were
      calling
      for
      a
      probe
      of
      Biden
      and
      his
      son
      Hunter,
      who
      served
      five
      years
      on
      the
      board
      of
      another
      Ukrainian
      energy
      company,
      Burisma.
       gt;
      The
      Trump
      and
      Giuliani
      allies
      driving
      the
      attempt
      to
      change
      the
      senior
      management
      at
      Naftogazt,
      however,
      appear
      to
      have
      had
      inside
      knowledge
      of
      the
      U.S.
      government #8217;s
      plans
      in
      Ukraine.
      For
      example,
      they
      told
      people
      that
      Trump
      would
      replace
      the
      U.S.
      ambassador
      there
      months
      before
      she
      was
      actually
      recalled
      to
      Washington,
      according
      to
      three
      of
      the
      individuals
      interviewed
      by
      the
      AP.
      One
      of
      the
      individuals
      said
      he
      was
      so
      concerned
      by
      the
      whole
      affair
      that
      he
      reported
      it
      to
      a
      U.S.
      Embassy
      official
      in
      Ukraine
      months
      ago.
      At
      this
      point,
      it's
      hard
      to
      tell
      which
      of
      those
      two
      countries
      is
      more
      corrupt.

      Maybe
      you're
      right.
      Maybe
      not.
      Maybe
      it
      is
      fake
      news.
      I
      don't
      know.
      But
      the
      only
      source
      I
      can
      find
      claiming
      it's
      fake
      news,
      is...
      the
      Russian
      Embassy
      in
      Norway.
      But
      that's
      not
      really
      surprising,
      cause
      Russia
      always
      denies
      everything.
      We
      shouldn't
      even
      bother
      asking
      them
      anymore
      when
      something
      happens.
      We
      already
      know
      their
      answer.
      So
      is
      it
      fake?
      I
      have
      no
      clue.

      That's
      why
      I
      said
      I

      that

      they

      seen
      in
      your
      media
      ANY
      good
      news
      about
      Russia?
      Yeah,
      sure.
      Just
      last
      week,
      our
      media
      reported
      about
      Russia
      ratifying
      the
      Paris
      Agreement.
      Good
      news,
      even
      though
      the
      Paris
      Agreement
      itself
      won't
      be
      enough.
      But
      that's
      not
      Russia's
      fault.
      I've
      read
      about
      lower
      alcohol
      consumption
      (43%
      fall)
      as
      well,
      which,
      in
      Russia's
      case,
      is
      a
      very
      good
      thing.
       gt;No.
      We
      are
      the
      World's
      evil
      and
      threat.
      I'm
      just
      saying
      that
      in
      recent
      years
      you've
      been
      meddling/messing
      in
      other
      countries
      quite
      frequently.
      And
      when
      I
      say
      *in*,
      I
      literally
      mean
      *in*
      and
      *on*
      other
      countries'
      soil.
      (I'm
      aware
      Russia
      is
      not
      alone
      in
      this
      and
      other
      countries
      do
      it,
      too.
      So
      you
      don't
      have
      to
      use
      that
      whataboutism.)
      Look.
      I'm
      not
      saying
      this
      particular
      incident
      is
      real.
      But
      I'm
      not
      saying
      it
      isn't
      either.
      I
      just
      don't
      know.

      Thanks.
      That's
      what
      I

      Still,

      I

      had
      you

      piece

      anti-Russian
      propaganda
      you
      read
      on
      an
      anti-Russian
      subreddit.
      That's
      why
      I
      *explicitly*
      stated
      that
      I
      didn't

      in
      my
      very
      first

      You
      can
      look
      it
      up,
      it's
      right
      above.
      Of
      course,
      there's
      a
      lot
      of
      propaganda,
      but
      on
      the

      a

      of
      negative
      news
      about
      Russia
      often
      appears
      to
      be
      true
      as
      well.
      So
      I'm
      not
      gonna
      apologize
      for
      not
      immediately
      refuting
      negative
      news
      about
      Russia.
      And
      I
      won't
      do
      that
      in
      the
      future
      either.
      They
      showed
      time
      and
      again
      they're
      not
      reliable.

      PresidentS.
      Plural.
      Both
      Obama
      and
      Bush
      criticized
      us
      as
      well,
      but
      they
      did
      it
      in
      a
      more
      decent
      way.
      I
      know
      what
      Rutte
      said,
      but
      I
      have
      to
      see
      it
      before
      I
      believe
      it.
      2024
      is
      a
      long
      time
      from
      now,
      and
      a
      lot
      can
      happen
      between
      now
      and
      then.
      Besides
      that,
      I
      think
      it's
      kind
      of
      a
      disgrace
      that
      we're
      not
      meeting
      2%
      already.
      We're
      a
      rich
      country.
      We
      don't
      need
      to
      wait
      till
      2024.
      We
      could
      pay
      up
      next
      year
      already
      if
      we
      really
      wanted
      to.
      Easily.
      Or
      to
      put
      it
      in
      other
      words:
      if
      Rutte
      is
      sincere
      and
      means
      what
      he
      says,
      he
      wouldn't
      wait
      5
      years
      to
      get
      there.
      Edit:
      as
      someone
      else
      pointed
      out,
      Rutte
      [said](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten/toespraken/2019/10/03/toespraak-van-minister-president-mark-rutte-voor-de-atlantische-commissie)
      we
      will
      *not*
      get
      to
      2%
      by
      2024.
      Even
      more
      of
      a
      disgrace.

      a
      far-right
      extremist
      already.
      Stabbed
      to
      death.
      And
      Boris
      (the
      Prime
      Minister
      of
      the
      UK,
      the
      utmost
      representative
      of
      what
      the
      UK
      is
      supposed
      to
      stand
      for)
      says
      it's
      [humbug](https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/brexit-referendum/boris-johnson-condemned-lawmakers-receive-death-threats-over-brexit-n1058936)
      and
      they
      should
      stop
      whining
      if
      they
      don't
      want
      death
      threats.
      So
      I
      can't
      blame
      'm
      for
      installing
      panic
      alarms.
      I'd
      get
      a
      panic
      *room*
      if
      I
      were
      them.

      No,
      not
      due
      to
      the
      reduction
      of
      immigration,
      but
      due
      to
      [stockpiling](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/01/uk-manufacturers-start-stockpiling-for-no-deal-brexit-again)
      cause
      no
      one
      knows
      what
      the
      fuck
      is
      going
      to
      happen
      so
      they
      stockpile.
      They

      Current
      status
      of
      UK
      leaving:
      1.
      What's
      happening
      now
      is
      temporary
      cause
      no
      one
      has
      a
      fucking
      clue,
      not
      even
      the
      government.
      2.
      UK
      is
      still
      part
      of
      the
      EU.
      3.
      We
      will
      only
      know
      the
      true
      effects
      of
      Brexit
      in
      a
      decade
      or
      more,
      when
      no
      one
      really
      cares
      anymore
      whether
      they're
      better
      off
      inside
      the
      EU
      or
      out
      of
      it.
      Which
      is
      exactly
      what
      Brexiteers
      want.
