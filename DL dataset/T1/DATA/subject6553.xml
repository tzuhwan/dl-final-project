      Too
      much
      of
      a
      good
      thing
      has
      left
      me
      numb
      and
      melancholic.
      I
      feel
      absolutely
      worthless
      and
      dumb.
      I
      bother
      him
      so
      much.
      All
      the
      time,
      I #8217;m
      like
      a
      never
      ceasing
      crying
      child
      that
      won #8217;t
      shut
      up.
      I
      bet
      even
      my
      friends
      think
      I #8217;m
      a
      kiss-ass
      too.
      I
      came
      in
      early
      to
      make
      some
      buttons
      for
      the
      art
      club
      fail
      sale.
      The
      only
      reason
      I #8217;m
      trying
      is
      because
      I
      committed
      a
      long
      time
      ago.
      And
      that
      girl
      on
      newspaper
      interviewed
      me.
      I
      don #8217;t
      even
      know
      if
      I
      can
      get
      Erin
      to
      help
      me
      during
      lunch.
      I
      made
      my
      buttons
      and
      I
      forgot
      to
      ask
      him
      if
      we
      had
      permission
      to
      sell
      stuff
      until
      last
      night.
      I
      made
      him
      go
      all
      the
      way
      to
      the
      office
      for
      my
      stupid
      sale
      idea
      that
      will
      never
      profit.
      He
      asked
      me
      if
      I
      could
      explain
      the
      difference
      between
      digital
      design
      and
      graphic
      design
      and
      I
      failed
      miserably.
      I #8217;m
      a
      useless
      sack
      of
      garbage
      who
      can #8217;t
      even
      speak
      coherently.
      He
      probably
      thinks
      I #8217;m
      just
      a
      sad,
      useless
      loser
      now.
      I
      was
      going
      to
       #8220;anonymously #8221;
      donate
      some
      money
      to
      the
      sale
      so
      it
      would
      look
      like
      I
      actually
      accomplished
      something
      but
      now
      I #8217;m
      broke.
      I
      didn #8217;t
      get
      the
      scholarship.
      Any
      scholarship
      at
      all.
      Hell,
      even
      100$
      would
      have
      helped
      a
      ton.
      I
      cried
      for
      two
      solid
      hours
      straight
      and
      my
      eyes
      stung
      for
      the
      next
      two
      days.
      All
      that
      work
      for
      NOTHING.
      Maybe
      it
      was
      my
      portfolio,
      maybe
      it
      was
      my
      recommendation
      letter,
      maybe
      my
      statement
      of
      intent,
      or
      maybe
      they
      don #8217;t
      want
      a
      cis-gendered
      white
      female
      that
      doesn #8217;t
      draw
      cartoons
      and
      isn #8217;t
      very
      political.
      Milla
      hasn #8217;t
      even
      gotten
      an
      email
      yet
      and
      I
      bet
      that
      means
      she
      got
      a
      scholarship.
      If
      SHE
      got
      one,
      then
      I #8217;m
      definitely
      doing
      something
      wrong.
      I
      did
      the
      math
      and
      I
      cant
      pay
      $2,900
      by
      June
      1st.
      It #8217;s
      going
      to
      take
      a
      miracle
      if
      I
      want
      to
      go.
      I #8217;m
      going
      to
      call
      today
      or
      sometime
      this
      week
      and
      find
      out
      about
      payment
      plans
      and
      options.
      I
      don #8217;t
      want
      to
      disappoint
      Milla
      or
      Fink.
      I
      just
      want
      to
      run
      to
      the
      bathroom
      and
      cry
      and
      bang
      my
      head
      on
      the
      wall
      until
      I
      pass
      out.
      Everything
      looks
      bleak.
      I #8217;m
      an
      utter
      failure
      who
      can #8217;t
      do
      anything
      right.
      I
      just
      passed
      Erin
      in
      the
      hall
      and
      asked
      about
      him
      helping
      me
      with
      the
      sale
      during
      lunch
      and
      he
      looked
      confused
      thinking
      it
      was
      just
      on
      Wednesday.
      I
      hate
      myself.
      I
      want
      to
      smash
      my
      head
      and
      just
      die.
      I #8217;m
      gonna
      have
      to
      convince
      Mrs.
      H
      to
      let
      me
      take
      all
      three
      lunches.
      I
      hate
      myself.
      If
      I
      didn #8217;t
      have
      art,
      I #8217;d
      kill
      myself.
      I
      just
      want
      to
      do
      a
      good
      job
      for
      once.

      Some
      thoughts;
      I #8217;m
      still
      the
      same
      old
      sack
      of
      shit.
      After
      all
      my
      drama
      this
      morning,
      things
      worked
      out
      fine
      like
      they
      always
      do
      on
      Mondays.
      Why
      did
      I
      doubt
      myself
      or
      anyone
      else?
      The
      sale
      went
      better
      than
      expected,
      class
      was
      alright,
      zine
      club
      was
      great.
      Yet
      I #8217;m
      lying
      on
      my
      bed
      like
      a
      lump
      of
      fat
      with
      27
      bleeding
      cuts
      on
      my
      left
      thigh.
      I
      called
      the
      CE
      office
      and
      found
      out
      that
      even
      if
      I
      do
      smaller
      payments,
      it #8217;s
      still
      gotta
      be
      in
      my
      June
      1st.
      Now
      I #8217;m
      really
      screwed.
      Working
      overtime
      is
      not
      an
      option,
      and
      I #8217;m
      deathly
      scared
      to
      tell
      dad
      I
      didn #8217;t
      get
      the
      scholarship.
      He
      won #8217;t
      ever
      understand
      how
      much
      this
      means
      to
      me.
      Fink
      suggested
      writing
      a
      grant
      proposal
      to
      the
      PTA.
      Apparently
      they
      don #8217;t
      often
      get
      grant
      requests
      from
      students,
      so
      I #8217;m
      hoping
      I
      have
      some
      chances.
      I
      don #8217;t
      want
      to
      write
      something
      TOO
      pretentious,
      but
      I
      really
      need
      that
      money.
      The
      last
      thing
      I
      want
      to
      do
      is
      get
      my
      hopes
      up.
      Because
      the
      second
      I
      do,
      according
      to
      Murphy #8217;s
      law,
      that
      grant
      goes
      straight
      to
      the
      trash.
      Not
      going
      to
      this
      camp
      or
      college
      seems
      really
      appealing
      to
      me
      right
      now.
      But
      this
      is
      my
      only
      path
      to
      success.
      But
      who
      needs
      success
      anyways?
      My
      dream
      life
      is
      living
      in
      some
      trailer
      park
      where
      the
      winters
      aren #8217;t
      2
      degrees,
      and
      where
      I
      can
      live
      in
      peace
      and
      draw
      for
      the
      rest
      of
      my
      days.
      Anyways,
      today
      was
      alright,
      as
      far
      as
      days
      of
      the
      week
      go.
      I
      wish
      this
      whole
      camp
      thing
      wasn #8217;t
      looming
      over
      me.
      I
      need
      to
      talk
      to
      dad
      ASAP.
      But
      I
      want
      to
      write
      a
      rough
      draft
      for
      my
      grant
      proposal
      before
      Fink
      leaves
      for
      his
      conference
      or
      whatever.
      I #8217;m
      so
      glad
      he
      asked
      me
      what
      was
      wrong.
      Wish
      he
      would
      have
      done
      that
      4
      months
      ago.

      I
      love
      how
      every
      day
      of
      my
      life
      is
      just
      one
      mood-swinging
      rollercoaster
      anymore.
      The
      sale
      went
      well
      today.
      Made
      33$.
      That #8217;s
      a
      total
      of
      about
      50$
      so
      far.
      Which
      I #8217;m
      honestly
      surprised
      about.
      I
      stressed
      about
      writing
      a
      grant
      and
      came
      up
      with
      an
      outline
      and
      later
      found
      out
      that
      it #8217;s
      pointless
      to
      write
      one
      to
      the
      PTA
      for
      something
      like
      this.
      That
      ruined
      me.
      I
      came
      to
      terms
      with
      not
      being
      able
      to
      go
      to
      the
      camp
      that
      hour,
      and
      I
      cried
      it
      out
      and
      was
      just
      really
      depressed
      the
      rest
      of
      class.
      I
      went
      to
      the
      bathroom
      right
      before
      the
      bell
      because
      I
      had
      to
      cry
      and
      shit
      like
      a
      pathetic
      loser,
      and
      I
      came
      back
      to
      grab
      my
      bag
      and
      on
      the
      way
      Milla
      said
      that
      Fink
      wanted
      to
      talk
      to
      me,
      and
      I
      was
      like,
      what??
      So
      I
      went
      in
      sheepishly
      and
      he
      was
      like
      Oh
      Syd,
      I
      need
      to
      talk
      to
      you.
      I
      shrugged
      and
      continued
      to
      be
      sad.
      I
      technically
      should
      have
      been
      in
      the
      basement
      taking
      my
      math
      test
      but
      screw
      that.
      I #8217;m
      already
      failing
      anyways.
      He
      told
      me
      to
      walk
      with
      him
      because
      he
      had
      a
      meeting
      to
      go
      to.
      And
      HOLY
      COW.
      This
      man
      is
      the
      nicest
      and
      most
      caring
      person
      I
      have
      ever
      met
      (but
      I
      already
      knew
      that
      anyways.)
      He
      genuinely
      cares
      about
      ME.
      Stupid
      old
      me
      who
      really
      isn #8217;t
      that
      great
      of
      an
      artist
      anyways
      but
      is
      obsessed
      with
      pleasing
      him.
      He
      said
      that
      there
      is
      another
      school
      fund
      that
      might
      be
      available
      to
      help.
      I
      was
      a
      little
      sheepish
      when
      I
      found
      out
      I #8217;d
      have
      to
      directly
      talk
      to
      someone
      in
      person.
      I #8217;m
      pretty
      bad
      at
      that
      and
      he
      knows
      it.
      I
      thanked
      him,
      and
      went
      down
      to
      sit
      by
      the
      painting
      room
      waiting
      for
      dad.
      Logan
      came
      around
      the
      corner
      and
      we
      started
      talking
      and
      I
      opened
      up
      about
      the
      whole
      camp
      situation.
      He
      was
      sick
      yesterday
      so
      had
      no
      clue.
      I
      cried
      and
      whines
      like
      a
      sad
      little
      artsy
      bitch.
      I
      hate
      myself
      sometimes.
      But
      he #8217;s
      so
      understanding!
      I
      love
      him
      aaaa.
      I
      was
      SO
      SCARED
      to
      talk
      to
      dad
      about
      any
      of
      this.
      I
      just
      didn #8217;t
      think
      I #8217;d
      know
      how.
      But
      tonight
      was
      a
      miracle.
      Anyways,
      when
      I
      got
      home,
      I
      had
      already
      come
      to
      the
      decision
      I
      wouldn #8217;t
      go
      to
      the
      camp.
      I
      was
      disappointed
      but
      life
      would
      continue.
      I
      wrote
      a
      long
      text
      to
      Fink
      explaining
      that
      there #8217;s
      no
      way
      I #8217;m
      gonna
      be
      able
      to
      go,
      and
      that
      I
      really
      appreciate
      how
      much
      he #8217;s
      trying
      to
      help
      me.
      He
      wrote
      me
      back
      while
      I
      was
      at
      work
      saying
      that
      he
      wants
      me
      to
      make
      smart
      decisions
      and
      stuff
      and
      that
      he
      wants
      to
      do
      everything
      in
      his
      power
      to
      help.
      I
      am
      so
      thankful
      for
      him.
      I
      don #8217;t
      know
      where
      I
      would
      be
      without
      all
      that
      he #8217;s
      done
      for
      me.
      I
      decided
      then
      I #8217;d
      try
      to
      go
      still.
      I #8217;ll
      do
      everything
      in
      my
      power.
      We
      went
      to
      IKEA
      after
      I
      got
      off
      work.
      Dad
      was
      in
      a
      good
      mood,
      we
      all
      were.
      It
      was
      a
      miracle.
      IKEA
      always
      does
      that
      to
      him
      for
      some
      odd
      reason.
      Anyways,
      we
      got
      home
      and
      I
      hung
      around
      in
      the
      basement
      waiting
      for
      my
      opportunity
      to
      talk
      about
      the
      camp
      and
      my
      situation.
      IT
      WENT
      SURPRISINGLY
      WELL!
      He
      doesn #8217;t
      seem
      absolutely
      opposed
      to
      it
      like
      before!
      Maybe
      it #8217;s
      because
      I
      gave
      him
      a
      lot
      more
      info
      or
      something,
      or
      maybe
      it
      was
      the
      IKEA
      frozen
      yogurt
      in
      his
      stomach.
      Regardless,
      things
      look
      brighter
      for
      sure.
      I
      need
      to
      decide
      ASAP.
      I
      want
      to
      pay
      the
      300$
      deposit
      by
      Friday
      or
      sooner.
      My
      stupid
      reddit
      diary
      entries
      sound
      so
      fake.
      I
      kind
      of
      wish
      I #8217;d
      just
      spit
      out
      everything
      that
      came
      to
      my
      mind,
      but
      I #8217;m
      not
      sure
      that #8217;s
      for
      the
      best
      long
      term.
      I
      just
      think
      that
      every
      day
      is
      important,
      no
      matter
      how
      great
      or
      bad.
      And
      there
      are
      thousands
      and
      thousands
      of
      days
      in
      my
      past
      I
      have
      absolutely
      no
      recollection
      of
      that
      I
      wish
      I
      could
      remember.

      Now
      I #8217;ve
      really
      done
      it.
      I
      didn #8217;t
      even
      get
      to
      tell
      him
      I
      changed
      my
      mind
      and
      decided
      not
      to
      give
      up.
      I
      hate
      myself.
      A
      whole
      11
      days
      without
      seeing
      or
      hearing
      from
      him.
      I
      sound
      like
      a
      desperate
      creep,
      I #8217;m
      just
      so
      dependent
      on
      his
      approval,
      I
      don #8217;t
      know
      who
      or
      what
      I
      am
      without
      it.
      IM
      SUCH
      AN
      IDIOT!
      I
      should
      have
      told
      him
      about
      last
      night.
      I
      feel
      like
      I #8217;ve
      failed
      him.
      Winter
      break
      was
      bad
      enough,
      but
      spring
      break
      is
      gonna
      be
      hell.
      I
      don #8217;t
      know
      how
      to
      convince
      dad.
      Gotta
      gage
      what
      kind
      of
      mood
      he #8217;s
      in
      first.
      I
      really
      wanna
      bruise
      myself,
      but
      I
      like
      cutting,
      I
      only
      bruise
      so
      that
      he
      might
      ask.
      Peace
      out
      void

      Milla
      isn #8217;t
      even
      going
      to
      go
      to
      the
      camp
      anymore.
      Her
      mom
      wants
      her
      to
      go
      to
      some
      painting
      class
      in
      Switzerland.
      Knowing
      her,
      I
      know
      that #8217;s
      what
      she #8217;d
      pick,
      but
      I
      am
      going
      to
      be
      SO
      lonely.
      I
      paid
      the
      deposit
      last
      night
      and
      switched
      my
      major
      to
      printmaking.
      I
      hope
      it
      will
      be
      beneficial.
      I
      don #8217;t
      know
      what
      I
      want
      to
      do
      with
      my
      life
      anymore,
      obviously
      art,
      but
      WHAT
      exactly??
      Things
      are
      going
      crazy
      and
      I
      just
      want
      to
      cry.
      I #8217;m
      trying
      to
      have
      a
      positive
      outlook
      on
      things
      but
      it #8217;s
      so
      hard.
      I
      wanna
      lose
      weight
      before
      the
      camp.
      Mostly
      so
      I #8217;ll
      have
      more
      pants
      and
      shorts
      to
      fit
      into,
      and
      also
      no
      one
      wants
      to
      be
      friends
      with
      the
      fat
      kid.
      Now
      I #8217;m
      gonna
      eat
      diet
      Apple
      Jacks
      for
      breakfast,
      lunch,
      and
      dinner.
      Woohoo.

      A
      shift
      in
      my
      life
      is
      approaching
      and
      I
      don #8217;t
      know
      what
      it
      will
      be
      or
      how
      it
      will
      play
      out.
      I #8217;ve
      had
      these
      senses
      before.
      The
      last
      time
      was
      6
      months
      before
      mom
      died.
      I
      knew
      I #8217;d
      lose
      someone
      important
      to
      me
      that
      year
      and
      I
      wasn #8217;t
      wrong.
      I
      knew
      it
      the
      second
      I
      got
      back
      in
      the
      car
      that
      day.
      I #8217;ve
      got
      some
      sort
      of
      super
      intuition.
      Things
      are
      going
      to
      change.
      Soon,
      but
      not
      too
      soon.
      I #8217;m
      going
      to
      realize
      something
      about
      myself
      or
      life
      that
      will
      change
      everything.
      I
      can
      feel
      it.
      My
      life
      is
      some
      sick
      system
      of
      cycles
      inside
      of
      bigger
      cycles
      that
      move
      at
      different
      speeds
      and
      at
      different
      sizes.
      Everything
      repeats
      itself.
      We
      are
      just
      too
      blind
      to
      see.
      I
      need
      to
      track
      it.
      I
      need
      concrete
      proof
      for
      myself.
      Things
      haven #8217;t
      felt
      real
      lately.
      I
      feel
      like
      I #8217;m
      floating
      through
      time
      or
      I #8217;ve
      drifted
      into
      some
      alternate
      state.
      I
      don #8217;t
      feel
      at
      home
      in
      my
      room,
      I
      never
      know
      what
      day
      it
      is.
      The
      idea
      of
      work
      sickens
      me.
      The
      uncertainty
      of
      the
      future
      scares
      me
      more
      than
      anything.
      School
      felt
      like
      school
      today,
      a
      feeling
      I
      haven #8217;t
      felt
      in
      months,
      even
      a
      year.
      I
      need
      Fink,
      he
      takes
      my
      mind
      of
      the
      numbness
      of
      life.
       #8220;I #8217;m
      worth
      it. #8221;
      He
      said.
      How
      can
      I
      be
      worth
      it?
      I #8217;m
      worth
      nothing,
      I #8217;m
      not
      even
      good
      enough
      to
      get
      even
      a
      partial
      scholarship
      to
      a
      stupid
      high
      school
      art
      camp.
      What
      does
      that
      say
      about
      me
      now?
      Am
      I
      really
      worth
      it?
      Or
      is
      it
      because
      I #8217;m
      a
      kiss-ass
      who
      is
      obsessed
      with
      his
      praise
      and
      approval?
      Would
      he
      think
      the
      same
      of
      me
      if
      he
      realized
      how
      much
      I
      think
      of
      him?
      He #8217;s
      the
      father
      figure
      I #8217;ve
      always
      needed.
      My
      own
      has
      left
      me
      alone
      with
      years
      of
      bottled
      emotions
      and
      feelings.
      I #8217;m
      beginning
      to
      understand
      what
      mom
      went
      through.
      If
      dad
      knew
      what
      went
      on
      in
      my
      head
      he
      would
      treat
      me
      like
      her.
      Fink
      doesn #8217;t
      do
      that
      to
      me.
      He #8217;s
      the
      one
      adult
      in
      my
      life
      who
      sees
      people
      from
      the
      heart
      instead
      of
      clouded
      judgement
      like
      my
      father.
      He
      understands
      empathy,
      the
      most
      important
      thing
      a
      person
      can
      have.
      It
      helps
      we
      agree
      on
      most
      everything
      when
      it
      comes
      to
      art,
      and
      he
      shares
      that
      same
      passion
      for
      it
      I
      do.
      He #8217;s
      just
      had
      more
      time
      to
      make
      it.
      But
      he
      CARES.
      More
      than
      anyone
      I #8217;ve
      ever
      seen.
      And
      it #8217;s
      genuine.
      There
      aren #8217;t
      a
      lot
      of
      genuines
      in
      my
      life.
      I
      want
      to
      make
      him
      proud
      with
      who
      I
      am
      and
      what
      I
      create
      because
      he
      understands
      in
      a
      way
      my
      dad
      doesn #8217;t.
      I
      still
      think
      about
      the
      day
      I
      cried
      on
      the
      bus
      when
      we
      passed
      where
      we
      used
      to
      live
      and
      where
      I
      found
      out
      mom
      died.
      He
      noticed
      something
      was
      up
      and
      when
      I
      got
      back
      to
      class
      to
      grab
      my
      bags
      he
      caught
      me
      in
      the
      hallway
      before
      I
      left.
      He
      asked
      me
      what
      was
      wrong
      and
      I
      couldn #8217;t
      tell
      him
      the
      full
      truth.
      I
      don #8217;t
      know
      if
      I #8217;ll
      ever
      be
      able
      to
      tell
      him.
      I
      just
      said
      it
      was
      hard
      going
      by
      there
      and
      I
      said
       #8220;I #8217;m
      sorry #8221;
      a
      hundred
      times
      like
      an
      idiot.
      And
      then
      he
      hugged
      me.
      And
      it
      was
      the
      first
      time
      I #8217;d
      felt
      safe
      and
      understood
      since
      mom
      died.
      He
      will
      never
      know
      how
      much
      I
      needed
      that
      hug.
      He
      will
      never
      know
      how
      much
      he
      means
      to
      me
      and
      I
      hate
      myself
      for
      not
      expressing
      my
      gratitude
      enough.
      He
      saved
      me.
      I
      had
      hit
      rock
      bottom
      by
      December.
      My
      self
      harm
      was
      at
      its
      worst.
      And
      it
      wasn #8217;t
      until
      school
      started
      again
      and
      I
      had
      two
      whole
      classes
      with
      him
      that
      I
      started
      becoming
      happy
      again.
      Things
      are
      going
      good
      overall.
      Obviously
      I #8217;m
      still
      a
      mess
      but
      I #8217;ve
      always
      been
      a
      mess.
      It #8217;s
      just
      been
      a
      pretty
      big
      mess
      this
      week
      that #8217;s
      all.
      I
      don #8217;t
      want
      to
      think
      about
      mom
      or
      Fink
      right
      now.
      I
      kind
      of
      got
      off
      on
      a
      tangent
      again.
      I
      seem
      to
      have
      a
      problem
      with
      that.
      I
      just
      gotta
      make
      it
      to
      Sunday.
      Then
      I
      can
      relax
      for
      a
      few
      days.

      Things
      don #8217;t
      feel
      real.
      I #8217;m
      SO
      tired
      all
      the
      time.
      I
      just
      fell
      asleep
      in
      the
      middle
      of
      the
      afternoon.
      That
      never
      happens.
      I
      n
      eeed
      to
      wake
      up.
      I
      need
      to
      go
      to
      work.
      Today
      sucked.
      I #8217;ll
      never
      remember
      this
      day
      ever.
      Doesn #8217;t
      that
      make
      you
      sad.
      How
      much
      of
      our
      lives
      are
      forgotten,
      or
      pushed
      into
      our
      dormant
      minds?
      Anyways,
      I
      should
      get
      ready.
      I
      have
      to
      take
      care
      of
      myself
      this
      week.

      He
      replied
      to
      my
      story,
       #8220;YAY,
      Go
      Me!! #128588; #8221;
      I
      don #8217;t
      know
      what
      to
      feel.
      I
      saw
      the
      notification
      and
      smiled
      and
      smiled
      but
      I
      feel
      so
      much
      guilt.
      I
      feel
      guilty
      about
      not
      being
      excited
      about
      going.
      I #8217;m
      so
      used
      to
      pushing
      my
      hopes
      down
      low
      so
      I
      won #8217;t
      be
      disappointed.
      I
      don #8217;t
      even
      know
      what
      expectations
      are
      real
      anymore.
      I
      need
      to
      figure
      out
      a
      payment
      system
      with
      dad
      real
      quick
      or
      else
      things
      could
      get
      messy.
      I
      need
      this
      camp.
      It #8217;ll
      get
      me
      into
      college
      easier.
      It #8217;ll
      set
      me
      up
      for
      my
      future.
      But
      I
      can #8217;t
      help
      thinking,
      what
      if
      the
      teachers
      are
      shitty?
      What
      if
      my
      roommate
      is
      annoying?
      What
      if
      I
      don #8217;t
      learn
      a
      single
      new
      thing?
      What
      if
      dad
      won #8217;t
      let
      me
      go
      when
      he
      finds
      out
      there
      might
      be
      nude
      figure
      models?
      What
      if
      he
      won #8217;t
      let
      me
      go
      because
      Milla
      can #8217;t?
      What
      if
      I
      get
      sick?
      What
      if
      I
      can #8217;t
      draw
      good?
      What
      if
      I #8217;m
      not
      the
      best?
      I
      hate
      myself.
      Why
      am
      I
      so
      anxious
      and
      paranoid?
      Why
      can #8217;t
      I
      be
      a
      happier
      person?
      Why
      can #8217;t
      I
      just
      be
      cool
      for
      once?
      Why
      am
      I
      so
      high
      maintenance?
      I
      feel
      the
      hundreds
      of
      scars
      beneath
      my
      pants
      and
      I
      wonder
      why
      I
      stopped.
      Was
      it
      boredom,
      or
      have
      I
      gotten
      better?
      All
      of
      my
      friends
      are
      so
      open
      about
      their
      issues
      and
      share
      their
      accomplishments
      with
      the
      world
      every
      day.
      And
      I #8217;m
      proud
      of
      them,
      and
      I
      never
      think
      of
      them
      wrongly
      when
      they
      do.
      Yet
      whenever
      I
      put
      myself
      out
      there,
      I
      feel
      as
      though
      I #8217;m
      wasting
      peoples
      time.
      I
      wish
      I #8217;d
      learn
      to
      take
      a
      compliment.
      I #8217;m
      trying,
      but
      it
      feels
      so
      unnatural.
      Tomorrow
      I
      work
      a
      day
      of
      my
      life
      away.
      Every
      Saturday.
      Every
      week.
      Down
      the
      drain
      for
      money.
      Money
      I #8217;ve
      spent
      because
      I
      couldn #8217;t
      learn
      contentment.
      But
      I
      won #8217;t
      complain.
      I #8217;m
      lucky
      to
      have
      my
      job.
      It #8217;s
      definitely
      not
      the
      best
      possible
      one,
      but
      it #8217;s
      all
      I #8217;ve
      known.
      Anyways,
      I
      should
      sleep.
      My
      sleep
      cycle
      is
      wack
      because
      I #8217;ve
      been
      going
      to
      bed
      so
      late
      recently.

      That #8217;s
      why
      I
      journal.
      I
      hate
      having
      my
      life
      just
      be
      wasted
      away.
      It #8217;s
      just
      nice
      to
      be
      able
      to
      remember.
      To
      try
      and
      track
      the
      otherwise
      untrackable.

      I #8217;ve
      come
      to
      terms
      with
      expecting
      a
      normal
      life.
      I
      think
      most
      people
      have
      in
      a
      way.
      Normal
      for
      me
      means
      a
      steady
      job
      that
      isn #8217;t
      physically
      exhausting,
      being
      able
      to
      make
      and
      sell
      my
      art
      on
      the
      side,
      and
      an
      apartment
      that
      isn #8217;t
      falling
      apart.
      That #8217;s
      all
      I
      need
      in
      life
      to
      be
      happy.
      A
      family
      would
      be
      nice
      too,
      but
      isn #8217;t
      necessary.
      I
      can
      accomplish
      this
      without
      being
      a
      high
      school
      art
      prodigy.
      However,
      I
      desperately
      want
      to
      go
      to
      college,
      and
      the
      only
      way
      I #8217;ll
      make
      it
      is
      if
      I
      get
      good
      scholarships.
      I
      need
      to
      build
      my
      brand
      now.
      Become
      a
      recognized
      name
      amongst
      the
      local
      art
      scene.
      Then
      I #8217;m
      sure
      to
      get
      great
      scholarships.
      I
      don #8217;t
      know
      why
      I #8217;m
      writing
      this
      because
      it
      sounds
      so
      pretentious,
      and
      I
      already
      know
      this
      stuff
      by
      heart,
      but
      I
      need
      to
      remember
      that
      things
      will
      be
      okay.
      I #8217;ve
      always
      adapted
      to
      change
      and
      tragedy.
      I
      can
      make
      it.
      I
      just
      can #8217;t
      help
      but
      feel
      guilty
      when
      I
      sit
      around
      all
      day.
      I
      know
      that
      I
      need
      to
      set
      aside
      days
      to
      do
      that
      without
      feeling
      guilty,
      but
      I
      just
      can #8217;t
      shake
      the
      guilt.
      Whatever.
      I #8217;m
      exhausted,
      just
      worked
      for
      10
      hours
      on
      my
      feet.
      All
      I
      know
      is
      that
      I
      need
      a
      job
      where
      I #8217;m
      not
      on
      my
      feet
      all
      day
      when
      I #8217;m
      out
      of
      college....
      if
      I
      go
      to
      college.

      God
      I
      wish
      I
      could
      tell
      my
      favorite
      teacher
      about
      my
      self
      harm.
      I
      just
      can #8217;t.
      He #8217;d
      tell
      my
      parents,
      and
      he #8217;d
      never
      see
      me
      the
      same.
      You #8217;re
      lucky,
      you
      should
      just
      talk
      to
      him!
