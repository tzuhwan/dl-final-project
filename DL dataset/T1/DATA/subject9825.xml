      In
      CoP
      i
      mostly
      prefer
      an
      assault
      gun
      (Strelok's
      SGi)
      and
      a
      sniper
      rifle
      to
      pick
      of
      enemies
      form
      afar
      (Lynx
      is
      my
      absolute
      favourite
      here)
      i
      carry
      as
      much
      anti
      rads
      i
      can,
      the
      same
      applies
      with
      medkits,
      food
      is
      optional
      mostly
      because
      every

      has

      five
      months

      The
      ZONE(part1)
      I
      never
      wanted
      to
      come
      to
      the
      so-called
      Zone.
      I
      joined
      the
      Ukrainian
      Military
      just
      to
      escape
      the
      bad
      conditions
      of
      my
      poor
      town,
      but
      when
      a
      letter
      came
      that
      i
      was
      being
      relocated
      to
      the
      military
      cordon
      there
      my
      heart
      sank.
      I
      heard
      so
      many
      frightening
      stories
      about
      it,
      mutants
      ready
      to
      tear
      you
      apart
      every
      time
      your
      guard
      is
      down,
      anomalies
      where
      one
      wrong
      step
      means
      being
      incinerated,
      electrified
      or
      torn
      to
      shreds
      quite
      literally.
      I'm
      surprised
      i
      didn't
      puke
      right
      then
      and
      there.
      I
      arrived
      there
      by
      jeep,
      from
      my
      first
      glance
      i
      could
      see
      that
      they
      were
      throwing
      away
      the
      worst
      of
      the
      worst
      here.
      The
      commander
      was
      blackout
      drunk,
      most
      men
      were
      shitting
      their
      pants,
      not
      to
      lie
      i
      did
      too
      but
      at
      least
      i
      knew
      how
      to
      use
      an
      AK-74.
      The
      worst
      part
      was
      when
      the
      night
      came,
      i
      was
      on
      guard
      duty
      when
      i
      saw
      some
      older
      guys
      force
      a
      younger
      soldier
      into
      the
      dark
      night
      to
      get
      them
      vodka.
      The
      man
      was
      found
      dead
      the
      next
      morning
      with
      his
      neck
      broken,
      poor
      bastard.
      If
      this
      continues
      i
      swear
      i'll
      join
      those
      damn
      Loners
      or
      whatever
      they
      are
      called.
      Let's
      hope
      i
      won't
      be
      the
      next
      poor
      bastard
      who's
      sent
      to
      get
      his
      superiors
      drunk.

      Mountain
      grave
      "Please
      god
      please
      if
      you
      are
      there
      please
      save
      me"
      i
      prayed
      like
      there
      was
      no
      tomorrow,
      until
      that
      point
      i
      believed
      in
      the
      Russian
      army,
      i
      thought
      it
      would
      be
      like
      my
      grandpa's
      World
      War
      two
      stories.
      I
      thought
      like
      it
      would
      be
      like
      Berlin,
      that
      we'd
      capture
      the
      city
      and
      be
      victorious.
      And
      yet
      here
      is
      where
      we
      were,
      surrounded,
      half
      of
      our
      men
      were
      either
      missing
      or
      dead,
      or
      vehicles
      were
      nothing
      more
      than
      burning
      scrap
      metal.
      I
      prayed
      behind
      a
      destroyed
      AC,
      until
      one
      of
      my
      comrades
      pulled
      me
      away
      from
      it
      "what
      are
      you
      doing
      Yura
      are
      you
      stupid?!
      Move
      your
      ass
      we
      lost
      enough
      men
      already!
      Move!"
      It
      was
      strange,
      minutes
      before
      it
      was
      quiet
      until
      we
      got
      a
      warning
      of
      the
      attack,
      the
      Chechen
      commander
      begged
      us
      to
      leave,
      but
      we
      couldn't,
      our
      lieutenant
      didn't
      have
      the
      authority
      to
      do
      so.
      We
      were
      running
      out
      of
      ammo
      really
      quickly.
      Those
      damn
      Chechens,
      this
      was
      their
      homeland
      they
      knew
      it
      better
      than
      their
      pockets,
      this
      was
      their
      little
      playground
      and
      we
      were
      the
      new
      kids
      on
      the
      block,
      this
      was
      their
      hell
      we
      created.
      "We
      have
      to
      escape
      this
      hell
      comrades!
      NOW!"
      I
      remember
      one
      soldier
      yelling
      at
      us,
      even
      though
      we
      were
      exhausted,
      without
      ammo,
      we
      had
      one
      instinct,
      to
      survive,
      we
      all
      fought
      like
      cornered
      rats,
      like
      animals.
      We
      looked
      at
      a
      street,
      it
      seemed
      deserted,
      i
      could
      smell
      the
      borscht
      cooking
      and
      the
      cold
      night
      air
      accompanied
      it.
      "Alright,
      i'll
      go
      first,
      you
      follow
      me"
      said
      one
      of
      my
      comrades,
      i
      don't
      remember
      their
      names,
      i
      choose
      not
      to,
      i'd
      rather
      not
      remember
      anything
      from
      that
      night.
      He
      sprinted,
      he
      made
      it
      about
      half
      way
      there
      before
      his
      head
      twitched
      in
      the
      left,
      he
      was
      hit
      by
      a
      sniper.
      I
      then
      remembered
      my
      grandpa's
      words,
      from
      his
      time
      in
      the
      Red
      Army
      "death
      isn't
      scary
      Yura,
      it's
      natural,
      i
      met
      with
      death
      many
      many
      times
      during
      the
      war,
      and
      i
      was
      afraid,
      like
      a
      small
      child
      i
      wanted
      to
      cry.
      I
      wanted
      my
      mother's
      hug,
      but
      i
      became
      brave,
      so
      can
      you,
      you
      are
      a
      very
      very
      strong
      and
      a
      brave
      boy."
      My
      grandpa
      was
      always
      there
      for
      me,
      he
      was
      like
      a
      second
      father
      to
      me,
      when
      i
      went
      to
      the
      army
      he
      gave
      me
      a
      medal,
      it
      wasn't
      his
      but
      it
      was
      from
      the
      one
      of
      the
      bravest
      men
      he
      served
      with.
      It
      read
      "The
      order
      of
      the
      Red
      banner"
      and
      as
      i
      knew
      it
      belonged
      to
      some
      Boris
      guy.
      "Maybe
      if
      we
      run
      all
      at
      once
      that
      sniper
      wouldn't
      be
      able
      to
      shoot
      us
      all"
      suggested
      one
      of
      us,
      it
      was
      a
      stupid
      plan
      but
      we
      still
      ran
      like
      flies
      without
      heads.
      I
      closed
      my
      eyes,
      i
      couldn't
      bare
      looking
      at
      death,
      i
      tried
      to
      be
      brave
      but
      i
      couldn't,
      i
      only
      opened
      my
      eyes
      when
      i
      rammed
      my
      head
      in
      a
      wall.
      I
      looked
      back,
      out
      of
      four
      or
      us
      only
      two
      of
      us
      remained,
      the
      entire
      night
      we
      crawled
      through
      the
      fire.
      Thankfully
      we
      were
      saved
      by
      paratroopers
      and
      sent
      off
      this
      hell,
      i
      wanted
      to
      be
      friends
      with
      that
      survivor
      but
      i
      learned
      he
      killed
      himself
      shortly
      after
      coming
      home.
      I
      wish
      my
      grandpa
      was
      here,
      he'd
      know
      how
      i
      feel
      right
      now.

      The
      ZONE
      (part
      2)
      It
      wasn't
      the
      same
      in
      the
      Zone
      after
      the
      largest
      emission
      yet,
      and
      it
      was
      noticeable.
      Everyone
      was
      different,
      more
      angry
      to
      put
      it
      simply.
      Our
      cordon
      commander
      Major
      Khaletskiy
      got
      more
      and
      more
      angrier
      and
      unstable.
      He
      made
      bad
      decisions
      that
      ultimately
      costed
      him
      his
      head,
      the
      biggest
      one
      was
      underestimating
      the
      stalkers
      and
      selling
      them
      out
      to
      the
      bandits.
      I
      also
      heard
      that
      there
      were
      even
      faction
      wars
      but
      i
      didn't
      find
      it
      important
      enough.
      Not
      to
      mention
      that
      there
      were
      new
      anomalies,
      just
      the
      other
      day
      one
      of
      our
      veterans
      stepped
      into
      a
      anomaly
      and
      it
      tore
      him
      to
      shreds,
      it
      still
      gives
      me
      nightmares.
      The
      Zone
      became
      a
      different
      place,
      a
      worse
      place,
      a
      more
      dangerous
      place,
      but
      i
      didn't
      know
      i
      was
      about
      to
      be
      thrown
      right
      into
      it.
      One
      night,
      which
      was
      surprisingly
      calm
      i
      was
      stationed
      at
      the
      bases
      machine
      gun.
      I
      always
      felt
      safer
      when
      i
      was
      on
      the
      machine
      gun,
      it
      calmed
      me
      down
      since
      everything
      i
      heard
      in
      night
      were
      screeches
      of
      something,
      i
      didn't
      want
      to
      find
      out
      what
      it
      was.
      My
      daydreaming
      was
      interrupted
      by
      a
      door
      being
      slammed
      opened,
      i
      turned
      around
      and
      there
      was
      Major
      Khaletskiy,
      drunk
      as
      usual,
      i
      looked
      at
      him
      in
      disgust
      and
      he
      looked
      at
      me
      and
      mumbled
      something,
      i
      ignored
      him
      and
      turned
      back
      on
      my
      post
      not
      thinking
      much
      about
      it.
      As
      i
      was
      about
      to
      go
      back
      to
      my
      daydreaming
      i
      felt
      something
      grab
      my
      neck
      tightly
      as
      i
      was
      thrown
      at
      the
      ground,
      my
      heart
      skipped
      a
      beat
      as
      i
      thought
      a
      mutant
      was
      about
      to
      break
      it.
      I
      was
      dragged
      for
      a
      while
      before
      the
      hand
      on
      my
      neck
      loosened,
      i
      turned
      on
      my
      back
      as
      i
      looked
      up
      it
      was
      major
       #8220;bring
      me
      vodka
      you
      filthy
      animal,
      that
      will
      teach
      you
      not
      to
      look
      at
      me
      that
      way!
      And
      don't
      think
      of
      returning
      without
      my
      booze! #8221;
      He
      yelled
      as
      he
      proceeded
      to
      puke
      next
      to
      me
      and
      return
      to
      the
      base.
      I
      got
      up
      and
      as
      i
      was
      about
      to
      take
      a
      step
      forward
      Khaletskiy
      pointed
      his
      gun
      at
      me,
      i
      understood
      the
      message,
      i
      turned
      and
      started
      to
      follow
      the
      road
      as
      in
      the
      distance
      i
      heard
      howling.
      I
      hope
      whoever
      finds
      this
      PDA
      will
      find
      my
      body
      recognizable
      enough
      if
      i
      don't
      survive
      this
      night.

      Anyway
      since
      i
      knew
      myself
      i
      hate
      everything
      about
      me
      and
      when
      i
      say
      everything
      i
      mean
      everything
      from
      the
      way
      i
      breathe
      to
      the
      way
      i
      walk
      it
      seems
      everything
      is
      wrong
      with
      me
      one
      way
      or
      another
      and
      it's
      hard
      since
      im
      always
      wanting
      to
      self-harm,
      i
      haven't
      done
      it
      in
      two
      weeks
      but
      it's
      harder
      by
      the
      day
      not
      to
      do
      it
      again,
      and
      the
      problem
      is
      because
      I'll
      do
      it
      anytime
      i
      can
      and
      i
      don't
      know
      how
      to
      stop,
      my
      friend
      gave
      me
      a
      advice
      to
      use
      a
      rubber
      band
      whenever
      i
      want
      to
      self
      harm,
      but
      im
      not
      sure
      if
      it'll
      work
      so
      i
      wanna
      know
      if
      there
      are
      any
      other
      methods
      to
      stop
      self
      harming
      just
      for
      a
      while
      until
      i
      can
      fix
      my
      mental
      issues

      I
      just

      about
      loli
      hentai
      and
      now
      every

      i
      think
      of
      that
      it
      calms
      me
      ignore
      the
      fact
      i
      didn't
      watch
      that
      in

      anytime
      i
      have

      i
      just

      So
      basically
      when
      i
      was
      12
      we
      didn't
      have
      Internet
      at
      home
      for
      about
      a
      month
      idk
      why
      and
      i
      can't
      remember
      it,
      anyway
      i
      was
      horny
      as
      shit
      as
      usual
      and
      there
      was
      this
      cafe
      near
      our
      school
      that
      had
      free
      WiFi
      and
      so
      every
      lunch
      break
      I'd
      sneak
      in
      to
      the
      toilets
      and
      just
      do
      it,
      i
      did
      this
      for
      an
      entire
      month
      except
      for
      the
      weekends
      because
      i
      was
      a
      anti-social
      freak

      So
      I've
      been
      hurting
      myself
      for
      a
      long
      time
      a
      couple
      of
      years
      now
      and
      I've
      been
      trying
      hard
      for
      these
      last
      couple
      of
      months
      to
      stop
      that
      but
      anytime
      i
      last
      a
      few
      months
      one
      day
      everything
      simply
      collapses
      sorta
      say
      and
      i
      just
      have
      to
      do
      it
      and
      i
      don't
      know
      why,
      i
      have
      this
      feeling
      that
      i
      deserve
      that
      even
      though
      i
      know
      for
      a
      fact
      that
      i
      didn't
      do
      anything
      wrong
      to
      anyone
      but
      i
      feel
      so
      bad
      that
      i
      have
      to
      do
      something
      to
      myself.
      And
      i
      wanted
      to
      ask
      are
      there
      any
      methods
      to
      replace
      it?
      Like
      I've
      heard
      of
      pulling
      a
      rubber
      band
      on
      my
      writs
      but
      that
      doesn't
      really
      help
      me
