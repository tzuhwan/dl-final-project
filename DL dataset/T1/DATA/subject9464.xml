      love
      lurking
      into
      the

      that
      when
      Einstein
      died,
      they
      preserved
      and
      chopped
      up
      his
      brain
      to
      study
      it,
      to
      see
      what
      made
      him
      such
      a
      genius.
      Turns
      out,
      his
      brain
      was
      just
      normal,
      but
      parts
      of
      it
      were
      donated

      The
      first
      time
      I
      saw
      graphics
      like
      this
      I
      shat

      Then
      I
      played
      the
      game
      and
      I
      shat
      my
      life
      because
      of
      how
      good
      the
      story
      was.

      It
      WAS
      RDM.
      Both
      times,
      in
      fact.
      What
      you
      did
      in
      the
      first
      part
      was
      killing
      off
      of
      suspicion,
      since
      he
      never
      called
      a
      false
      KOS
      on
      you
      just
      yet
      (although
      he
      was
      stupid
      for
      trying
      to
      pull
      that
      off),
      and
      on
      the
      second
      time
      you
      killed
      your
      T
      buddy.
      I
      mean...
      you
      just
      killed
      a
      teammate.
      On
      the
      server
      I
      play
      on,
      that's
      a
      Day
      ban
      unless
      they
      forgive
      you.
      A
      correct
      way
      to
      do
      it
      is
      to
      just
      shoot
      at
      their
      feet.

      I
      was
      about
      to
      write
      out
      an
      entire
      novel
      on
      just
      the
      part
      he
      said
      about
      maps,
      but
      then
      I
      just
      stopped.
      I
      thought
      about
      it
      for
      a
      second,
      and
      realized
      that,
      in
      a
      view
      about
      maps,
      players
      of
      Call
      of
      Duty
      are
      really
      split
      in
      three,
      which
      will
      now
      be
      revealed
      below.
      First,
      you
      got
      the
      run
      and
      gunners:
      You
      all
      know
      these
      people.
      Lightweight
      on
      almost
      every
      class;
      extreme
      conditioning
      and
      dexterity;
      fast
      hands
      and
      toughness
      etc
      etc.
      Woodsy
      gave
      a
      very
      accurate
      of
      one's
      thoughts
      on
      large
      maps
      if
      they
      like
      run
      and
      gunning:
      "Oh
      my
      dear
      God,
      when
      am
      I
      going
      to
      find
      someone
      to
      shoot?"
      From
      what
      I've
      seen,
      people
      that
      prefer
      running
      and
      shooting
      /
      spraying
      and
      preying
      (not
      praying)
      make
      up
      the
      large
      majority
      of
      players
      in
      this
      game,
      voting
      for
      every
      small
      map
      they
      see
      (e.g.
      Nuketown
      2025)
      Next,
      you
      got
      the
      long
      shots.
      I
      don't
      see
      people
      like
      this
      very
      often,
      but
      long
      shots
      (campers,
      headglitchers,
      whatever
      you
      want
      to
      call
      them)
      hang
      in
      a
      house,
      tree,
      corner,
      grassy
      areas,
      or
      just
      plain
      back
      of
      a
      choke
      point
      and
      shoot
      every
      single
      man
      they
      see.
      Black
      Ops
      2
      seemed
      to
      strengthen
      this
      minority
      with
      Target
      Finders
      and
      found
      a
      way
      to
      counter
      it
      with
      the
      MMS
      attachment,
      but
      I
      still
      find
      it
      very
      common
      to
      see
      someone
      use
      a
      sniper
      rifle
      over
      an
      automatic
      weapon
      (even
      though
      I
      count
      the
      SVU-AS
      as
      an
      automatic
      weapon
      because
      of
      how
      some
      people
      use
      it).
      Quick
      Scoping
      players
      are
      VERY
      strong,
      however
      it's
      glorious
      to
      me
      to
      find
      someone
      going,
      simply
      put,
      "old
      schooler"
      sniping.

      an
      example.
      There's
      a
      large
      open
      choke
      point
      in
      the
      middle,
      and
      two
      buildings
      with
      a
      perfect
      view
      of
      everyone's
      heads.
      These
      snipers
      will
      pull
      out
      their
      secondaries
      and
      fight
      over
      those
      houses
      and
      end
      up
      dominating
      the
      choking
      space.
      There
      are
      also
      people
      like
      me,
      dubbed
      "Mobile
      Snipers,"
      who
      lay
      down
      on
      a
      grassy
      knoll,
      kill
      about
      two
      people,
      and
      move
      on
      to
      the
      next
      grassy
      knoll.
      You
      see,
      these
      people
      love
      large
      and
      open
      maps
      because
      they
      bring
      fresh
      kill
      aplenty,
      and
      tend
      to
      hate
      people
      that
      find
      out
      their
      hiding
      spot
      and
      constantly
      kill
      them
      each
      life
      over,
      and
      over,
      and
      over.
      Finally,
      you
      have
      the
      people
      that
      prefer
      both.
      I
      fit
      in
      this
      group,
      because
      I
      have
      half
      long
      range
      classes
      and
      half
      running
      and
      gunning
      classes
      that
      I
      find
      incredibly
      entertaining
      to
      use.
      I
      think
      this
      group
      is
      definitely
      the
      minority
      in
      the
      Black
      Ops
      II
      player
      space,
      and
      probably
      got
      the
      accolade,
      "Evolver"
      the
      most
      in
      Modern
      Warfare
      3.
      What
      I
      end
      up
      doing
      early
      in
      a
      round
      on
      a
      big
      map
      like
      Turbine
      is
      pick
      two
      classes
      that
      would
      fit
      it.
      One
      to
      rush
      to
      a
      point
      on
      the
      back
      of
      the
      map,
      and
      then
      one
      to
      protect
      the
      point,
      or
      pointS
      if
      we're
      dominating.
      I've
      found
      people
      like
      this
      tend
      to
      enjoy
      objective-based
      game
      modes
      and
      will
      still
      lean
      one
      way
      or
      another
      in
      respect
      of
      the
      last
      two.
      I,
      myself,
      have
      realized
      that
      all
      of
      my
      classes
      tend
      to
      be
      ranged
      (not
      to
      mention
      I
      hate
      using
      shotguns,
      'cept
      for
      the
      KSG.)
      Edit:
      The
      middle
      paragraph
      /
      subject
      was
      a
      giant
      wall
      of
      text,
      fixed
      it
      so
      that
      it's
      easier
      on
      the
      eyes.

      I
      think
      the
      main
      thing
      is
      that
      you're
      thinking
      about
      it
      too
      much.
      Sometimes,
      when
      you
      cloud
      your
      head
      with
      an
      objective
      and
      try
      to
      do
      something
      else
      like,
      say,
      defending
      a
      bomb
      point,
      you
      end
      up
      choking
      and
      dying
      more
      often.
      If
      you
      often
      catch
      yourself
      thinking
      or
      saying
      to
      yourself,
      "Oh
      my
      God,
      one
      more
      kill
      and
      I
      get
      that
      Bloodthirsty!"
      then
      you're
      thinking
      about
      your
      own
      objective
      too
      much.
      Before
      playing
      a
      game,
      take
      a
      deep
      breath
      to
      clear
      your
      mind.
      Say
      to
      yourself,
      "I'm
      going
      to
      complete
      this
      game
      of
      _______
      and
      win,"
      and
      there's
      a
      bigger
      chance
      that
      you'll
      get
      your
      Bloodthirsties
      faster
      since
      you
      aren't
      overthinking
      your
      strategies.

      Preferably
      over
      a
      mic,
      so
      that
      it
      feels
      more
      real.
      I,
      personally,
      pull
      the
      overly
      stupid
      Bane
      card
      on
      my
      main
      server;
      it
      allows
      the
      innocents
      to
      camp,
      however
      not
      the
      Detectives
      or
      T's.
      Most
      often
      I
      scare
      the
      Traitors
      off
      with
      mass
      amounts
      of
      testosterone-filled
      manliness
      (i.e.
      fleeing
      like
      a
      pussy
      into
      the
      captain's
      quarters
      on
      roy_the_ship)
      and
      they
      plant
      C4
      near
      me
      to
      get
      me
      out.
      It's
      then
      I
      break
      out
      my
      cup
      specialized
      for
      Bane
      and
      just
      say,
      "Oh,
      you
      think
      C4
      is
      your
      ally.
      I
      was
      born
      in
      it,
      molded
      by
      it.
      I
      never
      saw
      the
      explosion
      until
      I
      was
      already
      a
      man,
      and
      by
      thing
      it
      was
      BLINDING!"
      Once
      the
      final
      note
      in,
      "BLINDING!"
      was
      out,
      I'd
      rush
      out
      of
      the
      room
      and
      continue
      to
      charge
      every
      living
      thing
      that
      comes
      in
      my
      path
      with
      a
      Shotgun
      or
      an
      M16.

      I
      disliked
      the
      SF
      Missions

      in
      a
      first
      person

      campaign.
      It
      seemed

      Black

      II
      tried
      to

      filled

      semi-optional

      him.

      I

      reading
      a
      short
      story
      a
      couple
      months
      ago
      with
      a
      twist
      ending.
      It
      started
      with
      a
      woman
      being
      glad
      that
      her
      ex-boyfriend
      or
      divorced
      husband
      was
      finally
      moving
      out
      of
      her
      apartment,
      but
      he
      wanted
      the
      baby.
      The
      baby
      was
      then
      fought
      over,
      almost
      burnt
      by
      a
      stove,
      cut
      by
      a
      knife,
      and
      was
      finally
      accidentally
      tossed
      out
      the
      window.

      I

      "cheating"
      when

      comes
      to

      It's
      all

      the

      I've
      recently
      started
      getting
      the
      Fatal
      Error
      that
      modders
      usually
      get
      once
      their
      stuff
      gets
      out
      of
      date.
      I
      knew
      this,
      so
      I
      uninstalled
      every
      single
      one
      of
      my
      mods,
      including
      the
      PD2Hook
      and
      IPAHPL
      (Typing
      that
      from
      memory,
      sorry
      if
      I
      got
      it
      wrong),
      yet
      I
      still
      got
      the
      error.
      After
      verifying
      the
      cache
      and
      reinstalling
      the
      entire
      thing,
      I
      still
      get
      this
      fatal
      error.
      Anyone
      know
      why?

      Honestly,
      I
      think
      that
      it's
      because
      there
      was
      a
      long
      time
      where
      Steam
      Train
      was
      just
      Ross
      and
      Arin
      instead
      of
      Ross
      and
      Danny.
      I
      still
      think
      Arin
      and
      Ross
      are
      really
      funny
      together,
      though.

      I
      thought
      that
      the
      historical
      pack
      was
      worth
      it,
      but
      the
      Diamond
      Heist
      and
      Clover
      Pack
      I'm
      very
      conflicted
      on.
      If
      you
      get
      both
      at
      the
      same
      time
      when
      it's
      not
      on
      sale,
      you're
      pretty
      much
      just
      spending
      $4.99
      on
      an
      okay-ish
      perk
      deck
      and
      a
      great
      new
      character,
      and
      $6.99
      on
      the
      rest.
      I
      wouldn't
      buy
      the
      actual
      Heist,
      but
      the
      Pack
      instead.

      An
      old
      pirate
      or
      a

      an

      and
      I
      toss

      power
      idea
      being
      a
      harpoon
      (preferably
      hand-thrown).
      There's
      a
      bunch
      of
      different
      ways
      a
      harpoon
      ability
      could
      work.
      The
      two
      ideas
      I
      like
      the
      most
      are
      1.
      Move
      slower
      for
      a
      few
      seconds
      as
      you
      aim
      and
      charge
      the
      harpoon,
      then
      throw
      it
      at
      a
      survivor.
      If
      it
      hits
      the
      target,
      then
      you
      yank
      it
      back
      a
      few
      meters,
      dragging
      the
      survivor
      with
      it.
      or
      2.
      Having
      it
      so
      the
      Harpoon
      has
      a
      short
      range
      but
      can
      injure
      survivors.
      If
      you
      hit
      an
      injured
      survivor
      with
      it,
      then
      they're
      put
      into
      the
      A-D
      wiggle
      state
      as
      you
      drag
      them
      back
      onto
      your
      shoulder
      for
      later
      hook
      placement
      (Wiggle
      progress
      carrying
      over
      once
      the
      dragging's
      done).
      'Course
      these
      are
      just
      rough
      ideas
      and
      probably
      wouldn't
      translate
      well
      into
      the
      game,
      it's
      just
      nice
      to
      think
      about
      some
      terrifying
      music
      playing
      as
      you
      watch
      yourself
      get
      pulled
      back
      by
      an
      old
      moldy
      rope
      before
      being
      put
      onto
      an
      old
      rusty
      hook.

      I
      found
      in
      in
      a

      that
      if

      Unnerving
      Presence,
      even
      if
      you

      The
      left
      is
      much
      more
      rigid
      than
      the
      right,
      and
      for
      good
      reason;the
      guy's
      trying
      to
      kick
      through
      a
      wooden
      pallet
      and
      turn
      it
      into
      sawdust.
      The
      animation
      on
      the
      right
      just
      looks
      like
      he's
      giving
      the
      pallet
      a
      footjob
      and
      it
      explodes
      prematurely.
      On
      top
      of
      that,
      your
      leg
      protrudes
      from
      your
      groin
      DOOM-style
      on
      the
      right,
      but
      more
      to
      the
      side
      like
      you'd
      expect
      on
      the
      left
      (although
      if
      you
      were
      to
      try
      that
      exact
      angle
      in
      real

      you

      pull
      something
      you're
      not
      supposed
      to
      pull).
      You
      can
      also
      see
      your
      hands
      in
      the
      old
      one,
      which
      is
      a
      small
      but
      nice
      detail
      to
      have.

      I
      dropped
      out
      of
      college
      in
      April
      and
      I
      still
      don't
      have
      a
      job.
      Every
      time
      I
      plan
      out
      the
      day
      to
      try
      and
      ease
      myself
      into
      pushing
      in
      an
      application
      or
      when
      I
      get
      ready
      to
      leave
      I
      just
      shut
      down.
      The
      farthest
      I've
      ever
      gotten
      was
      halfway
      through
      getting
      dressed
      but
      ended
      up
      psyching
      myself
      out,
      crawled
      into
      bed
      and
      didn't
      get
      out
      for
      the
      rest
      of
      the
      day.
      I
      don't
      even
      know
      what
      I'm
      worried
      about,
      but
      my
      brain
      still
      gets
      put
      out
      like
      a
      wet
      candle
      when
      I
      start
      thinking
      about
      going
      to
      these
      things.
      Are
      there
      any
      exercises
      out
      there
      I
      can
      do
      to
      maybe
      calm
      me
      down
      when
      I
      feel
      like
      this?
      I
      want
      to
      stop
      being
      a
      burden
      to
      my
      family
      so
      badly.

      Hey,
      I'm
      19M
      and
      I've
      been
      dealing
      with
      my
      anxiety
      for
      the
      last
      couple
      years.
      It's
      flared
      up
      badly
      before
      but
      not
      as
      badly
      as
      this
      past
      week.
      My
      mom
      and
      I
      have
      three
      dogs;
      a
      Dane
      and
      two
      labs.
      One
      of
      the
      labs
      started
      bleeding
      from
      his
      mouth
      and
      we
      took
      him
      to
      the
      vet,
      who
      told
      her
      immediately
      that
      there
      was
      a
      big
      tumor
      in
      his
      gums
      that
      started
      to
      bleed.
      It
      grew
      very
      fast,
      it
      wasn't
      there
      when
      he
      went
      to
      the
      vet
      last
      month-ish,
      so
      the
      vet
      said
      it
      was
      likely
      to
      be
      cancer.
      Two
      days
      ago
      they
      just
      cut
      out
      the
      tumor,
      and
      they're
      doing
      a
      biopsy
      right
      now.
      We
      won't
      get
      the
      results
      back
      until
      they
      call
      us
      next
      week,
      which
      is
      right
      in
      the
      middle
      of
      a
      vacation
      we're
      going
      to
      take
      to
      visit
      our
      family.
      I
      don't
      know
      if
      I'm
      going
      to
      be
      able
      to
      relax
      at
      all
      until
      the
      results
      get
      back,
      and
      if
      the
      results
      come
      back
      with
      bad
      news
      I'm
      going
      to
      be
      very
      distressed.
      I
      love
      this
      dog,
      he's
      only
      4
      years
      old
      and
      he's
      done
      so
      much
      for
      me.
      He
      spent
      almost
      the
      entirety
      of
      every
      day
      comforting
      me
      in
      my
      bed
      after
      I
      got
      in
      a
      car
      crash,
      he's
      the
      first
      thing
      to
      try
      and
      cuddle
      with
      you
      if
      he
      sees
      you're
      sad.
      Every
      time
      I
      get
      reminded
      about
      his
      situation
      I
      stress
      out,
      get
      flustered,
      and
      start
      breathing
      heavily.
      I
      know
      I
      can't
      fight
      the
      inevitable.
      I
      just
      want
      to
      know
      if
      there's
      anything
      I
      can
      do
      to
      help
      cope
      with
      it.

      Thank
      you
      for
      your
      kind
      words,
      it
      really
      means
      a
      lot.
      I
      talked
      to
      my
      boyfriend
      about
      it
      a
      little
      bit
      and
      it
      helped
      me
      calm
      down
      a
      little
      more
      than
      how
      on-edge
      I
      was
      writing
      this
      post.
      The
      vacation
      we're
      taking
      is
      to
      New
      England,
      halfway
      across
      the
      country.
      My
      mom
      and
      I
      talked
      it
      over
      and
      said
      if
      the
      news
      coming
      back
      was
      bad
      we
      would
      consider
      going
      back
      home
      to
      get
      him
      treatment
      asap.
      I
      can't
      remember
      everything
      the
      vet
      was
      saying
      but
      one
      of
      the
      treatments
      was
      basically
      taking
      out
      a
      chunk
      of
      his
      face
      where
      the
      cancer
      was,
      leaving
      him
      a
      bit
      of
      a
      dent
      on
      his
      snoot
      but
      with
      a
      chance
      of
      avoiding
      doomsday
      for
      at
      least
      few
      more
      years.
      Reading
      around
      said
      dogs
      responded
      pretty
      well
      to
      that
      treatment,
      which
      makes
      me
      feel
      a
      lot
      better,
      too.
      I
      just
      can't
      not
      think
      of
      the
      worst
      happening.
      Him
      having
      cancer,
      the
      treatment
      not
      working,
      leaving
      him
      deformed
      and
      progressively
      more
      sick
      until
      we
      decide
      it's
      best
      to
      put
      him
      down.
      There's
      no
      way
      we
      could
      afford
      something
      like
      chemo.
      Thank
      you
      again
      for
      your
      well-wishes.

       gt;I
      feel
      like
      the
      suggested
      change
      is
      awful
      for
      one
      core
      reason:
      it
      requires
      Survivors
      to
      take
      Self-Care
      or
      a
      Medkit
      I
      think
      you
      are
      misunderstanding
      the
      suggestion.
      There
      are
      four
      (4)
      survivors
      in
      each
      game,
      who
      can
      **heal
      each
      other.**
      It'd
      be
      no
      more
      required
      to
      bring
      Self
      Care
      or
      a
      medkit
      than
      it
      would
      be
      against
      any
      other
      killer.

      I
      don't
      have
      insurance
      and
      I
      work
      part-time,
      so
      I
      can't
      exactly
      afford
      the
      greatest
      therapy.
      I
      went
      to
      a
      few
      sessions
      for
      my
      anxiety
      at
      a
      local
      university
      that
      offered
      counselling
      for
      $10
      a
      session,
      but
      honestly
      the
      pressure
      I
      felt
      of
      adding
      another
      thing
      to
      my
      weekly
      schedule
      pushed
      me
      to
      stop
      them
      after
      about
      four
      of
      them.
      One
      thing
      that
      stuck
      with
      me
      though
      was
      when
      my
      therapist
      tried
      getting
      me
      to
      help
      him
      understand
      what
      I'm
      thinking
      when
      I
      start
      to
      panic
      in
      public
      but
      I
      just
      can't
      ever
      seem
      to
      put
      it
      into
      words.
      They're
      not,
      like,
      *conscious*
      thoughts,
      it
      feels
      like
      it
      all
      happens
      at
      once
      and
      it's
      not
      like
      I
      can
      just
      pick
      out
      sentences
      that
      I'm
      thinking
      to
      myself
      *because
      they're
      not
      there.*
      Surely
      I'm

      I
      love
      the
      way
      the
      Warden
      is
      looking
      at
      you.
      "You

      you
      wanna
      do
      this,
      dude?"

      The
      best
      part
      about
      this
      is
      the
      frame
      the
      video
      ends
      on
      makes
      Tiandi
      stick
      a
      sick
      Jojo-esque
      pose.

      If
      you
      feel
      like
      you'll
      be
      comfortable
      showing
      them
      or
      are
      prepared
      to
      be
      asked
      questions
      about
      them,
      then
      show
      them.
      If
      you
      can,
      I'd
      recommend
      getting
      a
      pair
      of
      arm
      sleeves
      /
      runner's
      sleeves
      so
      you
      can
      still
      wear
      your
      favorite
      t-shirts
      on
      those
      days
      when
      you
      really
      don't
      want
      to
      deal
      with
      them
      showing.
