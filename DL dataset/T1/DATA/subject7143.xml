      My
      first
      serious
      girlfriend
      idolised
      Anthony
      Bourdain.
      She
      read
      her
      uncle #8217;s
      copy
      of
      Kitchen
      Confidential
      when
      she
      quit
      college
      to
      become
      an
      apprentice
      chef.
      She
      took
      up
      a
      job
      at
      the
      restaurant
      where
      her
      uncle
      worked,
      in
      Tasmania's
      far
      south.
      By
      the
      end
      of
      the
      girlfriend #8217;s
      first
      apprenticeship
      year
      it
      was
      clear
      she #8217;d
      inherited
      her
      uncle #8217;s
      habit
      for
      charring
      rich
      cigarettes
      between
      hectic
      services
      of
      set
      six-course
      meals,
      enjoying
      long
      staff
      lunches
      and
      indulging
      in
      countless
      knock-off
      beers
      despite
      the
      foreseeable
      consequences.
      I
      was
      18
      when
      my
      girlfriend
      got
      me
      interested
      in
      Anthony
      Bourdain;
      she
      had
      been
      a
      vegetarian
      as
      a
      kid,
      but
      had
      since
      converted
      to
      a
      nose-to-tail
      style
      diet
      -
      much
      like
      her
      kitchen
      superiors.
      It
      seemed
      my
      girlfriend
      admired
      Bourdain #8217;s
      rockstar
      approach
      to
      cooking
      and
      eating.
      I
      think
      she
      liked
      that
      he
      normalised
      smoking
      at
      the
      table,
      swearing,
      sweating
      and
      binge-eating.
      There
      was
      also
      a
      quirky,
      Spike
      Jonze
      flavour
      about
      scenes
      in
      Bourdain #8217;s
      television
      shows
      where
      he
      would
      glug
      snake-blood
      or
      bite
      into
      the
      cheek
      of
      a
      half-boiled
      hog.
      Like
      Bourdain,
      my
      girlfriend
      steered
      away
      from
      more
      conventional
      dishes,
      like
      Meat
      and
      Three
      Veg,
      and
      instead
      opted
      to
      incorporate
      flavours
      including
      pig #8217;s
      trotter,
      various
      types
      of
      offal
      and
      rich
      bone
      stock.
      My
      girlfriend
      would
      pucker
      her
      lips
      at
      the
      chance
      to
      eat
      a
      hot
      chilli,
      and
      her
      willingness
      to
      bite
      into
      the
      unknown
      reminded
      me
      of
      Bourdain's
      recollection
      of
      tasting
      an
      oyster
      for
      the
      first
      time.
      In
      Kitchen
      Confidential
      Bourdain
      claims
      his
      inaugural
      Oyster
      experience
      was
      likely
      the
      catalyst
      for
      his
      passion
      of
      odd
      food
      textures,
      weird
      sources
      of
      protein
      and
      the
      addictive
      theatre
      of
      eating
      something
      that
      feels
      alive
      in
      his
      stomach.
      I
      would
      argue
      the
      oyster
      symbolises
      Bourdain #8217;s
      compulsion
      to
      fetishise
      and
      exploit
      food
      for
      its
      culture
      and
      notoriety.
      It's
      not
      that
      he
      doesn't
      value
      food,
      or
      appreciate
      flavours,
      but
      I
      wonder
      how
      much
      of
      what
      he
      ate
      he
      actually
      enjoyed.
      After
      binge-watching
      Bourdain #8217;s
      television
      programs
      it #8217;s
      become
      slightly
      triggering
      to
      recall
      scenes
      where
      his
      image
      and
      reputation
      leave
      him
      red-faced
      and
      hiding
      Portuguese
      delicacies
      in
      a
      napkin
      under
      the
      table,
      or
      watching
      a
      goat
      get
      slaughtered.
      There
      have
      been
      times
      where
      my
      girlfriend
      has
      taken
      the
      same
      overly-ambitious
      approach
      to
      off-centre
      culinary
      experiences,
      and
      suffered
      the
      digestinal
      ramifications.
      Although
      sometimes
      Bourdain
      was
      rude
      (particularly
      towards
      vegans),
      I
      know
      now
      that
      he
      was
      his
      own
      harshest
      critic.
      I #8217;ll
      kinda
      miss
      his
      sleazy,
      chicken
      grease
      smile
      and
      maudlin
      travel
      reviews.
      I
      had
      hoped
      one
      day
      I
      would
      meet
      Bourdain
      and
      we #8217;d
      make
      witty
      banter
      about
      my
      recent
      conversion
      to
      veganism,
      and
      the
      occasional
      cock.
      It
      seems,
      however,
      that
      he
      will
      never
      meet
      the
      two
      lesbians
      who
      would
      have
      cooked
      him
      dinner
      and
      let
      him
      fuck
      them.

      I'm
      a
      lesbian
      and
      I
      just
      posted
      a
      v
      relevant
      fanfic,
      for
      your
      reference.
      I
      feel
      like
      Tony's
      wisdom
      could
      be
      subconsciously
      interpreted
      as
      paternal
      stoicism.
      Maybe
      that
      has
      something
      to
      do
      with
      the
      attraction??
      I
      know
      he
      complained
      a
      lot
      but
      he
      was
      a
      resilient,
      straight-shooter
      with
      a
      clear
      ability
      to
      empathise.

      Maudlin
      but
      not
      necessarily
      morose...
      an
      ember
      can
      reignite
      but
      a
      flame
      is
      fleeting.
      I

      it
      A+,
      five
      stars,
      10/10!!

      Has
      anyone
      else
      stopped
      cooking
      because
      of
      crying?
      Television
      programs
      focussed
      on
      cooking
      tend
      to
      have
      a
      cathartic,
      comforting
      affect
      on
      the
      viewer.
      Ironically,
      I
      first
      binge-watched
      Bourdain's
      programs
      after
      I
      suffered
      a
      death
      in
      the
      family.
      Now
      that
      Bourdain's
      passed
      away
      I
      can't
      bring
      myself
      to
      watch
      his
      shows
      because
      it's
      too
      triggering.
      I
      worry
      that
      this
      connection
      between
      cooking
      and
      grief
      will
      bury
      my
      enthusiasm
      for
      eating.
      I
      haven't
      been
      able
      to
      cook
      a
      proper
      meal
      the
      last
      few
      months...just
      being
      in
      the
      kitchen
      emotionally
      drains
      me.
      Pls
      help.
      I'm
      getting
      kinda
      hungry.

      I
      like
      how
      the
      poem
      is
      super
      dark
      but
      has
      cute
      couplets.
      Do
      you
      keep
      a
      journal?
      I
      feel
      like
      you
      could
      go
      a
      lot
      deeper
      if
      you
      wanted
      to.
      Practicing

      is
      a
      good
      way

      Poetic
      journalling!
      It's
      a
      thing!
      [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetic\_journal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetic_journal)
      Also,
      I
      like
      the
      lines
      about
      how
      you
      wear
      colours
      but
      feel
      dull
      inside.
      I
      deliberately
      wear
      pink
      to
      spite
      my
      cynical
      character
      and
      progressive
      views
      on
      gender
      conformity.
      It's
      amazing
      how
      many
      people
      will
      tell
      me
      I'm
      looking
      well,
      just
      because
      I'm
      in
      bright
      clothes.

      Wow,

      so
      much
      for

      weird.
      I
      don't
      know
      what
      I
      was
      going
      for
      there
      but
      it's
      just
      what
      came
      out.
      As
      long
      as
      there's
      some
      hint
      at
      rhythm
      and
      meter
      in
      what
      I
      write
      I'll
      pop
      it
      in
      the
      poetry
      basket.
      I
      hope
      all
      those
      terms
      are
      still
      common
      vernacular!
      Where
      I
      live,
      in
      Tasmania's
      far
      south,
      there's
      been
      a
      reemergence
      of
      crust
      punk
      culture.
      It
      got
      me
      thinking
      about
      other
      forgotten
      youth
      subcultures.

      I
      think
      you
      got
      it!
      When
      I
      was
      writing
      it
      I
      was
      imagining
      myself
      walking
      through
      a
      high
      school
      cafeteria.
      As
      someone
      who
      feels
      like
      an
      outsider
      I
      take
      note
      of
      the
      groups
      I
      don't
      feel
      like
      I
      don't
      belong
      to.
      The
      lack
      of
      depth
      in
      the
      piece
      reflects
      the
      superficiality
      of
      social
      categorisation.
      Thanks
      for
      your
      feedback!

      In
      Tasmania,
      where
      I
      live,
      abortions
      are
      highly
      inaccessible
      and
      the
      facilities
      do
      not
      exist
      to
      undergo
      gender
      reassignment
      surgery.
      It
      would
      be
      amazing
      if
      either
      of
      these
      issues
      could
      be
      addressed
      by
      our
      government.
      I
      do
      not
      think
      one
      should
      have
      preference
      over
      the
      other,
      but
      only
      one
      policy
      can
      be
      passed
      at
      a
      time.
      I'm
      not
      sure
      where
      you
      live
      but
      it
      sounds
      like
      things
      are
      progressing
      towards
      a
      more
      equitable
      society.
      The
      Tasmanian
      health
      minister
      recently
      leaked
      a
      female
      ceo's
      records
      to
      expose
      them
      for
      having
      a
      pregnancy
      termination.
      Life's
      gr8
      here...

      I
      don't
      agree
      with
      half
      that
      statement
      but
      you've
      just
      indicated
      that
      the
      two
      issues
      are
      quite
      different.
      Services
      for
      one
      should
      not
      come
      at
      the
      expense
      of
      the
      other.
      I
      think
      it's
      just
      a
      matter
      of
      the
      first
      serious,
      long-term
      studies
      into
      the
      medicine
      and
      psychology
      of
      gender
      dysmorphia/
      gender
      reassignment
      are
      beginning
      to
      emerge
      and
      be
      taken
      seriously.
      Governments
      are
      responding
      to
      that.
      It's
      sorta
      comparable
      to
      a
      'wave'
      of
      feminism.
      Unfortunately,
      the
      rise
      of
      the
      political
      right
      (in
      Australia
      and
      the
      U.S,
      at
      least)
      continues
      to
      make
      it
      incredibly
      difficult
      for
      any
      issue
      regarding
      the
      rights
      of
      a
      minority
      group
      to
      progress.
      Things
      are
      still
      pretty
      lousy
      all
      'round.

      Haha,
      yeah,
      our
      politics
      are
      a
      bit
      of
      a
      joke.
      Tasmania
      is
      an
      island.
      Population:
      500,000.
      Our
      Health
      Minister
      is
      a
      cis-male
      hetero
      jerk
      who
      cheats
      on
      his
      wife
      then
      goes
      to
      church
      on
      a
      Sunday.
      Basically,
      the
      only
      place
      offering
      (relatively)
      affordable
      surgical
      terminations
      was
      closed
      down
      last
      year.
      It's
      meant
      some
      girls
      have
      had
      to
      fly
      to
      mainland
      Australia
      for
      the
      operation,
      and
      that
      comes
      at
      a
      huge
      cost
      (emotionally,
      physically
      and
      professionally).
      If
      you
      go
      through
      the
      public
      service
      chances
      are
      the
      doctor
      will
      come
      up
      with
      some
      ridiculous
      reason
      why
      you
      can't
      have
      the
      procedure.
      The
      only
      other
      option
      is
      to
      convince
      a
      gyno
      to
      do
      it
      but
      that
      costs
      SO
      MUCH
      money.
      The
      area
      where
      I
      live
      (Burnie)
      is
      super
      isolated,
      has
      a
      huge
      drug
      problem
      and
      more
      than
      7
      babies
      are
      born
      each
      week,
      despite
      the
      population
      being
      tiny
      (20,000).
      Often,
      the
      children
      in
      primary
      school
      will
      have
      better
      literacy
      skills
      than
      their
      parents.
      For
      trans
      folk
      in
      this
      community
      there
      is
      (I
      think)
      one
      support
      service
      that
      can
      put
      people
      in
      touch
      with
      open-minded
      medical
      professionals.
      At
      the
      moment
      the
      Greens
      political
      party
      is
      calling
      on
      the
      state
      government
      to
      allow
      people
      to
      alter
      their
      gender
      on
      their
      birth
      certificate
      without
      having
      to
      undergo
      full
      gender
      reassignment
      surgery
      first.
      If
      someone
      is
      interested
      in
      pursuing
      gender
      reassignment
      surgery
      there
      are
      people
      in
      the
      Tasmanian
      Health
      System
      who
      will
      help,
      but
      the
      process
      will
      ultimately
      involve
      many
      trips
      to
      see
      specialists
      on
      the
      mainland.
      Also,
      if
      you
      happen
      to
      be
      in
      a
      heterosexual
      marriage
      then
      you
      will
      have
      to
      get
      divorced
      before
      you
      can
      legally
      change
      your
      gender.
      This
      is
      despite
      same
      sex
      marriage
      being
      legal
      and
      the
      state
      government
      has
      been
      ordered
      to
      change
      that
      legislation.
      They
      have
      literally
      said
      they
      do
      not
      consider
      it
      a
      priority.
      ANYWAY,
      here's
      a
      link
      to
      a
      song
      by
      a
      Tasmanian
      band
      that
      actually
      happens
      to
      be
      about
      getting
      an
      abortion.
      It's
      called
      Urine
      Trouble.
      Get
      ittt??

      Should
      I
      get
      thanked/rewarded
      for
      house-sitting
      and
      looking
      after
      two
      dogs
      for
      two
      weeks?
      I
      fed

      raw
      chicken
      carcasses
      every

      I
      was
      house-sitting
      for
      a
      colleague.
      I
      think
      she
      thinks
      she
      was
      doing
      me
      a
      favour
      but
      I
      already
      had
      a
      home
      so
      there
      was
      no
      gain.
      I
      just
      did
      it
      cos
      she
      said
      she
      had
      no
      other

      I've
      already
      been
      told
      this
      is
      a
      silly
      thing
      to
      complain
      about
      but
      it
      won't
      stop
      bothering
      me...
      A
      fellow
      I
      work
      with
      eats
      curried
      sausages
      for
      lunch
      EVERY
      DAY
      and
      it
      stinks
      out
      the
      whole
      office
      from
      approx
      12.01pm
      until
      COB.
      The
      smell
      is
      so
      strong
      it
      makes
      me
      gag.
      I
      don't
      even
      know
      what
      is
      in
      that
      dish
      but
      it
      seems
      fucking
      foul.
      How
      do
      my
      fellow
      vegans
      manage
      the
      choking
      scent
      of
      reheated
      meat
      in
      the
      workplace?
      Is
      it
      something
      I
      just
      have
      to
      put
      up
      with
      or
      is
      there
      some
      sort
      of
      compromise
      I
      reach
      with
      my
      colleagues?
      Please
      help.
      I
      avoid
      eating
      my
      own
      lunch
      because
      it
      means
      going
      into
      the
      kitchen
      area
      which
      stinksss.

      Good
      idea!
      I
      only
      wish
      my
      colleague
      was
      the
      one
      who
      would
      take
      it
      outside...

      Yay!
      Glad
      to
      know
      I'm
      not
      being
      totally
      pedantic.

      Omg
      yes,
      I'll
      retaliate
      with
      the
      pungent
      scent
      of
      pine!

      LOVE
      the
      morose
      ending.
      LOVE
      the
      sense
      of
      nostalgia
      and
      the
      overarching
      simile.
      The
      one
      thing
      that
      kinda
      irks
      me
      is
      only
      two
      lines
      rhyme,
      and
      they
      don't
      really
      flow
      with
      the
      rest
      of
      the
      piece.
      It's
      also
      a
      bit
      jarring
      that
      some
      sentences
      are
      over
      two
      lines,
      while
      others
      three
      or
      four.
      If
      I
      read
      it
      aloud
      it's
      hard
      to
      get
      the
      rhythm
      right.

      Honestly,
      you'd
      be
      best
      to
      catch
      the
      bus
      from
      Bellerive.
      There's
      a
      pretty
      regular
      service
      from
      there
      into
      Hobart.
      I
      think
      a
      lot
      of
      Eastern
      Shore
      folk
      drive
      into
      Bellerive
      then
      hop
      on
      a
      bus
      to
      get
      to
      work.

      Head
      to
      a
      place
      called
      Waratah.
      It's
      sparsely
      populated
      so
      when
      it
      snows
      it's
      remarkably
      quiet
      and
      pristine.
      Close
      to
      Cradle
      Mountain
      so
      you
      can
      go
      on
      a
      day
      trip
      there.
      It's
      also
      the
      site
      of
      Tasmania's
      first
      tin
      mine
      (not
      that
      I
      support
      mining)
      and
      has
      a
      nice
      waterfall.
      It's
      summer
      though
      so
      you
      might
      have
      to
      wait
      a
      few
      months
      for
      snow...

      Wow!
      You
      ACTUALLY
      changed
      it
      and
      it's
      ACTUALLY
      better!
      Cool!

      So
      this
      is
      for
      bisexuals
      who
      may
      not
      identify
      as
      part
      of
      the
      queer
      community?
      People
      who
      hold
      traditional
      views
      but
      can't
      comprehend
      their
      own
      diversion?
      I'm
      not
      sure,
      sounds
      a
      bit
      like
      a
      platform
      for
      internalised
      biphobia
      but
      I'll
      wait
      and
      see.

      Sometimes
      I
      can't
      tell
      if
      I
      feel
      like
      crying,
      hiding
      or
      screaming.
      It's
      a
      weird
      mix
      of
      dread
      and
      adrenaline.
      Feels
      a
      bit
      like
      I
      am
      dying
      so
      I
      try
      to
      expel
      it
      by
      crying
      but
      nothing
      comes
      out.
      Often
      leads
      to
      a
      period
      of
      sitting
      in
      the
      middle
      of
      a
      room,
      in
      a
      state
      of
      catatonia/physical
      paralysis.
