      All
      digital
      art,
      when
      displayed
      on
      a
      monitor,
      is
      made
      up
      of
      pixels.
      Not
      all
      digital
      art
      is
      stored
      as
      pixels.
      Not
      all
      digital
      art
      is
      intended
      to
      be
      displayed
      only
      on
      monitors.
      If
      you
      printed
      this
      (on
      a
      large
      enough
      surface),
      you
      would
      still
      see
      the
      pixels.
      Printing
      vector
      art
      (using
      the
      right
      printer)
      will
      never
      show
      pixels,
      no
      matter
      how
      large
      or
      small
      the
      print
      area
      because
      there
      are
      no
      pixels
      to
      show.

      Even
      *if*
      plants
      suffer
      in
      the
      same
      way
      animals
      suffer,
      not

      at
      death
      but
      even
      through
      their
      lives
      like
      factory

      animals,
      you'd
      still
      be
      causing
      less
      suffering
      as
      a
      vegan
      because
      feeding
      an
      animal
      enough
      plants
      to
      make
      it
      large
      and
      then
      eating
      that
      animal
      result
      in
      far
      more
      plant
      suffering
      than
      just
      eating
      the
      plants
      directly.

      The
      amazon
      is
      being
      lit
      on
      fire
      by
      farmers
      illegally
      trying
      to
      clear
      land
      to
      graze
      cattle
      and
      to
      grow
      soy,
      80%
      of
      which
      is
      used
      to
      feed
      cattle.
      This
      is
      not
      something
      cows
      would
      "just
      do."
      Further,
      without
      us
      actively
      breeding
      cows
      into
      a
      life
      of
      suffering,
      there
      would
      be
      far
      fewer
      cows
      to
      graze
      on
      the
      grass
      that
      you've
      expressed
      concern
      for.
      As
      for
      eating
      seeds
      and
      fruit
      that
      are
      intended
      for
      consumption
      -
      it
      turns
      out
      that
      us
      human
      folks
      eat
      them,
      too.
      By
      all
      means,
      take
      it
      a
      step
      further
      from
      veganism
      to
      fruitarianism.
      It's
      something
      I'd
      like
      to
      do,
      too.

      Where
      do
      you
      justify
      "there
      are
      millions
      of
      examples
      every
      day
      of
      things
      existing
      independent
      of
      your
      mind"?
      What
      things
      influence
      me
      regardless
      of
      my
      mind?
      Which
      of
      those
      things
      can
      I
      know
      outside
      my
      mind?
      Does
      my
      bed
      hold
      me
      up
      as
      I
      sleep
      or
      does
      my
      mind
      fabricate
      the
      story
      that
      I
      went
      to
      sleep
      in
      a
      bed?
      Can
      you
      disprove
      the
      latter?
      Can
      you
      do
      so
      more
      convincingly
      than,
      say,
      Descartes?
      I'm
      genuinely
      curious.
      Incredibly
      skeptical,
      but
      if
      you
      have
      the
      answer
      I'd
      love
      to
      hear
      it.
      Don't
      get
      me
      wrong,
      my
      mind
      tells
      me
      to
      operate
      as
      though
      reality
      is
      real;
      that
      the
      floor
      objectively
      exists.
      I'm
      just
      curious
      how
      you
      can
      go
      the
      step
      further
      and
      drop
      the
      "my
      mind
      tells
      me"
      part.

       gt;
      Of
      course
      you
      can
      define
      "your
      mind"
      to
      be
      everything
      that
      ever
      was
      and
      will
      be
      but
      that's
      called
      solipsism,
      something
      I
      can
      tell
      you
      from
      personal
      authority
      is
      false
      (but
      it
      takes
      a
      humility
      to
      allow
      that
      anyone
      other
      than
      you
      exists,
      and
      I
      don't
      know
      if
      you'll
      grant
      me
      that
      dignity).
      Nobody
      can
      stop
      you
      from
      believing
      this,
      but
      it's
      quite
      a
      useless
      belief
      when
      a
      tiger
      is
      eating
      you
      against
      your
      will.
      Solipsism
      does
      not
      need
      to
      deny
      your
      existence,
      it
      only
      needs
      to
      deny
      your
      definition
      of
      your
      existence.
      What
      are
      *you*?
      Your
      body?
      Your
      experiences?
      Your
      mind?
      Your
      hobbies?
      Your
      relationships?
      Your
      impact
      on
      the
      world?
      What
      is
      the
      thread
      that
      holds
      all
      of
      this
      together
      as
      you
      slip
      in
      and
      out
      of
      consciousness,
      as
      memories
      disintegrate?
      You
      seem
      to
      have
      studied
      enough
      philosophy
      that
      it's
      likely
      that
      you
      have
      put
      thought
      into
      the
      topic.
      To
      hold
      a
      solipsistic
      world
      view
      the
      main
      thing
      is
      to
      strip
      all
      of
      that
      definition
      of
      self
      away.
      Why
      would
      you
      do
      that?
      Because
      the
      more
      you
      think
      about
      any
      particular
      definition,
      the
      less
      tenable
      it
      begins
      to
      seem.
      There
      are
      probably
      other
      reasons
      other
      people
      might
      do
      so.
      It's
      not
      that
      I'd
      (if
      I
      truly
      held
      a
      solipsistic
      world
      view,
      which
      I
      don't,
      but
      I'm
      coming
      around
      slowly)
      deny
      your
      existence.
      It's
      that
      I'd
      deny
      my
      existence
      as
      I've
      defined
      it
      throughout
      my
      entire
      life.
      To
      the
      point
      where
      all
      "I"
      am
      is
      the
      underlying
      forces
      driving
      and
      experiencing
      the
      entire
      universe.
      At
      which
      point
      I'd
      come
      to
      the
      conclusion
      that
      *you*,
      and
      everything
      else,
      are
      likely
      the
      same
      as
      me
      (albeit
      tied
      up
      in
      different
      notions
      of
      self
      than
      this
      body-mind
      would
      be).
      Perhaps
      that's
      more
      in
      line
      with
      Brahman
      than
      what
      you've
      read
      of
      solipsism?
      I've
      not
      read
      their
      work.
      But
      you're
      right,
      this
      view
      does
      leave
      the
      entire
      universe
      existing
      independently
      of
      what
      this
      body-mind
      experiences.
      Or
      at
      least
      it
      leaves
      the
      universe
      existing
      until
      the
      body-mind
      begins
      thinking
      about
      how
      the
      body-mind
      observes
      the
      universe
      and
      knows
      about
      the
      existence
      of
      the
      universe.
      Solipsism
      solves
      the
      tiger
      problem
      quite
      handily
      -
      "I"
      am
      not
      being
      eaten
      by
      the
      tiger.
      The
      body-mind,
      which
      is
      not
      me,
      is
      being
      eaten
      by
      the
      tiger.
      The
      tiger
      is
      also
      me
      and
      needs
      to
      eat
      me
      to
      survive.
      I'm
      not
      losing
      anything.
      Unfortunately
      it
      has
      only
      moved
      the
      goalposts
      on
      the
      existence
      of
      reality.
      I
      don't
      think
      you've
      helped
      me
      untangle
      anything.
      Maybe
      it
      reality
      does
      exist,
      but
      despite
      your
      adamant
      denial
      I
      could
      still
      just
      be
      dreaming
      this
      entire
      sequence;
      I've
      had
      some
      pretty
      convincing
      dreams
      before
      in
      your
      reality.
      Or
      maybe
      Descartes'
      demon
      is
      manipulating
      my
      senses
      or
      even
      the
      firing
      of
      neurons
      in
      my
      mind.
      As
      an
      aside
      -
      you
      ask
      what
      philosophies
      that
      deny
      reality
      have
      accomplished
      in
      this
      world.
      I'd
      point
      out
      that
      they've
      contributed
      directly
      to
      the
      happiness
      of
      many
      people
      who
      find
      solace
      in
      them,
      and
      indirectly
      to
      the
      happiness
      of
      many
      more
      through
      works
      of
      fiction.
      Perhaps
      not
      as
      much
      as
      immediately
      as
      the
      scientific
      method,
      but
      even
      *if*
      the
      scientific
      method
      has
      accomplished
      more,
      where
      is
      it
      taking
      us?

      consider:
      -
      you
      were
      probably
      bad
      at
      drawing
      once,
      too.
      I
      imagine
      you
      got
      better
      by
      not
      being
      afraid
      to
      try.
      -
      you
      managed
      to
      draw
      this
      and
      your
      pen
      could've
      slipped
      and
      messed
      it
      up
      at
      any
      time
      -
      nothing
      is
      permanent
      anyways,
      and
      attachment
      to
      an
      impermanent
      drawing
      is
      an
      attachment
      that
      seems
      worth
      letting
      go
      of
      -
      you
      won't
      get
      better
      at
      colours
      without
      trying
      to
      colour
      'Course
      there
      are
      easier
      ways
      to
      learn
      than
      on
      the
      only
      copy
      of
      your
      50
      hour
      masterpiece.
      I'm
      just
      commenting
      'cuz
      -
      while
      not
      being
      nearly
      as
      talented
      -
      I'm
      feeling
      the
      exact
      same
      fear
      as
      I
      try
      to
      learn.
      And
      I'm
      finding
      it
      valuable
      to
      talk
      myself
      through
      that
      fear.

      So
      your
      mind,
      under
      the
      influence
      of
      psychedelics,
      is
      able
      to
      convince
      you
      that
      you
      are
      the
      universe.
      But
      also
      you
      believe
      your
      mind
      is
      not
      capable
      of
      convincing
      you
      that
      the
      reality
      you
      are
      currently
      experiencing
      is
      reality?
      Don't
      get
      me
      wrong
      -
      I
      operate
      as
      though
      reality
      is
      reality
      because
      it's
      what
      seems
      to
      make
      sense
      in
      this
      moment.
      But
      knowing
      just
      how
      powerful
      my
      mind
      is,
      whether
      in
      dreams
      or
      while
      high,
      leaves
      me
      incapable
      of
      deciding
      that
      *this*
      is
      real
      and
      that
      I
      couldn't
      just
      wake
      up
      as
      someone
      else
      tomorrow
      none
      the
      wiser.
      That
      knowledge
      forces
      me
      to
      *also*
      at
      least
      consider
      the
      possibility
      that
      we
      (including
      every
      little
      rock)
      are
      all
      one
      while
      acting.
      Then
      on
      spirituality
      -
      what
      do
      you
      think
      drives
      every
      living
      thing?
      Also,
      what
      forces
      do
      you
      think
      hold
      the
      atoms
      of
      a
      rock
      in
      the
      shape
      of
      a
      rock?
      Yes
      physics
      and
      biology
      can
      describe
      some
      of
      the
      how.
      But
      not
      the
      why.
      Why
      are
      you
      so
      adamant
      that
      it
      *isn't*
      some
      great
      spirit?
      I
      don't
      know
      that
      it's
      useful
      to
      name
      that
      spirit
      or
      to
      worry
      about
      its
      motives
      or
      anything
      else
      of
      the
      sort.
      But
      your
      confidence
      in
      its
      non-existence
      feels
      unfounded.

      The
      strong
      nuclear
      force
      can
      explain
      what
      holds
      atom
      together.
      Quantum
      mechanics
      can
      then
      explain
      that.
      Indeed.
      Probably.
      Maybe.
      I
      vaguely
      recall
      reading
      things
      about
      that.
      In
      other
      words,
      this
      is
      secondhand
      information,
      being
      relayed
      through
      foolable
      senses,
      being
      dredged
      up
      through
      an
      unreliable
      memory.
      But
      definitely
      I'm
      being
      delusional
      by
      acknowledging
      the
      explanation
      for
      the
      next-to-nothing
      it
      actually
      is...
      Science
      doesn't
      look
      at
      Truth.
      Science
      looks
      at
      what
      works;
      what
      is
      observable.
      And
      then
      it
      gives
      names
      to
      observations
      like
      "strong
      nuclear
      force".
      It
      doesn't
      know
      what
      or
      why
      "strong
      nuclear
      force"
      is,
      it
      only
      knows
      what
      it
      has
      observed
      strong
      nuclear
      force
      doing.
      It's
      like
      if
      someone
      started
      watching
      you
      -
      every
      day
      -
      recording
      your
      actions
      and
      impacts
      on
      your
      environment.
      No
      matter
      how
      accurate
      a
      picture
      they
      draw
      of
      your
      life,
      they'll
      *never*
      get
      to
      who
      you
      are.
      Even
      if
      their
      observations
      get
      invasive,
      and
      they
      tear
      apart
      your
      brain
      so
      they
      can
      observe
      every
      individual
      neuron
      firing
      and
      where
      those
      neurons
      connect.
      They
      can
      observe
      you
      perfectly
      as
      a
      machine
      just
      as
      I
      can
      observe
      a
      piece
      of
      software.
      But
      they
      won't
      get
      to
      *you*.
      They
      might
      conclude
      that
      *you*
      don't
      exist,
      but
      doing
      so
      would
      reason
      themselves
      out
      of
      existence,
      too,
      and
      that
      strikes
      me
      as
      a
      silly
      thing
      to
      do.
      It's
      not
      just
      that
      there
      are
      things
      we
      don't
      know.
      It's
      that
      there
      are
      things
      we
      probably
      can't
      know.
      There
      are
      things
      we
      *know*
      we
      can't
      know,
      even.
      Then
      there
      are
      other
      things
      we
      *do*
      know,
      like
      "I
      exist",
      that
      science
      has
      not
      contributed
      and
      never
      will
      contribute
      one
      bit
      to
      us
      knowing.
      You
      can
      say
      it's
      not
      useful
      to
      think
      about
      the
      immaterial
      world
      as
      it's
      not
      possible
      to
      test
      any
      hypothesis
      that
      might
      be
      formulated.
      But
      if
      "delusional"
      stories
      to
      describe
      the
      sense
      of
      *being*
      we
      all
      feel
      -
      such
      as
      the
      existence
      of
      souls
      -
      have
      given
      comfort
      to
      billions
      of
      people
      through
      the
      millennia
      then
      those
      delusional
      stories
      strike
      me
      as
      not
      so
      useless,
      no?

      I
      actually
      came
      out
      of
      my
      comp
      sci
      degree
      with
      an
      easy
      4.0,
      swarmed
      with
      offers
      for
      funded
      grad
      positions.
      Instead
      I
      opted
      to
      get
      paid
      doing
      R amp;D
      on
      a
      static
      code
      analysis
      engine
      that
      is
      used
      to
      help
      ensure
      all
      kinds
      of
      mission
      critical
      software
      (medical
      equipment,
      commercial
      planes,
      etc)
      is
      as
      bug-free
      as
      we
      can
      manage.
      Aka
      doing
      the
      best
      we
      can
      to
      write
      P
      software
      in
      a
      problem
      space
      that
      in
      part
      is
      unsolvable
      (see:
      halting
      problem)
      and
      is
      in
      part
      NP-complete
      (see:
      boolean
      satisfiability).
      Like
      I
      said,
      I
      operate
      as
      though
      reality
      is
      real.
      There's
      not
      much
      choice
      but
      to
      do
      otherwise.
      I'm
      just
      not
      so
      willing
      to
      pretend

      care
      about
      philosophy

      science
      because
      they're
      too

      that

      that

      science

      No,

      am
      saying
      that
      because
      scientists
      have

      sell
      it
      as
      truth
      to
      the
      general
      population,
      that
      perhaps
      it
      would
      benefit
      scientists
      to
      brush
      up
      on
      what
      "truth"
      means
      so
      as
      to
      become
      better
      salespeople.
      Or
      at
      the
      very
      least
      they
      should
      consider
      not
      brushing
      discussions
      on
      "truth"
      aside
      as
      delusional
      navel
      gazing.
      Because
      that's
      pretty
      clearly
      not
      working.
      I'm
      kind
      of
      bored
      of
      this
      conversation,
      but
      wanted

      Note

      going

      that
      Tavares
      also
      drives
      play.
      Everyone
      on
      /r/leafs
      would've
      said
      the
      same.
      Marner
      drives
      play.
      It's
      *why*
      we
      assumed
      he
      was
      getting
      paid
      while
      kinda
      hoping
      otherwise.
      The
      puck
      sticks
      to
      him
      until
      he
      magically
      finds
      someone.
      Hence
      the
      nickname.
      Look
      at
      the
      two
      assists
      he
      got
      last
      night...
      did
      you
      see
      Tavares
      driving
      the
      play
      on
      either
      of

      scene.
      Which
      wasn't

      when
      you're
      going

      This
      would

      everywhere.
       gt;
      Also
      what's
      to
      stop
      bike
      thieves
      from
      just
      inputting
      a
      fake
      serial
      number?
      It's
      not
      like
      Kijiji
      can
      verify
      that
      it's
      real.
      No,
      but
      it
      does
      two
      things.
      First,
      it
      prompts
      the
      buyer
      to
      even
      think
      about
      the
      existence
      of
      the
      serial
      number.
      Which
      many
      don't.
      Second,
      the
      buyer
      can
      check
      the
      serial
      themselves
      and
      compare
      to
      what's
      listed
      on
      kijiji,
      at
      which
      point,
      if
      they
      don't
      match,
      the
      buyer
      can
      figure
      out
      that
      something
      is
      up
      pretty
      easily.
      Obviously
      buyers
      can
      just
      ask
      for
      the
      serial
      before
      going
      to
      meet
      the
      seller
      to
      accomplish
      the
      same
      thing,
      but
      refer
      back
      to
      my
      first
      point.
      Not
      saying
      it's
      a
      panacea,
      but
      it'd
      still
      be
      an
      improvement.

      Dunno
      if
      anyone
      here
      cares,
      but
      the
      WC3
      Remaster
      pre-order
      is
      easy
      to
      refund
      over
      things
      like
      this:
      Blizzard
      Ruling
      on
      HK
      interview:
      Blitzchung
      removed
      from
      grandmasters,
      will
      receive
      no
      prize,
      and
      banned
      for
      a
      year.
      Both
      casters
      fired.

      You
      can
      log
      into
      your
      battle.net
      account
      and
      refund
      your
      WC3
      Remaster
      pre-order
      without
      any
      hassle.
      It's
      not
      much
      but
      if
      it's
      what
      I
      can
      do
      right
      now
      to
      support
      Hong
      Kong
      it's
      an
      easy
      thing
      to
      do.

      Reposting
      because
      I
      didn't
      assign
      flair
      last
      time.
      I
      also
      submitted
      a
      ticket
      to
      try
      refunding
      my
      Blizzcon
      Virtual
      Ticket;
      not
      sure
      if
      that
      one
      will
      work
      but
      we
      will
      find
      out.
      Someone
      asked
      the
      question
      if
      the
      money
      still
      ends
      up
      on
      Blizzard
      balance
      or
      not
      before
      it
      was
      removed
      -
      mine
      did
      not
      end
      up
      on
      my
      balance,
      but
      maybe
      it
      would
      if
      you
      had
      paid
      from
      balance
      (I'd
      paid
      from
      paypal).
