      lost
      my

      last

      Nothing

      I

      I
      identify
      as
      a
      wolf,
      so
      today
      I
      walked
      into
      the
      woods
      to
      find
      other
      wolves.
      I
      found
      a
      pack
      and
      aproached
      them.
      They
      started
      walking
      away
      from
      me
      so
      of
      course
      I
      followed
      them.
      After
      that
      they
      started
      attacking
      me
      and
      I
      died.
      Those
      wolves
      are
      stupid
      conservatis
      that
      don't
      accept
      others
      :(

      They
      are
      bears
      and
      belong
      in
      order
      carnivora
      which
      includes
      all
      bears,
      canids,
      seals,
      felids
      and
      many
      other
      kinds
      of
      animals.
      But
      that
      doesn't
      mean
      that
      they
      are
      carnivores.
      Like
      many
      other
      bear
      species,
      (extinct
      Eurasian
      cave
      bear
      for
      example),
      pandas
      have
      more
      plant
      based
      diet.
      They
      eat
      little
      amounts
      of
      meat
      but
      I
      wouldn't
      call
      them
      carnivores.

      Even
      if
      the
      people
      are
      same
      everywhere
      around
      the
      world,
      the
      nature
      is
      different.
      I
      would
      love
      to
      explore
      different
      kinds
      of
      wild
      areas
      of
      the
      world.
      African
      megafauna
      exist
      only
      in
      Africa,
      many
      marsupials
      only
      live
      in
      Australia,
      and
      so
      on.
      It
      is
      still
      expensive
      and
      in
      my
      opinion
      using
      planes
      is
      too
      bad
      for
      the
      enviroment,
      so
      I
      "have
      to"
      stay
      in
      my
      local
      woods.

      I
      have
      been
      a
      big
      fan
      of
      prehistoric
      animals
      (mainly
      animals
      from
      Pleistocene
      era)
      since
      I
      was
      little
      child.
      Now
      I
      have
      started
      reading
      about
      these
      awesome
      animals
      again,
      but
      I
      have
      noticed
      that
      many
      of
      them
      aren't
      how
      I
      remembered
      them.
      For
      example
      now
      it
      seems
      that
      dire
      wolves
      were
      same
      size
      as
      big
      grey
      wolves
      of
      today,
      woolly
      mammoths
      were
      same
      size
      as
      African
      bush
      elephant,
      cave
      bears
      were
      mostly
      herbivorous,
      big
      part
      of
      cave
      lions
      diet
      and
      only
      little
      bigger
      than
      brown
      bears,
      Homotherium
      were
      only
      sabertooth
      cats
      living
      in
      the
      Europe,
      spotted
      hyena
      was
      dominant
      predator
      in
      Europe.
      Of
      course
      we
      might
      have
      more
      information
      about
      these
      animals
      than
      before,
      but
      bones
      of
      those
      animals
      existed
      back
      then
      and
      they
      showed
      that
      the
      dire
      wolves,
      woolly
      mammoths
      and
      cave
      bears
      were
      bigger
      than
      what
      I
      told
      earlier.
      Am
      I
      just
      remembering
      wrong
      or
      could
      this
      be
      something
      else?

      I

      Star
      Wars
      because
      it
      was
      part
      of
      my
      childhood.
      If
      I
      got
      introduced
      to
      it
      as
      adult,
      I
      would
      probably
      not
      care
      about
      it.

      In
      Europe
      many
      ethnic
      groups
      have
      their
      own
      countries
      and
      USA
      has
      always
      had
      people
      from
      all
      over
      the
      world
      living
      there.
      This
      doesn't
      justify
      racism
      but
      maybe
      it
      is
      one
      of
      the
      reasons?

      English
      is
      understood
      in
      many
      places.
      Many
      languages
      are
      limited
      to
      their
      countries.
      I
      agree
      tht
      English
      nice
      sounding
      language
      in
      music,
      but
      I
      also
      enjoy
      other
      languages
      that
      I
      understand.
      Still
      my
      favorite
      in
      everything
      is
      my
      native

      Currently
      I
      sit
      on
      my
      bed
      drinking
      alcohol
      and
      I
      really
      enjoy
      it.
      No
      one
      is
      complaining
      about
      music
      I
      listen,
      I
      can
      do
      what
      I
      want
      and
      this
      is
      alot
      cheaper
      than
      going
      to
      bars
      or
      night
      clubs.
      I
      don't
      accidentally
      break
      other
      peoples
      property
      or
      take
      part
      in
      their
      stupid
      plans.
      I
      don't
      have
      to
      worry
      about
      getting
      robbed
      or
      raped.
      I
      can
      just
      chill
      here
      and
      enjoy.
      And
      I
      regulary
      drink
      with
      my
      friends
      (almost
      every
      week),
      so
      I
      know
      what
      that
      is
      like.

      Last
      summer
      I
      went
      weeks
      without
      cutting
      or
      biting
      my
      finger
      nails.
      I
      didn't
      have
      to
      work
      with
      people
      so
      there
      was
      no
      problem.
      When
      I
      went
      to
      sauna
      the
      nails
      would
      get
      softer
      and
      bend.

      Why
      would
      you
      hit
      someone
      who
      falsely
      accuses
      you
      of
      rape?
      Yes
      it
      is
      bad
      to
      falsely
      accuse
      such
      thing
      but
      hitting
      her
      would
      just
      make
      things
      worse
      for
      you
      and
      wouldn't
      solve
      anything.

      hitting

      Is
      it
      because

      About
      an
      year
      ago
      I
      was
      way
      too
      addicted
      to
      Reddit.
      I
      used
      it
      every
      single
      day
      and
      I
      wanted
      as
      much
      karma
      as
      possible.
      I
      made
      up
      stories
      and
      pretended
      to
      be
      someone
      who
      I
      really
      wasn't.
      It
      had
      only
      negative
      impacts
      on
      me.
      Then
      I
      deleted
      that
      profile
      and
      took
      pretty
      long
      break
      from
      this
      website.
      That
      was
      very
      good
      decision,
      but
      now
      I
      am
      back
      here
      trying
      to
      not
      make
      same
      mistakes.

      I

      even
      think

      someone
      could

      can

      With

      Always
      when

      go
      out
      drinking
      I
      worry

      something
      worse,

      I
      drink

      much
      and
      wake
      up
      in
      some
      random
      place
      without
      remembering
      much.
      I
      am
      honestly
      very
      suprised
      that
      no
      one
      has
      even
      stolen
      anything
      from

      would
      be
      very
      easy.

      Our

      Eastern
      European
      cultures
      have
      been
      mixing
      with
      Western
      European
      ones
      for
      hundreds
      of
      years.
      Just
      because
      they
      were
      separated
      from
      the
      west
      during
      the
      Cold
      War
      doesn't
      mean
      that
      they
      are
      more
      Chinese.

      Now

      Yes,
      cities
      are
      place
      where
      young
      people
      move
      to
      study
      and
      work
      while
      many
      old
      people
      stay
      in
      rural
      areas.
      And
      usually
      young
      people
      are
      more
      liberal.

      They

      Usually
      I

      remember
      my
      dreams
      but
      this
      month
      I
      have
      remembered
      all
      of
      them.
      All
      of
      them
      are
      very
      different,
      even
      one
      dream
      can
      have
      two
      or
      more
      different
      parts.
      They
      all
      seem
      realistic,
      but
      more
      extreme
      than
      real
      life
      and
      many
      times
      I

      Well
      people
      living
      in
      the
      north
      Africa
      are
      ~~Arabs~~
      Coptic
      or
      Berbers
      and
      are
      not
      black.
      But
      tere
      are
      also
      differences
      between
      black
      Africans,
      look
      up
      people
      from
      west
      Africa
      (from
      Ivory
      Coast
      for
      example)
      and
      compare
      them
      to
      people
      from
      east
      Africa
      (Somalia
      for
      example).
      In
      my
      opinion
      the
      differences
      are
      pretty
      big.
      But
      in
      reality
      there
      is
      no
      good
      scientific
      definition
      for
      the
      term
      race.

      I
      am
      worried
      about
      the
      declining
      Finnish
      population
      because
      that
      means
      our
      language
      and
      culture
      will
      die
      or
      atleast
      change.
      It
      is
      predicted
      that
      over
      50%
      of
      people
      living
      in
      Helsinki
      will
      not
      be
      native
      Finnish
      speakers
      in
      30
      years.
      I
      don't
      care
      if
      replacing
      population
      will
      be
      Arabic,
      Russian,
      English,
      Somali,
      German,
      Swedish
      or
      anyother,
      I
      don't
      want
      to
      lose
      my
      culture.

      Look
      at

      in

      many

      No

      Better

      some

      diskliked

      because
      they

      it

      try

      I
      know
      many
      people
      who
      complain
      about
      climate
      change,
      but
      still
      fly
      around
      the
      world
      and
      buy
      new
      phone
      every
      year.
      They
      defend
      it
      by
      saying
      they
      don't
      have
      kids.
      I
      tell
      you
      can
      always
      do
      better
      and
      they
      tell
      that
      I
      shouldn't
      expect
      them
      to
      be
      perfect.

      When
      I
      was
      13
      years
      old
      I
      broke
      my
      foot
      by
      trying
      to
      kick
      door
      open.
      I
      was
      angry
      because
      I
      had
      an
      argument
      with
      my
      family
      member
      and
      wanted
      to
      go
      outside.
      At
      first
      it
      didn't
      hurt
      at
      all
      and
      I
      walked
      for
      about
      hundred
      meters.
      Then
      I
      sat
      down
      and
      couldn't
      step
      on
      that
      leg
      anymore.
       #8203;
      This
      other
      thing
      did
      not
      happen
      to
      me
      but
      to
      my
      cousin.
      We
      were
      about
      14
      years
      olds
      and
      were
      shooting
      cans
      with
      our
      new
      air-rifle.
      He
      accidentally
      shot
      his
      own
      hand
      and
      had
      to
      go
      to
      the
      hospital.

      is

      other

      People
      in
      the
      western
      countries
      usually
      only
      speak
      Indo-European
      languages,
      many
      times
      these
      languages
      are
      even
      from
      same
      brach
      of
      that
      family.
      For
      example
      English,
      Dutch
      and
      Swedish
      are
      very
      similiar,
      most
      words
      are
      almost
      same
      with
      little
      differences,
      grammar
      works
      similarry
      and
      it
      doesn't
      take
      much
      effort
      to
      learn
      them.
      Languages
      that
      are
      closely
      related
      should
      not
      be
      considered
      to
      be
      foreign.
      It
      is
      very
      different
      experience
      for
      native
      French
      speaker
      to
      learn
      Korean,
      Xhosan,
      Estonian
      or
      Vietnamese
      than
      Spanish,
      Portuguese,
      Romanian
      or
      Italian.
      It
      would
      not
      be
      fair
      to
      consider
      them
      as
      equally
      multilingual.

      I

      day

      had
      problems
      with
      my
      girl
      friend.
      I
      started
      drinking
      at
      the
      morning
      and
      stopped
      during
      next
      night
      when.
      I
      don't
      remember
      much
      but
      I
      made
      so
      many
      bad
      decisions
      which
      I
      don't
      like
      to
      think
      about
      and
      spended
      way
      too
      much
      money.
      After
      that
      day
      I
      only
      drink
      once
      a
      month
      and
      one
      drink
      per
      hour.
      Expect
      when
      I
      am
      far
      away
      enough
      from
      civilization.

      English
      language
      is
      everywhere
      these
      days
      and
      because
      of
      that
      it
      has
      big
      effects
      on
      other
      languages.
      Finnish
      is
      my
      native
      language
      and
      people
      are
      doing
      fast
      job
      at
      replacing
      Finnish
      words,
      sayings
      and
      even
      grammar
      with
      English
      ones.
      Even
      professional
      people
      in
      tv,
      news
      and
      radio
      are
      doing
      this.
      It
      sounds
      annoying
      and
      makes
      me
      think
      that
      you
      want
      to
      kill
      our
      language.
      Worst
      of
      all
      "Finglish"
      where
      every
      other
      word
      is
      English
      and
      other
      Finnish.
      Ofcourse
      languages
      always
      change
      and
      most
      words
      are
      alreaydy
      old
      lons,
      but
      it
      is
      still
      annoying.

      examples:

      "se

      literally
      translated
      from
      "it
      doesn't

      when
      it
      should
      be
      "siin #228;
      ei
      ole

      which

      about
      things
      like
      Roman
      Empire,
      European
      colonialism
      and
      nukes
      dropping
      in

      Also
      I
      remember
      that

      Irish
      thing
      was

      My
      goal
      now
      is
      to
      get
      my
      Russian
      on
      level
      where
      I
      can
      use
      it
      similarry
      how
      I
      use
      English
      (internet,
      movies
      and
      travelling).
      I
      have
      a
      list
      of
      languages
      that
      I
      would
      want
      to
      learn,
      but
      I
      will
      most
      likely
      learn
      only
      one
      if
      even
      that.
      Now
      I
      can't
      decide
      and
      will
      wait
      atleast
      a
      year
      to
      see
      if
      I
      am
      interested
      in
      learning
      new
      language
      anymore.

      Without

      I
      could
      have

      to
      university

      but
      now
      I
      have
      to
      wait
      atleast
      to
      2020.
