      Reddit,
      I
      just
      wanted
      to
      say
      that
      this
      is
      a
      great
      idea!
      I'm
      an
      assistant
      editor
      for
      RealClearScience,
      and
      would
      be
      happy
      to
      lend
      my
      humble
      expertise
      in
      addition
      to
      the
      knowledge
      Letmeirkyou
      is
      graciously
      tendering.
      P.S.
      I
      come
      to
      /r/science
      for
      story
      ideas
      all
      the
      time.
      You
      guys
      sleuth
      out
      some
      fascinating
      papers
      in
      lesser
      known
      journals!
      Terrific
      discussions,
      too
      (for
      the
      most
      part
      :D).

      There
      was
      a
      National
      Geographic
      piece
      featured
      here
      a
      while
      ago
      in
      which
      the
      author
      participated
      in
      the
      discussion,
      but
      you're
      right,
      for
      the
      most
      part,
      not
      many
      journalists
      join
      in.
      I
      think
      the
      prospect
      of
      commenting
      on
      Reddit
      can
      be
      rather
      daunting
      due
      to
      the
      potential
      for
      a
      lot
      of
      questions
      to
      come
      in,
      which
      can
      take
      a
      significant
      amount
      of
      time
      and
      energy
      to
      answer.

      When
      I
      started
      a
      blog
      a
      while
      back,
      I
      would
      email
      editors
      and
      established
      writers
      at
      various
      science
      sites,
      introduce
      myself,
      link
      my
      work,
      and
      ask
      for
      advice
      in
      terms
      of
      writing
      style,
      etc.
      Many
      writers
      are
      more
      than
      happy
      to
      help,
      and
      at
      the
      same
      time,
      you
      get
      your
      name
      out
      in
      a
      manner
      that
      doesn't
      come
      off
      like
      a
      sales
      pitch.
      If
      you're
      looking
      to
      get
      your
      work
      out
      there
      (a.k.a.
      unpaid),
      the
      Scientific
      American
      Guest
      Blog
      may
      take
      your
      stuff.
      We
      also
      take
      submissions
      at
      RealClearScience.
      We
      frequently
      feature
      the

      I
      personally
      love
      Vsauce
      and
      Big
      Think.
      Vsauce
      especially
      radiates
      enthusiasm
      and
      gets
      people
      excited
      about
      exploring
      the
      world
      around
      them.
      But
      you're
      right,
      while
      Vsauce
      imparts
      a
      great
      deal
      of
      amazing
      information,
      sometimes
      it
      only
      goes
      skin
      deep.
      You
      get
      the
      "wow!"
      without
      the
      understanding.

      Author
      here.
      Khyber
      has
      it
      partially
      right
      from
      my
      understanding.
      Here's
      a
      bit
      more
      info:
      The
      "half-life"
      for
      DNA
      is
      sorta
      different
      than
      that
      for
      an
      element.
      For
      elements,
      it
      describes
      the
      time
      for
      half
      of
      the
      substance
      to
      decay.
      For
      DNA,
      it
      describes
      the
      time
      it
      takes
      for
      half
      of
      the
      molecule's
      bonds
      to
      break.
      So,
      in
      the
      case
      of
      the
      hominin
      DNA
      from
      this
      study,
      even
      after
      400,000
      years,
      some
      bonds
      are
      still
      in
      place.
      Scientists
      just
      have
      to
      gather
      enough
      DNA
      molecules
      in
      order
      to
      put
      all
      of
      the
      pieces
      together.
      Also
      cool:
      the
      authors
      used
      a
      new
      method
      that
      is
      more
      efficient
      at
      collecting
      DNA
      from
      bone,
      which
      really
      helped
      them
      collect
      enough
      DNA
      to
      complete
      the
      mitochondrial
      DNA
      sequence.
      Edit:
      Wow.
      Thanks
      for
      the
      gold!

      If
      you're
      referring
      to
      the
      dating,
      the
      range
      is
      actually
      huge.
      The
      authors
      listed
      the
      lower
      and
      upper
      limits
      at
      150,000
      and
      640,000
      years.
      But
      I'm
      comfortable
      with
      the
      author's
      400,000-year
      estimate
      considering
      the
      bones,
      themselves
      have
      been
      previously
      dated
      to
      at
      least
      350,000
      years
      old
      by
      more
      traditional
      methods.
      (Carbon-14,
      I'm
      guessing.)
      Edit:
      My
      carbon-14
      guess
      is
      wrong!

      total
      input
      power
      of
      24
      mega
      watts
       #8211;
      a
      65%
      ratio."
      The
      current
      result
      is
      basically
      just
      putting
      into
      writing
      what
      was
      reported
      on
      by
      the
      BBC
      a
      few
      months
      back.
      Yes,
      NIF
      created
      fusion,
      and
      it's
      very
      cool,
      but
      the
      energy
      output
      is
      microscopic
      compared
      to
      the
      energy
      input.
      It's
      like
      the
      60-second
      commercial
      that
      --
      for
      15
      seconds
      --
      expounds
      on
      an
      amazing
      drug
      that
      will
      change
      your
      life,
      while
      the
      rest
      of
      the
      ad
      explains
      all
      of
      the
      associated
      side
      effects
      and
      asterisks.

      Hey!

      Good
      question.
      With
      current
      tech,
      however,
      there's
      actually
      not
      much
      that
      can
      be
      done.
      It'd
      be
      wonderful
      to
      know
      the
      composition
      of
      Kepler-186f's
      atmosphere,
      which
      we'd
      find
      out
      by
      analyzing
      the
      spectrum
      of
      light
      that
      traverses
      through
      the
      planet's
      atmosphere.
      But
      the
      star
      is
      far
      too
      dim
      to
      allow
      for
      such
      an
      analysis.
      In
      all
      honesty,
      the
      best
      bet
      is
      probably
      to
      continue
      pouring
      through
      the
      mountain
      of
      data
      that
      Kepler
      has
      collected
      and
      look
      for
      a
      more
      promising
      planetary
      candidate
      for
      life.

      Thanks
      a
      lot!
      I
      actually
      included
      that
      bit
      about
      flares
      in
      a
      later
      edit.
      I
      spoke
      with
      an
      astronomy
      prof
      who
      was
      excited
      about
      the
      result,
      but
      expressed
      skepticism
      mostly
      for
      that
      reason.
      Who
      knows,
      though.
      Maybe
      the
      four
      inner
      Kepler
      186
      planets
      shielded
      186f
      in
      some
      fashion?
      That's
      pure
      speculation
      on
      my
      part,
      however.

      Don't
      know
      if
      that
      would
      make
      much
      of
      a
      difference
      if
      it
      were
      blasted
      with
      a
      flare.
      Keep
      in
      mind,
      186f
      is
      closer
      to
      its
      star
      than
      Mercury
      is
      to
      our
      Sun!
      So
      a
      solar
      flare,
      even
      from
      a
      star
      half
      the
      size
      of
      our
      sun,
      would
      probably
      do
      some
      damage...

      Actually,
      the

      from
      the

      you're

      which

      am
      copy
      and
      pasting
      from
      the

      is:
      "On

      existence
      of
      NCGS
      remains

      Yes.
      But
      that
      is
      the
      abstract
      of
      the
      review,
      not
      the

      The

      "art"
      is
      a
      red
      dot
      found
      in
      El
      Castillo,
      which
      dates
      to
      at
      least
      40,800
      years
      old.
      Here,
      the
      researchers
      found
      the
      oldest
      hand
      stencil.
      [Nature
      News](http://www.nature.com/news/neanderthal-culture-old-masters-1.12974)
      reported
      that.
      So
      they
      seem
      to
      be
      contradicting
      themselves
      a
      bit
      with
      the
      present
      study
      and
      technically
      incorrect
      headline.
      Edit:
      [Here](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/336/6087/1409)
      is
      the
      El
      Castillo
      study.
      The
      authors
      cite
      "minimum
      ages
      of
      40.8
      thousand
      years
      for
      a
      red
      disk,
      37.3
      thousand
      years
      for
      a
      hand

      NASA
      scientists
      seem
      to
      have
      assumed
      that
      this

      possible.
      But
      I
      imagine
      that
      this
      would
      be
      extremely
      hard

      to

      with
      current
      planet-spotting
      techniques,
      especially
      considering
      these
      potential
      intergalactic
      stars
      are
      so
      faint
      as
      it
      is.

      Hey
      all,
      I'm
      a
      science
      writer
      for
      a
      popular
      website
      and
      a
      HUGE
      Trekkie.
      I'm
      looking
      to
      write
      a
      piece
      on
      how
      Star
      Trek
      forwarded
      and
      impacted
      science
      and
      I'm
      trying
      to
      collect
      quotes
      from
      the
      series
      as
      well
      as
      ideas
      for
      the

      Checking

      anyone

      this,
      knows

      relevant,
      or
      is
      aware
      of
      any
      quotes.
      For
      example,
      in
      the
      episode
      "Where
      Science
      Has

      from

      Hey
      all!
      My
      good
      friend
      from
      Chicago
      is
      getting
      married
      in
      Minneapolis
      next
      weekend.
      He's
      now
      entered
      a
      final,
      vital
      stage
      of
      preparation:
      selecting
      the
      beer.
      His
      plan
      is
      to
      get
      four
      types
      of
      local-ish
      beer
      in
      bottles.
      The
      shoe
      in
      for
      him
      is
      Grain
      Belt
      Nordeast,
      but
      the
      other
      three
      are
      still
      up
      for
      discussion.
      I
      figured
      /r/Minneapolis
      would
      be
      able
      to
      offer
      some
      learned
      input!
      Here
      are
      the
      categories
      he's
      laid
      out
      for
      the
      final
      three
      beers:
      1)
      Pale
      Ale-
      2)
      Lighter-
      3)
      Heavier-
      I'd
      greatly
      appreciate
      some
      suggestions!
      Thanks!

      I
      think
      there's
      a
      misplaced
      correlation
      between
      porn
      use
      and
      erectile
      dysfunction.
      It's
      not
      that
      porn
      makes
      it
      harder
      to
      have
      sex
      with
      a
      partner,
      it's
      simply
      that
      porn
      offers
      a
      safer
      and
      potentially
      more
      simulating
      experience.
      So
      when
      some
      men
      find
      it
      difficult
      to
      perform
      with
      a
      partner
      they
      may
      mistakenly
      blame
      pornography.
      Frankly,
      it
      makes
      sense
      to
      me
      that
      men
      would
      find
      porn
      easier
      to
      get
      off
      to
      than
      a
      partner.
      When
      masturbating
      to
      porn,
      there's
      no
      feelings
      involved,
      no
      performance
      anxiety,
      no
      STDs
      to
      worry
      about,
      no
      fears
      of
      accidental
      pregnancy.
      As
      fun
      as
      sex
      can
      be,
      it
      can
      also
      be
      a
      very
      awkward
      and
      nerve-wracking
      experience.
      To
      remedy
      that,
      one
      needs
      to
      be
      honest
      and
      open
      with
      their
      partner.

      The
      big
      question
      is
      whether
      these
      slight
      alterations
      in
      brain
      structure
      affect
      any
      meaningful
      changes.
      That
      will
      be
      extremely
      difficult
      to
      determine.
      In
      fact,
      the
      relationship
      between
      contraception
      and
      brain
      structure
      is
      quite
      nuanced.
      Five
      years
      ago,
      researchers
      found
      that
      The

      with

      gray

      in
      certain
      parts
      of
      the

      it

      also
      have

      "reckless"
      (yellow

      For
      most
      of
      the
      game,
      the
      ref
      was
      overmatched,
      but
      he
      did
      get
      that
      call
      correct
      IMHO.

      My
      mistake,
      it
      looks
      like
      he
      did
      get
      to
      the
      ball
      first.

      Still,
      I'm
      not
      sure
      that
      matters
      if
      the
      challenge
      was
      performed
      in
      a
      careless
      or
      reckless
      fashion,
      and
      when
      the
      keeper
      is
      leading
      with
      two
      balled
      fists
      and
      clearly
      makes
      contact
      with
      the
      back
      of
      the
      head
      at
      high
      speed,
      can
      you
      say
      that's
      not
      careless
      or
      reckless?
      Imagine
      if
      that
      were
      a
      challenge
      between
      two
      field
      players,
      and
      one
      jumps
      into
      the
      other,
      as
      Ndjock
      did.
      Is
      that
      a
      foul?
      Either
      way,
      tough
      call.
      As
      a
      ref,
      I
      hate
      to
      call
      PKs.
      As
      an
      MN
      United
      fan,
      I
      hate
      to
      see
      them
      called
      against
      us
      in
      close
      games.
      But
      I
      can
      also
      understand
      why
      the
      ref
      made
      that
      call.
      Discussion
      with
      AR
      might
      have
      been
      warranted,
      or
      at
      least
      a
      glance
      over.

      It's
      a
      common
      misconception
      that
      if
      you
      "get
      the
      ball"
      it's
      not
      a
      foul.
      This
      is
      false.
      If
      your
      follow
      through
      causes
      you
      to
      subsequently
      hit
      a
      player,
      this
      is
      a
      foul.
      So
      with
      this
      play,
      you
      have
      to
      isolate
      the
      situations.
      Did
      the
      keeper
      punch
      the
      ball
      away?
      Yes.
      Did
      the
      keeper
      also
      punch
      the
      player
      in
      the
      back
      of
      the
      head?
      Yes.
      The
      GK
      is
      entitled
      to
      punch
      the
      ball
      away,
      but
      the
      player
      is
      also
      entitled
      not
      to
      be
      punched
      in
      the
      head.

      Oh
      no
      it's
      not
      always
      reckless.
      That's
      not
      what
      I'm
      saying.
      But
      when
      you
      punch
      a
      player
      in
      the
      back
      of
      the
      head,
      regardless
      of
      whether
      you
      play
      the
      ball
      first,
      it's
      hard
      to
      say
      that's
      not
      a
      foul.
      Once
      again,
      tough
      call.
      Could
      have
      gone
      either
      way.
      But
      I
      can
      see
      why
      the
      ref
      made
      the
      call,
      and
      it
      probably
      was
      the
      correct
      decision.

      Her
      advice
      is
      a
      bit
      more
      nuanced
      than
      the
      title
      suggests.
      A
      quote:
      "Some
      definitions
      of
      sexual
      harassment
      do
      include
      inappropriate
      looking
      or
      staring,
      especially
      when
      it #8217;s
      repeated
      to
      the
      point
      where
      the
      workplace
      becomes
      inhospitable.
      Has
      it
      reached
      that
      point?
      I
      don #8217;t
      mean
      to
      suggest
      that
      leering
      is
      appropriate
      workplace
      behavior #8212;it
      isn #8217;t #8212;but
      it
      is
      human
      and
      up
      to
      a
      point,
      I
      think,
      forgivable.
      Certainly
      there
      are
      worse
      things,
      including
      the
      unlawful
      behaviors
      described
      by
      the
      EEOC.
      No
      one
      should
      ever
      use
      a
      position
      of
      authority
      to
      take
      sexual
      advantage
      of
      another."

      than

      the

      is
      by
      no

      robust.
      In

      they
      generally
      don't
      migrate

      roughly
      a

      It's

      Here's
      an
      [article](http://www.realclearscience.com/blog/2015/03/gluten_sensitivity_has_not_just_been_proven.html)
      that
      looked
      into
      the
      study.
      Apparently,
      the
      research
      does
      not
      support
      gluten
      sensitivity
      as
      much
      as
      the
      abstract
      suggests.
      "Upon
      closer
      examination,
      however,
      the
      researchers
      noticed
      that
      50
      of
      the
      59
      subjects
      who
      completed
      the
      study
      (two
      dropped
      out)
      either
      had
      en
      equally
      negative
      response
      to
      gluten
      or
      placebo
      (likely
      due
      to
      the
      nocebo
      effect),
      showed
      no
      statistically
      significant
      differences,
      or
      experienced
      a
      worse
      response
      to
      the
      rice
      starch
      pill!
      In
      other
      words,
      the
      researchers
      identified
      only
      nine
      subjects
      who
      they
      suspected
      might
      actually
      be
      sensitive
      to
      gluten".

      A
      skeptical
      discussion
      of
      the
      study
      can
      be
      found
      [here](https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/organic-vs-conventional-meat-and-milk/).
      A
      key
      facet
      to
      note:
      The
      authors
      of
      the
      analysis
      believe
      the
      nutritional
      differences
      they
      found
      can
      be
      attributed
      to
      whether
      or
      not
      the
      animals
      producing
      the
      meat/milk
      were
      grass-fed.
      This
      prompted
      the
      author
      of
      the
      piece
      linked
      above
      to
      comment:
      "That
      is
      the
      real
      variable
      here,
      not
      organic
      vs
      conventional.
      Grass
      fed
      conventional
      meat
      and
      milk
      has
      the
      same
      profile
      as
      grass-fed
      organic.
      It
      is
      therefore
      deceptive,
      in
      my
      opinion,
      to
      frame
      this
      difference
      as
      organic
      vs
      conventional
      when
      it
      is
      clearly
      grass-fed
      vs
      grain-fed."

      For
      clarification,
      the
      caucus
      volunteers
      resorted
      to
      the
      Coors
      Light
      box
      after
      running
      out
      of
      the
      original
      boxes.
      My
      precinct,
      as
      well
      as
      many
      others
      in
      my
      home
      state,
      had
      unexpectedly
      high
      turnout
      this
      year.
      So
      I'd
      say
      that
      this
      situation
      --
      while
      not
      optimal
      --
      represented
      something
      right
      with
      our
      election
      system.

      I
      think
      it
      means
      that
      supplementation
      may
      raise
      your
      blood
      testosterone
      levels,
      but
      there
      may
      not
      be
      any
      noticeable
      improvements
      in
      physical
      or
      emotional
      outcomes.
      Sure
      you
      may
      have
      slightly
      higher
      testosterone
      levels,
      but
      that
      won't
      translate
      to
      actual
      results
      in
      your
      everyday
      health.

      It
      means
      that
      some
      studies
      in
      the
      review
      showed
      that
      testosterone
      helped,
      while
      others
      did
      not.
      When
      clinical
      trials
      give
      mixed
      or
      "inconsistent"
      results
      like
      this
      it's
      a

      the

      they're

      if
      that's

      In

      of
      the
      review's
      results,
      the

      note
      that
      less
      than
      half
      of
      the
      studies
      that
      assessed
      strength
      showed
      improvements.
      They
      went
      on
      to
      say:
      "In
      summary,
      the
      majority
      of
      studies
      show
      increased
      muscle
      mass
      but
      no
      effect
      of
      testosterone
      on
      muscle
      strength
      or

      While
      I
      don't
      usually
      like
      posting
      political
      links
      to
      /r/skeptic,
      I
      think
      the
      Orwellian
      term
      "alternative
      facts"
      merits
      discussion.
      This
      may
      not
      be
      the
      last
      time
      we
      hear
      it.
      Seems
      to
      me
      that
      "alternative
      facts"
      is
      a
      euphemism
      for
      "bullshit."

      The

      refer
      to
      it
      as
      a
      "repulsion

      but
      I
      prefer
      to
      look
      at
      the

      Stuff
      near

      void
      will
      roll
      down

      away
      from
      it.
      In
      this
      case,
      our
      Local
      Group
      is
      rolling
      away
      from
      the
      "hill"
      and
      towards
      a
      "valley"
      (or
      depression)
      in
      spacetime
      created
      by
      the

      I
      can

      you
      that
      we
      are
      very
      ideologically
      diverse.
      Two
      libertarians
      and

      liberal.
      SciAm
      wasn't
      placed
      entirely
      in
      green
      because
      their
      coverage
      has
      trended
      towards
      a
      liberal
      bias
      of
      late
      --
      especially
      in

      section
      --
      compared
      to
      the
      higher
      ranked
      sites.
      In
      the
      past,
      they've
      also
      had
      issues
      with
      stifling
      writers
      who
      aren't
      perfectly
      politically
      correct.

      The
      rankings
      went
      through
      eight
      iterations
      over

      the

      ending

      being

      a

      Good
      question.
      The
      issue
      you
      raise
      points
      to
      what
      I
      consider
      to
      be
      somewhat
      of
      a
      fallback
      in
      our
      methods:
      "compelling"
      is
      a
      very
      subjective
      measure.
      What's
      compelling
      to
      some
      is
      not
      compelling
      to
      others.
      For
      our
      rankings,
      we
      took
      compelling
      to
      mean
      two
      things:
      1.
      Is
      the
      science
      presented
      so
      that
      a
      general
      audience
      could
      understand
      it?
      2.
      Are
      the
      stories
      timely,
      quality,
      and
      of
      broad,
      general
      interest?

      Obviously
      that
      makes
      it
      tougher
      to
      take
      everything
      into
      account.
      But
      what
      we
      look
      for
      is
      that
      content
      is
      clearly
      demarcated
      into
      op-eds
      and
      news,
      versus
      blending
      the
      two
      into
      a
      distorted
      representation
      of
      science.

      Yes.

      It
      seems
      it

      have
      some
      effect,
      though
      it's
      not
      extremely
      well
      studied.
      From
      the
      paper:
      "It
      has
      been
      demonstrated
      in
      praying
      mantis,
      crickets
      and
      honeybees
      that
      morphine
      injection
      reduces
      their
      defensive
      response
      to
      a
      noxious
      stimulus
      in
      a
      dose-dependent

      and
      that
      this
      analgesic
      effect
      can
      be
      blocked
      by
      naloxone.
      These
      studies
      suggest
      that
      insects
      have
      opiate
      binding
      sites
      or
      opioid
      general
      sensitivity
      similar
      to
      vertebrates,
      or,
      alternatively,
      non-opioid
      receptors
      to
      which
      morphine
      binds."

      My
      mistake.
      :(
      Misread
      this
      statement.
      Turned
      out
      the
      author
      was
      referring
      to
      the
      Messinian
      salinity
      crisis:
      "In
      the
      Mediterranean
      region,
      the
      crisis
      was
      caused
      by
      the
      closure
      of
      what
      today
      is
      known
      as
      the
      strait
      of
      Gibraltar,
      cutting
      the
      passage
      between
      the
      sea
      and
      the
      Atlantic
      Ocean.
      This
      occurred
      around
      six
      million
      years

      More
      information!
      My
      company
      is
      called
      Nomi
      (https://www.nomisnacks.com/)
      and
      we're
      based
      in
      Minneapolis.
      We
      recently
      just
      rebranded
      from
      Fresh
      Bar
      and
      have
      at
      least
      10,000
      bars
      leftover
      with
      our
      old
      branding.
      We've
      tried
      to
      give
      them
      away
      to
      food
      shelves
      but
      have
      found
      this
      surprisingly
      difficult.
      Since
      our
      bars
      are
      not
      dried
      and
      don't
      use
      preservatives,
      they
      must
      be
      refrigerated
      or
      frozen,
      and
      a
      lot
      of
      food
      shelves
      don't
      want
      non-produce
      refrigerated
      goods.
      So
      I'm
      reaching
      out
      to
      r/TwinCities
      to
      help
      our
      company
      do
      something
      good!
      The
      bars
      are
      great
      for
      a
      breakfast
      or
      snack
      and
      stay
      good
      outside
      the
      fridge
      for
      roughly
      3
      days.
      Where
      can
      we
      donate
      a
      bunch
      of
      these
      snack
      bars
      so
      they
      can
      do
      some
      real
      good?
      Thanks
      for
      your
      help!

      Good
      question!
      What's
      also
      fascinating
      is
      that
      aerobic
      exercise
      doesn't
      seem
      to
      affect
      cancer
      survivability
      nearly
      as
      much
      as
      resistance
      exercise.
      Could
      it
      have
      to
      do
      with
      the
      mechanical
      action
      on
      the
      tumor(s)?
      Or
      perhaps
      the
      different
      effects
      on
      body
      tissues?

      at
      Mankato
      West
      where
      he
      used

      Marched
      in
      about
      a
      dozen
      parades
      for
      him
      when
      he
      ran
      for
      Congress
      the
      first
      time.
      Walz
      is
      as
      genuine
      and
      honest
      as
      politicians

      and
      will

      regulate,
      grow
      it
      in
      Minnesota,
      release

      with
      a
      previous
      marijuana

      and

      A

      had
      cavities
      in
      its

      likely
      from

      a

      rich
      in
      fruits.

      Not
      a
      fan
      of
      Jeff
      Davis,
      but
      I
      have
      seen
      Ken
      Burns'
      The
      Civil
      War
      many
      times,
      and
      this
      story
      isn't
      true.
      Read
      the
      full
      article:
      "The
      story
      of
      Davis
      in
      women #8217;s
      clothing
      traveled
      quickly
      to
      the
      ears
      of
      Edwin
      Stanton,
      the
      Secretary
      of
      War.
      Stanton
      recognized
      the
      story
      as
      an
      opportunity
      to
      discredit
      Davis,
      who
      still
      had
      numerous
      sympathizers
      throughout
      the
      country.
      Historians
      [have
      noted](https://books.google.com/books?id=Uv3DBwAAQBAJ amp;pg=PT144 amp;dq=jefferson+davis+women%27s+clothes amp;hl=en amp;sa=X amp;ved=0ahUKEwizh-WX16HOAhVBJiYKHUa4AgU4ChDoAQhFMAc#v=onepage amp;q amp;f=false)

      the
      North
      gendered
      its
      victory
      as
      masculine
      and
      heroic
      and,
      in
      contrast,
      portrayed
      the
      South
      as
      feminine
      and
      weak.
      Davis #8217;s
      flight
      played
      into
      that
      narrative,
      portraying
      the
      Southern
      leader
      as
      a
      coward
      willing
      to
      emasculate
      himself
      in
      order
      to
      escape.
      In
      short,
      manly
      martyrs

      and

      More
      details
      from
      [American
      Heritage](https://www.americanheritage.com/content/was-jefferson-davis-captured-dress):
      "The
      arrival
      in
      Washington
      of
      the
      so-called
      petticoats
      proved
      to
      be
      a
      big
      letdown.
      When
      Stanton
      saw
      the
      clothes,
      he
      knew
      instantly
      that
      Davis
      had
      not
      disguised
      himself
      in
      a
      woman #8217;s
      hoop
      skirt
      and
      bonnet.
      The
       #8220;dress #8221;
      was
      nothing
      more
      than
      a
      loose-fitting,
      waterproof
      raglan
      or
      overcoat,
      a
      garment
      as
      suited
      for
      a
      man
      as
      a
      woman.
      The
       #8220;bonnet #8221;
      was
      a
      rectangular
      shawl,
      a
      type
      of
      wrap
      President
      Lincoln
      himself
      had
      worn
      on
      chilly
      evenings.
      Stanton
      dared
      not
      allow
      Barnum
      to
      exhibit
      these
      relics
      in
      his
      museum.
      Public
      viewing
      would
      expose
      the
      lie
      that
      Davis
      had
      worn
      one
      of
      his
      wife #8217;s
      dresses.
      Instead
      Stanton
      sequestered
      the
      disappointing
      textiles
      to
      perpetuate
      the
      myth
      that
      the
      cowardly
       #8220;rebel
      chief #8221;
      had
      tried
      to
      run
      away
      in
      his
      wife #8217;s
      clothes."

      I
      am
      the
      author!
      Sorry
      about
      my
      face.
      I
      believe
      it #8217;s
      because
      the
      original
      top
      image
      was
      wiped
      when
      our
      tech
      team
      moved
      all
      our
      old
      blog
      posts
      to
      a
      new
      CMS
      and
      they
      never
      replaced
      the
      photos.
      Looks
      like
      the
      thumbnail
      defaulted
      to
      my
      bio
      photo.
      Thanks
      for
      posting
      my
      article!
      I #8217;m
      so
      glad
      you
      enjoyed
      learning
      about
      spiders.
      They
      are
      truly
      amazing
      critters.
      Regarding
      another
      comment,
      I
      definitely
      don #8217;t
      advocate
      crushing
      them,
      though
      I
      can
      totally
      see
      how
      the
      expression
      on
      my
      face
      looks
      like
      one
      a
      deranged
      spider
      crusher
      might
      have.
      Also,
      it
      was
      really
      pleasant
      to
      wake
      up
      and
      see
      all
      the
      nice/funny
      things
      said
      about
      my
      face.
      Another
      reason
      I
      love
      Reddit!

      here!
      Just
      want
      to
      make
      it
      clear
      that
      I
      do
      not
      advocate
      crushing
      spiders.
      My

      spider #8221;
      but
      my
      heart
      says
      leave
      them
      alone
      to
      fulfill
      their
      vital
      ecological
      roles,
      which
      includes
      eating
      mosquitoes!

      I
      LOVE
      my
      Farm
      Plus.
      Looks
      great
      in
      my
      living
      room!
      But
      with
      that
      said,
      I
      probably
      only
      needed
      the
      farm,
      at
      least
      for
      lettuce
      and
      tomatoes.
      I
      would
      definitely
      recommend
      at
      least
      a
      Farm
      or
      Bounty
      to
      get
      the
      touch
      screen.
      It's
      very
      slick
      and
      provides
      a
      lot
      of
      helpful
      guides/tips
      to
      perfect
      your
      indoor
      garden.

      Had
      similarly
      amazing
      results
      with
      my
      Farm
      Plus.
      My
      biggest
      tips:
       #8203;
      For
      tomatoes,
      keep
      them
      well
      watered,
      and
      remove
      any
      dead
      or
      dry
      branches
      or
      leaves.
      Don't
      be
      afraid
      to
      prune.
      Also,
      perform
      the
      "[topping](https://www.aerogarden.com/aerogarden-customer-service-support/pruning-tomatoes-at-4-5-weeks.html)"
      trim
      that
      Aerogarden
      recommends.
      Also,
      make
      sure
      to
      pollinate
      your
      flowers!
      Some
      light
      tapping
      1-2x
      a
      day
      does
      the
      trip
      beautifully.
      I
      now
      have
      over
      100x
      tomatoes
      on
      my
      12
      plants.
      They're
      finally
      ripening
      now.
       #8203;
      For

      I
      harvest
      around
      3x
      a

      I
      also

      draining
      every

      some
      conservatives
      would
      rationalize
      Trump's
      blatantly
      racist
      comments.
      Here's
      one
      completely
      boneheaded
      example
      from
      Matt
      Wolking,
      the
      deputy
      director
      of
      communications
      for
      Trump's
      2020
      reelection
      campaign:
      "Anyone
      who
      says

      told
      members
      of

      back
      to
      where
      they
      came
      from
      is
      lying.
      He
      told
      them
      to
       #8220;Then
      come
      back
      and
      show

      how

      the
      function
      of
      zebras'
      stripes
      are
      to
      deter
      insects,
      so
      a
      team
      of
      researchers
      painted
      black
      and
      white
      stripes
      on
      cows.
      They
      found
      that
      it
      reduced
      the
      number
      of
      biting
      flies
      landing
      on
      the
      cows
      by
      more
      than
      50%.

      Also
      really
      cool
      from
      the
      article:
      "The
      cattle
      industry
      commonly
      sprays
      pesticides
      to
      combat
      biting
      flies,
      but
      the
      researchers
      say
      that
      painting
      stripes
      with
      non-toxic
      materials
      could
      be
      cheaper,
      healthier
      for
      livestock,
      and
      better
      for
      the
      environment."
