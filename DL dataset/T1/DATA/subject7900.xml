      Thanks
      for
      your
      comment,
      and
      it
      rhymes
      pretty
      good
      with
      my
      experience
      as
      well.
      The
      cat
      painting
      in
      the
      link
      is
      the
      one
      that
      has
      gotten
      most
      of
      the
      attention,
      and
      I've
      now
      sold
      two
      of
      it,
      which
      is
      great.
      I've
      also
      sold
      a
      huge
      oil
      portrait
      as
      well,
      which
      was
      super
      fun
      to
      do.
      I'll
      see
      if
      I
      can
      find
      a
      nice

      Why
      the
      "Kathy"
      story
      makes
      more
      sense
      if
      Adnan
      is
      innocent

      So
      the
      story
      is
      that
      a
      girl
      has
      a
      friend
      come
      over
      later
      in
      the
      evening,
      he
      brings
      a
      friend
      with
      him
      which
      the
      girl
      doesn't
      know.
      At
      one
      point,
      this
      friend
      gets
      a
      call
      that
      seems
      to
      really
      upset
      him,
      make
      him
      nervous,
      saying
      things
      like
      "What
      am
      I
      going
      to
      do?"
      and
      "They're
      going
      to
      call
      me,
      what
      am
      I
      going
      to
      say?"
      and
      things
      like
      that.
      Her
      friend
      later
      says
      it
      was
      nothing,
      seemingly
      trying
      to
      downplay
      the
      supposed
      importance
      of
      the
      call.
      If
      he's
      guilty
      So,
      if
      Adnan
      is
      guilty,
      this
      call
      makes
      no
      sense
      as
      told.
      If
      the
      call
      is
      supposedly
      someone
      calling
      him
      to
      warn
      about
      the
      police
      looking
      for
      him
      (a
      co-conspiritor),
      then
      why
      would
      he
      react
      this
      way?
      If
      he's
      guilty,
      he
      would
      totally
      be
      expecting
      the
      police
      to
      contact
      him,
      being
      the
      ex-boyfriend
      and
      all.
      He
      wouldn't
      be
      surprised
      or
      aggravated
      about
      it
      over
      the
      phone.
      Plus,
      if
      he's
      guilty,
      the
      last
      thing
      he
      would
      probably
      do
      was
      talk
      nervously
      about
      events
      concerning
      the
      murder
      in
      a
      place
      where
      he
      can
      be
      overheard,
      right?
      I
      mean,
      if
      someone
      did
      call
      him
      to
      warn
      about
      the
      police,
      he's
      more
      likely
      to
      play
      it
      cool,
      act
      normal
      etc
      etc
      during
      the
      call,
      in
      order
      not
      to
      raise
      unnecessary
      suspicion.
      If
      he's
      innocent
      In
      a
      scenario
      where
      he
      is
      innocent
      of
      the
      crime,
      this
      call
      makes
      perfect
      sense.
      He
      is
      high,
      he
      gets
      a
      call,
      and
      he
      is
      upset,
      nervous,
      jittery
      about
      something
      on
      the
      phone.
      How
      many
      haven't
      overheard
      one
      side
      of
      a
      phone
      conversation
      where
      what
      you
      heard
      makes
      you
      think
      something
      really
      important
      or
      ominous
      is
      going
      on
      while
      it
      may
      not
      be
      that
      important
      of
      significant
      at
      all,
      really?
      You
      could
      probably
      make
      up
      a
      hundred
      different
      conversations
      that
      would
      have
      a
      totally
      innocent
      person
      responding
      and
      reacting
      the
      way
      he
      did.
      It's
      only
      after
      he
      was
      charged
      with
      murder
      that
      this
      call
      somehow
      became
      laden
      with
      meaning
      to
      Kathy,
      but
      it
      still
      would
      require
      Adnan
      to
      be
      a
      complete
      idiot
      for
      it
      to
      actually
      have
      been
      this
      way.

      How
      do
      you
      figure?
      Kathy's
      testimony
      sort
      of
      hinges
      of
      her
      remembering
      him
      sounding
      very
      "worried"
      and
      "concerned"

      that
      it
      wasn't
      "normal
      behavior
      for
      anybody".
      Doesn't
      sound

      someone
      telling
      a
      story
      about
      someone
      acting

      Yeah?
      Not
      sure
      what
      your
      point
      here
      is.
      If
      he's
      innocent,
      would
      he
      be
      screaming
      at
      the
      cops?
      He
      just
      got
      news
      that
      his
      ex
      girlfriend
      is
      missing,
      and
      according
      to
      himself
      his
      first
      thought
      was
      that
      SHE
      was
      in
      so
      much
      trouble,
      not
      that
      he
      was
      (or
      would
      be).
      Either
      way,
      this
      post
      was
      about
      Cathy's
      story.
      Can't
      remember
      reading/hearing
      anything
      about
      what
      demeanor
      he
      had
      during
      the
      call
      with
      the
      cops.

      Well,
      if
      Jay
      is
      being
      involved
      in
      a
      third
      party
      and
      is
      bullied
      to
      framing
      someone,
      the
      logical
      choice
      is
      for
      the
      guy
      whose
      car
      and
      phone
      he
      is
      currently
      in
      possession
      of.
      At
      the
      time,
      he
      may
      not
      have
      an
      exact
      timeline
      in
      mind,
      but
      all
      he
      knows
      is
      that
      he
      needs
      to
      pick
      up
      Adnan
      after
      track
      and
      make
      sure
      they
      drive
      around
      the
      rest
      of
      the
      evening
      smoking
      weed
      to
      make
      sure
      that
      Adnan
      wouldn't
      remember
      most
      of
      the
      evening.
      The
      actual
      time
      of
      the
      murder
      need
      not
      happen
      at
      a
      time
      where
      Adnan
      might
      possibly
      have
      an
      alibi,
      but
      when
      Jay
      sees
      the
      call
      logs
      and
      are
      asked
      by
      the
      detectives,
      he
      molds
      the
      story
      to
      fit
      the
      call
      logs
      as

      were
      without

      for
      way
      too
      long.

      I
      actually
      first
      ordered
      the
      floor
      tiles
      for
      an
      area
      to
      only
      cover
      the
      floor
      area
      not
      covered
      by
      the
      kitchen
      unit,
      suggested
      by
      the
      wife.
      But
      then
      I
      decided
      against
      it
      and
      put
      the
      tiles
      everywhere
      but
      I
      must
      have
      used
      the
      old
      calculation
      when
      ordering.

      IKEA
      is
      pretty

      Husqvarna
      is

      the
      makeover
      came

      Oh,
      and
      about
      earlier
      skills.
      I
      actually
      did
      a
      similar
      makeover
      to
      our
      last
      house
      as
      well,
      albeit
      not
      as
      big.
      This
      was
      the
      first
      time
      I
      ripped
      out
      a
      bath
      room
      :)

      Yeah
      it's
      a
      bit
      oddly
      placed.
      I
      rather
      have
      in
      the
      living
      room.
      But
      it
      was
      there
      when
      we
      moved
      in
      and
      moving
      it
      is
      apparently
      a
      pretty
      costly
      thing
      :)

      So,
      you're
      probably
      right,
      but
      I'm
      from
      Sweden
      so
      I
      didn't
      know
      :)
      Also,
      I
      am
      very
      strong
      :)

      But
      to

      honest,
      "kitchen

      sounds
      a

      Yeah,
      someone

      pointed
      that
      out.
      The
      Swedish

      "k #246;ksb #228;nk"
      translates
      to
      "kitchen

      You're
      probably
      right.
      The
      house
      is
      from
      the
      seventies,
      and
      the
      original
      kitchen
      frames
      were
      definitely
      still
      in
      place,
      but
      at
      some
      point
      some
      previous
      owner
      probably
      changed
      the
      fronts
      and
      counter.
      Still,
      crap
      stuff.
      :)

      I
      hear
      you.
      But
      we
      had
      three
      bathrooms
      and
      now
      we
      have
      two.
      In
      a
      family
      with
      two
      kids,
      that's
      plenty
      enough
      for
      us

      Seriously
      though,
      I
      do
      my
      best
      not
      to
      bring
      it
      up,
      since
      it
      makes
      her
      feel
      bad.
      But
      a
      life
      without
      sex
      is
      pretty
      hard
      sometimes...
      Pun
      intended.
      A
      small
      explanation
      might
      be
      in
      order.
      My
      wife
      is
      pretty
      much
      asexual,
      meaning
      that
      there
      is
      nothing
      that
      seems
      to
      arouse
      her.
      We've
      talked
      about
      it
      many
      times,
      but
      she
      can't
      change
      herself
      and
      how
      her
      body
      works.
      It
      wasn't
      always
      this
      way,
      of
      course,
      but
      we're
      at
      an
      all-time
      low
      right
      now...

      I
      would
      do
      that
      if
      I
      could.
      But
      I
      get
      turned
      down
      all
      the
      time

      Fair
      enough.
      There
      is
      no
      shortage
      of
      intimacy
      in
      terms
      of
      hugs,
      kisses
      and
      touching.
      And
      I've
      been
      reluctant
      to
      bring
      up
      therapy
      since
      I
      fear
      it
      would
      put
      pressure
      on
      her

      I've
      had
      this
      baby
      for
      a
      while
      now,
      and
      I'e
      started
      to
      shoot
      at
      18MP
      most
      of
      the
      time
      for
      the
      sheer
      reason
      that
      42MP
      files
      are
      freaking
      monsters
      to
      deal
      with,
      even
      on
      a
      fast
      computer.
      I
      do
      go
      back
      to
      raw
      42
      when
      shooting
      something
      of
      "importance"
      so
      to
      speak,
      but
      for
      normal
      day
      to
      day
      shooting,
      I
      usually
      use
      the
      lower
      resolutions
      and
      miss
      out
      on
      RAW.
      I
      really
      wish
      I
      could
      use
      RAW
      and
      lower
      resolution.

      I
      use
      it
      a
      lot,

      I
      love

      It's
      a

      wide
      open,
      which
      is
      to
      be
      expected.
      Most
      of
      the
      time
      I
      use
      it
      a
      0.95
      since
      that's
      why
      I
      bought
      it.
      Here
      are
      [some

      Only
      drawback
      of
      the
      lens
      is
      that
      it's
      really
      heavy
      for
      its
      size,
      being
      all-metal
      with
      huge
      glass
      in
      it.

      Not
      sure
      there
      is
      an
      "advantage"
      so
      to
      speak.
      I
      like
      that
      it's
      only
      16MP,
      I
      have
      a
      D800E
      and
      a
      Sony
      A/R
      II
      with
      36
      and
      42MP
      respectively
      and
      while
      it's
      great
      to
      have
      that
      kind
      of
      resolution
      at
      your
      disposal,
      you
      rarely
      ever
      actually
      need
      it
      unless
      you're
      doing
      professional
      portrait
      photography
      or
      something
      like
      that.
      I
      rarely
      shoot
      RAW
      with
      my
      Df,
      and
      I
      have
      a
      few
      image
      profiles
      set
      up
      to
      mimic
      a
      more
      retro
      camera,
      and
      that's
      what
      it
      is,
      a
      nostalgic
      throwback
      to
      another
      era
      where
      photography
      was
      ore
      hands-on
      and
      I
      for
      one
      love
      it.

      The

      Right,
      the

      just
      a
      style
      so
      to
      speak.

      Manual
      lenses
      with
      Sony

      I
      have
      a
      few
      manual
      lenses
      that
      I
      use
      with
      my
      Sony
      A7
      RII,
      most
      notably
      the
      Mitakon
      50mm/f0.95
      which
      I
      really
      like.
      Now,
      when
      using
      this
      lens
      I
      get
      no
      lens
      data
      at
      all
      in
      my
      EXIF.
      But
      when
      I
      use
      manual
      lenses
      with
      my
      Nikon,
      I
      can
      enter
      manual
      lens
      profiles,
      so
      when
      I
      mount
      my
      Nikon
      28mm/f2.8
      and
      select
      it
      as
      my
      non-CPU
      lens,
      I
      don't
      get
      a
      lens
      ID
      in
      the
      EXIF,
      but
      the
      correct
      focal
      length
      and
      aperture
      is
      recorded.
      Is
      there
      a
      way
      to
      handle
      manual
      lenses
      in
      the
      Sony
      A7
      in
      the
      same
      way?
      EDIT:
      I
      don't
      mean
      adapted
      lenses
      from
      Nikon/Canon/etc,
      I
      mean
      native
      manual
      non-CPU
      lenses

      Just
      received
      my
      K3
      focusing
      screen
      from
      focusingscreen.com.
      It
      installed
      super
      easy
      using
      nothing
      but
      a
      pair
      of
      pliers.
      And
      now
      focusing
      with
      a
      manual
      lens
      is
      just
      as
      easy
      as
      it
      should
      be.
      The
      split
      screen
      makes
      it
      as
      accurate
      as
      the
      built-in
      focusing
      (which
      continues
      to
      work
      flawlessly
      as
      well).
      I.e.
      you
      still
      get
      the
      dot
      when
      the
      subject
      is
      in
      focus.
      You
      can
      even
      tell
      the
      Df
      to
      hide
      the
      focusing
      spot
      (overlaid
      rectangle
      on
      current
      focusing
      point
      in
      finder)
      when
      a
      manual
      lens
      is
      attached,
      which
      works
      amazingly.
      There
      are
      two
      metal
      frames
      inside
      the
      Df,
      and
      there
      are
      two
      rubber
      frames
      included
      with
      the
      focusing
      screen,
      adding
      the
      two
      rubber
      frames
      made
      the
      AF
      work
      flawlessly,
      both
      with
      non-AF
      and
      AF
      lenses.
      This,
      combined
      with
      true
      aperture
      ring
      support
      and
      turning
      off
      chimping/preview,
      makes
      the
      Df
      act
      and
      feel
      very
      much
      like
      a
      nostalgic
      piece
      of
      camera,
      and
      it's
      a
      joy
      to
      use.

      Now,
      I've
      not
      actually
      seen
      the
      new
      movie,
      but
      when
      it
      was
      announced,
      I
      talked
      about
      how
      to
      make
      a
      reboot/sequel
      to
      the
      GB
      universe
      instead
      of
      what
      I
      saw
      in
      the
      trailer.
      Just
      a
      few
      thoughts:
      1.
      Make
      it
      a
      sequel,
      not
      a
      reboot.
      I've
      heard
      conflicting
      information
      about
      whether
      or
      not
      this
      is
      set
      30
      years
      into
      the
      future
      of
      events
      that
      occurred
      or
      if
      it's
      just
      setting
      it
      up
      where
      the
      earlier
      events
      never
      happened,
      having
      not
      seen
      the
      film,
      I'm
      unsure.
      Either
      way,
      the
      story
      should
      be
      that
      30
      years
      ago,
      there
      were
      paranormal
      events
      in
      NY
      that
      is
      partly
      a
      myth,
      partly
      covered
      up,
      partly
      hearsay.
      Some
      people
      remember
      the
      strange
      things,
      the
      government
      tries
      to
      cover
      it
      up
      but
      since
      nothing
      else
      has
      happened
      in
      30
      years,
      no
      one
      is
      100%
      sure
      just
      what
      happened,
      even
      though
      there
      are
      many
      eyewitness
      accounts
      of
      a
      huge
      stay
      puft
      marshmallow
      man
      (parade
      ballon
      exploding,
      according
      to
      the
      government
      etc
      etc).
      2.
      Make
      the
      cast
      the
      offspring
      of
      the
      four
      ghost
      busters.
      It's
      a
      good
      way
      to
      throw
      in
      some
      diversity
      if
      that's
      what
      you
      really
      want.
      The
      daughter
      of
      Venkman
      is
      scientist
      working
      with
      occult
      stuff,
      the
      son
      of
      Ray
      is
      a
      hippie
      that
      loathe
      that
      story
      from
      back
      then
      and
      all
      the
      questions
      from
      reporters
      etc
      etc.
      3.
      The
      storyline
      is
      that
      30
      years
      later,
      Gozer
      is
      back
      or
      something
      like
      that.
      Venkman's
      daughter
      is
      the
      only
      one
      that
      has
      kept
      up
      with
      this
      stuff
      to
      even
      begin
      to
      understand
      it
      but
      still
      needs
      information
      from
      her
      father,
      and
      there
      are
      some
      cameos
      by
      the
      original
      cast
      when
      she
      tries
      to
      hunt
      them
      down
      for
      more
      information.
      4.
      When
      things
      get
      serious,
      the
      government
      is
      actually
      drafting
      the
      original
      cast
      as
      per
      some
      earlier
      contract
      if
      it
      should
      happen
      again,
      but
      since
      Venkman
      is
      a
      loon,
      Spengler
      can't
      be
      found
      etc
      etc,
      they
      move
      down
      to
      their
      kids
      saying
      that
      they
      need
      to
      get
      together
      and
      fix
      this,
      of
      anyone,
      they're
      the
      ones
      that
      supposedly
      would
      know
      best
      what
      to
      do.
      5.
      So
      instead
      of
      a
      well
      knit
      group,
      they're
      people
      that
      may
      or
      may
      not
      have
      met
      in
      the
      past,
      with
      the
      common
      denominator
      that
      they
      all
      heard
      from
      their
      parents
      about
      this
      ghost
      events
      in
      the
      past.
      So
      (reluctantly
      for
      some)
      they
      need
      to
      quickly
      piece
      together
      information,
      archive
      footage,
      technology
      (which
      has
      been
      taken
      and
      kept
      by
      the
      government
      and
      some
      by
      the
      original
      cast).
      They
      are
      faced
      with
      technology
      "upgrades"
      made
      by
      the
      government
      that
      may
      or
      may
      not
      work,
      and
      a
      lot
      of
      pressure
      from
      this
      super
      secret
      govt
      division
      and
      they
      can't
      tell
      local
      police
      anything
      until
      they
      know
      more
      what
      to
      do
      with
      the
      situation.
      6.
      Character
      development
      is
      that
      each
      offspring
      has
      it's
      own
      different
      level
      of
      distrust
      in
      what
      happened,
      the
      government,
      the
      technology
      or
      ghosts
      in
      general.
      Venkman's
      daughter
      is
      the
      main
      driving
      force,
      and
      in
      spite
      of
      malfunctioning
      tech
      from
      the
      govt,
      inexperience
      with
      pretty
      much
      everything,
      after
      a
      few
      failures
      to
      successes
      (think
      slimer
      hotel
      scene)
      they
      start
      to
      get
      a
      hang
      of
      it
      and
      starts
      to
      actually
      work
      as
      a
      good
      team
      catching
      ghosts.
      7.
      As
      for
      major
      challenges,
      the
      first
      is
      to
      get
      everything
      working,
      testing
      it.
      Second
      is
      their
      first
      ghost
      hunt
      which
      turns
      on
      them
      badly
      due
      to
      malfunctioning
      equipment
      and
      really
      scaring
      them
      out
      of
      their
      mind.
      8.
      Turning
      point
      is
      when
      they
      finally
      get
      a
      hold
      on
      Ray,
      whose
      son
      has
      no
      idea
      where
      he
      has
      been
      for
      the
      last
      decade.
      Finally
      some
      form
      of
      information
      is
      found
      that
      makes
      them
      being
      able
      to
      face
      the
      escalating
      threat
      9.
      Crescendo
      is
      when
      Gozer
      appears,
      recognizing
      the
      ghost
      busters
      from
      before
      and
      instead
      of
      facing
      them
      on
      their
      term,
      drags
      them
      into
      the
      twilight
      zone/para-universe/whatever
      and
      they're
      totally
      cut
      off
      from
      everyone
      else,
      and
      it's
      up
      to
      them
      to
      defeat
      Gozer
      using
      nothing
      but
      smarts
      and
      the
      now
      working
      tech.

      lowers
      the
      signal-to-noise
      ratio
      and
      you
      get
      noise
      (grain)
      in
      the
      resulting
      image.

      The
      iris
      doesn't
      change
      the
      focal
      length
      (the
      depth)
      of
      the
      eye,
      only
      the
      "aperture"
      which
      let's
      in
      light.
      So
      the
      field
      of
      view
      is
      always
      the
      same.

      It
      would
      become
      darker,
      yes,
      but
      no
      "ring",
      it
      would
      be
      exactly
      the
      same
      as
      if
      your
      iris
      did
      not
      open
      the
      pupil
      "enough".
      The
      lens
      inside
      the
      eye
      is
      behind
      the
      pupil
      and
      will
      focus
      whatever
      light
      it
      lets
      through
      back
      to
      your
      retina
      at
      the
      back
      of
      your
      eye.
      So
      even
      if
      the
      pupil
      is
      opened
      up
      larger,
      if
      that
      light
      is
      blocked
      by
      other
      means
      it
      will
      be
      the
      same
      as
      if
      the
      pupil
      didn't
      open
      up
      enough.

      No,
      the
      iris
      only
      closes
      and
      opens
      the
      pupil,
      the
      ciliary
      muscle
      behind
      the
      iris
      is
      what
      helps
      you
      focus
      on
      things
      by
      changing
      the
      shape
      of
      the
      lens.
      If
      you
      know
      of
      anything
      about
      camera
      lenses,
      the
      pupil
      is
      the
      aperture
      opening
      and
      the
      iris
      is
      the
      aperture
      blades.
      The
      ciliary
      muscles
      is
      the
      mechanism
      that
      moves
      the
      focusing
      lenses
      inside
      the
      lens
      to
      focus
      the
      image.

      Apart
      from
      the
      other
      answers,
      lunch
      guests
      occupy
      a
      table
      for
      a
      shorter
      period
      of
      time
      than
      dinner
      guests.
      Also,
      during
      lunch,
      there
      is
      usually
      a
      lot
      more
      guests
      moving
      through
      the
      seats,
      making
      up
      for
      the
      lower
      price.
      Dinner
      guests
      usually
      sit
      longer,
      blocking
      the
      seats
      so
      fewer
      guests
      can
      be
      admitted
      to
      the
      restaurant.

      That's
      the
      point.
      With
      the
      crop
      factor
      you
      have
      to
      take
      a
      step
      back
      from
      the

      which
      increases
      the
      distance,
      and
      thus
      the
      distortion.

      Late
      reply
      here.
      I
      get
      your
      idea,
      and
      it
      would
      probably
      be
      really
      neat.
      But
      we
      love
      Myst
      because
      it
      isn't
      random,
      because
      we
      know
      that
      there
      is
      a
      deep
      meaning
      behind
      most
      of
      what
      you
      can
      see
      in
      the
      game.
      Something
      randomly
      generated
      will
      have
      no
      direction,
      no
      purpose
      -
      especially
      in
      the
      scale
      you're
      talking
      about.

      A
      decade
      ago,
      I
      wrote
      this
      idea
      for
      how
      to
      "save"
      Uru

      Basically,
      I
      wanted
      a
      game
      that
      took
      the
      great
      parts
      of
      the
      Myst
      games
      and
      the
      great
      parts
      of
      Uru
      and
      merged
      them.
      I
      called
      it
      Uru
      ReLive
      (for
      some
      reason)
      and
      the
      basic
      idea
      was
      that
      instead
      of
      it
      being
      a
      MMORPG,
      it
      was
      a
      standalone
      game
      where
      you
      could
      host
      a
      session
      for
      your
      friends.
      So
      no
      server
      costs
      for
      Cyan.
      You
      can
      read
      about
      it
      here:
      http://jonaseklundh.se/pages/HowToMakeUrumystShineAgain
      Reading
      it
      again
      -
      damn,
      I
      still
      want
      this
      game.

      It's
      not
      their
      fault.
      Unreal
      Engine
      4
      is
      a
      bit
      lacking
      on
      the
      Mac,
      unfortunately.
      In
      short
      -
      if
      you
      want
      to
      play
      games,
      get
      a
      PC.
      Or
      boot
      up
      Windows
      via
      Boot
      Camp
      and
      use
      the
      PC
      version
      of
      Unreal
      Engine
      on
      your
      Mac,
      provided
      you
      have
      the
      necessary
      specs
      on
      your
      Mac.
      I'm
      a
      Mac
      user
      myself,
      but
      I
      also
      have
      a
      kickass
      gaming
      PC
      for
      these
      occasions

      During
      a
      nights
      sleep
      you
      go
      through
      different
      "phases"
      of
      sleep
      with
      different
      brain
      activity.
      There
      is
      a
      phase
      called
      REM
      (Rapid
      Eye
      Movement)
      sleep
      during
      which
      the
      vast
      majority
      of
      dreams
      occur.
      Only
      if
      you
      are
      awoken
      during
      this
      phase
      will
      you
      remember
      your
      dream
      since
      you
      woke
      from.
      During
      an
      eight
      hour
      sleep
      period,
      the
      average
      person
      has
      a
      total
      of
      two
      hours
      of
      REM
      sleep
      in
      which
      dreams
      occur,
      so
      that
      makes
      the
      odds
      of
      waking
      up
      from
      one
      lower.

      about
      how
      much
      the
      sensor
      signal
      needs
      to
      be
      amplified
      to
      produce
      an
      image
      of
      expected
      brightness.
      For
      a
      larger
      sensor,
      more
      light
      is
      collected
      and
      less
      amplification
      is
      needed
      for
      a
      brightness
      expected
      if
      ISO
      3,200
      for
      instance.
      Hence,
      less
      amplification
      =
      less
      noise.

      So,
      I
      got
      the
      game
      running
      after
      running
      in
      to
      the
      loading
      screen
      bug,
      changing
      the
      language
      and
      restarting
      the
      game.
      Weird,
      but
      whatever.
      I
      have
      a
      Radeon
      R9
      295x2
      GPU
      which
      is
      hardly
      top
      of
      the
      line
      anymore,
      but
      still
      in
      the
      higher
      percentile,
      and
      with
      2560x1440
      and
      all
      settings
      to
      "Epic"
      I
      get
      a
      lot
      of
      frame
      drops
      here
      and
      there.
      I'm
      guessing
      it's
      a
      optimization
      issue
      since
      I
      don't
      think
      the
      graphics
      in
      Obduction
      is
      sufficiently
      "advanced"
      to
      tax
      out
      my
      system.
      Anyway,
      I
      am
      now
      an
      obductee,
      and
      I
      won't
      spoil
      anything
      about
      the
      game.
      I
      will
      say
      that
      it
      feels
      distinctively
      "Myst",
      which
      I'm
      sure
      most
      here
      will
      understand
      what
      I
      mean
      by.
      The
      feeling
      of
      not
      knowing
      anything
      and
      trying
      to
      figure
      out
      things
      as
      you
      go
      along,
      along
      with
      a
      beautifully
      designed
      world.
      This
      is
      what
      Cyan
      does
      best
      and
      while
      I
      can't
      say
      I've
      come
      far
      in
      the
      game,
      I
      still
      feel
      that
      this
      is
      something
      really
      special!

      Only,
      photos
      were
      square
      long
      before
      digital
      cameras
      existed.
      The
      simple
      answer
      is
      that
      a
      round
      photo
      is
      hard
      to
      fit
      in
      an
      album,
      or
      in
      a
      newspaper
      article
      etc
      etc.
      there
      was
      a
      practical
      reason
      to
      keep
      the
      end
      result
      square
      and
      cropped.

      Right,
      but
      that's
      not
      a
      problem.
      You
      could
      expose
      a
      circle
      on
      a
      square
      piece
      of
      film
      (think
      exposing
      the
      circle
      of
      a
      35
      mm
      lens
      on
      a
      medium
      format
      film)
      but
      it
      would
      have
      been
      a
      waste
      of
      space
      on
      the
      film
      roll.

      Although,

      could
      supposedly
      make
      only
      a
      circle
      on
      the

      Hogwash.
      As
      a
      painter
      myself,
      I
      can
      say
      that
      many
      artists
      cut
      out
      the
      parts
      of
      the
      work
      that
      they
      dislike.
      If
      you
      love
      making
      portraits
      but
      grids
      or
      whatever
      outline
      method
      you
      learned
      to
      use
      is
      tedious,
      you
      rationalize
      it
      in
      order
      to
      note
      get
      bored
      by
      what
      you
      do.
      It's
      like
      saying
      that
      a
      real
      artist
      would
      bind
      their
      own
      brushes,
      mount
      their
      own
      canvases,
      mix
      their
      own
      light
      umbra,
      instead
      of
      purchasing
      it
      prefabricated.
      So
      when
      I
      trace
      a
      portrait
      it's
      not
      because
      I
      can't
      reproduce
      it
      in
      some
      other
      way,
      it's
      because
      I've
      done
      that
      part
      so
      many
      times
      and
      it's
      boring.
      Also,
      using
      a
      projector/light
      table
      or
      using
      a
      transfer
      grid
      is
      not
      much
      different
      from
      a
      "cheating"
      viewpoint.
      One
      is
      slower
      and
      one
      is
      faster.
      That's
      all.

      If
      you're
      going
      for

      it's
      a
      good
      idea
      to
      not
      trace.
      That's
      my

      The

      is
      base64

      starts
      with

      I
      am
      assuming
      some

      of

      encryption,
      but
      I'm
      not
      sure.
      Any
      ideas
      are
      welcome.

      No
      the
      ip
      is
      easily

      it's

      The

      The
      full

      doesn't
      help
      really.
      here
      is
      the
      full
      header
      for
      the
      eternal

      Injection-Info:

      mail-complaints-to="abuse@eternal-september.org";
      posting-account="U2FsdGVkX19bCgrkbEjt4gDrFKNANCce"
      It's
      the
      "posting-account"
      part
      of
      the
      header
      I
      am
      interested
      in.
      The
      reason
      is
      that
      I
      want
      to
      make
      sure
      that
      two
      posters
      are
      using
      the
      same
      posting
      account.
      I
      believe
      that
      this
      does
      not
      contain
      any
      personal
      information
      other
      than
      maybe
      the
      account
      name,
      or
      the
      account
      ID.
      And
      here
      is
      the
      X-Trace
      header
      from
      individual.net:
      X-Trace:
      individual.net
      q8cNyBZr8H6vQw1XWBg3Lw/QBrMuMlRjgDz4A0vDV6dfOCokS6
      Which
      I
      believe
      could
      be
      the
      posting
      host
      of
      the
      user.
      Note
      that
      all
      these
      X-Trace
      headers
      seem
      to
      have
      a
      "/"
      in
      them,
      maybe
      signifying
      two
      parts:
      q8cNyBZr8H6vQw1XWBg3Lw
      QBrMuMlRjgDz4A0vDV6dfOCokS6
      hash-identifier
      and
      hashid.py
      can't
      identify
      them,
      so
      I
      am
      asking
      here
      in
      the
      hopes
      that
      someone
      that
      has
      worked
      with
      NNTP
      software
      might
      have

      Making
      outdoor
      furnitures
      out
      of
      pine?

      So,
      I
      am
      having
      problem
      getting
      good
      access
      to
      hardwood
      in
      capacity
      where
      I
      live,
      but
      my
      local
      wood
      stores
      have
      plenty
      of
      pine.
      So
      I
      am
      wondering
      whether
      it
      is
      possible
      to
      build
      outdoor
      patio
      furniture
      out
      of
      pine
      and
      how
      it
      should
      be
      treated
      to
      keep
      for
      many
      years?
      My
      idea
      is
      using
      really
      thick
      pine
      boards
      to
      build
      a
      table,
      and
      I
      am
      assuming
      that
      the
      thicker
      they
      are,
      the
      more
      likely
      they
      are
      to
      bend,
      so
      I'll
      join
      them
      with
      dominoes
      and
      breadboards,
      but
      I
      am
      a
      bit
      concerned
      how
      the
      soft
      pine
      will
      fare
      against
      the
      weather
      in
      terms
      of
      rot,
      and
      sucking
      up
      water.

      I
      figured
      as
      much.
      Cedar
      is
      extremely
      hard
      for
      me
      to
      get,
      but
      I
      can
      get
      my
      hands
      on
      pressure-treated
      pine,
      but
      when
      new
      fromm
      the
      store,
      it's
      usually
      quite
      moist,
      should
      I
      let
      it
      dry
      out
      for
      a
      while
      before
      starting
      to
      work
      with
      it?

      What
      my
      local
      store
      has
      is
      pine
      boards
      for
      construction
      and
      pressure
      treated
      pine
      boards
      for
      patios
      and
      such.
      Some
      have
      a
      limited
      selection
      of
      oak
      fittings
      and
      linings
      but
      nothing

      Yes,
      I
      know,
      I
      would
      rather
      not
      paint
      it
      though.
      My
      idea
      was
      to
      brush
      it
      to
      get
      away
      most
      of
      the
      soft
      wood
      and
      keep
      a
      lot
      of
      the
      core
      wood
      to
      make
      it
      feel
      stronger
      on
      the
      surface,
      and
      then
      stain
      it.
      If
      I
      use
      pressure
      treated
      pine,
      I
      don't
      know
      if
      it
      can
      be
      stained
      -
      or
      rather
      *when*
      it
      can
      be
      stained..

      Well,
      I
      never
      claimed
      to
      be
      "such
      a
      photographer",
      but
      something
      messy
      happened
      when

      from
      the

      There
      never
      is
      alternate
      brands
      for
      the
      same
      lens
      though.
      For
      the
      same
      focal
      length
      and
      aperture,
      sure,
      but
      that's
      about

      There
      are
      very
      crappy
      50mm/f1.4
      for
      $50
      and
      there
      are
      amazeball

      for
      $5,000

      Really
      not
      much
      of
      a
      hassle.
      I
      had
      the
      lenses
      in
      a
      drawer
      before,
      and
      just
      finding
      the
      right
      lens
      was
      a
      bit
      off
      a
      struggle
      sometimes.
      This
      way
      all
      lenses
      are
      always
      shown
      and
      have
      their
      place.
      All
      lens
      caps
      is
      in
      a
      drawer
      next
      to
      the
      shelf,
      so
      I
      can
      unscrew
      the
      lens
      with
      one
      hand
      and
      grab
      a
      lenscap
      with
      the
      other.

      I
      routed
      a
      hole
      in
      the
      board
      so
      the
      lens
      caps
      are
      inset
      into
      it,
      then
      I
      used
      polyurethane
      glue
      which
      bonds
      super
      strongly
      with
      both
      the
      wood
      and
      the
      plastic.
      For
      the
      large
      lenses
      I
      also
      added
      two
      screws,
      but
      I
      don't
      think
      that
      would
      be
      necessary
      since
      the
      glue
      bond
      becomes
      stronger
      than
      both
      the
      wood
      and
      the
      plastic.

      And,

      I
      have
      the
      1.8
      as
      well,
      and
      it's
      a
      nice
      lens,
      but
      the
      1.4
      is
      creamier

      I'm
      gonna
      throw
      in
      the
      very
      versatile
      24-120mm/f4.
      If
      I
      could
      only
      take
      one
      lens
      to
      a
      vacation,
      this
      should
      be
      it.
      My
      fallback
      from
      that
      one
      is
      the
      Tamron
      18-200,
      which
      isn't
      as
      good
      but
      still
      ok
      for
      vacation
      shots.
      But
      in
      reality,
      I
      would
      probably
      just
      get
      my
      50/1.4G
      and
      use
      my
      legs
      to
      zoom.

      I
      hadn't
      heard
      them
      being
      called
      Titan
      XP,
      even
      though
      I
      knew
      what
      you
      meant.
      I've
      waited
      for
      the
      Titan
      X
      to
      be
      released
      since
      I
      didn't
      want
      to
      get
      1080's
      so
      late
      in
      the
      cycle.
      The
      1080Ti
      are
      expected
      in
      january
      and
      I
      wanted
      to
      build
      this
      now.
      I
      doubt
      the
      1080ti
      will
      outperform
      the
      Titan
      X's,
      so
      I
      would
      have
      perhaps
      saved
      money
      but
      lost
      time,
      so...
      :)
      Also,
      there's
      *always*
      a
      better
      card
      in
      the
      pipeline
      and
      there
      never
      is
      a
      good
      time
      to
      buy
      any
      PC
      parts
      :-D

      Supposedly,

      What
      always
      kills
      me
      with
      this
      is
      that
      if
      I
      go
      back
      to
      being
      ten,
      my
      kids
      will
      never
      exist.
      Even
      if
      I
      hook
      up
      with
      the
      same
      girl
      and
      conceive
      at
      pretty
      much
      the
      same
      time,
      genetics
      is
      not
      going
      to
      produce
      the
      exact
      same
      offspring.
      So
      by
      taking
      the
      10yo
      pill
      I
      will
      never
      meet
      my
      children
      again.

      Well,
      the
      D40
      was
      a
      decent
      amateur
      DSLR
      at
      the
      time,
      but
      it
      was
      never
      a
      great
      camera.
      Pretty
      much
      any
      modern
      DSLR
      is
      of
      a
      "higher"
      standard.
      I'd
      start
      by
      looking
      at
      the
      Nikon
      5xxx
      and
      7xxx
      series.
      The
      3xxx
      series
      is
      the
      modern
      equivalent
      of
      the
      D40

      Outdoor
      table
      made
      of
      pine?

      So
      I
      am
      going
      to
      make
      a
      huge
      outdoor
      table,
      and
      for
      the
      time
      being
      it
      will
      be
      standing
      outside
      without
      a
      roof.
      My
      idea
      is
      buying
      really
      thick
      pine
      lumber
      and
      domino
      join
      them
      together
      and
      then
      add
      bread
      boards.
      I
      am
      wondering
      if
      the
      pine
      will
      survive
      the
      rain
      and
      if
      so,
      for
      how
      long?
      And
      how
      should
      I
      treat
      it
      to
      maximize
      life
      span
      and
      minimize
      twisting?
      Any
      ideas?

      Don't
      have
      any
      flares
      anymore
      (thanks

      dry
      skin
      in

      face
      and
      on

      Usually

      to
      get
      a

      than
      joint
      aches.

      Sorry,
      I'm
      one
      of
      those
      lucky
      bastards
      where
      humira
      has
      been
      100%
      successful.
      No
      joint
      aches,
      no
      stomach
      pains,
      no
      nothing.
      I
      still
      get
      diarrhea
      due
      to
      the
      shortened
      colon
      sometimes,
      and
      due
      to
      my
      diet
      probably.
      But
      as
      far
      as
      symptoms
      go,
      I'm
      pretty
      much
      totally
      free
      of
      them.
      I
      take
      it
      as
      needed,
      one
      pen
      every

      So
      I'm
      building
      a
      roof
      over
      our
      patio
      (Swedish
      guy
      here,
      sorry
      if
      some
      terms
      are
      wrong,
      hope
      you
      understand
      what
      I
      mean).
      So
      [this
      is
      my
      house](http://imgur.com/VHnBn4J)
      more
      or
      less,
      it
      has
      it's
      back
      cut
      off
      here,
      but
      just
      to
      show
      the
      two
      facades
      that
      matter
      to
      this
      build.
      So
      it
      has
      a
      roof
      in
      a
      corner,
      and
      I
      want
      to
      build
      a
      roof
      over
      the
      part
      of
      the
      patio
      closest
      to
      the
      "camera"
      so
      to
      speak.
      And
      [this
      is
      my
      idea](http://imgur.com/1RLFuKb)
      where
      I
      build
      a
      corner
      roof
      where
      one
      side
      has
      zero
      length,
      which
      makes
      sense
      to
      me.
      The
      sideboard
      on
      the
      zero
      length
      part
      means
      that
      water/snow
      will
      drain
      down
      to
      the
      corner
      and
      into
      a
      spout
      at
      that
      point.
      Would
      you
      do
      it
      any
      differently.
      I'll
      attach
      (stringers?)
      to
      the
      house
      and
      then
      get
      either
      screws
      into
      the
      ground
      or
      cement
      blocks
      embedded.
      Here
      is
      a
      [top
      view](http://imgur.com/9DG2xyP)
      where
      the
      corner
      idea
      is
      more
      pronounced
      I
      think.
      Any
      ideas?
      I'll

      I
      see
      what
      you
      mean
      and
      my
      idea
      is
      not
      to
      attach
      the
      stringer
      to
      the
      fascia,
      but
      to
      the
      structural
      roof
      behind
      them.
      It's
      hard
      to
      explain
      but
      the
      shingles
      end
      and
      there
      is
      a
      vertical
      surface
      under
      them
      where
      the
      water
      spout
      is
      mounted.
      Behind
      this
      vertical
      surface
      and
      behind
      the
      fascia
      on
      it
      is
      the
      roof
      "stools"
      (as
      they're
      called
      in
      Swedish)
      which
      has
      a
      huge
      horizontal
      beam
      and
      a
      beam
      the
      roofing
      is
      built
      upon.
      The
      stringer
      would
      be
      attached
      to
      these
      (through
      the
      fascia).
      I
      hope
      you
      understand
      what
      I
      mean
      :)

      Right,
      someone
      else
      suggested
      this,
      but
      that
      would
      mean
      I
      would
      build
      it
      even
      larger
      and
      then
      overlap
      the
      house
      roof
      on
      both
      the
      long
      and
      short
      side,
      but
      still
      building
      a
      sloping
      corner
      roof?
      The
      clearance
      for
      the
      front
      stringer
      is
      right
      now
      203cm
      (6'8")
      which
      to
      me
      sounds
      sufficient
      for
      most
      :)

      I
      get
      that,
      but
      if
      the
      patio
      roof
      should
      clear
      the
      house
      roof,
      it
      would
      raise
      to
      be
      at
      about
      7'10"
      at
      its
      lowest
      point,
      and
      require
      four
      more
      post
      at
      50cm
      out
      from
      the
      house
      facade,
      which
      kind
      of
      defeats
      its
      purpose
      to
      be
      a
      roof
      for
      the
      outdoor
      dining
      area.
      Plus,
      it
      would
      not
      be
      anchored
      sideways,
      so
      it
      would
      have
      to
      have
      cross
      bracing
      to
      protect
      against
      sideway
      forces
      like
      wind
      and
      such,
      right?
      Also,
      the
      low
      point
      of
      6'8"
      is
      only
      in
      the
      one
      corner
      front,
      where
      there
      is
      less
      traffic
      actually,
      towards
      the
      rest
      of
      the
      patio
      and
      the
      under-roof
      patio,
      there
      will
      be
      more
      clearance
      as
      well.
      I
      get
      your
      thinking
      and
      I
      value
      your
      feedback,
      I'm
      just
      trying
      to
      weight
      to
      pros
      and
      cons
      here
      :)

      "v #228;l"
      can
      also
      be
      "insisting"
      as
      added
      to
      something
      you
      or
      someone
      should
      do:
      "Jag
      ska
      kl #228;
      p #229;
      mig"
      -
      "I'll

      "Jag
      ska
      v #228;l
      kl #228;

      mig"

      it's
      about
      your

      someone
      else,
      the

      changes
      meaning,
      where
      if
      it's
      about
      yourself,
      it's
      more
      of
      something
      you
      probably
      should
      be
      doing,
      but
      if
      it's
      about

      else,
      it's
      more
      of
      an
      added
      irritation,
      with
      an
      implied
      "should",
      as
      in
      it's
      expected
      from
      the
      person
      that
      he

      So
      this
      is
      a
      table
      of
      runes,
      and
      how
      they
      differed
      from
      different
      locations
      in
      which
      they
      were
      found.
      So
      the
      title
      row
      is
      location
      and
      year.
      and
      its
      columns
      is
      how
      that
      location
      portrayed
      specific
      runes.

      So
      there
      are
      tons
      of
      comments
      about
      characters
      "teleporting"
      to
      locations
      in
      this
      and
      last
      season.
      With
      a
      shorter
      season
      and
      fewer
      episodes
      it
      is
      understandable.
      But
      another
      reason
      I
      thought
      of
      was
      that
      there
      is
      no
      "official"
      events
      that
      took
      place
      during
      the
      travels.
      I.e.
      GRRM
      writes
      at
      length
      about
      travels
      and
      what
      happens
      during
      the
      travels.
      So
      when
      Tyrion
      and
      Jorah
      travelled
      to
      Mereen,
      it
      was
      drawn
      out
      in
      the
      show
      because
      this
      journey
      is
      described
      in
      length
      in
      the
      books.
      Of
      course,
      the
      show
      journey
      and
      the
      book
      journey
      is
      very
      dissimilar
      but
      the
      show
      took
      its
      time
      because
      the
      book
      did.
      But
      now
      the
      show
      has
      no
      book
      to
      reference.
      If
      the
      events
      of
      TWOW
      will
      resemble
      the
      events
      in
      the
      show,
      we
      know
      that
      it
      will
      be
      with
      a
      lot
      more
      information
      about
      the
      journeys.
      As
      an
      adaptation,
      it's
      easier
      for
      the
      show
      writers
      to
      relate
      to
      the
      journey
      itself
      when
      the
      book
      has
      so
      much
      information
      about
      it,
      but
      when
      there
      is
      no
      such
      information,
      it's
      easier
      to
      just
      gloss
      over
      the
      journey
      rather
      than
      trying
      to
      invent
      something
      interesting
      that
      happens.
      The
      show
      has
      always
      been
      "simpler"
      than
      the
      books.
      More
      straight
      forward
      plot
      lines
      and
      characters,
      and
      without
      the
      books
      as
      a
      "crutch"
      this
      may
      lead
      to
      thing
      becoming
      too
      simple
      for
      a
      lot
      of
      book
      readers
      that
      are
      used
      to
      journeys
      being
      very
      time
      consuming.

      The
      end
      result
      doesn #8217;t
      look
      too
      hot.
      Why
      is
      it
      so
      slow
      and
      how
      does
      it
      do
      it?
      The
      iPhone
      7/8/X
      does
      it
      with
      a
      dual
      lens
      setup
      and
      creates
      a
      3D
      depth
      map
      of
      the
      scene
      to
      know
      exactly
      what
      should
      be
      out
      of
      focus
      and
      not.
      Given
      the
      time
      this
      takes
      to
      recalculate
      blur
      I #8217;m
      assuming
      it
      takes
      several
      photos
      and
      using
      focus
      stacking
      (in
      reverse)
      to
      find
      out
      how
      a
      blurred
      part
      should
      look.

      Yeah,
      much
      cheaper.
      And
      it #8217;ll
      be
      a
      subscription
      plan
      with
      a
      rate
      for
      how
      much
      you
      use
      it.
      So
      a
      normal
      person
      may
      pay
      $69/month
      for
      a
      plan
      that
      includes
      4-6
      in-city
      rides
      per
      day.
      It
      will
      start
      out
      more
      expensive
      since
      you
      pay
      hundreds
      of
      dollars
      per
      month
      for
      your
      car
      so
      $299/month
      will
      be
      cheaper
      still.
      But
      competition
      will
      drive
      the
      prices
      down
      quickly.

      Well,
      just
      do
      the
      math.
      You
      pay
      for
      100%
      of
      your
      car
      and
      use
      it
      5%
      per
      day
      (in
      general).
      Now
      imagine
      only
      paying
      for
      the
      amount
      you
      use
      it.
      So
      let #8217;s
      say
      your
      car
      costs
      you
      $500/month
      (gas,
      taxes,
      devaluation
      etc).
      So
      from
      the
      start
      services
      will
      be
      $399
      or
      $299
      because
      they
      can
      and
      it #8217;s
      still
      cheaper.
      But
      competition
      will
      drive
      it
      down.
      Sure,
      a
      car
      that
      is
      being
      used
      more
      hours
      P #228;r
      day
      will
      be
      more
      expensive
      in
      service,
      devaluation
      etc,
      but
      the
      sweet
      spot
      will
      be
      around
      10-15%
      of
      what
      you
      pay
      today,
      which
      is
      $50-$90/month,

      Dunno,
      I
      think
      most
      people
      dislike
      riding
      the
      bus
      because
      there
      are
      other
      people
      on
      it
      and
      you
      have
      to
      catch
      it
      at
      a
      specific
      time
      -
      not
      because
      someone
      else
      has
      sat
      in
      the
      chair
      they #8217;re
      sitting
      in.
      And
      for.
      Kemal
      commute,
      it #8217;s
      less
      of
      an
      issue.
      When
      going
      on
      vacation
      you
      use
      a
      premium
      service
      to
      rent
      a
      more
      comfortable

      They

      guzzling,

      savings
      largely

      Of

      not.
      We're
      not
      going
      to
      have
      some
      10-20
      years
      of
      people
      buying
      autonomous
      vehicles,
      that's
      the

      become
      commonplace
      and
      "accepted"
      car-as-a-service
      will
      roll
      out
      en

      So

      thingamajig
      and
      when
      realising
      it
      can
      cut
      their
      car
      costs
      by
      90%
      will

      You're
      suggesting
      that
      down
      the
      road
      when
      small,
      electric,
      autonomous
      fleet
      vehicles
      are
      out
      people
      will
      say,
      "Wow,
      I'd
      love
      to
      be
      driven
      around

      and
      that
      fleet

      is
      cheap,
      so
      rather
      than
      compare
      it
      to
      the
      cost
      of
      buying
      one
      of
      those
      small,
      electric,
      autonomous

      large,
      dumb,

      I
      could
      have
      driven
      20

      You're

      yourself

      you
      think
      CAAS

      be
      a
      viable
      option
      in
      20
      years.
      It
      will
      be
      available
      the
      second
      autonomous
      vehicles
      roll
      out.
      In
      fact,
      never
      mind
      the
      EV
      part,
      if
      autonomous
      vehicles
      were
      all
      gas
      cars,
      the
      scenario
      would
      be
      the
      same.

      difference

      the
      vast
      majority
      of
      autonomous
      cars
      will
      be
      EV's.
      Your
      argument
      is
      that
      people
      will
      sell
      their
      gas
      cars,
      get
      self-driving
      EV's
      and
      *then*
      CAAS
      will
      be
      an
      option.
      I
      am
      saying
      that
      people
      will
      sell
      their
      gas
      cars
      and
      then
      have
      to
      choose
      between
      buying
      an
      autonomous
      EV
      or
      getting
      a
      CAAS
      subscription.
      And
      I
      am
      arguing
      that
      CAAS
      will
      be
      much
      more
      economical
      for
      that
      person,
      and
      for
      the
      vast
      vast
      majority,
      it
      will
      be
      the
      far
      better
      choice.

      Go
      research
      the
      actual
      cost
      of
      renting
      a
      tractor
      on
      a
      regular
      basis
      vs.
      owning
      and
      get
      back
      to
      me.
      No
      need,
      depends
      on
      how
      often
      you
      use
      it.
      If
      you're
      a
      farmer,
      it
      would
      probably
      add
      too
      much
      overhead.
      For
      me,
      living
      in
      the
      suburb
      and
      needing
      a
      tractor
      to
      move
      a
      tree,
      it's
      way
      cheaper.
       gt;
      Taxis
      today
      offer
      the
      same
      benefits
      of
      increased
      usage
      you
      attribute
      to
      self
      driving
      cars
      and
      also
      show
      up
      at
      your
      doorstep
      to
      pick
      you
      up.
      And
      have
      to
      pay
      salary
      to
      the
      driver,
      and
      the
      vast
      majority
      are
      gas
      vehicles
      which
      are
      more
      expensive
      to
      operate
      and
      service.
       gt;
      When
      you
      can
      reasonably
      compare
      the
      cost
      of
      using
      CAAS
      to
      owning
      an
      equivalent
      car
      It's
      the
      same
      math.
      As
      "equivalent
      cars"
      get
      cheaper
      to
      own,
      so
      will
      CAAS.

      Yes,
      and
      if
      you
      need
      a
      car
      on
      rare
      occasions
      using
      fleet
      service
      will
      be
      much
      cheaper.
      But
      most
      people
      use
      their
      vehicle
      multiple
      times
      per
      day.
      That
      changes
      things
      dramatically.
      Yes,
      if
      "renting"
      a
      car
      meant
      picking
      it
      up
      and
      returning
      it.
      With
      CAAS,
      that's
      not
      a
      problem.
      You
      just
      press
      the
      car
      button
      in
      the
      app
      and
      it
      will
      show
      up
      within
      five
      minutes
      if
      you're
      in
      the
      city.
      Or
      you
      have
      it
      scheduled
      to
      appear
      at
      7.45
      am
      every
      weekday
      morning.
      Think
      about
      it,
      remove
      math
      and
      economics
      and
      imagine
      a
      world
      where
      taxi
      today
      was
      a
      subscription
      service
      that
      cost
      you
      $59/month,
      and
      at
      the
      press
      of
      a
      button
      a
      driver
      and
      car
      would
      arrive
      promptly
      and
      drive
      you
      wherever
      you
      want
      inside
      the
      city
      limits,
      for
      as
      many
      times
      or
      as
      few
      times
      as
      you
      need
      it.
      Go
      to
      the
      mall,
      shop
      for
      an
      hour,
      boom
      theres
      a
      car
      waiting
      for
      you
      when
      you
      exit
      the
      building.
      No
      one
      would
      own
      a
      car.
      That's
      where
      we're
      heading.
       gt;
      Do
      you
      just
      ignore
      anything
      that
      doesn't
      fit
      your
      reality.
      Go
      back
      and
      read
      what
      I
      wrote.
      I
      explicitly
      said
      it's
      still
      way
      more
      expensive
      EVEN
      AFTER
      SUBTRACTING
      THE
      EXPENSE
      OF
      THE
      DRIVER.
      No.
       gt;
      The
      issue
      is
      comparing
      the
      cost
      of
      ownership
      vs.
      the
      cost
      of
      a
      service,
      which
      you
      just
      assume
      is
      dramatically
      cheaper
      while
      ignoring
      economic
      realities
      of
      the
      expenses
      related
      to
      TCO
      of
      operating
      a
      vehicle.
      Cost
      of
      total
      TCO
      vs.
      cost
      of
      5-10%
      of
      TCO.

      And
      you're
      not
      getting
      it.
      Whenever
      this
      period
      of
      time
      is,
      by
      necessity
      the
      cars
      being
      used
      for
      CAAS
      must
      exist,
      right?
      And
      things
      that
      exist
      can
      be
      purchased.
      Possibly.
      I
      think
      some
      cheap
      car
      platform
      will
      be
      developed
      where
      they're
      just
      "shuttles"
      that
      are
      used
      as
      CAAS.
      Not
      necessarily
      also
      being
      sold
      as
      cars
      for
      the
      public.
      I.e.
      Uber
      talks
      to
      someone
      in
      chine
      to
      develop
      the
      cheapest
      possible
      autonomous
      EV
      that
      doesn't
      have
      any
      specific
      brand
      name
      or
      styling,
      it's
      just
      a
      minibus
      shuttle
      kind
      of
      vehicle.
      Some
      will
      want
      to
      travel
      in
      style
      and
      get
      a
      BMW
      or
      Mercedes
      autonomous
      vehicle,
      but
      for
      the
      vast
      majority,
      these
      shuttle
      vehicles
      will
      be
      vastly
      cheaper
      and
      quite
      sufficient.
       gt;
      So
      compare
      a
      small,
      electric
      autonomous
      vehicle
      against
      a
      small,
      electric,
      autonomous
      vehicle.
      Or
      compare
      an
      RV
      sized
      gas
      guzzling
      autonomous
      vehicle
      against
      an
      RV
      sized
      gas
      guzzling
      vehicle.
      Compare
      whatever
      the
      fuck
      you
      want,
      but
      don't
      disingenuously
      compare
      completely
      dissimilar
      vehicles
      and
      then
      attribute
      all
      the
      cost
      savings
      to
      only
      one
      factor
      when
      the
      reasons
      one
      is
      cheaper
      are
      many.
      I
      have
      done
      no
      such
      thing.
      My
      prediction
      is
      that
      people
      will
      move
      from
      gas-guzzlers
      to
      CAAS
      autonomous
      EV's,
      not
      from
      gas
      guzzlers
      to
      EV's
      to
      autonomous
      EV's
      and
      then
      maybe
      to
      CAAS.
       gt;
      Puts
      finger
      on
      nose.
      Yes,
      exactly.
      Compare
      the
      cost
      of
      equivalent,
      contemporary
      vehicles.
      See,
      it's
      really
      not
      that
      hard.
      EV
      CAAS
      will
      be
      contemporary
      to
      their
      gas
      cars.
      That's
      the
      point.
       gt;
      But
      your
      argument
      is
      stupid
      and
      completely
      ignores
      economic
      realities.
      That's
      the
      problem.
      Haha

      If

      But
      you
      could.
      All
      you'd
      have
      to
      do
      would
      be
      throw
      out
      reasonable
      numbers
      for
      things
      like
      depreciation,
      fuel,
      insurance,
      repairs,
      tires,
      empty
      miles,
      profit,
      overhead,
      etc
      and
      show
      your
      way
      can
      be
      as
      much
      cheaper
      as
      you
      claimed.
      Simple
      math.
      Go
      here:
      https://financialmentor.com/calculator/car-cost-calculator
      Leave
      the
      numbers
      as-is,
      but
      select
      "no"
      in
      the
      box
      whether
      you're
      finance
      the
      car,
      so
      we'll
      purchase
      it
      as-is.
      Total
      cost
      of
      owning
      a
      generic
      car
      for
      three
      years:
      $28,740.32
      Total
      cost
      per
      month
      (3
      years):
      $798
      Total
      usage
      of
      a
      car
      is
      about
      5-10%,
      i.e.
      idle
      time
      is
      usually
      above
      90%
      So,
      at
      the
      time
      of
      cheaper
      EV
      and
      autonomous
      vehicles,
      let's
      assume
      the
      TCO
      is
      $350/month.
      Now
      take
      that
      expense
      and
      put
      it
      on
      a
      fleet
      company
      and
      split
      the
      sum
      amongst
      it's
      customers,
      each
      paying
      compared
      to
      the
      percentage
      they
      use
      a
      car,
      which
      is
      5-10%.
      That's
      $35/month.
      Now
      add
      margins,
      earnings
      and
      an
      initial
      greed
      to
      this
      and
      the
      prices
      will
      start
      at
      around
      $299/month
      and
      will
      still
      be
      much
      cheaper,
      but
      competition
      will
      drive
      it
      down
      to
      somewhere
      around
      $69/month
      or
      $79/month
      depending
      on
      your
      "plan".
      And
      the
      CAAS
      companies
      will
      still
      make
      a
      lot
      of
      money
      on
      it.

      Then
      again,
      who
      cares
      about
      GL #8217;s
       #8220;vision #8221;
      anyway,
      or
      anyone #8217;s
       #8220;vision #8221;.
      If
      the
      movies
      are
      good,
      whatever
      vision
      a
      director
      may
      or
      may
      not
      have
      had
      is
      unimportant.
      Personally
      I
      consider
      the
      prequels
      to
      be
      utter
      shit
      so
      if
      those
      are
      somehow
      integral
      to
      GLs
       #8220;vision #8221;
      then
      good
      riddance.
      That
      doesn #8217;t
      make
      me
      a
      JJ
       #8220;fanboy #8221;
      since
      TFA
      had
      its
      problems
      as
      well.
      ESB
      is
      a
      masterpiece.
      What
      was
      Irvin
      Kershners
      vision?
      More
      of
      that!
      Direction
      and
      screenplay
      by
      someone
      else
      than
      GL.
      Golden.
      All
      cred
      to
      GL
      though.
      Not
      shitting
      on
      the
      man
      that
      brought
      is
      SW,
      but
      every
      director
      has
      good
      moments
      and
      bad
      moments.
      And
      if
      your
      out
      of
      the
      game
      as
      long
      as
      GL
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      anyone
      could
      churn
      out
      a
      masterpiece
      like
      ANH
      just
      like
      that.

      Interesting,
      yes.
      New
      trilogy-worthy?
      Naaaah.
      Even
      the
      Thrawn
      trilogy
      is
      rather
      subdued
      because
      they
      couldn #8217;t
      mess
      too
      much
      with

      love

      som
      Mara
      Jade,
      though.

      Right!
      I
      was
      thinking
      about
      some
      bridge
      for
      the
      actual
      boiler
      and
      was
      completely
      lost.
      Yes,
      the
      actual
      bridge
      to
      the
      island
      can
      be
      a
      real
      problem,
      I'd
      imagine.
      One
      of
      the
      instances
      where
      you
      start
      walking
      it,
      and
      then
      it
      fades
      to
      black
      and
      then
      you're
      at
      the
      other
      end
      perhaps?

      a
      noname
      rotary
      sander,
      this
      is
      pretty
      much
      the
      only
      one
      I
      use.
      I
      think
      its
      great.
      While
      not
      vibration-free,
      it's
      really
      not
      vibrating
      much
      at
      all,
      so
      it's
      easy
      to
      handle
      and
      use.
      Highly
      recommend
      it
      -
      but
      then
      again,
      it's
      not
      like
      I've
      tested
      many
      other
      brands
      :)

      So
      for
      upcoming
      christmas
      celebrations
      I
      need
      to
      build
      a
      table
      that
      has
      the
      same
      height
      and
      width
      as
      our
      dining
      table,
      but
      can
      be
      stowed
      away
      when
      not
      in
      use.
      I've
      googled
      and
      searched
      youtube
      without
      finding
      any
      real
      good
      solutions
      (but
      some
      ideas).
      Anyone
      here
      have
      a
      good
      suggestion
      on
      how
      to
      make
      this
      sturdy?
      I'll
      be
      using
      some
      pallet
      wood
      mostly
      (from
      a
      pallet
      with
      slightly
      thicker
      stock)
      so
      we're
      not
      talking
      fine
      furniture,
      but
      still,
      it
      needs
      to
      be
      sturdy
      enough.

      It
      does
      and
      it
      doesn't.
      Exposure
      is
      also
      a
      value
      of
      illumination
      per
      square
      area,
      so
      the
      exposure
      for
      DX
      and
      FX
      is
      the
      same,
      but
      DX
      will
      get
      less
      *total*
      light.
      This
      is
      why
      smaller
      sensors
      appear
      grainier
      in
      low
      light.
      It's
      because
      if
      you
      have
      a
      FX
      camera
      set
      to
      ISO
      400
      and
      a
      DX
      camera
      set
      to
      ISO
      400,
      the
      DX
      camera
      will
      try
      to
      match
      an
      expected
      "brightness"
      associated
      with
      "ISO
      400",
      and
      in
      order
      to
      do
      this,
      is
      forced
      to
      amplify
      the
      signal
      *more*
      since
      it
      has
      received
      less
      *total
      light*.
      Exposure
      is
      just
      shutter
      +
      aperture
      and
      knows
      nothing
      about
      the
      receiving
      sensor
      size.
      But
      a
      smaller
      sensor
      will
      catch
      less
      total
      light,
      and
      thus
      need
      to
      amplify
      it
      more
      to
      end
      up
      with
      an
      equally
      bright
      image.
      This
      is
      why
      they
      appear
      to
      be
      grainier
      the
      smaller
      the
      sensors
      get.
      They
      really
      aren't,
      if
      you
      give
      the
      smaller
      sensor
      the
      same
      amount
      of
      total
      light
      (i.e.
      change
      the
      exposure),
      and
      adjust
      the
      ISO
      with
      the
      crop
      factor
      squared,
      you
      get

      The
      problem
      is
      with
      what
      we
      call
      "ISO",
      which
      in
      the
      olden
      days
      meant
      the
      amount
      of
      light
      a
      film
      could
      gather
      per
      square
      mm,
      but
      these
      days,
      a
      sensor
      can
      only
      catch
      "X"
      amount
      per
      square
      mm,
      and
      then
      we
      amplify
      that
      signal
      and
      that
      amplification
      is
      called
      "ISO"
      steps.
      So,
      since
      a
      smaller
      sensor
      receives
      less
      total
      light
      for
      a
      given
      exposure,
      it
      needs
      to
      amplify
      the
      signal
      *more*
      to
      look
      as
      bright
      as
      the
      same
      exposure
      for
      a
      full
      format
      sensor.
      So
      if
      the
      FF
      sensor
      takes
      the
      shot
      at
      "ISO
      400"
      which
      is
      just
      an
      arbitrary
      value
      tied
      to
      a
      perceived
      brightness
      from
      the
      old
      film
      days.
      But
      for
      the
      smaller
      sensor
      to
      create
      an
      equally
      bright
      image
      as
      the
      FF
      sensor,
      it
      needs
      to
      amplify
      the
      signal
      more.
      So
      back
      in
      the
      olden
      days,
      ISO
      was
      very
      much
      connected
      to
      the
      "grainyness"
      of
      a
      picture,
      given
      the
      fact
      that
      higher
      ISO
      film
      had
      larger
      silver
      halide
      crystals
      =
      more
      grain.
      But
      in
      sensors,
      "grain"
      is
      exchanged
      with
      "noise"
      and
      is
      produced
      by
      the
      amplification
      process
      from
      the
      sensor
      readout,
      and
      again,
      a
      small
      sensor
      need
      to
      amplify
      the
      signal
      more
      for
      the
      same
      exposure
      =
      more
      noise.
      Give
      the
      smaller
      sensor
      the
      same
      amount
      of
      *total
      light*
      (i.e.
      change
      the
      exposure)
      and
      then
      turn
      down
      the
      ISO
      by
      the
      crop
      factor
      squared,
      then
      you
      have
      an
      "identical"
      image.

      So,
      freshly
      installed
      2.4.2-RELEASE-p1,
      everything
      worked
      fine,
      but
      I
      went
      into
      system
      settings
      and
      changed
      to
      https,
      it
      saved
      and
      redirected
      me,
      but
      logged
      me
      out
      efter
      each
      request,
      which
      was
      infuriating.
      Went
      back
      into
      settings
      and
      saw
      that
      neither
      http
      or
      https
      was
      selected,
      so
      I
      selected
      https
      again,
      pressed
      saved
      and
      had
      to
      log
      in
      again
      etc
      etc...
      Went
      in
      via
      SSH,
      checked
      /conf/config.xml
      and
      saw
      that
      system
      - gt;
      webgui
      - gt;
      protocol
      was
      empty,
      added
      "http"
      to
      it
      and
      saved,
      and
      then
      /etc/rc.restart_webgui
      But
      nothing,
      now
      it
      won't
      even
      respond.
      "netstat
      -la"
      shows
      Proto
      Recv-Q
      Send-Q
      Local
      Address
      Foreign
      Address
      (state)
      tcp6
      0
      0
      *.http
      *.*
      LISTEN
      tcp4
      0
      0
      *.http
      *.*
      LISTEN
      So
      something
      is
      listening.
      Checking
      the
      /var/etc/nginx-webConfigurator.conf
      shows:
      server
      {
      listen
      80;
      listen
      [::]:80;
      ...
      }
      And
      I've
      tried
      "killall
      nginx;
      killall
      php",
      also
      "pkg
      upgrade"
      and
      reboot
      but
      still
      nothing.
      What
      am
      I
      doing
      wrong?

      **Provide
      any
      additional
      details
      you
      wish
      below.**
      Basically,
      I
      have
      a
      AMD
      Radeon
      R9
      295x2
      card,
      a
      couple
      of
      hard
      drives,
      a
      ATX
      case
      and
      a
      PSU,
      but
      the
      mobo
      is
      an
      old
      Asus
      Rampage
      III
      and
      the
      computer
      is
      acting
      up.
      Basically,
      I
      want
      to
      chuck
      out
      the
      mobo,
      RAM
      and
      CPU
      and
      build
      something
      new.
      (And
      yes,
      I've
      run
      diagnostics
      on
      it).
      I'm
      building
      it
      for
      my
      sisters
      son,
      so
      nothing
      overly
      fancy.
      The
      R9
      GPU
      will
      remain,
      so
      I
      need
      to
      know
      what
      parts
      will
      be
      a
      good
      economy
      build
      around
      that
      GPU.
      Basically
      what
      mobo+cpu+RAM
      I
      should
      get
      for
      a
      good
      fit.

      With
      my
      son
      (16),
      on
      a
      road
      trip.
      He
      really
      liked
      it,
      and
      his
      impression
      from
      the
      podcast
      is
      that
      Adnan
      didn't
      do
      it,
      but
      it
      was
      more
      entertainment
      to
      him
      rather
      than
      any
      murder
      mystery
      that
      he
      felt
      he
      could
      wrap
      his
      head
      around.
      After
      listening
      to
      the
      podcast
      again,
      I
      started
      to
      dig
      around
      the
      old
      reddit
      group,
      and
      found
      this
      group,
      which
      wasn't
      around
      the
      first
      time
      as
      far
      as
      I
      can
      remember.
      And
      man,
      the
      worst
      part
      of
      Serial
      has
      to
      be
      the
      "guilters"
      and
      "FAP:ers".
      I'm
      a
      logical
      kind
      of
      guy
      and
      the
      way
      each
      side
      tried
      to
      discredit
      the
      other
      side
      rather
      than
      the
      facts/evidence
      is
      cringey
      :)
      Anyway,
      I
      can't
      say
      I'm
      on
      the
      "fence"
      or
      either
      way.
      It's
      an
      interesting
      case,
      and
      I'm
      not
      sure
      I
      personally
      care
      whether
      Adnan
      is
      guilty
      or
      not.
      I
      just
      felt
      I
      wanted
      to
      comment
      on
      some
      of
      the
      things
      that
      one
      side
      makes
      a
      huge
      deal
      out
      of
      and
      the
      other
      side
      make
      far-fetched
      explanations
      for.
      **Tap

      I,
      for
      one,
      do
      think
      the
      police
      did
      the
      tapping.
      Not
      to
      "coach"
      the
      witness
      in
      a
      conspiracy/nefarious
      way,
      just
      that
      they
      had
      worked
      with
      Jay
      for
      hours
      trying
      to
      get
      a
      statement
      and
      when
      he
      diverged
      from
      his
      own
      statement,
      they
      need
      him
      to
      get
      back
      on
      track.
      **Lividity**
      Since
      the
      photos
      of
      Hae's
      burial
      site
      hasn't
      been
      seen
      by
      many,
      it's
      hard
      to
      make
      any
      conclusive
      statements
      about
      them
      without
      letting
      your
      preconceived
      notions
      take
      over.
      The
      few
      drawings
      and
      clay
      models
      and
      whatnot
      we've
      seen
      seem
      to
      more
      or
      less
      agree
      that
      her
      legs
      were
      on
      her
      side,
      while
      her
      torso
      were
      not
      *completely*
      on
      the
      side,
      nor
      completely
      level
      straight
      down
      either.
      Which
      of
      course
      would
      check
      out
      given
      how
      skeletons
      work.
      What
      I
      am
      unsure
      of
      is
      the
      testimony
      made
      by
      the
      doctor
      -
      that
      talked
      about
      upper
      lividity,
      if
      they
      had
      seen
      the
      photos
      and
      were
      making
      a
      statement
      about
      whether
      the
      lividity
      as
      in
      contradiction
      or
      agreement
      of
      the
      burial
      position
      or
      not.
      **Jay**
      As
      for
      the
      timeline
      of
      the
      day
      Hae
      was
      kidnapped,
      I
      wouldn't
      take
      much
      of
      what
      Jay
      says
      seriously.
      Partly
      because
      he
      was/is
      clearly
      leaving
      out/lying
      about
      information
      to
      keep
      himself
      and/or
      others
      out
      of
      trouble,
      also
      he
      has
      given
      so
      many
      statements
      that
      I
      don't
      think
      he
      himself
      remembers
      what
      actually
      happened
      that
      day.
      So
      apart
      from
      knowing
      where
      the
      car
      was,
      any
      information
      from
      Jay
      has
      lost
      all
      credibility
      for
      me.
      **Serial,
      Rabia,
      Susan**
      None
      of
      these
      are
      "liars",
      Sarah
      was
      the
      narrator
      of
      a
      podcast
      that
      selected
      information
      for
      an
      interesting
      narrative,
      not
      a
      murder
      mystery
      with
      the
      intent
      to
      solve
      the
      case.
      If
      anything,
      I
      think
      Sarah
      makes
      it
      clear
      many
      times
      how
      she
      isn't
      convinced
      Adnan
      is
      innocent,
      and
      the
      final
      episode
      says
      as
      much
      -
      just
      that
      as
      far
      as
      she
      can
      determine,
      there
      wasn't
      enough
      to
      put
      Adnan
      in
      jail,
      regardless
      of
      whether
      or
      not
      he
      did
      it.
      Some
      people
      disagree
      with
      her,
      but
      that
      doesn't
      make
      her
      a
      liar.
      Rabia
      is
      an
      Adnan
      advocate,
      she
      said
      so
      from
      the
      very
      beginning.
      She
      thinks
      he
      is
      innocent,
      and
      there
      is
      nothing
      wrong
      with
      that.
      She
      has
      certainly
      been
      selective
      with
      the
      data
      she
      has
      released,
      focusing
      on
      "X"
      while
      not
      showing
      "Y".
      Other
      have
      found
      "Y"
      that
      undermines
      "X"
      and
      therefor
      Rabia
      is
      a
      liar.
      That
      just
      doesn't
      follow.
      Rabia
      thinks
      he's
      innocent,
      wants
      him
      to
      be
      innocent,
      and
      just
      as
      many
      guilters
      think
      he
      is
      guilty
      and
      wants
      him
      to
      be
      guilty,
      that
      means
      you
      will
      overlook
      or
      minimise
      contradicting
      information,
      happens
      all
      the
      time,
      to
      all
      of
      us.
      Susan
      may
      or
      may
      not
      be
      someone
      that
      was/is
      just
      riding
      on
      this
      for
      attention,
      but
      I've
      so
      far
      not
      seen
      a
      compelling
      argument
      that
      she
      was
      withholding
      or
      excluding
      information
      just
      for
      the
      sake
      of
      it.
      Being
      hand
      in
      hand
      with
      Rabia,
      she
      was
      most
      certainly
      coloured
      by
      that
      early
      on,
      and
      wants
      Adnan
      to
      be
      innocent,
      and
      her
      actions
      follow
      that.
      **Adnan**
      Guilters
      wants
      to
      make
      a
      big
      deal
      out
      of
      what
      Adnan
      has
      said
      that
      "proves"
      he
      is
      guilty,
      but
      I
      can't
      find
      anything
      on
      Serial
      that
      points
      to
      his
      guilt.
      Listening
      to
      the
      podcast
      alone
      won't
      show
      either
      way,
      really.
      When
      he
      gets
      upset
      he
      has
      good
      reason
      to,
      when
      he
      talks
      about
      himself
      it
      is
      clear
      he
      is
      doing
      his
      best
      not
      to
      glorify
      himself
      in
      any
      way.
      In
      fact,
      most
      of
      the
      glorification
      of
      Adnan
      comes
      from
      the
      people
      that
      knew
      him,
      not
      himself.
      But
      I
      also
      don't
      buy
      the
      entire
      "I
      can't
      remember
      much"
      line
      of
      reasoning.
      Do
      I
      think
      Adnan
      is
      lying/withholding?
      Yes,
      you
      don't
      get
      called
      by
      the
      police
      when
      you're
      seventeen
      and
      then
      remember
      anything
      of
      importance
      from
      that
      day.
      I
      just
      can't
      see
      it
      happening.
      On
      the
      other
      hand,
      like
      Sarah
      points
      out
      -
      if
      he
      is
      guilty,
      why
      on
      earth
      would
      he
      allow
      them
      to
      make
      this
      huge
      podcast
      about
      it?
      That
      really
      doesn't
      check
      out
      either.
      It's
      hard
      reconciling
      Adnan's
      actions
      for
      the
      podcast
      with
      a
      guilty
      man.
      As
      Sarah
      said,
      he
      has
      to
      be
      cocky
      as
      hell
      to
      think
      he'd
      get
      away
      with
      it.
      Then
      again,
      like
      the
      Serial
      producer
      said,
      if
      he's
      innocent
      -
      he
      has
      to
      be
      the
      unluckiest
      man
      alive.
      That
      he
      just
      so
      happened
      to
      borrow
      his
      car
      and
      phone
      to
      the
      guy
      that
      was
      later
      going
      to
      frame
      him
      for
      murder?
      Occam's
      razor
      and
      all,
      how
      unlucky
      can
      you
      get?
      **Cell
      records**
      With
      Jay's
      and
      Adnan's
      statements
      about
      their
      whereabouts
      on
      that
      day
      more
      or
      less
      out
      the
      window,
      the
      cell
      record
      and
      their
      location
      doesn't
      have
      much
      value
      to
      me.
      What
      cell
      tower
      was
      being
      used
      gives
      a
      general
      area,
      and
      the
      stories
      we've
      been
      told
      very
      rarely
      line
      up
      with
      those
      general
      areas,
      at
      least
      not
      in
      a
      way
      to
      be
      called
      evidence
      of
      either
      guilt
      or
      innocence.
      I
      don't
      doubt
      the
      veracity
      of
      the
      locations,
      I
      just
      don't
      know
      who
      to
      trust
      when
      it
      comes
      to
      claims
      about
      those
      locations.
      That
      means
      also
      that
      things
      like
      the
      Nisha
      call
      is
      irrelevant
      to
      me.
      Maybe
      Adnan
      called
      her,
      maybe
      he
      didn't,
      but
      it
      doesn't
      mean
      anything
      either
      way.
      **Timelines**
      The
      timelines
      here
      in
      the
      sidebar
      is
      the
      result
      of
      a
      lot
      of
      work,
      and
      it
      seems
      it's
      taken
      as
      gospel
      here.
      Being
      a
      web
      developer,
      I
      can't
      help
      but
      think
      I
      want
      this
      all
      in
      a
      database,
      with
      each
      claim
      properly
      related
      to
      a
      source,
      and
      each
      source
      properly
      weighed.
      So
      if
      there
      is
      a
      claim
      that
      "Adnan
      was
      in
      school
      at
      2:36",
      I
      want
      that
      claim
      to
      have
      a
      source,
      i.e.
      "Testimony
      by
      Asia
      (link)",
      and
      that
      "testimony"
      has
      a
      fixed
      value
      of
      credibility
      (i.e.
      evidence
      trumps
      testimony,
      testimony
      trumps
      heresy
      etc
      etc),
      and
      the
      source
      person
      also
      has
      a
      credibility
      score.
      That
      way
      it
      would
      be
      easier
      to
      build
      a
      timeline
      of
      credible
      events,
      rather
      than
      just
      a
      miss-mash
      of
      Jay's
      forty
      different
      stories,
      someone
      said
      that
      he
      said,
      etc
      etc...
      **So?**
      Oh,
      you
      made
      it
      this
      far?
      Hey!
      :)
      So,
      what
      my
      point?
      Well,
      there
      may
      be
      none,
      I
      may
      just
      be
      venting
      a
      bit.
      I
      just
      read
      thread
      and
      thread
      here
      of
      people
      placing
      way
      too
      much
      significance
      on
      something,
      or
      underplaying
      something
      else.
      I
      think
      it's
      safe
      to
      say
      that
      the
      original
      subreddit
      has
      far
      more
      people
      that
      believe
      he
      is
      innocent,
      while
      this
      group
      has
      far
      more
      that
      believe
      he
      did
      it.
      Both
      places
      have
      tons
      of
      hyperbole
      either
      way,
      and
      it's
      sometimes
      hard
      to
      wade
      through
      it
      all
      to
      find
      what
      is
      real
      and
      verifiable.

      As
      a
      computer
      science
      student,
      the
      thing
      you
      mentioned
      about
      the
      timelines
      that
      you'd
      like
      to
      see
      about
      having
      a
      database
      and
      all
      these
      other
      features,
      and/or
      maybe
      even
      a
      nice
      visual
      to
      go
      with
      it,
      is
      something
      I
      have
      considered
      doing
      as
      one
      of
      my
      next
      projects.
      Sounds
      like
      a
      neat
      idea.
      Yeah,
      and
      it
      should
      be
      crowd-sourced,
      with
      people
      being
      able
      to
      comment
      on
      and
      weigh
      on
      the
      validity
      of
      a
      source
      and/or
      a
      claim.
      Just
      to
      keep
      it
      as
      objective
      as
      possible.
       gt;
      For
      example,
      polices
      files
      indicate
      that
      the
      Nisha
      call
      putting
      Adnan
      and
      Jay
      together
      at
      3:32
      p.m.
      did
      happen
      (as
      you
      can
      see
      in
      the
      sidebar)
      Yeah,
      I've
      always
      had
      problems
      with
      that
      post,
      and
      it's
      a
      perfect
      example
      of
      guilters
      and
      FAP:ers
      both
      being
      selective
      of
      what
      information
      they
      take
      as
      truth.
      If
      you
      want
      to
      claim
      that
      Nisha
      remembers
      "better"
      at
      this
      date
      rather
      than
      on
      another
      date,
      which
      I
      grant
      you
      is
      quite
      possible.
      Then
      you
      can't
      ignore
      "Jay's
      Store"
      and
      only
      focus
      on
      "Day
      or
      two
      after".
      Both
      statements
      are
      in
      the
      same
      quote,
      and
      one
      of
      them
      is
      incorrect.
      If
      you
      want
      to
      bend
      the
      language
      to
      fit
      "Jay's
      store"
      into
      your
      preconceived
      notion
      of
      guilt,
      you
      have
      to
      allow
      the
      same
      "bending
      of
      language"
      for
      the
      "day
      or
      two
      after",
      wouldn't
      you
      agree?
      And
      the
      "fake
      alibi"
      thing
      is
      just
      hilarious,
      that
      Adnan
      or
      Jay
      would
      have
      the
      forethought
      to
      create
      a
      fake
      alibi
      about
      a
      "store"
      job
      that
      doesn't
      yet
      exist
      in
      order
      to
      create
      an
      alibi
      is
      just
      funny.
      There
      seems
      to
      be
      no
      other
      attempts
      of
      them
      trying
      to
      create
      fake
      alibis
      during
      the
      day,
      so
      why
      now?
      Be
      sure
      that
      I'm
      not
      saying
      either
      way.
      Maybe
      the
      Nisha
      call
      was
      on
      the
      thirteenth,
      maybe
      it
      wasn't.
      I
      don't
      think
      it
      show
      either
      guilt
      or
      innocence
      either
      way.
      It
      shows
      that
      someone
      remembers
      something
      incorrectly
      at
      worst.
       gt;
      when
      you
      take
      into
      account
      the
      circumstances
      that
      make
      it
      absurd
      for
      Jay
      to
      have
      done
      it,
      there
      aren't
      any
      other
      reasonable
      possibilities.
      At
      least
      as
      far
      as
      we
      know.
      All
      I'm
      saying
      is
      that
      there
      is
      a
      LOT
      of
      credence
      in
      details
      by
      either
      side
      that
      to
      them
      "proves"
      something.
      But
      actual
      facts
      and
      known
      variables
      are
      pretty
      damn
      low.
      And
      both
      sides
      jump
      on
      small
      things
      and
      blow
      them
      out
      of
      proportion
      :/

      I

      credit
      for
      going

      podcast,
      thinking
      that
      it
      would
      be
      ballsy?
      Well,
      Serial
      did
      that,

      I
      just
      agreed.

      100%
      my
      line
      of
      thinking
      as
      well.
      They
      tapped
      to
      bring
      Jay
      back
      on
      track,
      not
      to
      necessarily
      tell
      him
      what
      to
      say.
      They
      had
      an
      outline
      they
      had
      worked
      out
      with
      Jay,
      then
      they
      taped
      the
      testimony
      and
      when
      Jay
      went
      off
      on
      one
      of
      his
      many
      many
      mistakes
      and
      tangents,
      they
      had
      to
      lead
      him
      back
      to
      what
      he
      had
      already
      said.
      I'm
      certain
      that
      some
      things
      were
      introduced
      incorrectly
      by
      the
      police
      as
      well,
      and
      Jay
      having
      to
      fit
      his
      story
      to
      mistaken
      cell
      towers
      and
      things
      like
      that,
      but
      it's
      no
      news
      that
      Jay
      made
      up
      large
      parts
      (or
      most
      parts)
      of
      his
      testimony,
      but
      whether
      that
      was
      pushed
      by
      the
      police
      or
      by
      his
      own
      reluctance
      to
      say
      things
      out
      right
      is
      another
      question.
      It's
      not
      a
      police
      conspiracy
      at
      least.
      Now
      does
      it
      say
      much
      about
      innocence
      or
      guilt,
      only
      that
      Jay
      had
      a
      hard
      time
      keeping
      all
      his
      stories
      straight.

      I
      listened

      *again*
      now,
      I
      listened

      Instead
      of
      having
      an
      honest
      conversation
      about
      Nisha,
      Sarah
      Koenig
      sent
      Dana
      to
      some
      obscure
      TOS
      contract
      for
      AT amp;T,
      in
      search
      of
      some,
      any
      remote
      possibility
      that
      Adnan
      might
      be
      telling
      the
      truth
      when
      he
      says
      he
      didn't
      make
      that
      call.
      Koenig
      spent
      half
      an
      episode
      on
      this,
      when
      she
      had
      Nisha's
      interview
      right
      in
      front
      of
      her.
      That's
      only
      a
      bombshell
      if
      you
      take
      "a
      day
      or
      two"
      as
      gospel
      while
      ignoring
      the
      "At
      Jay's
      store".
      That's
      the
      problem
      with
      extremist
      "guilters"
      and
      "FAP:ers",
      you
      see
      only
      what
      you
      want
      to
      see.

      think
      increases
      the
      odds
      that
      he

      I
      just

      You

      is
      100%
      fact,
      what
      she
      recollects
      of
      the
      day/days
      may
      be
      true
      as
      far
      as
      she

      of
      all
      her
      information
      comes
      from
      Jay
      again.
      Her
      only
      "implication"
      would
      be
      that
      she
      helped

      tools,

      Accept

      men,
      especially
      young
      men
      in
      love
      who
      have
      had
      few

      partners,
      are
      DEVASTATED
      by
      being
      dumped
      and
      then
      seeing
      their
      ex
      very
      quickly
      start
      having
      sex
      with
      another
      guy.
      It's
      gut-wrenching.
      A
      guy
      murdering
      his
      ex
      girlfriend
      in
      such
      a
      scenario
      is
      not
      at
      all
      unbelievable.
      It's
      rare,
      but
      murder
      is
      rare.
      I
      have
      no
      doubt
      that
      things
      like
      this
      happens
      all
      the
      time,
      but
      it's
      hardly
      proof
      of
      guilt
      that
      it
      CAN
      happen.
       gt;
      Admit
      that
      the
      police
      did
      their
      due
      diligence
      in
      interviewing
      and
      investigating
      all
      obvious
      suspects,
      including
      Don.
      If
      my
      memory
      serves
      me
      correctly,
      both
      the
      podcast,
      and
      especially
      the
      podcast
      spin-offs,
      peddled
      the
      falsehood
      that
      they
      didn't
      investigate
      Don
      Serial
      didn't,
      Undisclosed
      did.
       gt;
      Pay
      close
      attention
      to
      the
      way
      that
      the
      police
      didn't
      immediately
      pounce
      on
      anyone,
      they
      interviewed
      and
      investigated
      suspects,
      finally
      got
      a
      subpoena
      for
      Adnan's
      phone
      records,
      and
      only
      then
      were
      they
      led
      to
      Jenn,
      who
      was
      interrogated
      by
      police
      and
      didn't
      admit
      to
      any
      knowledge
      of
      anything,
      but
      then
      lawyered-up
      and
      came
      back
      in
      the
      next
      day
      to
      make
      an
      official
      statement,
      which
      consisted
      of
      her
      telling
      them
      what
      Jay
      had
      told
      her
      about
      the
      murder
      Indeed,
      what
      Jay
      had
      told
      her.
       gt;
      Now
      that
      they
      had
      something
      on
      Jay,
      they
      press
      him
      with
      the
      info
      they
      had
      gotten
      from
      Jenn,
      and
      that's
      when
      he
      tells
      them
      where
      the
      car
      is
      at.
      Only
      from
      Jay
      were
      they
      able
      to
      find
      the
      car.
      True,
      and
      in
      all
      of
      this
      -
      this
      is
      the
      only
      thing
      that
      gives
      Jay
      any
      semblance
      of
      credibility.
      Everything
      else
      that
      comes
      out
      of
      his
      mouth
      is
      a
      jumbled
      mess
      that
      doesn't
      fit
      reality.
       gt;
      And
      then
      there's
      the
      most
      damning
      fact
      that
      provides
      a
      backdrop
      to
      all
      of
      this:
      Adnan
      admits
      that
      he
      loaned
      his
      car
      to
      Jay
      that
      day,
      and
      say
      what
      you
      want
      about
      he
      cell
      phone
      evidence,
      it
      shows
      that
      they
      were
      together
      all
      throughout
      the
      day.
      I
      know.
      He's
      either
      guilty
      of
      a
      crime
      no
      one
      can
      accurately
      describe,
      including
      the
      guy
      that
      supposedly
      helped
      him
      -
      or
      he's
      innocent
      and
      the
      unluckiest
      guy
      alive.

      I #8217;ll
      blame
      the
      restaurant.
      I
      don #8217;t
      care
      if
      free
      refills
      of
      soda
      was
      withdrawn
      because
      it
      was
      abused
      by
      some,
      it #8217;s
      cheap
      and
      since
      I #8217;m
      the
      victim,
      not
      the
      cause,
      I
      don #8217;t
      care
      what
      the
      cause
      is.
      The
      one
      making
      the
      decision
      is
      the
      restaurant,
      the
      one
      that
      have
      pull
      one-ply
      toilet
      paper
      squares
      is
      me.

      I
      used
      it
      for
      the
      first
      time
      yesterday,
      at
      a
      dance
      exhibition
      where
      my
      daughter
      was
      participating,
      focus
      was
      as
      good
      as
      on
      a
      Nikon
      most
      of
      the
      time,
      there
      was
      a
      specific
      number
      where
      there
      was
      a
      lot
      of
      red
      (dim)
      light
      on
      the
      scene
      where
      it
      was
      hunting
      hopelessly.
      Overall,
      in
      dim
      light,
      it
      may
      be
      a
      bit
      poorer
      than
      natively,
      but
      I'd
      say
      it's
      really
      good
      overall.
      And
      the
      dance
      routine
      had
      some
      really
      dim
      (i.e.
      ISO
      12800)
      moments,
      yet
      it
      managed
      pretty
      good.
      Is
      it
      as
      good
      as
      a
      native
      lens?
      Hard
      to
      say,
      but
      it
      managed
      really
      well.

      I
      shot
      some
      pictures
      from
      a
      dance
      routine
      yesterday,
      I
      haven't
      offloaded
      them
      from
      the
      camera
      yet.
      I'll
      post
      some
      when
      I
      do.
      Far
      from
      all
      were
      perfect
      and
      the
      ISO
      is
      really
      high
      due
      to
      the
      dim
      lighting,
      but
      when
      I
      shoot
      natively
      with
      my
      Nikon,
      far
      from
      all
      is
      good
      then
      too.

      Don #8217;t
      know
      about
      higher
      resolution
      cameras.
      Could
      a
      human
      driver
      drive
      the
      car
      using
      only
      those
      cameras?
      If
      yes,
      then
      it #8217;s
      just
      a
      matter
      of
      AI
      +
      processing
      power.
      I #8217;m
      sure
      Tesla
      could
      offer
      upgrades
      to
      the
      CPU
      when
      it
      has
      become
      too

      to

      black

      He
      clearly
      wanted

      it

      it
      then
      turns
      into
      a

      something
      went
      wrong
      and
      the
      integer
      it
      got
      was
      -1

      Just

      of
      one
      of
      the
      first

      Volvo
      XC90
      T8
      and
      really

      Not

      I
      think
      it's
      really
      nice.
      The
      Volvo
      system
      has
      four
      horizontal
      areas
      on
      a
      fairly
      large
      screen,
      from
      top
      to
      bottom:
      navigation,
      media,
      phone
      and
      app.
      So
      when
      I
      start
      CarPlay,
      it
      loads
      in
      the
      bottom
      panel,
      while
      the
      three
      above
      gets
      minimised.
      I
      swipe
      left
      to
      get
      to
      more
      apps,
      and
      ship
      right
      to
      get
      to
      car
      functions.
      It's
      pretty
      sweet

      Yes,
      even
      in
      "pure"
      the
      gas
      engine
      will
      kick
      in
      if
      you
      floor
      it.
      The
      electric
      motor
      only
      has
      87
      HP
      but
      tons
      of
      torque
      so
      perfect
      for
      getting
      rolling
      quickly,
      but
      if
      you
      want
      to
      keep
      accelerating,
      the
      gas
      engine
      needs
      to
      kick
      in.
      You
      have
      a
      visual
      indication
      of
      how
      much
      electric
      power
      you're
      using
      and
      at
      which
      point
      the
      gas
      engine
      will
      kick
      in,
      so
      you
      can
      always
      see
      when
      and
      if
      it
      will
      happen

      I'm
      the
      kind

      Thanks!
      This
      is
      the
      second
      table
      I've
      done
      this
      with,
      and
      I
      really
      think
      it
      raises
      the
      style
      and
      value.
      We
      certainly
      had
      a
      "white
      and
      fresh"
      style
      going
      for
      a
      number
      of
      years
      and
      I
      grew
      very
      tired
      of
      it,
      so
      back
      to
      rustic
      now

      Haha
      no,
      I
      really
      tried
      to
      cut
      a
      veneer
      out
      of
      old
      pallet
      wood
      but
      it
      cracked
      on
      me
      when
      bending
      due
      to
      the
      knots.
      So
      I
      used
      some
      cutoff
      fresh
      pine
      lumber
      and
      cut
      a
      thin
      veneer
      that
      I
      dunked
      in
      water
      for
      a
      few
      days
      before
      it
      allowed
      me
      to
      bend
      it
      without
      cracking.
      It #8217;s
      about
      four
      mm
      thick.
      I
      then
      used
      a
      torch
      to
      burn
      it
      to
      match
      the
      older
      en
      rougher
      look
      of
      the
      top.

      Nah
      it #8217;s

      So
      I'm
      having
      the
      strangest
      problem.
      I
      am
      currently
      being
      SYN
      flooded,
      so
      I
      wrote
      a
      script
      to
      track
      and
      `DROP`
      (via
      `iptables`)
      the
      IP's
      that
      were
      flooding
      me,
      but
      it
      didn't
      help,
      and
      the
      problem
      is
      that
      iptables
      flushes
      itself
      some
      every
      ten
      seconds
      it
      seems.
      So
      I
      run
      the
      script,
      several
      rules
      are
      added
      and
      `iptables
      -L`
      shows
      them.
      Wait
      a
      few
      seconds
      and
      run
      `iptables
      -L`
      again
      and
      they're
      all
      gone.
      I've
      obviously
      checked
      my
      crontabs
      for
      root
      and
      for
      the
      system,
      and
      nothing
      touches
      `iptables`,
      also,
      crontab
      runs
      as
      most
      every
      minute,
      and
      this
      is
      done
      much
      more
      often.
      I'm
      at
      a
      loss
      here,
      really.
      I've
      also
      turned
      on
      SYN
      cookies
      in
      sysctl
      but
      that
      hasn't
      helped.
      I'm
      running
      Debian
      7.7
      (wheezy)
      and
      I
      have
      a
      plan
      to
      upgrade,
      but
      I
      need
      to
      address
      this
      problem
      faster
      than
      I
      can
      upgrade.
      Is
      there
      any
      log
      I
      could
      see
      when
      iptables
      is
      changed
      and
      by
      what?

      Ys,
      it
      doesn't
      matter
      if
      I
      add
      it
      manually
      or
      via
      the
      script,
      the
      iptables
      just
      clears
      (i.e.
      like
      `iptables
      -F`)
      after
      a
      few
      seconds.
      It's
      so
      weird...

      So
      xtables-multi
      is
      just
      what
      iptables
      links
      to,
      it's
      a
      binary
      for
      lots
      of
      different
      iptables
      functions.
      So
      the
      audit
      could
      just
      as
      easily
      just
      say
      "/sbin/iptables"...
      So
      that
      didn't

      Yes,
      I
      have
      new
      hardware
      coming
      in
      2-3
      weeks,
      and
      I
      will
      run
      Buster
      on
      that
      one.
      I
      just
      need
      to
      upgrade
      current
      to
      see
      if
      that
      solves
      my
      iptables
      problems
      which
      remains
      unsolved...
      :/

      Indeed

      and
      I

      my
      upgrade
      plan
      includes
      Jessie
      - gt;
      Stretch
      as
      well,
      so...

      Yeah,
      that's

      new
      ppid
      every
      time,
      so
      that's
      no
      help
      either,
      but
      thanks...

      I
      probably
      will
      when
      I
      go
      all-in
      on
      Buster,
      but
      I'm
      keeping
      to
      iptables
      for
      the
      moment

      Just
      to
      give
      some
      feedback
      here
      and
      a
      great
      thank
      you
      for
      your
      help.
      I
      did
      this
      and
      managed
      to
      backtrack
      an
      iptables
      call
      from
      a
      process
      called
      "/usr/sbin/cronologd"
      that
      seemingly
      reset
      the
      iptables.
      Now,
      I
      run
      cronolog
      for
      Apache,
      but
      that
      is
      in
      /usr/bin/cronolog
      -
      so
      that
      got
      me
      worried
      -
      what
      is
      this
      /usr/sbin/cronologd?
      Google
      yields
      exactly
      no
      results
      so
      I
      have
      to
      dig
      deeper...
      Hmmm
      :/

      I
      never
      know,
      is
      reddit
      one
      of
      those
      sites
      or
      not?
      I
      mean,
      I
      get
      that #8217;s
      it #8217;s
      social,

      I
      also
      assume

      the
      stress
      you
      get
      from
       #8220;social
      sites #8221;
      are
      more
      likely
      to
      be
      tied
      to
      seeing
      people
      you
      know
      seemingly
      have
      a
      better
      life
      or
      look
      better
      than
      you.

      Well,
      a
      SR-71
      can
      fly
      at
      Mach
      3,
      ramming
      one
      of
      those
      into
      an
      airplane
      carrier
      at
      full
      speed
      would
      surely
      make
      it
      go
      boom.
      So
      why
      don #8217;t
      the
      military
      do
      that?
      Well
      because
      it
      costs
      money.
      And
      they
      have
      bombs
      that
      are
      cheaper
      while
      doing
      less
      damage.
