    <TEXT>Much enjoyment from this. Thank you!!! Left with a question, though: not a hunter, but is it routine to shoot arrows so close (referring to the second one). Would think a knife to slit at close range would be preferred. But truly good read, thank you.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>September was amazing for live shows- caught Iron Maiden the first week, last week got to see the Misfits with most of the original members (Danzig!!!) , and just last night saw Amon Amarth- who opened but At the Gates, an incredible band I never thought I #8217;d see.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Your ten year old sounds advanced for his age- I would think this is the perfect age to start reading the classics: Poe, Lovecraft, Jackson, etc. If it #8217;s really just sex that you want to downplay, not creepiness. I still don #8217;t like a lotta sex in my books, actually. Edit SHIRLEY Jackson.</TEXT>
