      Having
      graduated
      from
      DX
      to
      FX,
      I
      am
      completely
      floored
      by
      the
      detail
      the
      D850
      is
      capable
      of
      capturing.
      The
      Nikkor
      24-120
      f/4.0
      is
      a
      good
      lens
      with
      limitations,
      which
      if
      you
      keep
      in
      mind
      can
      do
      very
      well.

      enough.

      a

      a
      fling
      with
      the

      to
      bring
      out
      the

      of

      Through

      I
      have
      a
      Karen
      in
      my
      orbit.
      I
      would
      not
      describe
      her
      as
      a
      friend,
      more
      of
      an
      second
      degree
      acquaintance
      if
      I
      was
      pressed.
      To
      be
      honest,
      she
      might
      feel
      the
      same
      way
      about
      me.
      I
      am
      a
      high
      functioning
      autistic
      and
      can
      be
      a
      bit
      "opaque"
      to
      people
      who
      find
      me
      a
      a
      hard
      read
      at
      much
      of
      the
      time.
      She
      has
      never
      been
      favorite
      company
      for
      me
      as
      she
      can
      kind
      of
      loud
      and
      boisterous.
      Sort

      a
      roomy
      alpha
      female
      in
      any
      given
      crowd.
      She
      is
      educated,
      possessing
      a
      masters
      degree
      in
      something
      from
      someplace,
      of
      which
      I
      am
      not
      truly
      interested
      in
      finding
      out
      about.
      I
      know
      this
      as
      she
      has
      been
      known
      to
      lecture
      people
      about
      everything
      from
      education,
      politics,
      medicine,
      etc
      to
      my
      field
      (aeronautics)
      and
      what
      they
      are
      doing
      wrong.
      When
      contradicted,
      she
      will
      lend
      force
      to
      her
      opinion
      with
      "I
      have
      a
      master's".
      For
      all
      this
      education,
      her
      belief
      system
      is

      with
      promising
      futures.
      One
      of
      the
      step
      children
      is
      (was...
      more
      to
      follow)
      a
      medicated
      schizophrenic.
      The
      child
      they
      share
      between
      them
      is
      an
      utter
      mess.
      It
      seems
      the
      pathology
      of
      a
      Karen
      is
      to
      excuse
      a
      problem
      child
      with
      little
      discipline
      with
      anything
      other
      than
      bad
      parenting.
      The
      son
      is
      undisciplined,
      slow
      witted,
      socially
      disengaged,
      overweight
      and
      rude.
      How
      rude
      do
      you
      have
      to
      be
      for
      someone
      like
      me
      to
      notice.
      In
      middle
      school
      his
      mother
      decided
      his
      poor
      grades,
      social
      issues
      and
      weight
      were
      caused
      by
      an
      undiagnosed
      gluten
      allergy
      and
      changed
      his
      diet.
      His
      only
      real
      friend
      was
      an
      Xbox
      which
      prompted
      this
      Karen
      to
      announce
      her
      son
      was
      going
      to
      be
      a
      professional
      gamer.
      I
      guess
      that
      is
      one
      way
      to
      cover
      your
      inability
      to
      engage
      your
      own
      child
      on
      any
      meaningful
      level.
      By
      the
      time
      he
      hit
      highschool,
      he
      was
      morbidly
      obese,
      a
      social
      outcaste
      and
      a
      failing
      student.
      She
      decided
      now
      he
      had
      a
      learning
      disability,
      which
      is
      possible,
      decided
      to
      homeschool
      him
      and
      treat
      him
      with
      essential
      oils.
      She
      also
      announced
      her
      son
      was
      going
      to
      be
      a
      professional
      football
      player.
      This
      of
      course
      was
      the
      latest
      excuse
      for
      obesity
      and
      academic
      disinterest.
      Homeschooling
      consisted
      of
      slathering
      him
      up
      with
      oil,
      then
      leaving
      him
      at
      home
      with
      the
      Xbox
      for
      ten
      hours
      a
      day.
      The
      stepson
      is
      the
      real
      victim
      here.
      He's
      the
      oldest
      of
      the
      children
      around
      22
      years
      old
      and
      developed
      schizophrenia
      in
      his
      late
      teens.
      I
      have
      never
      really
      met
      him
      but
      I've
      been
      told
      he
      does
      well
      with
      his
      medications.
      The
      father
      and
      biological
      mother
      have
      gone
      to
      bat
      for
      him
      and
      worked
      hard
      to
      get
      the
      resources
      necessary
      for
      him
      to
      function.
      For
      most
      of
      his
      life
      he
      lived
      with
      his
      biological
      mother
      in
      Texas,
      but
      move
      in
      with
      his
      father
      and
      stepmother
      when
      he
      was
      21.
      This
      is
      where
      schizophrenia
      meets
      New
      Age
      Google
      Guru.
      She
      somehow
      got
      it
      in
      her
      head
      all
      his
      problems
      were
      treatable
      with
      dietary
      changes
      and
      essential
      oils.
      Down
      the
      toilet
      goes
      the
      med's
      and
      out
      comes
      the
      gluten
      free
      diet
      and
      essential
      oils.
      The
      medications
      a
      schizophrenic
      takes
      for
      their
      condition
      is
      not
      something
      you
      just
      stop
      taking.
      You're
      on
      them
      and
      you
      stay
      on
      them
      until
      a
      physician
      says
      otherwise.
      The
      combination
      of
      having
      his
      meds
      flushed,
      served
      crap
      food
      and
      being
      rubbed
      down
      with
      fancy
      cooking
      oil
      caused
      a
      psychotic
      break
      and
      he
      beat
      his
      mothers
      face
      to
      a
      pulp.
      By
      the
      time
      the
      police
      got
      to
      the
      house,
      he
      was
      completely
      canonic.
      He
      was
      hospitalized,
      placed
      back
      on
      his
      medication
      and
      sent
      back
      to
      Texas.
      The
      Karen
      of
      our
      story
      ended
      up
      with
      multiple
      surgeries
      to
      rebuild
      her
      face.
      I
      must
      admit
      the
      doctor
      who
      is
      doing
      the
      work
      has
      some
      impressive
      skills.
      She
      only
      has
      two
      complaints.
      1.
      She
      wished
      she
      had
      more
      time
      to
      help
      her
      schizophrenic
      stepson
      get
      off
      the
      meds
      with
      diet,
      exercise
      and
      essential
      oils
      to
      lead
      a
      normal
      life
      and
      2.
      The
      medical
      bills
      are
      a
      fucking
      bitch.
      When
      she
      said
      this,
      I
      wasn't
      the
      only
      one
      in
      the
      room
      having
      issues
      with
      eye
      contact.

      I
      was
      diagnosed
      later
      in
      life
      when
      referred
      to
      a
      psychologist
      for
      PTSD
      related
      symptoms.
      When

      to

      a

      asked
      how

      to
      which
      I
      replied
      about

      They
      looked
      at
      each
      other,
      shrugged
      and
      turned
      to

      One
      of
      my
      hobbies
      is
      collected
      cameras
      and
      putting
      them
      to
      use.
      In
      this
      case,
      I
      paid
      around
      $25.00
      in
      a
      thrift
      store
      near
      me.
      It
      looked
      to
      be
      in
      working
      order,
      so
      I
      loaded
      a
      roll
      of
      Ilford
      HP5
      and
      used
      my
      iPhone
      as
      a
      light
      meter.
      Fun
      fact;
      the
      max
      speed
      is
      100,
      aperture
      f/32.
      You
      don't
      realize
      how
      much
      handholding
      is
      going
      on
      with
      the

      You
      really

      stuff
      back

      First,
      good
      shot.
      Second,
      Not
      to
      be
      a
      snot,
      but
      as
      a
      closeted
      Petrolhead,
      I
      feel
      an
      unnatural
      need
      to
      point
      out
      the
      Porsche
      911
      was
      first
      produced
      in
      1964.
      Not
      that
      I #8217;m
      a
      big
      fan
      of
      the
      911.
      Being
      rear
      engined,
      it
      suffers
      dramatically
      from
      over
      steer
      in
      a
      turn.
      That
      tail
      swings
      like
      a
      pendulum.

      I
      agree.
      A-1
      is
      a
      great
      consumer
      camera.
      I
      have
      had

      I

      Reddit

      it #8217;s
      too
      big
      (over

      megabytes)
      and
      tells
      me
      to
      down
      size
      it.
      From
      mobile
      I #8217;ve
      not
      experienced
      this
      and
      since

      had

      to
      to
      my

      I
      uploaded

      this
      format
      and
      thought,
      considering
      the
      money
      I
      had
      laid
      down,
      I #8217;d
      better
      find
      out
      more
      about
      this
      image
      option.
      It
      took
      a
      bit
      of
      lurking
      around
      on
      the
      Internet
      until
      I
      found
      many
      describing
      it
      as
      a
      digital
      negative.
      Many
      years
      later,
      I
      think
      that
      is
      over
      simplistic.
      A
      DSLR
      can
      be
      overwhelming
      when
      you
      first
      look
      over
      the
      options.
      I
      still
      find
      myself
      consulting
      notes
      and
      dog
      eared
      manuals
      on
      changing
      settings
      and
      enabling
      capabilities.
      I
      have
      been
      shooting
      SLR #8217;s
      since
      the
      1970 #8217;s
      and
      understand
      the
      trifecta
      of
      ISO,
      shutter,
      and
      aperture.
      White
      Balance
      was
      something
      you
      worried
      about
      when
      selecting
      film.
      Sharpness
      was
      making
      sure
      the
      lens
      was
      in
      focus #8230;.
      I #8217;m
      feeling
      old.
      So
      you
      have
      dropped
      anywhere
      from
      $500
      to
      $3500
      on
      a
      DSLR
      and
      God
      bless
      you.
      You
      have
      in
      your
      hands
      a
      lot
      of
      firepower
      compared
      to
      that
      1980 #8217;s
      Minolta
      (my
      second
      SLR)
      and
      you
      could
      just
      go
      on
      shooting
      in
      auto
      mode
      and
      hope
      for
      the
      best.
      But
      you
      are
      not
      going
      to
      get
      the
      most
      out
      of
      a
      DSLR
      unless
      you
      are
      willing
      to
      do
      some
      research
      and
      a
      bit
      of
      trial
      and
      error.
      One
      of
      them
      is
      taking
      advantage
      of
      the
      RAW
      file
      format
      proprietary
      to
      your
      camera.
      Most
      of
      the
      major
      camera
      manufactures
      have
      their
      own
      proprietary
      format
      for
      RAW
      files.
      My
      Nikon
      used
      the
      NEF
      extension
      to
      differentiate
      it
      from
      the
      JPG
      file
      it
      creates
      simultaneously.
      Canon #8217;s
      extension
      is
      CRW,
      Sony #8217;s
      extensions
      can
      be
      ARW,
      SRF
      or
      SR2.
      There
      is
      little
      difference
      between
      the
      extensions
      really,
      though
      there
      is
      not
      much
      in
      the
      way
      of
      standardization
      of
      RAW
      files
      either.
      Trying
      to
      find
      an
      overall
      description
      of
      what
      goes
      into
      these
      files
      can
      be
      problematic.
      There
      is
      no
      true
      single
      format
      and
      sometimes
      each
      are
      radically
      different
      from
      other
      manufactures,
      to
      the
      point
      of
      encrypting
      certain
      tags
      to
      prevent
      compatibility
      with
      third
      party
      tools
      accessing
      them.
      Formats
      from
      a
      single
      manufacture
      can
      vary
      from
      camera
      model
      to
      camera
      model.
      This
      can
      be
      disconcerting
      for
      photographers
      who
      worry
      their
      RAW
      images
      might
      become
      inaccessible
      someday,
      should
      operating
      systems
      change
      and
      RAW
      file
      formats
      end
      up
      being
      dropped
      by
      the
      manufacturer.
      Manufacturers
      have
      a
      tendency
      to
      clam
      up
      when
      asked
      about
      what
      goes
      on
      inside
      the
      camera
      to
      produce
      the
      RAW
      files.
      While
      all
      the
      camera
      manufacturers
      provide
      computer
      software
      that
      can
      read,
      duplicate
      and
      modify
      their
      RAW
      file
      formats,
      third
      party
      vendors
      often
      have
      to
      decipher
      what
      is
      going
      on
      and
      occasionally
      provide
      updates
      to
      their
      software
      to
      improve
      compatibility
      with
      each
      of
      these
      competing
      formats.
      I
      know
      Adobe
      is
      always
      sending
      down
      updates
      for
      RAW
      file
      compatibility.
      Now
      that
      I
      have
      talked
      down
      RAW
      files,
      time
      for
      me
      to
      talk
      about
      the
      benefits
      of
      saving
      your
      images
      in
      RAW
      format.
      When
      you
      snap
      that
      photo,
      your
      DSLR
      has
      a
      lot
      of
      work
      to
      do.
      First
      thing
      it
      does
      is
      decode
      the
      image
      data
      from
      the
      image
      sensor
      for
      compression
      purposes.
      Compare
      the
      size
      of
      a
      JPG
      to
      a
      TIFF
      file
      and
      you
      will
      understand
      how
      important
      this
      is.
      Then
      the
      camera
      processor
      starts
      looking
      for
      defective
      pixels.
      This
      is
      the
      same
      as
      having
      a
      dead
      pixel
      on
      your
      monitor.
      Sometimes
      a
      pixel
      might
      just
      misfire
      or
      go
      missing.
      The
      camera
      processor
      identifies
      these
      mistakes
      and
      then
      interpolates
      from
      nearby
      pixels
      as
      to
      what
      is
      supposed
      to
      be
      there.
      Most
      of
      the
      time,
      this
      is
      just
      an
      error
      caused
      by
      noise.
      The
      next
      photo
      and
      the
      pixel
      will
      be
      fine.
      Even
      if
      it
      is
      a
      dead
      pixel
      in
      the
      sensor,
      you #8217;ll
      never
      notice
      as
      it
      has
      been
      removed
      by
      the
      processor.
      White
      balancing
      is
      next.
      I
      can
      spend
      the
      rest
      of
      my
      life
      talking
      about
      white
      balance.
      The
      processor
      begins
      to
      determine
      the
      proper
      color
      temperature
      of
      the
      light
      that
      was
      used
      when
      the
      photo
      was
      taken.
      Most
      of
      the
      time,
      the
      processor
      gets
      it
      right,
      but
      sometimes #8230;..
      meh.
      Now
      the
      image
      is
      interpolated
      in
      a
      matrix
      of
      colored
      pixels
      (demosaicing)
      and
      filtering
      followed
      by
      noise
      reduction
      where
      there
      is
      a
      trade
      off
      between
      detail
      and
      color
      smoothing
      through
      removing
      small
      fluctuations
      in
      color
      variations.
      I
      don #8217;t
      like
      noise
      reduction,
      at
      least
      at
      this
      stage.
      I
      think
      it
      robs
      me
      of
      image
      sharpness
      and
      usually
      I
      turn
      it
      off #8230;
      but
      I
      digress.
      Now
      the
      camera
      processor
      translates
      the
      color
      from
      the
      native
      color
      space
      to
      the
      output
      color
      space.
      I
      like
      my
      images
      in
      Adobe
      RGB
      when
      I
      am
      thinking
      about
      hard
      copy
      printing.
      Most
      people
      prefer
      sRBG
      for
      viewing
      on
      their
      computer
      monitors.
      Both
      of
      these
      are
      controlled
      by
      user
      settings
      and
      it
      is
      important
      to
      understand
      these
      formats.
      The
      image
      is
      then
      rendered
      to
      the
      JPG
      format
      and
      for
      most
      people
      that
      is
      fine.
      I
      set
      my
      camera
      to
      create
      both
      a
      JPG
      and
      a
      RAW
      file.
      In
      the
      RAW
      format,
      most
      cameras
      save
      these
      setting
      in
      the
      file,
      but
      defer
      the
      processing.
      This
      leaves
      some
      extra,
      but
      in
      many
      cases,
      worthwhile
      work
      for
      the
      photographer.
      There
      are
      many
      advantages
      to
      saving
      a
      RAW
      file.
      A
      RAW
      file
      has
      many
      more
      shades
      of
      color
      compared
      to
      a
      JPG.
      Most
      cameras
      save
      the
      unprocessed
      image
      in
      12
      to
      14
      bits
      of
      color
      information
      meaning
      between
      4096
      to
      16384
      shades
      of
      color
      per
      channel.
      A
      higher
      quality
      image
      is
      also
      possible
      thanks
      to
      the
      ability
      to
      apply
      gamma
      correction,
      demosaicing,
      white
      balance,
      brightness
      and
      contrast
      before
      generating
      RGB
      pixel
      values.
      Some
      third
      party
      programs
      apply
      a
      more
      accurate
      method
      of
      constructing
      the
      final
      image
      from
      the
      setting
      and
      RAW
      format
      than
      the
      camera
      might
      be
      capable
      of.
      You
      can
      also
      determine
      the
      color
      space.
      sRBG
      for
      the
      Internet
      or
      Adobe
      RGB
      for
      printing.
      And
      here
      is
      what
      makes
      them
      all
      the
      more
      important
      to
      me;
      changes
      to
      the
      RAW
      file
      are
      non-destrucatable.
      By
      saving
      the
      file
      or
      converting
      it
      to
      JPG
      or
      TIFF,
      you
      have
      not
      altered
      the
      RAW
      file.
      If
      later
      you
      decide
      you
      need
      it
      in
      a
      different
      color
      space
      for
      printing,
      or
      the
      white
      balance
      is
      just
      a
      bit
      off,
      the
      RAW
      file
      is
      still
      ready
      for
      you
      to
      modify
      or
      reset
      and
      start
      again.
      I
      have
      sat
      on
      RAW
      files
      for
      years
      waiting
      for
      a
      Photoshop
      plugin
      or
      technique
      to
      show
      itself
      to
      save
      a
      RAW
      file
      from
      the
      delete
      key.
      There
      are
      a
      few
      drawbacks
      to
      using
      RAW
      files.
      The
      most
      obvious
      is
      the
      size
      of
      the
      file,
      which
      can
      be
      as
      much
      as
      6
      times
      the
      size
      of
      a
      JPG.
      That
      means
      less
      photos
      on
      a
      SD
      card.
      Then,
      as
      mentioned
      before,
      there
      is
      no
      accepted
      standard
      between
      camera
      manufactures
      as
      far
      as
      format,
      though
      DNG
      is
      gaining
      some
      ground,
      but
      acceptance
      is
      being
      slowed
      by
      pushback
      from
      manufacturers.
      Finally
      workflow.
      Processing
      RAW
      files
      can
      slow
      down
      editing
      of
      images
      considerably,
      though
      some
      software
      allows
      for
      batch
      processing
      and
      syncing
      of
      changes
      among
      several
      images
      at
      a
      time.
      This
      is
      the
      case
      for
      Adobe
      Lightroom.
      So,
      I
      guess
      the
      point
      of
      this
      article
      is
       #8220;if
      you
      have
      it,
      use
      it. #8221;

      My
      wife
      and
      I
      left
      London
      very
      early
      in
      the
      morning
      for
      Salisbury
      to
      avoid
      congestion
      and
      ended
      up
      at
      Stonehenge
      just
      as
      it
      was
      opening.
      This
      was
      very
      fortunate
      as
      I
      was
      able
      to
      get
      an
      image
      before
      a
      measurable
      fraction
      of
      the
      European
      Union
      showed
      up
      to
      clog
      up
      the
      pathway
      around
      the
      site.
      I
      decided
      on
      my
      composition
      then
      stood
      there
      for
      easily
      20
      min
      waiting
      for
      a
      few
      tourist
      to
      exit
      the
      frame
      before
      doing
      the
      capture.
      There
      were
      still
      a
      few
      of
      my
      fellow
      travelers
      in
      the
      image,
      but
      I
      was
      confident
      I
      could
      remove
      them
      in
      post.
      Shooting
      in
      Britain
      is
      hit
      and
      miss.
      Even
      in
      the
      fairer
      months,
      you
      get
      about
      two
      weeks
      of
      rain
      on
      average.
      I
      already
      knew
      this
      was
      going
      to
      be
      monochrome
      as
      the
      lighting
      was
      flat.
      I
      also
      didn't
      want
      another
      trite
      Stonehenge
      photo
      to
      match
      the
      20,000
      images
      already
      out
      there.
      I
      first
      edited
      the
      NEF
      File
      in
      Photoshop
      to
      remove
      a
      few
      bodies,
      as
      well
      as
      a
      low
      lying
      rope
      barrier
      used
      to
      keep
      visitors
      off
      the
      henge
      proper.
      In
      Lightroom,
      I
      set
      up
      the
      initial
      monochrome
      tonal
      range.
      I
      didn't
      use
      a
      red
      filter
      as
      I
      disagree
      with
      how
      it
      is
      implemented
      by
      Adobe.
      I
      then
      added
      a
      top
      and
      bottom
      graduated
      exposurer.
      After
      this,
      a
      few
      more
      tweaks
      and
      applied
      a
      printer
      profile
      for
      output.
      *
      As
      HDR
      would
      have
      been
      interesting
      as
      well
      as
      provide
      an
      additional
      image
      to
      work
      with,
      but
      you
      are
      forbidden
      to
      use
      a
      tripod
      around
      areas
      like
      this.

      Yeah,
      I
      jumped
      a
      step.
      I
      always
      import
      into
      Lightroom,
      then
      right
      click
      to
      edit
      in
      Photoshop.
      This
      creates
      a
      TIF
      file
      which
      I
      edited
      out
      the
      bodies.
      I
      start
      out
      in
      Lightroom
      so
      much,
      I
      often
      forget
      PS
      is
      a
      separate
      program
      altogether.
      I
      do
      recommend
      you
      use
      TIF
      files
      rather
      than
      JPG
      as
      there
      is
      an
      enormous
      amount
      of
      information
      in
      comparison.

      The
      Crow
      is
      the
      bird
      on
      the
      arm.
      The
      first
      three
      enlisted
      ranks
      are
      simple
      hash
      marks
      .
      When
      you
      make
      petty
      officer,
      you
      get
      the
      bird
      (
      Crow)
      and
      the
      red
      chevron.
