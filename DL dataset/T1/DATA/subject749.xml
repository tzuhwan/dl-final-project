      From
      today #8217;s
      point
      of
      view,
      it
      is
      obvious
      that
      they
      could
      not
      have
      won
      the
      war,
      knowing
      what
      we
      know
      now.
      However,
      by
      1943
      axis
      victory
      was
      possible.

      Why
      does
      Hogwarts
      make
      a
      student
      use
      a
      time-turner
      instead
      of
      making
      a
      schedual
      where
      every
      student
      can
      theoretically
      make
      it
      to
      every
      class?
      What
      if
      someone
      really
      wants
      to
      take
      Arithmancy
      and
      Care
      of
      Magical

      but
      they #8217;re
      both
      at
      9

      Thanks!
      I
      was
      just
      thinking
      how
      I
      also
      had
      to
      choose
      in
      college
      between
      different
      classes,
      but
      they
      lasted
      one
      term
      and
      at
      the
      end
      of
      the
      day
      weren #8217;t
      that
      important
      for
      my
      overall
      education...
      And
      there
      weren #8217;t
      many
      instances
      when
      I
      had
      to
      make
      a
      choice
      like
      that...
      But
      it
      seems
      how
      in
      Hogwarts
      they
      make
      a
      choice
      in
      their
      second
      year
      which
      will
      influence
      their
      whole
      education,
      and
      their
      future
      careers,
      which
      isn #8217;t
      easy,
      and
      then
      they
      just
      make
      it
      more
      difficult
      for
      students
      to
      choose
      by
      making
      them
      pick
      only
      one
      class
      between
      the
      three
      that
      all
      take
      place
      at
      the
      same
      time.
      It #8217;s
      just
      someting
      that
      bothers
      me
      because
      I #8217;d
      probably
      pull
      a
      Hermione
      and
      choose
      everything
      because
      they
      all
      seem
      really
      interesting

      I
      could
      be
      wrong
      here,
      but
      isn #8217;t
      there
      a
      passage
      in
      the
      Chamber
      of
      Secrets
      where
      they
      talk
      about
      choosing
      classes
      for
      their
      third
      year,
      and
      how
      it
      affects
      their
      future
      careers?
      And
      then
      signing
      up
      for
      different
      classes?
      I
      know
      Percy
      and
      Hermione
      were
      really
      interested
      in
      that,
      and
      Ron
      and
      Harry
      didn #8217;t
      put
      much
      though
      into
      it.

      That #8217;s
      an
      interesting
      point,
      how
      some
      subjects
      are
      not
      commonly
      taken
      together,
      and
      thefore
      scheduals
      are
      made
      with
      that
      though
      in
      mind.
      It #8217;s
      just
      that
      I #8217;m
      really
      against
      making
      children
      decide
      their
      educational
      path
      at
      such
      a
      young
      age.
      I
      think
      it #8217;s
      ok
      when
      you #8217;re
      twelve
      to
      be
      interested
      in
      Muggle
      studies
      and
      Arithmancy
      at
      the
      same
      time,
      even
      though
      maybe
      those
      subjects
      are
      not
      commonly
      taken
      together.
      At
      that
      age
      you #8217;re
      still
      under
      the
      influence
      of
      your
      family,
      society
      etc
      and
      it
      just
      seems
      like
      too
      big
      of
      a
      commitment
      to
      just
      choose
      one
      path
      and
      then
      stick
      to
      it.
      But
      their
      time
      spent
      in
      school
      is
      pretty
      short,
      so
      I #8217;m
      probably
      reading
      too
      much
      into
      this.
      That
      being
      said,
      I
      100%
      agree
      with
      you
      that
      she
      could
      have
      taken
      extra
      time
      for
      homework
      and
      sleep,
      it #8217;s
      still
      for
      the
      purpose
      of
      her
      taking
      every
      class
      possible,
      so
      she
      shouldn #8217;t
      have
      felt
      guilty
      or
      anything.

      Sometimes

      Occasionally

      Mine
      is
      probably
      in
      PoA
      when,
      during
      Potions,
      he
      threw
      a
      crocodile
      heart
      and
      hit
      Malfoy
      in
      the
      face,
      causing
      Gryffindor
      to
      lose
      50
      point.
      Seeing
      how
      that
      was
      only
      a
      week
      after
      he
      got
      a
      detention
      for
      defending
      Hermione
      after
      Snape
      insulted
      her,
      it
      showed
      real
      bravery.

      Yeah
      you #8217;re
      right.
      They
      sometimes
      go
      hand
      in
      hand
      but
      not
      always.
      However,
      I
      think
      they
      almost
      always
      overlap
      when
      it
      comes
      to
      standing
      up
      to
      authority
      figures,
      which
      is
      what
      my
      example
      is
      about.
      I
      mean,
      there
      is
      really
      no
      reason
      to
      stand
      up
      to
      someone
      like
      Snape,
      you #8217;ll
      lose
      a
      bunch
      of
      points,
      get
      detention
      etc.
      So
      really
      Ron
      was
      being
      super
      reckless.
      But
      Malfoy
      was
      making
      fun
      of
      his
      best
      friend
      almost
      dying
      on
      the
      pitch,
      and
      Snape
      made
      his
      other
      best
      friend
      cry
      and
      he
      humiliated
      her
      in
      front
      of
      the
      whole
      class,
      so
      Ron
      wasn #8217;t
      thinking
      about
      himself,
      he
      defended
      them.
      So
      that
      was
      both
      brave
      and
      reckless.
      Same
      thing
      goes
      with
      Harry
      shouting
      at
      Umbridge.
      Was
      that
      reckless?
      Yes.
      Was
      it
      brave?
      Definitely.

      Yes!!!
      What #8217;s
      worse,
      I
      think
      they
      gave
      that
      line
      (if
      you
      want
      to
      kill
      Harry
      you #8217;ll
      have
      to
      kill
      us
      too)
      to
      Hermione,
      which
      is
      yet
      another
      example
      of
      how
      movies
      ruined
      Ron #8217;s
      character.
      In
      the
      movies
      he
      just
      cries
      in
      the
      background
      because
      his
      leg
      is
      broken.

      Me
      too,
      but
      I
      walk
      a
      lot
      (almost
      every
      week
      I
      get
      the
      50
      km
      reward)
      and
      I
      hatch
      about
      3-4
      10
      km
      eggs
      a
      week.
      And
      I
      only
      got
      gibble
      once.
      The
      most
      common
      ones
      that
      I
      do
      get
      are
      dratini,
      larvitar,
      beldum,
      and
      I
      have
      plenty
      of
      those.
      Needless
      to
      say,
      I
      stopped
      caring
      about
      10
      km
      eggs
      because
      they #8217;re
      usually
      soooo
      disappointing.

      He #8217;s
      really
      good
      at
      reading
      the
      mood
      of
      the
      conversation
      and
      has
      a
      great
      social
      intelligence.
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      it
      necessarily
      makes
      him
      a
      legilimens.
      And
      also,
      I
      was
      under
      the
      impression
      that
      legilimency
      required
      eye
      contact
      and
      some
      form
      of
      violent
      penetration
      into
      another
      person #8217;s
      mind?
      Because
      in
      The
      Half
      Blood
      Prince,
      when
      Snape
      tries
      to
       #8220;read #8221;
      Malfoys
      mind,
      Malfoy
      says
      something
      like
       #8220;I
      know
      what
      you #8217;re
      doing
      I
      won #8217;t
      let
      you #8221;
      and
      then
      Snape
      says
      something
      like
       #8220;Bellatrix
      taught
      you
      well #8221;
      or
      something.
      Because
      of
      that,
      I
      always
      thought
      that
      a
      person
      cannot
      have
      their
      mind
      penetrated
      without
      knowing
      it,
      idk.

      I
      never
      saw
      it
      that
      way.
      Dumbledore
      is
      over
      a
      hundred
      years
      old,
      and
      he #8217;
      probably
      one
      of
      the
      most
      intelligent
      people
      in
      the
      world,
      who
      isn #8217;t
      easily
      fooled.
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      he
      needs
      legilimency
      to
      tell
      if
      a
      teenage
      boy,
      whose
      emotions
      are
      not
      easily
      concealed,
      is
      lying
      to
      him.
      He
      has
      a
      penetrating
      stare
      that
      feels
      like
      an
      x-ray,
      but
      that
      is
      just
      a
      characteristic,
      a
      part
      of
      his
      personality,
      not
      him
      reading
      someone #8217;s
      mind.
      Also,
      while
      that
      is
      not
      explicitly
      said,
      legilimency
      has
      strong
      connections
      to
      dark
      magic.
      Most
      famous
      legilimens
      are
      Voldemort,
      Salazar
      Slytherin
      and
      Snape.
      While
      Dumbledore
      is
      a
      legilimens
      as
      well,
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      he
      would
      use
      legilimency
      lightly,
      especially
      not
      on
      a
      student.
      It #8217;s
      an
      extreme
      violation
      of
      a
      person #8217;s
      privacy,
      and
      is,
      at
      the
      end
      of
      the
      day,
      immoral.
      It
      is
      enough
      to
      say
      that
      legilimency
      is
      something
      Voldemort
      *enjoys*
      doing.
      So
      it
      is
      a
      bit
      twisted.
      The
      only
      two
      instances
      we
      know
      Dumbledore
      to
      use
      legilimency
      is
      to
      interrogate
      Kreacher
      and
      Voldemort #8217;s
      uncle.
      I
      wouldn #8217;t
      go
      that
      far
      to
      say
      that
      he
      ever
      performed
      it
      on
      Harry,
      or
      any
      student
      for
      that
      matter.

      This
      is
      maybe
      an
      unpopular
      opinion,
      but
      Lily
      and
      James.
      They
      loved
      each
      other
      so
      much,
      even
      though
      she
      hated
      him
      when
      they
      were
      kids.
      People
      change
      and
      mature
      over
      time,
      and
      so
      did
      James,
      and
      just
      the
      fact
      that
      he
      loved
      Lily
      all
      his
      life
      and
      then
      she
      started
      seeing
      something
      in
      him
      is
      beautiful.
      Also,
      scenes
      of
      their
      lives
      before
      Voldemort
      kills
      them,
      with
      Lily
      and
      James
      casually
      playing
      with
      Harry
      in
      the
      living
      room,
      and
      then
      Harry
      finding
      out
      from
      Lily #8217;s
      letter
      just
      how
      happy
      they
      were,
      are
      heart-breaking.
      James
      is
      a
      much
      better
      fit
      for
      Lily
      than
      Snape
      could
      ever
      be.

      TIL
      that
      tickle
      torture
      was
      used
      in
      ancient
      Rome,
      where
      a
      person #8217;s
      feet
      were
      dipped
      in
      a
      salt
      solution,
      and
      a
      goat
      was
      brought
      in
      to
      lick
      the
      solution
      off.
      This
      type
      of
      tickle
      torture
      would
      only
      start
      as
      tickling,
      eventually
      becoming
      extremely
      painful.

      Interesting
      question.
      Given
      that
      Harry #8217;s
      cloak
      is
      one
      of
      a
      kind,
      that
      provides
      complete
      protection,
      it
      would
      probably
      protect
      him
      from
      legilimency,
      even
      if
      it
      doesn #8217;t
      require
      eye
      contact
      (which
      I
      think
      it
      does).
      It #8217;s
      not
      an
      ordinary
      invisibility
      cloak.
      The
      explanation
      here
      is
      probably
      that
      Snape
      assumes
      that
      Harry
      is
      behind
      any
      rule-breaking
      in
      Hogwarts.
      Especially
      because
      he
      knows
      that
      Harry
      has
      the
      cloak,
      but
      also
      because,
      in
      this
      example,
      Harry
      left
      an
      egg
      behing,
      and
      only
      4
      students
      at
      that
      time
      had
      the
      egg.

      They
      probably
      did
      need
      to
      catch
      up
      on
      spells
      after
      spending
      so
      many
      years
      in
      prison,
      but
      since
      they
      were
      all
      fully
      qualified
      wizards,
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      it
      was
      a
      big
      problem.
      The
      one
      example
      from
      the
      books
      that
      I
      can
      think
      of
      that
      relates
      to
      your
      question
      is
      in
      the
      Half
      Blood
      Prince
      when
      Hagrid
      forgot
      which
      spell
      to
      use
      when
      his
      cabin
      was
      on
      fire.
      He
      asked
      Harry
      how
      to
      produce
      water,
      and
      when
      he
      remembered
      the
      spell
      he
      had
      no
      trouble
      producing
      it.
      So
      I
      assume
      that
      if
      they
      do
      forget
      something
      it #8217;s
      the
      incantation,
      which
      is
      understandable
      because
      there
      is
      a
      lot
      of
      them.
      But
      if
      they
      become
      competent
      in
      one
      spell
      they
      will
      catch
      up
      quickly
      no
      matter
      how
      much
      time
      had
      passed.

      Me
      too.
      I
      guess
      it #8217;s
      the
      same
      thing
      as
      Harry
      not

      at

      It
      didn #8217;t
      make
      sense
      to
      introduce
      it
      so
      early

      the
      sake
      of

      there #8217;s
      really
      no
      magical
      explanation
      for
      it.

      I
      agree,
      it #8217;s

      Maybe

      a

      So
      basically,
      anything
      you
      hear
      about
      the
      books
      that
      is
      completely
      wrong
      and
      annoys
      you?
      For
      example,
      I
      really
      hate
      it
      when
      people
      are
      being
      dismissive
      about
      Voldemort #8217;s
      powers
      and
      think
      Voldemort
      is
      this
      neurotic
      wizard
      who
      can #8217;t
      do
      anything
      right
      and
      fails
      to
      murder
      Harry
      every
      year
      at
      the
      end
      of
      his
      school
      year.
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      people
      fully
      realize
      how
      powerful
      he
      is,
      and
      how
      dangerous
      it
      is
      to
      be
      around
      him.
      This
      has
      a
      lot
      to
      do
      with,
      in
      my
      opinion,
      really
      bad
      portayal
      of
      Voldemort
      in
      the
      movies.
      I
      love
      Ralp
      Fiennes,
      but
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      he
      captured
      the
      essence
      of
      Voldemort.
      Some
      of
      his
      scenes
      are
      so
      over
      the
      top,
      when
      he
      yells
      like
      a
      maniac,
      like
      Dumbledore
      and
      the
      infamous
       #8220;did
      you
      put
      your
      name
      in
      the
      Goblet
      of
      Fire? #8221;
      It
      seems
      like
      the
      only
      spell
      he
      knows
      is
      Avada
      Kedavra
      which
      usually
      clashes
      with
      Harry #8217;s
      Expelliarmus
      and
      achieves
      nothing.

      Harry
      is
      really
      underrated.
      He
      was
      only
      twelve
      when
      he
      defeated
      a
      Basilisk
      for
      example,
      and
      people
      still
      think
      he
      just
      gets
      lucky
      every
      time.
      Ron
      too,
      they
      mutilated
      his
      character
      in
      the
      movies.
      I
      guess
      movies
      are
      to
      blame
      for
      most
      misconceptions.
      They #8217;re
      just
      too
      bad.

      Yeah,
      I
      think
      people
      took
      it
      too
      seriously.
      I
      mean,
      Harry
      went
      through
      a
      process
      of
      realizing
      that
      his
      father
      was
      flawed
      but
      all
      in
      all
      a
      good
      man.
      We
      all
      go
      through
      that
      as
      we
      get
      older,
      we
      stop
      idolizing
      our
      parents.
      So
      Harry,
      who
      until
      then
      only
      heard
      about
      his
      father
      being
      an
      amazing
      seeker,
      a
      Head
      Boy,
      a
      talented
      animagus,
      saw
      a
      memory
      where
      all
      of
      that
      made
      him
      arrogant.
      It #8217;s
      just
      a
      realization
      that
      nobody #8217;s
      perfect.
      But
      people
      read
      that
      as
      James
      being
      a
      horrible
      person.

      That #8217;s
      a
      good
      point,
      people
      underestimating
      Death
      Eaters.
      Yes,
      Lucius
      Malfoy
      proved
      himself
      to
      be
      incompetent
      and
      disinclined
      to
      follow
      Voldemort
      all
      the
      way.
      But
      the
      rest
      of
      them
      are
      just
      evil.
      I
      always
      saw
      them
      as
      Hitler #8217;s
      inner
      circle,
      who #8217;s
      just
      as
      bad
      as
      him.
      So
      to
      have
      a
      Dark
      Mark
      tattooed
      means
      that
      you #8217;re
      either
      extremely
      ignorant
      or
      a
      horrible
      person.

      The
      first
      books
      is
      a
      good
      example
      of
      this.
      The
      plot
      doesn #8217;t
      really
      affect
      the
      plot
      of
      the
      rest
      of
      the
      series,
      and
      things
      like
      the
      philosopher #8217;s
      stone
      are
      never
      mentioned
      again.
      But
      of
      course,
      that #8217;s
      understandable,
      it #8217;s
      just
      that
      the
      first
      book
      is
      my
      least
      favourite
      one
      precisely
      because
      of
      that.

      I
      totally
      agree,
      I
      just
      can #8217;t
      see
      why
      people
      automatically
      assume
      someone #8217;s
      an
      introvert
      just
      because
      they
      like
      to
      read.
      I
      know
      loads
      of
      introverts
      who
      hate
      reading
      and
      studying.
      And
      also
      extroverts
      who
      read
      all
      the
      time.
      I
      guess
      movies
      and
      tv
      shows
      that
      deal
      with
      young
      adults
      like
      to
      show
      someone #8217;s
      shy
      and
      introverted
      by
      giving
      them
      a
      book
      to
      read.
      And
      glasses.
      I #8217;m
      surprised
      Harry #8217;s
      not
      labeled
      an
      introvert
      because
      he #8217;s
      wearing
      them.

      I
      know,
      I
      always
      get
      mad
      when
      in
      the
      CoS
      movies
      Malfoy
      calls
      Hermione
      a
      mudblood
      and
      then
      she
      explains
      what
      a
      mudblood
      is.
      Come
      on,
      they
      could
      have
      at

      given

      in

      But
      no,
      they
      even
      took
      that
      away
      from
      him.
      As

      enough
      that
      they
      made

      This
      is
      really
      important
      for
      people
      to
      understand.
      But
      I
      guess
      for
      movies
      reasons
      they
      wanted
      to
      make
      it
      as
      if
      Buckbeack
      was
      killed
      and
      then
      they
      saved
      him
      in
      an
      alternate
      timeline,
      to
      increase
      the
      suspension.
      But
      what
      they
      did
      in
      the
      Cursed
      Child
      with
      the
      time
      turner
      is
      unforgivable.
      That #8217;s
      just
      completely
      destroying
      everything
      that
      made
      sense
      in
      the
      PoA.

      I
      always
      wondered
      whose
      idea
      it
      was
      to
      portray
      Dumbledore
      that
      way.
      No
      glasses,
      no
      silver
      hair,
      no
      crazy
      colours,
      no
      peaceful
      calm
      voice.
      In
      the
      movies
      he
      seems
      like
      a
      wizard
      who
      loses
      its
      temper
      and
      knows
      he
      is
      in
      a
      position
      of
      power
      and
      acts
      like
      it.
      Book
      Dubledore
      is
      just
      a
      completely
      different
      person.

      Well,
      I
      only
      know
      about
      Grindelwald
      from
      what
      I
      read
      in
      the
      7
      HP
      books
      because
      I
      haven #8217;t
      seen
      Crimes
      of
      Grindelwald
      (I
      have
      trouble
      forcing
      myself
      to
      care
      about
      those
      movies
      tbh).
      So
      I
      might
      be
      completely
      wrong
      here.
      But,
      we
      know
      that
      Grindelwald
      never
      had
      a
      strong
      following
      in
      Britain
      because
      he
      was
      afraid
      of
      Dumbledore.
      He
      was
      the
      strongest
      in
      Eastern
      Europe.
      Voldemort
      saw
      himself
      as
      being
      superior
      in
      every
      way
      possible,
      and
      was
      the
      proudest
      because
      of
      his
      Salazar
      Slytherin
      heritage.
      I
      wouldn #8217;t
      be
      surprised
      he
      though
      his
      nationality
      was
      the
      purest
      as
      well.
      If
      he
      is
      the
      wizard
      equivalent
      of
      Hitler,
      then
      I
      guess
      Grindelwald
      would
      be
      Stalin.
      Knowing
      how
      those
      two
      functioned
      together,
      I
      wouldn #8217;t
      be
      surprised
      if
      the
      same
      would
      work
      with
      Voldemort
      and
      Grindelwald.
      So
      that
      would
      mean
      that
      Voldemort
      would
      first
      let
      Grindelwald
      do
      its
      thing
      and
      support
      him
      for
      some
      time,
      but
      seeing
      himself
      superior
      in
      every
      way
      he
      would
      eventually
      get
      rid
      of
      him.
      One
      of
      Voldemort #8217;s
      problems
      is
      that
      he
      wanted
      to
      do
      everything
      by
      himself,
      and
      only
      recognized
      a
      small
      number
      of
      people
      fit
      enough
      to
      follow
      him.
      So
      in
      a
      situation
      where
      Voldemort
      and
      Grindewald
      interact,
      it
      wouldn #8217;t
      have
      lasted
      long.

      Well,
      he
      would
      definitely
      used
      Grindelwald
      just
      as
      he
      used
      the
      Ministry
      for
      Magic
      to
      spread
      his
      power.
      So
      he
      wouldn #8217;t
      phisically
      attend
      meetings
      or
      anything,
      but
      would
      use
      either
      his
      men
      or
      someone
      under
      Imperius
      curse
      to
      work
      for
      his
      benefit.
      But
      like
      I
      said,
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      Voldemort
      would
      keep
      up
      with
      that
      for
      too
      long,
      Grindelwald
      was
      too
      powerful,
      a
      competition.
      He
      would
      have
      tried
      to
      kill
      him
      before
      long.
      Voldemort
      works
      alone.

      Sirius.
      I
      love
      it
      how
      he
      never
      even
      considered
      to
      fit
      in
      his
      family
      and
      though
      all
      the
      pure
      blood
      talk
      was
      rubbish.
      He
      was
      also
      a
      great
      friend,
      and
      an
      extremely
      intelligent
      person.
      To
      think
      that
      his
      life
      was
      ruined
      by
      staying
      for
      12
      years
      in
      Azkaban,
      only
      to
      finally
      escape
      and
      die
      just
      before
      he
      had
      the
      opportunity
      to
      clear
      his
      name
      always
      makes
      me
      sad.

      I

      recognize
      the
      7
      books
      as
      canon,

      I
      think
      this
      could
      only
      be
      explained
      as
      a
      plot
      hole.
      Sirius
      is
      pretty
      tall,
      and
      he
      didn #8217;t
      need
      to
      crawl.
      I
      doubt
      17-year-old
      Harry
      was
      taller
      than
      Sirius.
      I
      think
      the
      point
      was
      to
      emphasise
      how
      much
      time
      has
      passed,
      and
      how
      they
      were
      children
      in
      PoA
      and
      now
      they
      are
      adults.
      But
      it
      is
      still
      an
      inconsistency
      in
      story
      telling,
      or
      at
      least
      I
      can #8217;t
      think
      of
      a
      better
      answer.

      I
      know
      money
      can #8217;t
      buy
      talent,
      and
      that
      in
      the
      end
      always
      the
      most
      talented
      group
      wins.
      I
      understand
      that
      brooms
      vary
      and
      that,
      of
      course,
      some
      kids
      have
      more
      money
      and
      can
      afford
      better
      brooms.
      But
      Firebolt
      is
      an
      *internetionally*
      good
      broom,
      used
      on
      World
      Cups
      by
      *professional*
      players.
      I
      simply
      cannot
      believe
      it
      does
      not
      influence
      the
      outcome
      of
      the
      match.
      For
      example,
      Wood
      dismisses
      Cho #8217;s
      Comet
      and
      says
      it
      is
      no
      match
      to
      Harry #8217;s
      firebolt.
      So
      we #8217;re
      in
      a
      situation
      where
      two
      seekers
      have
      insanely
      different
      chances
      of
      catching
      the
      snitch.
      What
      if
      a
      seeker
      notices
      the
      snitch
      first
      but
      the
      other
      one
      has
      a
      Firebolt?
      I
      just
      think
      that
      the
      school
      should
      impose
      some
      rule
      about
      brooms,
      like
      saying
      that
      nothing
      above
      Nimbus
      2000
      or
      below
      Cleansweeps
      is
      alowed,
      something
      like
      that.

      Exactly.
      Truth
      be
      told,
      I
      haven #8217;t
      even
      seen
      Crimes
      of
      Grindelwald,
      but
      I
      heard
      the
      timeline
      was
      too
      frustrating
      for
      someone
      who
      has
      read
      the
      books.
      I
      did
      watch
      the
      first
      Fantastic
      Beasts
      movies
      and
      it
      was
      so
      disappointing.
      I
      can #8217;t
      remember
      any
      of
      the
      characters
      or
      what
      was
      even
      going
      on.
      The
      atmosphere
      just
      didn #8217;t
      seem
      right.
      You
      can #8217;t
      just
      give
      someone
      a
      wand
      and
      expect
      it
      to
      feel
      like
      it
      fits
      into
      Harry
      Potter
      universe.
      I
      think
      making
      those
      movies
      was
      a
      big
      mistake,
      and
      a
      complete
      waste
      of
      an
      oportunity.

      That
      would
      definitely
      be
      the
      best
      option.
      The
      school
      already
      has
      house
      elves
      who
      clean
      the
      whole
      castle
      for
      free.
      So
      that #8217;s
      a
      bunch
      of
      galleons
      saved
      right
      there.
      They

      buy

      and
      solve
      the
      whole
      inequality

      I

      Like

      to
      run
      faster
      or
      something.
      If
      speed
      plays
      a
      role
      in
      sport,
      any

      should
      be

      and,
      if

      prohibited.
      Especially
      if
      the
      only
      thing
      stopping
      you
      to
      achieve
      that

      is

      Exactly,
      if
      anything,
      having
      a
      superior
      broom
      diminishes
      Harry #8217;s
      talent.
      I
      don #8217;t
      see
      why
      he
      had
      to
      have
      the
      best
      broom
      on

      every
      year
      (except

      Yes,
      Firebolt
      was
      an
      important
      plot
      element,
      but
      I #8217;d

      greatness,

      No,

      it #8217;s
      never
      too
      late
      to

      Also
      some
      inequalities
      are
      harder
      to
      sort
      out
      than

      Buying
      the
      same
      broom
      for
      every
      kid
      in

      The
      last
      we
      heard
      was
      that
      he
      was
      being
      chased
      by
      the
      goblins
      because
      he
      owed
      them
      money.
      So
      I
      assume
      he
      had
      to
      give
      up
      on
      his
      job
      in
      the
      Ministry
      since
      he
      was
      on
      the
      run?
      But
      if
      that
      hadn #8217;t
      been
      the
      case,
      do
      you
      think
      he
      would
      support
      Voldemort?
      Or
      was
      he,
      at
      the
      end
      of
      the
      day,
      a
      good
      guy
      battling
      addiction?
      He
      cheated
      a
      lot
      of
      people
      because
      he
      was
      addicted
      to
      gambling,
      but
      like
      Sirius
      said,
      wizards
      aren #8217;t
      divided
      into
      good
      guys
      and
      Death
      Eathers.
      Do
      you
      think
      that
      if
      push
      came
      to
      shove
      Ludo
      would
      turn
      to
      the
      dark
      side?
      Or
      would
      he
      stand
      up
      against
      them
      risking
      his
      own
      life?

      My
      question
      was
      actually
      about
      him
      as
      a
      person,
      like
      I
      said
      I
      know
      he
      was
      running
      from
      the
      goblins.
      It #8217;s
      just
      that
      I
      never
      thought
      he
      was
      into
      dark
      arts
      so
      it
      would
      be
      interesting
      to
      see
      what
      path
      he #8217;d
      take.

      Not
      necessarily
      your
      favourite
      chapter
      of
      all
      time,
      just
      the

      you

      reading
      when

      re-read
      the
      series.
      For
      example,
      I
      really
      like
      the
      chapter
      The
      House-elf
      Liberation
      Front
      in
      the
      GoF,
      because
      we
      get
      to
      see
      Dobby
      again,
      and
      we
      find
      out
      what
      the
      kitchens
      look
      like,
      and
      because
      of
      Ron #8217;s
      famous
      line #8221;Percy
      wouldn #8217;t
      recognize
      a
      joke
      if
      it
      danced
      naked
      in
      front
      of
      him
      wearing
      Dobby #8217;s
      tea-cosy. #8221;
      It #8217;s
      pre-Christmas
      time,
      and
      the
      atmosphere
      is
      really
      relaxed,
      and
      it #8217;s
      just
      a
      chapter
      I
      really
      like
      to
      read.

      Yeah,
      Bellatrix #8217;s
      not
      as
      smart
      as
      she
      thinks
      she
      is.
      She
      resolves
      most
      of
      her
      conflicts
      by
      force.
      She
      can #8217;t
      outsmart
      someone
      just
      by
      talking
      to
      them.

      Lockhart
      is
      a
      gem,
      I
      agree.
      The
      Egg
      and
      the
      Eye
      is
      always
      too
      stressful
      for
      me
      tho,
      idk
      why.
      I
      know
      it #8217;s
      not
      the
      worst
      thing
      if
      Harry
      gets
      caught
      but
      still...

      I
      love
      those
      two
      chapters
      too,
      especially
      because
      Harry
      is
      having
      such
      a
      hard
      time
      with
      Marge
      being
      over,
      and
      then
      he
      finally
      escapes.
      I #8217;d
      probably
      run
      away
      more
      often
      from
      Dursley
      if
      I
      were
      him.

      his

      I
      just
      realized
      that
      when
      Sirius
      gave
      Harry
      his
      knife
      for
      Christmas
      in
      GoF
      that
      he
      literally
      gave
      up
      on
      normal
      food
      in
      order
      for
      Harry
      to
      get
      a
      nice
      present.
      At
      that
      point
      he
      was
      hiding
      in
      the
      mountains
      near
      Hogsmead
      and
      I
      bet
      he
      used
      the
      knife
      to
      steal
      some
      food
      (if
      we
      consider
      that
      most
      shopowners
      secure
      their
      shops
      from
      being
      broken
      into
      with
      an
      Alohamora
      spell).
      So
      Sirius
      had
      to
      live
      off
      rats
      and
      starve
      and
      he
      nontheless
      gave
      the
      knife
      to
      Harry.
      It #8217;s
      such
      a
      sad
      moment
      actually
      but
      I
      never
      gave
      it
      much
      thought
      before
      now.

      Yeah
      but
      didn #8217;t
      Sirius
      literally
      broke
      into
      someone #8217;s
      house
      to
      talk
      to
      Harry
      before
      the
      First
      Task?
      And
      didn #8217;t
      he
      collect
      newspaper
      in
      his
      dog
      form
      and
      walk
      around
      Hogsmead
      without
      fear
      of
      being
      caught?
      I
      was
      under
      the
      impression
      that
      he
      wasn #8217;t
      that
      scared
      of
      the
      Ministry
      in
      GoF
      because
      they
      looked
      for
      him
      in
      the
      south
      and
      were
      preoccupied
      with
      other
      things
      at
      the
      time
      (the
      Tournament,
      the
      World
      Cup,
      the
      dissapearance
      of
      Bertha
      and
      Barty
      Crouch).
      It
      was
      only
      in
      OotP
      that
      Malfoy
      noticed
      him
      and
      so
      the
      Ministry
      realized
      that
      he
      was
      in
      London.
      So
      while
      I
      understand
      your
      point,
      I
      still
      think
      that
      Sirius
      would
      have
      no
      problem
      with
      using
      the
      knife
      to
      get
      some
      food.

      forget

      Harry
      was
      like

      to
      him.

      Yes,
      I
      agree,
      it #8217;s
      probably
      because
      he
      hated
      Kreacher
      so
      much.
      I
      think
      that
      Sirius
      returned
      to
      Grimmauld
      Place
      at
      the
      end
      of
      GoF,
      because
      he
      had
      to,
      but
      he
      spent
      2
      years
      after
      he
      escaped
      wandering
      around.

      Yeah,
      but
      Sleeping
      Draft
      is
      something
      only
      dragon
      keepers
      had
      at
      the
      time.
      Harry
      had
      two
      days
      until
      the
      task,
      I
      doubt
      he
      could #8217;ve
      brewed
      one,
      plus
      it
      would
      probably
      mean
      that
      he
      would
      have
      to
      break
      into
      Snape #8217;s
      office.
      Stealing/taking
      it
      from
      Charlie
      isn #8217;t
      an
      option
      either.
      Everyone
      would
      realize
      immediately
      and
      disqualify
      Harry
      and
      Charlie
      would
      get
      into
      trouble.

      Interesting
      question,
      I
      never
      thought
      about
      that.
      I
      really
      hope
      one
      of
      them
      was
      forced
      to
      swim
      to
      the
      shore,
      that
      would
      be
      hilarious.

      It #8217;s
      probably
      a
      motorcycle.
      1.)
      We
      see
      Hagrid
      at
      the
      beginning
      of
      a
      novel
      use
      it.
      I
      doubt
      JK
      thought
      about
      testrals
      so
      early
      on
      and
      those
      two
      are
      the
      only
      modes
      of
      transportation
      suitable
      for
      Hagrid
      if
      he
      wishes
      to
      fly
      (The
      Seven
      Potters
      being
      a
      good
      example).
      2.)
      He
      says
      they #8217;ll
      go
      by
      a
      boat
      because
      he #8217;s
      not
      allowed
      to
      do
      magic
      now
      he #8217;s
      picked
      Harry
      up.
      And
      you
      need
      magic
      to
      drive
      the
      motorcycle.
      So
      Hagrid
      probably
      magicked
      the
      motorcycle
      back
      to
      mainland
      or
      something
      and
      picked
      it
      up
      later
      on.
      Any
      other
      explanation
      just
      doesn #8217;t
      make
      sense
      so
      early
      on
      in
      the
      series.

      You #8217;re
      definitely
      right,
      I
      always
      think
      the
      same
      thing
      when
      I
      read
      the
      chapter
      when
      Harry
      Hermione
      Ron
      Luna
      Neville
      Ginny
      are
      fighting
      the
      Death
      Eathers
      in
      the
      Department
      of
      Misteries.
      They
      should
      just
      cast
      stupefy
      around
      and
      run.
      The
      only
      reason
      I
      can
      think
      of
      why
      they
      might
      cast
      something
      else
      is
      that
      maybe
      stupefy,
      if
      cast
      without
      enough
      determination,
      is
      not
      effective
      enought.
      Maybe
      they #8217;ll
      wake
      up
      too
      soon
      and
      be
      ok.
      So
      I
      guess
      in
      difficult
      situations
      they
      vary
      spells,
      because
      they
      can #8217;t
      stop
      and
      concentrate
      on
      just
      one
      effective
      spell?

      It

      and

      That
      is
      a
      mistake
      that
      was
      later
      changed,
      in
      my
      editions
      Lily
      appears
      first
      and
      James
      second.
      Regarding
      Bertha,
      Voldemort
      did
      have
      some
      kind
      of
      form
      that
      enabled
      him
      to
      kill
      people,
      he
      killed
      Frank
      Bryce
      from
      an
      armchair
      but
      he
      was

      little
      Harry
      couldn #8217;t
      see
      what
      he
      looked
      like.
      And
      he
      killed
      Bertha
      before
      Frank.
      We
      find
      out
      later
      on
      that
      he
      looked
      like
      a
      skinned
      child.

      I
      knew
      right
      away
      that
      the
      bartender
      in
      the
      Hog #8217;s
      Head
      was
      Dumbledore #8217;s
      brother.
      He
      was
      kinda
      dodgy,
      and
      the
      pub
      smelled
      of
      goat.
      In
      GoF,
      Dumbledore
      said
      that
      his
      brother
      enchanted
      a
      goat
      or
      something
      like
      that.
      So
      that
      wasn #8217;t
      a
      big
      plot
      twist
      for
      me.
      The
      one
      that
      really
      surprised
      me
      was
      Snape
      being
      in
      love
      with
      Lily.
      I
      didn #8217;t
      see
      that
      one
      coming
      at
      all.

      Thanks
      for
      making
      me
      feel
      smart!
      Idk
      I
      was
      a
      child
      when
      I
      figured
      that
      one
      out,
      I
      just
      connected
      the
      two
      times
      a
      goat
      was
      mentioned
      and
      didn #8217;t
      overthink
      it.
      If
      I
      was
      reading
      the
      books
      for
      the
      first
      time
      as
      an
      adult
      maybe
      I
      wouldn #8217;t
      figure
      it
      out.

      Harry
      performed
      underage
      magic
      in
      front
      of
      a
      muggle.
      Given
      how
      he
      was
      already
      warned
      against
      performing
      magic
      outside
      of
      school,
      the
      Ministry
      wanted
      to
      expel
      him
      and
      snap
      his
      wand
      in
      half.
      Ok,
      he
      did
      get
      away
      and
      was
      allowed
      to
      keep
      his
      wand,
      but
      that
      got
      me
      thinking.
      Why
      do
      they
      destroy
      someone #8217;s
      wand
      after
      they #8217;ve
      been
      expelled?
      Is
      it
      not
      enough
      that
      they
      don #8217;t
      get
      to
      finish
      their
      magical
      education?
      It
      already
      diminishes
      their
      chances
      of
      getting
      a
      good
      job.
      But
      also,
      if
      they
      don #8217;t
      get
      to
      keep
      their
      wands,
      they
      become
      complete
      outcasts,
      just
      like
      squibs.
      Which
      is
      worse,
      their
      whole
      magical
      education
      up
      until
      that
      point
      had
      become
      useless.
      Ok,
      Hagrid #8217;s
      wand
      was
      snapped
      in
      half
      because
      he
      was
      charged
      with
      the
      murder
      of
      another
      student.
      I
      can
      understand
      that.
      But
      any
      other
      fellony
      just
      doesn #8217;t
      seem
      big
      enough
      for
      the
      student
      to
      lose
      their
      wand.
      Plus,
      it
      probably
      affects
      the
      rise
      of
      a
      black
      market
      for
      wands.
      Students
      whose
      wands
      get
      confiscated
      will
      probably
      try
      and
      buy
      a
      new
      one,
      and
      so
      a
      whole
      illegal
      business
      is
      created.
      It
      just
      seems
      really
      unneccessary
      and
      completely
      wrong
      from
      a
      moral
      perspective.

      it
      only
      causes
      illegal
      business
      to
      flourish.
      Wizarding
      laws
      can
      be
      medieval
      sometimes,
      and
      they
      don #8217;t
      really
      care
      about
      the
      outcasts
      (werewolves,
      squibs
      etc).
      This
      is
      one
      of
      those
      cases.
      I
      mean,
      we #8217;re
      talking
      about
      a
      world
      that
      allows
      prisoners
      to
      be
      mentally
      tortured
      by
      beings
      who
      are
      very
      difficult
      to
      control.
      But
      I
      still
      think
      it
      is
      well
      thought
      out.

      I
      suppose
      that
      students
      develop
      their
      writing
      skills
      in
      a
      passive
      way,
      by
      reading
      different
      books.
      They
      do
      have
      to
      read
      a
      lot,
      and
      they
      always
      write
      essays
      for
      homework.
      I
      really
      hope
      that
      when
      teachers
      grade
      their
      essays
      that
      they
      correct
      grammar
      and
      spelling
      mistakes
      too.
      So
      instead
      of
      a
      deductive
      approach,
      teachers
      opt
      for
      an
      inductive
      approach,
      where
      they
      let
      the
      student
      come
      up
      with
      grammar
      rules
      themselves,
      through
      a
      process
      of
      trial
      and
      error.

      Mine #8217;s
      probably
      Umbridge.
      Every
      detail
      about
      her
      character #8217;s
      just
      so
      perfect.
      Pointy
      teeth,
      pink
      outfits,
      high
      trembling
      girlish
      voice,
      desire
      to
      punish
      people
      who
      are
      out
      of
      order
      etc.
      She
      is
      one
      of
      the
      best
      villains
      in
      literature
      imho.
      Also
      the
      way
      she
      is
      first
      introduced
      gives
      me
      chills
      upon
      rereading.
      The
      way
      she
      lurkes
      in
      the
      shadows
      during
      Harry #8217;s
      hearing,
      and
      then
      comes
      to
      the
      light
      and
      straight
      up
      lies
      about
      the
      dementors
      and
      she
      was
      the
      one
      who
      sent
      them.
      JK
      Rowling
      really
      showed
      her
      writing
      abilities
      when
      creating
      Umbridge.

      Yes
      I
      completely
      agree.
      The
      actress
      was
      good,
      but
      they
      could
      have
      made
      her
      more
      toad-like
      with
      makeup.
      She
      could
      have
      had
      a
      wig
      and
      a
      fat
      suit
      or
      something.
      I
      think
      her
      vile
      appearence
      emphasised
      her
      horrible
      personality
      in
      the
      books.
      The
      movie
      completely
      lost
      that
      aspect
      of
      her.
      But
      the
      fifth
      movie
      is
      when
      things
      just
      went
      wrong,
      I
      don #8217;t
      even
      want
      to
      get
      started...

      I
      also
      love
      the
      fact
      that
      she
      was
      introduced
      in
      the
      very
      first
      chapter.
      She
      started
      caring
      about
      Harry
      immediately
      and
      we
      got
      to
      see
      her
      soft
      side.
      And
      so
      however
      strict
      she
      was
      in
      school,
      we
      knew
      that
      she
      is
      a
      very
      caring
      person
      actually.

      I
      was
      thinking
      the
      same
      thing.
      She
      is
      the
      only
      teacher
      who
      taught
      Harry
      without
      a
      description
      of
      her
      physical
      appearance.
      I
      always
      wanted
      to
      know
      more
      about
      her
      and
      Astronomy
      in
      general.
      It
      would
      fit
      with
      the
      tone
      of
      the
      book,
      but
      I
      guess
      she
      was
      cut
      off
      from
      any
      real
      action
      in
      order
      for
      the
      plot
      to
      stay
      clear
      of
      big
      digresions.

      I
      think
      Krum
      is
      really
      underrated.
      They
      made
      him
      really
      stupid
      in
      the
      movies,
      like
      he #8217;s
      the
      type
      of
      guy
      who
      looks
      good
      but
      can #8217;t
      hold
      an
      intelligent
      conversation.
      He
      wouldn #8217;t
      have
      been
      chosen
      as
      a
      champion
      if
      that
      were
      true,
      and
      book
      Krum
      is
      really
      smart
      just
      also
      really
      shy,
      so
      he
      doesn #8217;t
      talk
      much,
      plus
      he #8217;s
      foreign
      so
      his
      English
      isn #8217;t
      that
      good.
      So
      I
      would
      say
      that
      movies
      didn #8217;t
      do
      him
      justice.

      In
      order
      to
      be
      elected
      as
      a
      school
      champion
      you
      have
      to
      be
      both
      brave
      and
      intelligent.
      So
      I
      would
      say
      that
      that
      is
      enough
      book
      evidence
      to
      support
      tha
      claim
      that
      Krum
      is
      smart.
      The
      same
      goes
      for
      Fleur
      too,
      she #8217;s
      also
      smart,
      but
      since
      Harry
      doesn #8217;t
      spend
      much
      time
      with
      them
      we
      really
      don #8217;t
      get
      to
      see
      that.
      Krum #8217;s
      chemistry
      with
      Hermione
      is
      a
      completely
      different
      thing
      however.
      She
      doesn #8217;t
      seem
      that
      interested
      in
      him,
      and
      he #8217;s
      not
      really
      good
      with
      girls.
      I
      would
      never
      say
      they
      were
      a
      good
      couple
      because
      Hermione
      always
      liked
      Ron
      better.
      But
      the
      movie
      did
      this
      -
      they
      wanted
      to
      make
      an
      American
      teenage
      TV
      show
      move
      when
      a
      stupid
      jock
      falls
      for
      a
      pretty
      girl
      who #8217;s
      into
      books.
      Krum
      is
      far
      from
      being
      a
      stupid
      jock
      stereotype,
      like
      I
      said,
      he #8217;s
      just
      shy
      and
      foreign,
      but
      there
      is
      still
      so
      much
      more
      to
      him
      than
      the
      movies
      depicted.

      I
      always
      tought
      that
      the
      trace
      is
      what
      minors
      have
      to
      activate
      if
      the
      magic
      is
      being
      practiced
      around
      them.
      But
      the
      Ministry
      cannot
      detect
      who
      performed
      it.
      That
      means
      that
      kids
      like
      Malfoy
      probably
      do
      magic
      at
      home
      during
      the
      holidays.
      But
      it
      also
      means
      that
      the
      7
      Potters
      is
      justified.

      McGonagall #8217;s
      just
      so
      funny
      and
      sarcastic,
      I #8217;d
      love

      her
      bicker

      uniting

      hating
      Lockhart

      Also
      they #8217;re
      both
      competitive
      and
      care
      about
      their

      I
      would
      read

      cannot

      who
      like
      Bellatrix #8217;s

      I

      I
      really
      hate
      that
      women
      from
      the
      bottom
      of
      my

      she
      did
      to
      Neville #8217;s
      parents
      but
      also
      because
      she
      killed
      Dobby

      Sirius.

      I
      like
      to
      think
      that
      owls
      have
      a
      magic
      of
      their
      own,
      just
      like
      house
      elves
      for
      example.
      So
      if
      owls
      don #8217;t
      want
      to
      be
      followed,
      they #8217;ll
      make
      sure
      they
      won #8217;t
      be,
      and
      there #8217;s
      nothing
      any
      wizard
      can
      do
      about
      it.
      I
      mean,
      in
      HP
      Universe
      owls
      are
      definitely
      magical.
      You
      cannot
      train
      a
      regular
      owl
      to
      do
      anything
      regarding
      mail
      service.

      I
      just
      realized
      that
      the
      part
      where
      Ginny
      got
      the
      Snitch
      right
      out
      from
      under
      Cho #8217;s
      nose
      during
      the
      last
      match
      of
      the
      Quidditch
      season
      could
      be
      seen
      as
      a
      foreshadowing
      of
      her
      relationship
      with
      Harry.
      Order
      of
      the
      Phoenix
      is
      full
      of
      foreshadowing
      in
      general.
      Little
      details
      such
      as
      Sirius
      being
      the
      first
      to
      get
      up
      from
      the
      table
      where
      13
      people
      are
      sitting
      is
      another
      example
      of
      how
      his
      death
      was
      foreshadowed.
      It
      just
      goes
      to
      show
      how
      JK
      Rowling
      is
      an
      anazing
      writer.
      Do
      you
      guys
      have
      any
      other
      examples
      of
      foreshadowing
      in
      the
      series?
