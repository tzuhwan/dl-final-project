      I
      would
      advice
      downloading
      'Grammarly'
      on
      your
      phone.
      It's
      free
      and
      automatically
      fixes
      most
      mistakes,
      so
      you
      don't
      have
      to
      worry
      about
      wasting
      your
      time
      with
      grammar
      and
      you
      won't
      have
      to
      worry
      about
      people
      not
      understanding
      your
      messages.

      It's
      always
      hard
      to
      see
      the
      perspective
      of
      the
      opposition,
      but
      they
      may
      have
      something
      of
      importance
      to
      say
      so
      don't
      hear,
      listen.
      Take
      socialism
      versus
      capitalism.
      If
      our
      society
      becomes
      too
      unequal
      the
      people
      at
      the
      bottom
      will
      riot
      and
      overthrow
      the
      government
      and
      start
      socialism;
      however,
      for
      every
      one
      unit
      of
      wealth
      you
      need
      three
      units
      of
      inequity,
      and
      if
      people,
      who
      work
      harder
      aren't
      rewarded
      with
      money
      or
      something
      else,
      they
      won't
      work
      harder
      (to
      strawman
      the
      point).
      The
      radical
      leftists
      have
      found
      a
      problem
      in
      our
      system,
      "what
      about
      poor
      people?"
      We
      can't
      just
      turn
      our
      backs
      on
      them.
      That's
      unethical;
      however,
      at
      the
      same
      time,
      we
      can't
      steal
      from
      the
      rich.
      So
      how
      do
      we
      fix
      the
      situation?
      Nobody
      knows.
      The
      people
      at
      the
      bottom
      made
      poor
      decisions
      and
      are
      paying
      for
      them,
      and
      the
      people
      at
      the
      top
      have
      made
      good
      decisions
      and
      have
      been
      rewarded.
      It's
      a
      just
      system.
      We
      can't
      steal
      to
      fix
      the
      issue!
      Doing
      a
      bad
      thing
      for
      a
      good
      cause
      is
      still
      bad.
      Anyone
      with
      any
      other
      opinions?

      We
      need
      restricted
      capitalism.
      We
      can't
      have
      monopolies,
      but
      a
      free
      market
      creates
      wealth
      for
      everyone.
      One
      unit
      of
      wealth
      for
      every
      three
      of
      inequity,
      but
      we
      should
      reward
      those,
      who
      work
      hard
      to
      give
      us
      new
      products
      that
      we
      desire
      or
      else
      they
      won't
      give
      us
      those
      products.
      The
      free
      market
      may
      need
      to
      be
      reform,
      but
      let's
      try
      to
      improve
      a
      system
      working
      at
      80%
      efficiency
      than
      one
      that
      works
      even
      less.

      While
      this
      is
      a
      valid
      point,
      I
      disagree
      with
      the
      notion
      that
      we
      need
      a
      european-style
      social
      democracy.
      You
      will
      get
      benefits
      if
      you
      live
      in
      social
      democracies,
      but
      you
      must
      pay
      for
      them
      through
      taxes.
      Then
      if
      you
      decide
      you
      don't
      want
      health
      care
      you
      still
      have
      to
      pay
      the
      taxes.
      It's
      not
      fair
      that
      you
      have
      to
      pay
      for
      someone
      else's
      bills;
      however,
      your
      point
      about
      rich
      people
      having
      to
      much
      power
      over
      certain
      politicians
      is
      correct,
      but
      corruption
      is
      in
      every
      country.

      True.
      Just
      out
      of
      curiosity
      would
      you
      be
      fine

      power?
      Most

      folks
      have
      a

      nuclear
      power
      for
      some
      reason
      even
      though
      it's
      very
      clean
      because
      all
      the
      waste
      is
      put
      far
      underground
      where
      it
      can't
      do
      any
      harm.

      if
      not
      why?

      Don't
      get
      me
      wrong,
      I'm
      not
      arguing
      for
      socialism;
      however,
      the
      liberals
      have
      a
      point.
      They
      have
      found
      a
      flaw
      in
      the
      best
      social
      system
      the
      world
      has
      ever
      created,
      but
      that
      doesn't
      mean
      that
      you
      need
      to
      dismantle
      it.
      We
      can
      work
      to
      fix
      it.
      If
      it
      is
      possible
      to
      do
      so
      without
      infringing
      on
      the
      rights
      of
      others,
      but
      our
      society
      needs
      a
      right
      and
      left.
      A
      bird
      cannot
      fly
      without
      two
      wings,
      but
      radicals
      it
      can
      do
      without.

      Well,
      studies
      have
      found
      that
      the
      brain
      structure
      of
      conservatives
      and
      liberals
      do
      differ
      significantly.
      They
      may
      find
      a
      compromise
      that's
      better
      than
      just
      one
      side,
      but
      do
      you
      believe
      that
      the
      socialists
      have
      a
      point?
      That
      they
      have
      found
      a
      flaw?
      The
      liberals?
      The
      leftists,
      when
      it
      comes
      to
      this
      issue?

      Regulations
      like
      the
      anti-trust
      act
      stabilize
      capitalism.
      Not
      a
      social
      democracy
      and
      not
      everyone
      needs
      health
      care
      or
      wants
      health
      care:
      however,
      most
      people
      do.
      I
      take
      issue
      with
      the
      opinion
      that
      we
      deserve
      anything.
      We
      don't.
      If
      you
      want
      something,
      you
      need
      to
      work
      to
      get
      it.
      It's
      not
      fair
      to
      the
      rich,
      who
      have
      worked
      hard
      to
      get
      their
      money
      when
      you
      take
      it
      away
      from
      them;
      however,
      money
      does
      tend
      to
      stay
      in
      family
      lines,
      but
      the
      same
      argument
      applies
      to
      that
      too.
      You
      don't
      get
      to
      take
      someone
      else's
      stuff
      because
      you
      think
      you
      deserve
      it.
      That's
      called
      greed.
      But
      the
      problem
      still
      remains
      that
      there
      are
      poor
      people,
      who
      got
      screwed
      over
      by
      the
      system.
      I
      just
      don't
      believe
      that
      they
      deserve
      what
      is
      not
      there's.
      There
      needs
      to
      be
      any
      other
      solution
      besides
      theft.
      Another
      problem
      is
      that
      the
      people
      at
      the
      bottom
      tend
      to
      be
      there
      for
      a
      reason.
      Most
      of
      the
      time
      they
      didn't
      get
      screwed.
      They
      screwed
      themselves.
      They
      got
      there
      by
      cheating,
      stealing,
      and
      lying.
      They
      got
      what
      they
      deserved.
      We
      need
      a
      system
      that
      will
      still
      be
      just,
      but
      allow
      the
      people,
      who
      are
      at
      the
      bottom
      and
      are
      undeserving.
      Climb
      the
      latter
      again.
      Any
      disagreements?

      Confounding
      usually
      occurs
      when
      you
      would
      think
      the
      data
      wouldn't
      be
      correlated.
      Here
      you
      would
      think
      the
      data
      would
      be
      in
      some
      way
      correlated.
      Lead
      is
      poisonous
      to
      people,
      but
      good
      for
      cars
      lets
      put
      it
      in
      gasoline.
      When
      put
      in
      gas
      it
      will
      also
      be
      emitted
      into
      the
      air.
      Then
      people
      inhale
      the
      air
      with
      lead.
      It
      builds
      up
      in
      them
      and
      eventually
      gets
      to
      the
      brain.
      Where
      it
      does
      what
      it
      normally
      does
      and
      makes
      you
      stupid.
      You
      would
      suppose
      that
      as
      the
      lead
      in
      the
      air
      increased
      IQ
      would
      decrease.
      But
      when
      the
      lead
      decreased
      after
      they
      stopped
      putting
      it
      in
      cars.
      The
      people
      stayed
      dumb,
      and
      no
      matter
      what
      you
      do
      IQ
      cannot
      be
      increased.
      Correlation
      doesn't
      mean
      causation.
      But
      the.
      Correlation
      coefficient
      means
      causation,
      but
      still
      could
      be
      off
      if
      the
      data
      were
      skewed
      in
      a
      certain
      direction
      by
      an
      unsavory
      experimentor.
      But
      more
      than
      just
      correlation
      has
      been
      calculated.
      And
      many
      tests
      have
      been
      done.

      The
      correlation
      coefficient
      is
      how
      much
      out
      of
      100
      the
      two
      variables
      selected
      cause
      each
      other.
      And
      it
      is
      a
      major
      difference
      at
      the
      ends.
      So
      of
      the
      mean
      is
      96
      it
      will
      make
      people
      with
      genius
      level
      IQ
      significantly
      rarer.
      I
      just
      ran
      a
      2
      sample
      z
      test
      comparing
      100
      to
      96
      and
      the
      z
      is
      3266
      this
      means
      my
      data
      is
      significant
      at
      the
      1E-3266
      level.
      This
      is
      about
      as
      significant
      as
      it
      gets.
      I'm
      taking
      a
      college
      statistics
      course
      btw.

      Lol,
      my
      prof
      told
      us
      that.
      I'm
      saying
      the
      evidence
      is
      strong
      for
      my
      case,
      who
      now
      maybe
      I'm
      wrong.
      Maybe
      the
      data
      is
      confounding.
      I
      don't
      know.
      However,
      a
      small
      difference
      in
      the
      mean
      can
      have
      large
      changes
      at
      the
      ends
      of
      the
      distribution.
      I'm
      just
      saying
      that
      our
      country
      mean
      IQ
      is

      I
      personally
      say
      yes
      to
      the
      government
      mandating
      vaccinations.
      The
      government
      is
      supposed
      to
      protect
      life,
      liberty,
      and
      happiness.
      I
      believe
      that
      life
      takes
      priority
      over
      liberty,
      and
      liberty
      over
      happiness;
      therefore,
      when
      the
      life
      of
      the
      child
      is
      on
      the
      line
      when
      a
      child
      isn't
      vaccinated,
      protection
      of
      the
      life
      of
      the
      child
      overtakes
      the
      liberty
      of
      the
      child's
      guardians.

      the
      road
      to
      destruction
      is
      paved
      with
      good
      intentions.
      Just
      interested
      what
      you
      thought.

      Just
      like
      there
      is
      a
      political
      spectrum.
      There
      is
      also
      a
      libertarian
      spectrum,
      and
      personally,
      when
      people
      who
      don't
      vaccinate
      effect
      those
      who
      can't
      vaccinate
      because
      of
      allergies
      or
      something
      else
      and
      that
      person
      dies,
      the
      government
      should
      intervene.
      The
      people,
      who
      don't
      vaccinate
      should
      be
      getting
      vaccinated
      anyway
      for
      there
      own
      sake.
      I
      understand
      that
      the
      path
      to
      destruction
      is
      made
      with
      good
      intentions,
      so
      everyone
      must
      be
      cautious;
      however,
      like
      unguided
      capitalism
      ideas
      may
      need
      change.
      Like
      child
      labor
      laws
      and
      if
      a
      company
      becomes
      a
      true
      monopoly
      it
      gets
      broken
      apart.
      True
      Libertarianism
      has
      its
      flaws
      also
      (though
      they
      are
      definitely
      few),
      and
      when
      someone
      is
      endangering
      another
      person's
      life,
      with
      their
      liberty
      I
      believe
      that
      liberty
      might
      need
      to
      be
      taken
      away.
      Do
      you
      have
      any
      input?

      First
      of
      all,
      chill
      out.
      Everyone's
      immune
      system
      is
      terrible,
      that's
      why
      millions
      of
      people
      died
      from
      measles
      and
      that's
      why
      polio
      crippled
      my
      grandfather.
      However,
      your
      points
      are
      valid.
      But
      what
      do
      you
      propose
      to
      fix
      the
      problem?
      Death
      by
      vaccination
      or
      by
      disease?
      Should
      the
      choice
      be
      the
      guardians
      or
      the
      children?

      No,
      the
      disease
      killed
      me
      through
      your
      transmission,
      and
      you
      murdered
      me
      with
      a

      My

      I've
      had
      sleep
      paralysis
      only
      once
      in
      high
      school.
      At
      the
      time
      I
      knew
      what
      it
      was
      and
      it
      scared
      the
      crap
      out
      of
      me.
      It
      started
      with
      a
      dream.
      I
      was
      lucid
      dreaming
      at
      the
      time,
      but
      I
      didn't
      know
      it.
      In
      my
      dream,
      I
      was
      in
      my
      room
      cleaning
      on
      the
      floor
      in
      the
      arch
      of
      my
      doorway
      at
      night.
      To
      sister's
      was
      sister's
      room,
      cracked
      open
      just
      a
      bit
      and
      completely
      dark.
      To
      my
      right
      was
      a
      hallway
      pitch
      black
      also.
      When
      suddenly
      my
      sister's
      door
      quivered.
      Now
      doors
      don't
      do
      that
      on
      their
      own
      (using
      my
      dream
      logic),
      so
      I
      swung
      my
      hand
      out
      to
      hit
      the
      door;
      however,
      my
      hand
      stopped
      just
      before
      I
      could
      hit
      the
      door,
      not
      by
      my
      doing.
      I
      was
      suddenly
      flung
      into
      the
      air.
      My
      chest
      nearing
      the
      ceiling
      my
      head
      and
      back
      bent
      backward.
      I
      could
      feel
      breathing
      on
      my
      neck.
      Now
      terrified,
      I
      called
      out
      for
      anyone!
      Everyone!
      But
      no
      cry
      came
      out.
      Not
      even
      a
      hint
      of
      breath
      escaping
      my
      mouth.
      Every
      name
      I
      called
      me
      perspective
      would
      shift
      and
      fly
      to
      wherever
      they
      were
      and
      I
      would
      watch
      each
      person
      lift
      their
      head
      from
      a
      book
      and
      look
      up
      as
      if
      they
      thought
      they
      heard
      someone
      calling
      their
      name.
      Then
      I
      would
      watch
      as
      they
      shrugged
      off
      my
      cry.
      I
      called
      out
      one
      more
      time
      as
      I
      felt
      teeth
      brush
      against
      my
      neck.
      Then
      I
      woke
      up
      feeling
      three
      more
      breaths
      on
      my
      neck.
      I
      had
      a
      weight
      on
      my
      chest
      for
      thirty
      more
      minutes,
      while
      sensing
      a
      threat
      still
      looking
      in
      the
      shadows
      of
      my
      room.
      Then
      the
      weight
      lifted
      and
      I
      jumped
      out
      of
      bed
      at
      the
      light
      switch.

      Not
      an
      obvious
      one,
      but
      the
      scariest
      fact
      I
      know.
      The
      army
      doesn't
      hire
      anyone
      with
      an
      IQ
      of
      less
      than
      83.
      This
      is
      scary
      because
      the
      reason
      for
      the
      rule
      is
      that
      it
      was
      found
      that
      on
      average
      people
      with
      those
      scores
      cannot
      do
      anything
      productive
      that
      makes
      up
      for
      their
      inadequacy.
      That's
      about
      15%
      of
      Americans.
      That
      many
      people
      cannot
      be
      hired
      because
      of
      their
      smarts
      by
      the
      army,
      which
      always
      needs
      more
      manpower.
      Also,
      don't
      say
      that
      IQ
      means
      nothing.
      Because
      it
      correlates
      highly
      with
      life
      success,
      and
      it
      is
      literally
      a
      measure
      of
      how
      powerful
      your
      brain
      is.
      It's
      not
      biased,
      and
      everyone,
      who
      looks
      into
      the
      IQ
      literature
      knows
      that
      it
      is
      sad.

      I
      was
      downstairs
      I
      was
      afraid
      ghosts
      would
      come
      out
      of
      the
      toilet
      to
      get
      me,
      so
      I
      had
      to
      get
      upstairs
      before
      the
      toilet
      flushed
      whenever
      I
      used
      it.

      I
      have
      a
      few.
      Probably
      the
      scariest
      moment
      of
      my
      life
      was
      opening
      the
      first
      page
      to
      my
      college
      statistics
      test
      in
      my
      freshmen
      year.
      My
      second
      was
      when
      my
      friend's
      cancer
      got
      worse.
      My
      third
      was
      sleep
      paralysis.
      Also,
      the
      first
      day
      of
      high
      school
      left
      me
      shaking.

      I
      can't
      stop
      laughing
      when
      somebody
      dies
      in
      a

      It's
      because
      everyone
      else
      is
      upset
      and
      I
      get
      really
      awkward
      and
      just
      start
      laughing.
      I
      also
      find
      it
      extremely
      hard
      to

      It's
      just
      so

      No.
      I

      don't

      I
      was
      told
      I
      was
      creepy
      by
      too
      many
      of
      my
      friends
      too
      many
      times.
      I
      started
      looking
      for
      clinical
      tests
      and
      checked
      out
      as
      a
      sociopath.
      The
      differences
      between
      me
      and
      them
      are
      that
      I
      don't
      use
      emotion
      until
      I
      have
      to,
      I
      tend
      to
      star
      at
      peoples
      eyes
      and
      foreheads
      a
      little
      too
      often
      when
      talking
      to
      them,
      I
      have
      a
      really
      hard
      time
      with
      empathy,
      I
      tend
      to
      awkwardly
      laugh
      at
      a
      lot
      of
      messed
      up
      stuff,
      and
      I
      feel
      I'm
      better
      than
      others.
      The
      last
      one
      is
      the
      worst
      thing
      about
      myself.
      It
      goes
      in
      my
      notebook
      of
      daily
      regrets
      almost
      every

      I'm
      a
      middle
      sociopath.
      Not
      a
      crazy
      person
      but
      not
      normal
      in
      any
      way.
      I
      found
      out
      I
      wasn't
      normal
      a
      long
      time
      ago
      in
      6th
      grade.
      I
      don't
      know
      what
      provoked
      it,
      but
      the
      school
      decided
      to
      run
      some
      tests
      on
      me.
      That
      year
      I
      found
      out
      I
      was
      clinically
      depressed,
      I
      had
      an
      anxiety
      disorder,
      and
      I
      was
      a
      genius,
      by
      clinical
      standards
      (IQ
      of
      145
      or
      above,
      or
      around
      one
      in
      ten
      thousand).
      I
      started
      figuring
      out
      that
      I
      could
      learn
      things
      super
      quickly.
      I
      would
      be
      getting
      98s
      in
      AP
      classes.
      At
      the
      same
      time
      in
      high
      school,
      I
      found
      out
      I
      was
      a
      sociopath.
      I
      took
      a
      clinical
      test
      and
      discovered
      I
      was
      a
      moderate
      sociopath.
      Other
      traits
      are
      I
      have
      a
      really
      hard
      time
      with
      empathy
      and
      expressing
      emotions,
      which
      makes
      me
      appear
      creepy.
      A
      blank-faced
      pale
      skinny
      high
      schooler.
      I
      don't
      manipulate
      I
      just
      know
      I
      can.
      Because
      of
      my
      depression
      I
      also
      suffer
      from
      regret.
      I'm
      regretful
      of
      every
      mistake
      I've
      every
      made
      and
      keep
      them
      in
      a
      list
      in
      my
      head
      that
      comes
      up
      to
      haunt
      me
      every
      time
      I
      make
      another
      mistake.
      I
      can
      make
      friends
      easily
      because
      of
      my
      odd
      quirky
      nature,
      and
      just
      because
      I
      know
      exactly
      how
      to
      get
      people
      to
      trust
      me.
      I
      rarely
      ever
      dare
      show
      my
      real
      self.
      I'm
      rejected
      by
      the
      smart
      people
      of
      my
      school
      of
      3000.
      I
      just
      don't
      fit
      in
      anywhere,
      but
      no
      matter.
      I'll
      be
      starting
      by
      bachelors
      in
      what
      should
      be
      my
      junior
      year
      of
      high
      school.

      Coming
      from
      a
      sociopath.
      Sometimes,
      when
      smiling
      I
      forget
      to
      use
      the
      muscles
      in
      my
      eyes
      to
      make
      them
      a
      bit
      squintier,
      they're
      really
      easy
      to
      trust,
      often
      its
      a
      pain
      to
      listen
      to
      others
      talk
      about
      their
      problems
      because
      of
      reduced
      empathy,
      and
      often
      the
      face
      will
      drop
      to
      become
      blank
      at
      odd
      times.

      Sometimes.
      Often
      we
      know
      those
      cues
      and
      make
      sure
      to
      be
      careful
      about
      showing
      them.
      I
      also
      lie
      on
      purpose
      and
      make
      sure
      it's
      obvious
      that
      I'm
      lying,
      so
      I
      get
      a
      reputation
      for
      not
      lying.
      Then
      I
      can
      lie
      to
      people
      faces
      without
      question.

      Sadness
      is
      a
      state
      that
      comes
      and
      goes
      like
      a
      passing
      breeze.
      Sometimes
      there
      are
      gusts
      and
      storms.
      Depression
      is
      a
      never-ending
      tornado
      of
      deepest
      regret,
      self-loathing,
      and
      hopelessness,
      which
      is
      only
      ceased
      by
      the
      sweet
      release
      of
      death.
      It
      will
      not
      ever
      vacate
      but
      will
      stay
      by
      your
      side
      like
      a
      parasite,
      draining
      you
      of
      the
      will
      to
      live;
      however,
      it
      can
      be
      ignored,
      whether
      by
      action
      or
      drug,
      but
      the
      winds
      of
      woe
      will
      take
      you
      again.

      I
      pulled
      myself
      out
      with
      discipline.
      Not
      with
      drugs
      or
      help

      I
      hardened

      to
      my
      thoughts
      and
      feelings,
      knowing

      couldn't
      be
      fixed,
      with
      it
      being
      clinical.
      I
      made
      goals,
      I
      planned
      out
      my
      life
      and
      broke

      into
      small
      goals
      one
      by
      one
      to
      complete.
      This
      day,
      week,
      month,
      year.
      I
      bottled
      up
      my
      thoughts
      about
      my
      inadequacy
      knowing
      I
      was
      on
      my
      way
      to
      the
      person
      I
      wanted
      to
      be.
      I'm
      still
      working
      on
      each
      small
      task.
      Every
      mistake
      I
      make
      with
      induce
      a
      mountain
      of
      mental
      pain,
      but
      I
      bottle
      it
      up
      putting
      on
      a
      smile
      for
      the
      world.
      I
      save
      all
      the
      pain
      and
      rage
      for
      condemning
      the
      actions
      of
      those,
      who
      deserve
      it.
      It
      makes
      me
      intense,
      but
      I'm
      functioning.

      Intelligence
      runs
      in
      my
      family.
      My
      grandfather
      went
      to
      oxford,
      two
      of
      my

      are

      one

      cousins
      is
      a
      piano
      composer,
      who
      goes
      on
      your
      in
      China
      every
      summer.
      I
      and
      my
      sister
      are
      both
      really
      smart
      and
      being
      really
      competitive,
      with
      GPA
      becomes
      a
      contest.
      My
      sister
      is
      a
      junior
      in
      college
      while
      being
      a
      senior
      in
      Highschool.
      We
      always
      got
      along
      well.
      She
      is
      the
      book
      worm
      and
      I'm
      the
      math
      nerd.
      So
      far
      I'm
      at
      a
      4.15
      GPA
      but
      my
      sister
      is
      close
      behind.

      it

      know

      Incorrect.
      There
      is
      no
      way
      to
      improve
      your
      intelligence/IQ
      score
      after
      a
      certain
      age,
      with
      the
      exception
      of
      breastfeeding,
      which
      will
      increase
      hour
      score
      by
      on
      average
      around
      four
      points.
      I've
      looked
      into
      the
      IQ
      literature
      and
      it
      is
      depressing.
      It
      accurately
      predicts
      intelligence.
      Almost
      to
      a
      tee.
      In
      the
      60s
      we
      ran
      massive
      trials
      and
      studies
      trying
      anything
      to
      improve
      scores.
      We
      have
      found
      that
      nothing
      works.
      Brain
      games
      make
      you
      better
      at
      brain
      games.
      Early
      education
      gives
      you
      a
      headstart
      but
      the
      benefits
      end
      at
      around
      fourth
      grade.
      Not
      increasing
      scores.
      Then
      one
      question
      was
      asked.
      Perhaps
      IQ
      is
      mostly
      biological?
      After
      that,
      almost
      all
      research
      was
      dropped.
      You
      can
      guess
      why.
      Reading
      makes
      you
      more
      knowledgeable
      but
      doesn't
      actually
      make
      you
      smarter.
      It
      will
      also
      increase
      reading
      comprehension.
      I'm
      sorry.

      on
      an
      evil
      geniuses

      and
      create
      the

      biggest

      so
      he
      wouldn't
      lose
      to
      Brenda
      again,
      but
      then
      the
      U.S.
      agents
      stormed
      the
      place
      and
      sent
      me
      straight
      back
      to
      school
      put
      my
      parachute
      got
      stuck
      on
      the
      flag
      pole
      so
      I
      was
      late.
      And
      I
      pulled
      a
      mock
      parachute
      I
      was
      using
      for
      science
      fair
      out
      and
      dropped
      it
      on
      his

      How
      does
      it
      take
      two
      weeks
      to
      read
      a
      book?
      If
      you
      spend
      all
      free
      time
      which
      on
      average
      is
      8
      hours
      16
      if
      you
      don't
      have
      a
      job
      or
      school.
      This
      is
      a
      conservative
      estimate.
      If
      you
      were
      to
      none
      stop
      read
      this
      for
      two
      weeks
      assume
      an
      average
      of
      400
      pages
      per
      book.
      I
      believe
      this
      is
      reasonably
      accurate.
      So
      1200
      pages
      total.
      That's
      like
      10
      pages
      an
      hour.
      Most
      read
      above
      20.

      I'm
      a
      depressed
      genius
      sociopath.
      I
      went
      through
      some
      mental
      tests
      a
      long
      time
      ago.
      I
      discovered
      I
      was
      a
      genius
      then,
      and
      soon
      after
      I
      discovered
      I
      was
      a
      sociopath
      after...
      a
      mistake.
      The
      only
      interesting
      experience
      I
      can
      think
      of
      was
      when
      somebody
      came
      up
      to
      me
      once,
      who
      I
      had
      been
      talking
      to
      for
      a
      long
      time.
      They
      told
      me
      they
      felt
      weird
      around
      me
      all
      the
      time
      like
      I
      was
      radiating
      bad
      vibes.
      They
      said
      I
      made
      them
      feel
      very
      uncomfortable
      and
      worried.
      It
      left
      me
      shook
      since
      then
      I've
      managed
      to
      catch
      a
      few
      weird
      looks
      from
      people
      around
      me.
      Everyone
      knows
      I'm
      not
      normal
      the
      second
      I
      walk
      into
      a
      room.
      Many
      people
      can't
      put
      their
      finger
      on
      it.
      The
      few
      I've
      told
      what
      I
      am
      to
      tell
      me
      it
      makes
      sense.
      Somehow
      I
      know
      it
      makes
      sense
      too.
      Maybe
      I
      know
      it
      makes
      sense
      because
      I
      catch
      myself
      with
      I
      blank
      face
      when
      I'm
      happy,
      or
      maybe
      because
      I'm
      a
      clever
      loner.
      I've
      tried
      to
      listen,
      smile,
      and
      laugh
      but
      I
      somehow
      just
      put
      people
      off.
      I'll
      quit
      monologuing
      because
      I
      know
      you
      don't
      really
      care
      about
      my
      boring
      life.
      But
      that's
      my
      weird
      experience.

      Lenin.
      Stalin
      was
      his
      henchman.
      He
      had
      almost
      complete
      power
      over
      hundreds
      of
      millions
      of
      people.
      He
      hired
      thousands
      of
      people
      to
      micromanage
      everyone
      under
      his
      power.
      Almost
      all
      kulaks
      put
      to
      death,
      the
      state
      of
      Ukraine
      starved
      to
      the
      point
      of
      capital
      punishment
      for
      gleaning
      the
      fields,
      millions
      of
      men
      sent
      to
      war
      without
      the
      ability
      to
      surrender
      (you

      go
      home
      under
      punishment
      of
      slave

      a

      prison
      camps
      for
      all,
      who
      don't
      comply,
      a
      third
      of
      the
      population
      spies
      for
      the
      government,
      nuclear
      weapons,
      and
      the
      terrible
      power
      of
      the
      fusion
      of
      deuterium
      atoms
      of
      which
      the
      fission
      of
      uranium
      235
      is
      its

      this

      the
      terrible
      power
      over
      the
      population
      that
      Lenin
      and

      There
      was
      a
      little
      nest
      of
      baby
      bunnies
      in
      the
      grass
      and
      a
      terrible
      group
      of
      kids
      came
      up
      and
      crushed
      them
      with
      there
      feet.
      It
      was
      a
      huge
      bloody
      mess.
      It
      was
      horrible.
      The
      bones
      were
      turned
      to
      dust.
      After
      that
      day
      I
      never
      was
      under
      the
      delusion
      of
      all
      people
      are
      good.
      People
      are
      all
      evil
      to
      the
      core.
      We
      can
      do
      our
      best
      to
      ignore
      evil,
      but
      it
      will
      never
      go
      away.

      Why
      do
      you
      perceive
      the
      rich
      as
      enemies?
      They
      are
      just
      people
      trying
      to
      make
      money.
      Some
      use
      bad
      business
      practices
      and
      they
      should
      be
      called
      out
      and
      pay
      the
      price.
      But
      as
      long
      as
      all
      laws
      are
      followed
      why
      should
      we
      care?
      The
      truth
      is
      that
      almost
      all
      people
      in
      the
      united
      states
      are
      in
      the
      global
      1%.
      Are
      we
      all
      bad?
      No.
      Rich
      people
      should
      be
      looked
      upon
      not
      with
      scorn
      but
      will
      reverence.
      Our
      society
      rewards
      those,
      who
      produce
      goods,
      with
      trading
      units
      (money).
      Great
      actors,
      athletes,
      and
      inventors
      are
      wealthy
      because
      they
      earned
      it.
      Some
      rich
      people
      inherited
      their
      wealth,
      but
      what's
      wrong
      there?
      They
      didn't
      deserve
      it;
      however,
      they
      got
      the
      money
      because
      someone
      gave
      them
      a
      gift.
      And
      how
      can
      we
      be
      bad
      at
      a
      gift?
      If
      you
      write
      a
      good
      book
      you
      get
      money
      because
      you
      give
      a
      bunch
      of
      people
      entertainment.
      If
      you
      state
      a
      company
      that
      makes
      a
      revolutionary
      new
      software
      that
      helps
      the
      world
      you
      get
      money.
      And
      if
      you
      invest
      in
      a
      company
      that
      does
      well
      and
      helps
      others,
      you
      get
      money.
      Some
      companies
      like
      Monsanto
      sell
      herbicides
      to
      help
      farmers
      with
      weeds
      and
      are
      also
      rewarded.
      The
      only
      enemies
      are
      those,
      who
      cheat
      and
      use
      unethical
      business
      practices,
      which
      are
      fewer
      than
      you
      think.
      Coming
      from
      a
      rather
      poor
      person
      in
      the
      midwest,
      who
      believes
      in
      the
      basic
      principal
      of
      innocent
      until
      proven
      guilty.
      Explain
      to
      me
      why
      this
      is
      a
      justifiable
      question
      to
      even
      be
      asking?

      Scythe.
      Summary:
      It's
      a
      book
      series
      that
      currently
      has
      only
      two
      books
      and
      the
      third
      and
      likely
      final
      will
      come
      out
      in
      2020.
      It
      begins
      in
      a
      future
      where
      all
      disease
      and
      aging
      has
      been
      stopped.
      The
      only
      way
      to
      die
      is
      by
      fire
      and
      acid,
      which
      cannot
      be
      healed,
      or
      by
      a
      scythe.
      The
      world
      is
      run
      by
      a
      super
      intelligent
      AI
      called
      the
      thunderhead,
      but
      at
      the
      same
      time
      a
      separate
      government,
      the
      order
      of
      the
      scythe,
      is
      in
      charge
      of...
      Overpopulation.
      They
      must
      kill.
      Scythes
      are
      meant
      to
      kill,
      but
      like
      regular
      people,
      they
      grieve
      for
      there
      actions.
      But
      some
      enjoy
      the
      killing
      and
      they
      are
      trying
      to
      overthrow
      the
      old
      guard
      of
      the
      scythe.

      Coming
      from
      a
      person,
      who
      has
      been
      taking
      college
      classes
      in
      my
      freshman
      year
      of
      high
      school.
      I
      come
      home
      to
      make
      a
      cup
      of
      a
      coffee
      turn
      on
      my
      favorite
      song
      to
      relax
      too.
      Then
      I
      drink
      the
      cup
      with
      my
      eyes
      closed
      as
      long
      as
      the
      song
      lasts,
      while
      rationalizing
      and
      organizing
      all
      the
      things
      I
      need
      to
      do.
      Then
      once
      the
      song
      ends
      and
      my
      cup
      is
      dry.
      I
      get
      up
      and
      get
      back
      to
      work.

      It's
      because
      I'm
      sick
      of
      the
      bullshit.
      The,
      you
      can't
      say
      retard,
      you
      can't
      say
      this,
      you
      can't
      say
      that
      biological
      sex
      doesn't
      exist,
      furries
      (no
      explanation
      needed),
      the
      fact
      that
      some
      people
      with
      a
      weekend
      to
      kill
      can
      make
      a
      few
      dozen
      completely
      fabricated
      thesis
      papers
      for
      gender
      studies
      using
      quotes
      from
      Hitler
      with
      white
      men
      in
      place
      of
      the
      word
      jews
      and
      get
      a
      dozen
      accepted,
      the
      hypocrisy,
      the
      fact
      that
      nobody
      wants
      to
      admit
      that
      ALL
      media
      is
      biased
      to
      one
      side
      or
      another,
      I'm
      sick
      of
      the
      pandering
      and
      the
      lies,
      and
      most
      of
      all
      I'm
      sick
      of
      the
      left
      being
      racist
      against
      white
      people,
      saying
      they're
      a
      plague.
      And
      for
      the
      sake
      of
      my
      sanity
      can
      you
      please
      spell
      check
      before
      you
      post
      it's
      driving
      me
      crazy.

      I'd

      on

      it
      leans

      Why
      do
      you
      think
      studies
      show
      that
      80%
      of
      drivers
      say
      they're
      above
      average?
      Why
      do
      dumb
      people
      say
      they're
      smart?
      Why
      do
      we
      take
      so
      many
      selfies?
      Why
      do
      we
      get
      so
      angry
      do
      fast?
      And
      why
      don't
      you
      call
      your
      mom
      and
      say
      I
      love
      you
      at
      least
      once
      a
      year?
      I
      know
      I
      don't.

      Think
      of
      it
      this
      way.
      You
      need
      to
      get
      to
      work
      and
      you
      want
      to
      read.
      Listen
      to
      audiobooks.
      You
      could
      work
      more
      hours
      or
      you
      could
      start
      investing.
      You
      could
      stick
      with
      your
      crappy
      job
      or
      you
      could
      look
      for
      a
      good
      job
      with
      a
      higher
      salary
      applie
      for
      it
      and
      just
      before
      being
      hired
      talk
      to
      your
      old
      boss.
      Either
      you
      pay
      me
      more
      or
      I
      quit
      and
      get
      a
      new
      job.
      You
      could
      work
      really
      hard
      fixing
      the
      fridge
      or
      you
      could
      hire
      someone
      to
      do
      it
      (if
      it
      costs
      less
      than
      your
      job
      would
      if
      that
      would've
      been
      a
      job
      you
      were
      given.

      It's
      true
      that
      it
      can
      be
      hard
      to

      smarter,

      in

      its
      not
      harder.
      But
      most
      are
      easy.
      Before
      you
      start
      a
      hard
      task
      that
      you

      do,
      just
      take
      a
      few
      minutes
      to
      think
      about
      ways
      to
      do
      it
      faster
      or
      easier,
      and
      most
      of
      the
      time
      you
      will
      be
      able
      to
      find
      a
      way
      to
      make
      it
      just
      a
      little
      less
      painful.

      Because
      it's
      a
      greedy
      notion.
      Example.
      You
      sell
      apples
      and
      make
      300
      bucks.
      You
      worked
      all
      day
      to
      sell
      them
      door
      to
      door
      and
      you're
      tired.
      Now
      the
      government
      comes
      in
      takes
      299
      bucks
      and
      gives
      it
      to
      your
      neighbors.
      Sound
      fair?
      That's
      what
      I
      thought.
      Capitalism
      is
      a
      fair
      system.
      If
      you
      work
      hard
      you
      get
      money.
      And
      if
      you
      make
      a
      poor
      life
      decision
      you
      pay
      the
      consequences.

      A
      paragraph
      is
      hardly
      comparable
      to
      a
      lecture,
      and
      in
      answer
      to
      your
      confusion,
      I
      wrote
      'explain'
      because
      I
      had
      to
      write
      something
      before
      my
      food
      got
      burnt.
      I
      don't
      really
      know
      much
      about
      the
      fall
      of
      Yugoslavia;
      however,
      I'm
      questioning
      your
      stance
      that
      socialism
      works.
      In
      you're
      original
      comment
      you
      didn't
      really
      say
      much
      about
      why
      it
      works,
      but
      it
      was
      rather
      a
      lot
      of
      you
      defending
      that
      it
      wasn't
      the
      ideology
      that
      was
      the
      downfall
      of
      the
      state.
      My
      stance
      is
      that
      socialism
      works,
      but
      it
      doesn't
      work
      nearly
      as
      well
      as
      loosely
      regulated
      capitalism.
      Define,
      "socialism
      works"?

      Makes
      sense.
      No
      ideology
      is
      perfect,
      but
      nobody
      should
      be
      able
      to
      steal
      from
      anyone
      rich
      or
      poor.
      And
      I
      have
      to
      wonder
      why
      you
      don't
      seem
      to
      be
      arguing
      against
      it.

      Yes,
      people
      are
      running
      to
      radicalism,
      with
      a
      rapidly
      increasing
      rate.
      I
      used
      to
      be
      really
      stubborn
      with
      my
      opinions
      until
      one
      of
      my
      teachers
      set
      me
      aside
      and
      told
      me
      to
      listen.
      Not
      just
      hear.
      Socialism
      can
      work
      reasonably
      well
      on
      some
      levels
      under
      certain
      conditions,
      but
      personally,
      I'll
      leave
      my
      faith
      with
      the
      free
      market.

      the

      is
      because

      Get

      superiority
      complex.
      Iran
      doesn't
      want
      a
      fight.
      They
      want
      to
      scare
      Norway
      and
      some
      other
      countries
      just

      get
      some
      money
      from
      them
      to
      leave
      them
      alone.
      They
      are
      doing
      this
      because
      we
      put
      restrictions
      on
      their
      economy.
      We
      shouldn't
      get
      pushed
      around
      by
      a
      third
      rate
      navy
      if
      they
      start
      attacking
      American
      ships.

      I'm
      a

      so

      However,
      I
      think
      it
      dumb

      they
      let

      Because
      kids
      are
      stupid.
      Should
      we
      trust
      them
      with
      transitioning?
      No.
      And
      also
      as
      a
      society,
      we
      should
      have
      a

      where
      XX
      cannot

      It's
      boring

      boring
      respectively.
      Talk

      crossfind

      number
      so
      you
      can
      "share
      your

      Don't
      be
      nervous.
      Just
      talk
      to
      them
      like
      you

      IQ
      is
      not
      a
      scam
      whatever
      anyone
      else
      says.
      It's
      just
      controversial
      because
      who
      likes
      to
      be
      called
      dumb?
      It
      has
      some
      testing
      variability
      but
      it
      will
      only
      be
      off
      by
      a
      few
      points.
      The
      research
      has
      been
      done.
      It
      is
      the
      highest
      predictor
      of
      life
      success.
      You
      can
      ask
      a
      psychologist
      to
      administer
      an
      IQ
      test
      if
      you
      want
      one.
      But
      sadly
      most
      free
      alternatives
      are
      poorly
      made
      bs.
      IQ
      cannot
      be
      increased,
      the
      only
      proven
      way
      to
      do
      so
      is
      breastfeeding,
      which
      will
      on
      average
      increase
      your
      score
      by
      Four
      points.
      IQ
      falls
      as
      you
      get
      older,
      which
      mag
      be
      why
      your
      parents
      were
      so
      dumb.
      This
      can
      be
      almost
      entirely
      stopped
      by
      regular
      exercise
      though.
      IQ
      research
      is
      grim.
      Because
      it's
      not
      lie.

      I
      never
      really
      noticed
      I
      was
      different
      until
      I
      was
      conversing
      with
      some
      friends
      and
      the
      topic
      came
      up.
      Afterwards,
      I
      looked
      into
      it
      a
      bit
      and
      everything
      checked
      out.
      I
      have
      some
      other
      issues
      and
      I
      brought
      the
      term
      up
      with
      my
      therapist
      and
      he
      said
      that
      I
      did
      have
      almost
      all
      the
      tendencies.
      So
      he
      gave
      me
      the
      test
      and
      I
      checked
      out
      as
      a
      sociopath.
      I
      started
      to
      watch
      myself
      kind
      of
      like
      a
      third
      person
      spectators
      as
      I
      talked
      to
      people
      and
      I
      noticed
      myself
      pulling
      the
      conversation
      and
      twisting
      the
      words.
      I
      weave
      my
      way
      through
      conversations
      watching
      where
      the
      eyes
      of
      my
      friends
      look
      all
      to
      get
      to
      the
      desired
      outcome.
      I
      realized
      I
      was
      a
      narcissist,
      which
      is
      a
      trait
      I
      try
      hard
      to
      fight
      back,
      but
      it's
      hard.
      Also,
      I
      noticed
      that
      I
      don't
      seem
      to
      care
      about
      the
      feelings
      of
      others.
      I'm
      rude
      like
      a
      reflex.
      I'm
      bored
      at
      the
      funerals
      of
      close
      family
      members,
      and
      I
      didn't
      know
      how
      to
      feel
      about
      my
      friend
      getting
      cancer.
      If
      you
      have
      any
      other
      questions
      feel
      free
      to
      ask.
      I
      don't
      really
      care.

      Yes,
      I
      have
      a
      weird
      combination
      of
      mental
      illness.
      I'm
      a
      sociopath,
      which
      makes
      me
      narcissistic,
      and

      which
      makes

      will

      me
      miserable.

      Your
      right.
      It
      measures
      classical
      intelligence.
      The
      kind
      that
      predicts
      life
      success.
      That's
      because
      the
      other
      kinds
      of
      smarts
      can't
      be
      reliably
      measured.

      This
      only
      works
      if
      you're
      tired,
      but
      stop
      trying
      to
      go
      to
      sleep.
      Enjoy
      the
      nice
      comfy
      bed.
      Be
      ok
      with
      lying
      on
      your
      back
      and
      just
      staying
      still
      for
      a
      long
      time.
      Just
      have
      the
      mindset
      of,
      'it
      doesn't
      matter.'
      It's

      describe
      what
      my
      sleep
      strategy
      is
      as
      you
      can
      no
      doubt
      see.
      But
      it
      works
      for
      me.

      I

      zone
      in
      a

      that's

      ran

      then
      drove

      Being

      isn't

      It's
      boring.
      Every
      conversation
      is
      like
      listening
      to
      your
      Alzheimers
      great
      uncle
      tell
      the
      only
      story
      he
      knows
      for
      the
      fifteenth
      time.
      Small
      talk
      is
      even
      worse.
      But
      I
      seek
      out
      smart
      people
      to
      talk
      to
      because
      smart
      people
      tend
      not
      to
      fake
      and
      they're
      more
      interesting.

      It
      was
      a
      long
      time
      ago.
      There
      were
      these
      kids
      at
      my
      school
      who
      were
      always
      a
      bit
      off,
      and
      one
      day
      a
      bunch
      of
      us
      found
      a
      best
      of
      baby
      bunnies
      in
      the
      grass.
      Super
      cute
      and
      tiny.
      I
      had
      my
      back
      turned
      when
      they
      came
      by;
      however,
      when
      I
      heard
      the
      squeaking
      nothing
      could
      be
      done.
      The
      little
      monsters
      pulverized
      the
      bones
      of
      the
      cute
      little
      things.

      can't

      they

      the
      sacrifices
      to
      get
      to
      their

      If

      not

      the

      they

      They

      work
      on
      themselves
      to
      be
      worth

      job.
      You
      aren't
      entitled
      to
      a
      wage.
      You
      get
      the
      wage
      you
      deserve;
      however,
      you
      can
      make
      laws
      that
      can
      entitle
      you
      to
      a
      wage,
      but
      these
      laws
      always
      have
      negative
      side
      effects,
      as
      I
      believe
      that
      social
      changes
      also
      have
      an
      equal
      and
      opposite
      reaction,
      rather
      than
      just
      physical
      changes.
      If
      they
      are
      still
      struggling
      to
      live
      a
      good
      life,
      there
      is
      nothing
      that
      can
      be
      done.
      That's
      not
      the
      fault
      of
      the
      system;
      rather,
      that
      is
      your
      lot
      in
      life.
      Don't
      tear
      down
      the
      system,
      because
      it's
      easy
      to
      make
      the
      most
      complex
      system
      in
      the
      world
      worse
      than
      better.
      Please
      tell

      Black
      holes
      the
      remains
      of
      really
      big
      stars.
      Stars
      run
      on
      nuclear
      fusion,
      which
      is
      the
      reaction
      that
      makes
      hydrogen
      bombs
      possible.
      When
      all
      that
      mass
      is
      collected
      into
      one
      spot,
      it
      begins
      to
      squeeze
      itself
      into
      a
      very
      small
      spot,
      and
      when
      you
      squeeze
      atoms
      together
      hard
      enough,
      for
      example,
      hydrogen,
      they
      become
      one
      atom
      helium;
      however,
      the
      mass
      of
      the
      helium
      atom
      will
      be
      less
      than
      the
      mass
      of
      the
      two
      hydrogen
      atoms,
      which
      means
      that
      some
      of
      the
      mass
      turned
      into
      energy
      via
      E=mc^2.
      This
      release
      of
      energy
      keeps
      the
      mass
      of
      the
      star
      from
      squishing
      itself
      into
      a
      smaller
      space.
      It's
      a
      balance
      between
      the
      fusion
      reaction
      and
      the
      mass
      of
      the
      star,
      but
      soon
      the
      hydrogen
      will
      run
      out
      if
      the
      star
      is
      really
      big.
      The
      helium
      fuses
      into
      carbon;
      the
      carbon
      to
      neon;
      the
      neon
      to
      iron;
      and
      iron
      to
      lead.
      Lead
      cannot
      be
      fused
      any
      further,
      so
      the
      reaction
      dies
      and
      along
      with
      it,
      the
      star
      collapses.
      The
      gravitational
      force
      keeps
      pulling
      down
      until
      the
      protons
      and
      electrons
      fuse
      together
      and
      become
      neutrons,
      which
      makes
      them
      star
      into
      a
      neutron
      star.
      If
      the
      mass
      is
      still
      crushing
      down
      the
      hadrons
      themselves
      get
      ripped
      apart
      into
      strange
      matter.
      A
      quark-gluon
      soup.
      If
      the
      mass
      is
      great
      enough
      even
      the
      elementary
      particles
      break
      and
      the
      star
      becomes
      a
      black
      hole.
      Theoretically,
      the
      mass
      keeps
      getting
      crushed
      into
      a
      zero-dimensional
      point,
      a
      singularity.
      The
      gravity
      around
      this
      is
      so
      strong
      that
      photons,
      the
      waves/particles
      that
      interact
      with
      the
      electromagnetic
      field,
      or
      light,
      cannot
      escape
      its
      gravity.
      The
      star
      is
      now
      a
      black
      hole.
      There
      are
      supermassive
      black
      holes,
      which
      reside
      at
      the
      center
      of
      galaxies,
      and
      some
      of
      these
      at
      so
      huge
      we
      call
      them
      ultra-massive
      black
      holes,
      these
      are
      black
      holes
      with
      billions
      of
      times
      the
      mass
      of
      our
      sun.
      There
      has
      been
      some
      speculation
      about
      black
      holes
      that
      they
      violate
      the
      first
      law
      of
      thermodynamics
      (no
      mass
      can
      be
      destroyed
      or
      created);
      however,
      I
      recently
      went
      to
      a
      lecture
      that
      disproved
      this
      hypothesis.
      Without
      explaining
      the
      mathematical
      proof
      of
      this,
      which
      made
      that
      lecture
      quite
      dull,
      because
      of
      quantum
      flux
      (small
      particles
      and
      antiparticles
      that
      pop
      in
      and
      out
      of
      existence,
      which
      then
      annihilate
      each
      other
      because
      the
      universe
      finest
      care
      about
      the
      first
      law
      of
      thermodynamics
      as
      long
      as
      the
      average
      of
      the
      mass
      in
      the
      universe
      is
      still
      the
      same),
      the
      black
      hole
      will
      slowly
      lose
      its
      mass
      by
      Hawking
      radiation
      (
      the
      process
      by
      which
      a
      particle
      and
      an
      antiparticle
      pop
      in
      and
      out
      of
      existence
      near
      the
      event
      horizon
      of
      the
      black
      hole,
      where
      one
      tiny
      particle
      falls
      in
      and
      one
      escapes
      from
      the
      black
      hole,
      and
      because
      the
      universe
      says
      that
      this
      can't
      happen
      it
      removes
      a
      particle
      from
      the
      black
      hole
      so
      that
      the
      particle,
      which
      escaped
      can
      safely
      exist.

      I
      don't
      think
      so.
      Our
      mathematical
      map
      encompasses
      all.
      Our
      main
      system
      use
      base
      10
      but
      we
      can
      use
      any
      number,
      it
      compasses
      shapes
      and
      shapes
      in
      higher
      dimensions
      and
      notes
      and
      their
      functions,
      physics,
      the
      basic
      functions,
      manipulating
      basic
      functions,
      trigonometric
      functions
      and
      it's
      math,
      calculus,
      the
      math
      of
      graphs,
      matrix
      theory,
      and
      all
      of
      the
      branches
      of
      higher-level
      mathematics
      ever
      being
      added
      to
      one
      proof
      at
      a
      time.
      There
      are
      many
      languages
      already
      tied
      into
      our
      known
      mathematical
      theory.
      There
      probably
      are
      more
      languages
      to
      add
      to
      our
      math
      map,
      but
      I
      don't
      think
      anything
      that
      can't
      be
      tied
      to
      it.
      Unless
      someone
      discovered
      a
      math
      language
      much
      higher
      then
      what
      we
      can
      already
      comprehend.

      your

      Depressing

      not

      chemicals
      also
      leads

      your
      eyes.
      You
      will
      watch
      everything
      crumble
      to
      dust.
      Nothing
      matters
      in
      the
      end
      when
      the
      sun
      explode
      and
      in
      a
      trillion
      trillion
      trillion
      years
      the
      atoms
      decay
      and
      in
      a
      bother
      trillion
      trillion
      trillion
      years
      so
      will
      the
      hadrons.
      We
      will
      all
      die.
      All
      of
      this
      is
      true,
      but
      any
      fool
      can
      pick
      a
      range
      of
      time
      in
      which
      nothing
      will
      matter.
      Your
      brain
      will
      feed
      you
      the
      truth,
      but
      you
      can
      still
      be
      happy
      once
      enlightened.
      You
      must
      not
      fall
      into
      the
      lies
      that
      happiness
      is
      the
      goal.

      A

      like

      in

      poverty
      will

      Like

      an

      never
      come
      to

      Let
      someone
      else
      praise
      you,
      not
      yourself.
      Life
      is
      a
      disease.
      Everything
      you
      love
      will
      crumble
      to
      dust.
      Everyone
      you
      love
      will
      die
      a
      horrible
      death.
      Everything
      you
      live
      for
      is
      worthless.
      Everything
      horrible
      about
      life
      will
      through
      itself
      at
      the

      of
      your
      emotional
      defenses,
      so
      be
      prepared.
      If
      you
      falter
      in
      times
      of
      struggle
      how
      little
      is
      your
      strength?
      And
      once
      you
      beat
      those
      things
      that
      crush
      your
      soul,
      make
      them
      a
      joke
      to
      everyone
      and
      yourself
      and
      through
      it
      show
      yourself
      to
      everyone
      that
      you
      are
      strong
      and
      that
      what
      is
      filth
      is
      weak!
      So
      tell
      nobody
      that
      some
      jokes
      are
      off-limits!
      Don't
      live
      in
      the
      present,
      but
      for
      the
      future.
      For
      if
      you
      don't
      prepare
      for
      the
      storm
      you
      will
      be
      swept
      away.

      You
      could
      do
      that,
      but
      when
      layoffs
      come
      around
      you're
      first
      up.
      With
      that
      work
      ethic,
      you
      will
      likely
      not

      promoted
      or
      make
      many
      beneficial
      relationships.
      Your
      points
      do
      hold
      some
      merit;
      however,
      in
      a
      work
      environment,
      good
      work
      is
      rarely
      left
      unrewarded.
      If
      your
      boss
      really
      is
      squeezing
      every
      penny
      out
      of
      you,
      then
      I
      would
      advise
      finding
      a
      better
      job.

      Being
      smart

      being
      good
      at

      a

      Wisdom
      is

      calm
      while

      yelled

      it's
      knowing
      to
      live
      for
      the
      future
      and
      not
      the

      past;
      its
      not
      standing
      for
      truth
      its
      the
      willingness
      to
      sit
      in
      jail

      truth;

      its
      overlooking
      an
      insult
      to
      your
      own
      glory.
      Wisdom
      stands

      shouts
      in
      the

      of
      a

      a
      camp
      week,
      a
      bunch
      of
      people
      met
      in
      the
      dining
      hall
      to
      eat
      the
      extra
      ice
      cream
      at
      midnight,
      when
      a
      bunch
      of
      us
      decided
      to
      put
      the
      circle
      on
      a
      piece
      of
      paper
      (if
      you
      don't
      know
      its
      a
      game
      where
      you
      make
      a
      circle
      with
      your
      hand
      and
      put
      it
      below
      your
      waste
      and
      if
      you
      look
      at
      it
      not
      with
      your
      peripherals
      you
      get
      slapped).
      We
      made
      a
      few
      and
      dispersed
      around
      the
      camp.
      We
      put
      one
      on
      the
      doormat
      of
      each
      cabin
      and
      banged
      on
      the
      door
      and
      moved
      on.
      After
      a
      while,
      we
      woke
      up
      and
      ding
      dong
      ditched
      half
      the
      camp.

      First
      of
      all,
      this
      sounds
      like
      a
      question
      that
      should
      end
      with
      a
      'hypothetically
      speaking.'
      You
      should
      get
      them
      into
      a
      situation
      where
      conversation
      is
      almost
      forced.
      Like
      a
      restaurant.
      Next,
      you
      either
      pick
      blunt
      or
      roundabout.
      If
      blunt
      then
      just
      tell
      them
      what's
      on
      your
      mind.
      If
      roundabout
      then
      start
      with
      something
      that
      has
      nothing
      to
      do
      with
      the
      issue.
      Then
      slowly
      push
      the
      conversation
      where
      you
      need
      it
      to
      go
      to.
      If
      they
      try
      to
      redirect,
      pull
      them
      right
      back.
      Do
      not
      get
      mad.
      Stay
      calm.
      If
      they
      get
      angry,
      calm
      them
      down.
      Be
      perfectly
      logical.
      Write
      out
      the
      problem
      and
      the
      conversation.
      Plan
      it
      out.
      Remove
      your
      own
      paradoxes.
      I'm
      assuming
      a
      lot,
      but
      I
      hope
      this
      helps.
      Also,
      remember
      that
      an
      underserved
      curse
      never
      comes
      to
      rest.
      So
      don't
      make
      it
      worse.

      Thanks
      for
      the
      information.
      You
      avoided
      information
      about
      the
      falling
      out
      and
      it
      would
      be
      helpful
      if
      you
      told
      me
      that
      also;
      however,
      if
      you
      would
      rather
      not
      divulge
      I
      will
      still
      try
      to
      assess
      the
      situation
      and
      help.
      This
      is
      only
      speculation,
      but
      from
      what
      you've
      told
      me,
      this
      person
      at
      first
      appeared
      to
      want
      to
      mend
      things
      but
      has
      since
      broken
      off
      the
      remaining
      ties
      between
      you
      two.
      Also,
      from
      what
      you
      have
      said
      about
      this
      person,
      she
      appears
      to
      have
      several
      toxic
      traits.
      This
      leads
      me
      to
      believe
      that
      she
      wanted
      to
      cause
      you
      some
      emotional
      turmoil
      as
      one
      last
      middle
      finger.
      It
      my
      understanding
      that
      she
      first
      wanted
      to
      open
      you
      up
      with
      a
      kind
      photo
      and
      some
      appearances
      of
      trying
      to
      mend
      things
      only
      to
      then
      block
      you
      and
      leave
      you
      with
      some
      very
      mixed
      feelings.
      This
      is
      likely
      chalking
      up
      ignorance
      and
      mistakes
      to
      malice.
      Nevertheless,
      this
      is
      one
      conclusion
      that
      can
      be
      made
      from
      the
      information.
      She
      may
      have
      blocked
      the
      wrong
      person.
      Check.
      She
      may
      have
      blocked
      you
      a
      while
      ago
      when
      she
      was
      mad
      at
      you
      (assumptions).
      Check.
      Talk
      to
      her.
      Don't
      avoid
      conversation.
      If
      you
      don't
      ask,
      you
      won't
      know.
      If
      she
      doesn't
      answer
      or
      you
      can't
      contact
      her...
      Then
      if
      you
      ever
      stumble
      across
      her
      again
      be
      kind
      and
      forgive.
      If
      you
      can
      contact
      her
      make
      sure
      you
      aren't
      pointing
      the
      blame
      anywhere
      for
      obvious
      reasons.
      Plan
      fun
      things
      to
      do
      together.
      Spend
      more
      time
      together.
      These
      take
      a
      long
      time
      to
      write
      and
      I
      need
      to
      go.
      I
      hope
      this
      helps.

      Reward
      yourself
      once
      you
      are
      done.
      Example,
      I

      read
      more
      books.
      I
      will

      for
      half

      hour
      every

      After

      I
      will
      read
      for
      one
      hour
      a
      day.
      After
      a
      week,
      I
      will
      slowly
      remove
      the
      reward.

      Only
      those,
      who
      have
      depression
      that
      bad
      can
      say;
      however,
      I've
      struggled
      with
      mild
      depression
      my
      whole
      life.
      When
      every
      mistake
      that
      you
      have
      ever
      made
      is
      continually
      mounted
      on
      your
      conscience
      over
      and
      over
      in
      never-ending
      waves
      filling
      you
      with
      a
      feeling
      of
      deepest
      regret
      again
      and
      again
      and
      again
      and
      again;
      when
      your
      very
      being
      is
      crushed
      by
      the
      pointlessness
      of
      getting
      up
      only
      to
      try
      and
      fail
      and
      miss
      the
      mark
      again
      and
      again;
      when
      your
      hopes
      and
      dreams
      are
      being
      dashed
      against
      the
      rocks
      of
      reality
      again
      in
      a
      flood
      of
      anguish
      over
      your
      obliterated
      soul;
      when
      you
      know
      you
      are
      too
      weak
      to
      bring
      the
      blade
      against
      your
      own
      neck;
      what
      should
      you
      do
      but
      surge
      yourself
      in
      your
      unconsciousness
      where
      you
      will
      be
      haunted
      by
      nightmares
      better
      than
      reality?

      I

      with
      my
      mild
      depression.
      I
      never

      anything
      horrible

      I
      also
      didn't

      after

      speak
      about
      manipulation
      I
      realized
      I

      We
      have
      been
      splitting
      into
      tribes.
      Tribes
      of
      politics,
      sports,
      victimization
      level,
      color,
      gender,
      etc...
      I
      predict
      that
      this
      will
      continue
      to
      happen
      so
      that
      soon
      our
      attempts
      at
      being
      kind
      and
      caring
      will
      soon
      lead
      us
      into
      another
      global
      war.

      Sleep.
      Lack
      of
      sleep
      makes
      your
      brain
      slower
      Practice.
      The
      way
      you
      get
      better
      at
      math
      is
      by
      practice
      If
      this
      isn't
      a
      recurring
      problem
      then
      it's
      not
      a
      big
      deal.
      I
      breeze
      through
      most
      math,
      but
      occasionally
      some
      problems
      I
      get
      super
      stuck
      on.
      Then
      once
      I
      look
      back
      it

      As
      a
      sociopath,
      I
      think
      you
      need
      to
      know
      what
      you're
      talking
      about.
      Narcissism
      isn't
      selfishness.
      True
      narcissism
      is
      where
      you
      can't
      think
      about
      others.
      A
      bird
      will
      hit
      your
      window
      and
      you
      will
      think
      that
      the
      bird
      is
      trying
      to
      tell
      you
      something.
      It
      has
      to
      be
      about
      you.
      It
      can't
      just
      be
      a
      bird
      has
      hit
      a
      window.
      It's
      more
      than
      just
      selfishness.
      Sociopathy
      can
      be
      seen
      as
      a
      bell
      curve
      where
      the
      average
      is
      very
      little
      trait
      Sociopathy.
      The
      sociopathic
      traits
      are
      selfishness,
      a
      lack
      of
      empathy,
      which
      leads
      to
      manipulativeness.
      Psychopathy
      can
      also
      be
      seen
      as
      a
      bell
      curve
      but
      the
      been
      is
      much
      less
      than
      the
      latter.
      This
      is
      essentially
      sociopathy,
      but
      with
      more
      violent
      tendencies.
      Narcissism
      is
      a
      mental
      illness;
      however,
      I
      believe
      that
      sociopaths
      and
      psychopaths
      are
      just
      people
      who
      have
      abnormal
      personality
      traits,
      which
      help
      them
      succeed!
      Most
      executives
      are
      sociopaths!

      Sorry,
      got

      banditos,

      shipped
      me
      off

      to
      make
      crack,

      they
      got
      raided

      helicoptered

      nearest
      exit
      door

      late

      Needless
      to
      say,
      he
      didn't
      approve

      gave

      chair
      and
      started
      smearing
      bread
      on
      the
      wall
      while
      vaping.
      Found
      a
      piece
      of
      toast
      in
      each
      toilet.
      I
      couldn't
      stop
      laughing.

      Being

      A
      person
      easily

      Not

      an

      curse
      never

      Setting

      the

      for
      the

      A

      We

      Taking
      responsibility
      is
      the

      of
      life.
      Knowing

      worked,
      helped,
      sacrificed,
      succeeded,
      excelled,

      developed,
      this
      is

      I
      used

      terrified
      of
      dogs.
      They
      would
      scare
      the
      crap
      out

      me.
      After

      The

      dogs
      still
      makes

      shiver.
      Just

      my

      Everyone
      believes
      in
      pollution.
      Does
      anyone
      see
      trash
      on
      the
      ground
      and
      say,
      "look!
      A
      figment
      of
      my
      imagination."
      I
      believe
      in
      both,
      but
      I'm
      not
      too
      concerned
      about
      global
      warming.
      We
      can
      just
      switch
      to
      nuclear
      energy,
      which
      has
      zero
      emissions.
      Why
      all
      the
      expensive
      solar
      and
      wind?
      We
      can
      engineer
      sea
      walls,
      Big
      dikes.
      Anyway,
      the
      climate
      does
      change
      from
      time
      to
      time,
      and
      we
      will
      adapt.
      An
      example
      of
      nuclear
      power
      would
      be
      France.
      Most
      of
      their
      power
      comes
      from
      nuclear.
      They
      almost
      no
      power
      issues.
      Germany
      has
      switched
      to
      almost
      all
      solar
      and
      wind
      and
      they
      have
      power
      problems
      all
      the
      time.
      People
      have
      this
      dream
      of
      a
      future
      of
      only
      solar
      and
      wind,
      but
      it's
      just
      not
      going
      to
      happen
      anytime
      soon.

      Thanks
      for
      the
      clarification.
      I
      would
      say
      it's
      not
      a
      smart
      idea
      to
      deregulate
      it.
      Coal
      and
      oil
      are
      the
      real
      killers.
      If
      you
      look
      at
      what
      kinds
      of
      power
      put
      out
      the
      most
      carbon
      it
      would
      be
      coal,
      oil,
      then
      natural
      gas,
      then
      a
      few
      others,
      and
      it's
      significantly
      better
      then
      the
      first
      two.
      Some
      natural
      gas
      plants
      actually
      calculate
      how
      much
      carbon
      they
      output
      then
      they
      collect
      that
      much
      carbon
      out
      of
      the
      air
      and
      use
      it
      to
      power
      the
      plant!
      If
      our
      goal
      is
      to
      reduce
      carbon
      emissions
      while
      causing
      as
      little
      harm
      to
      the
      economy
      and
      to
      our
      pockets
      (taxes).
      We
      would
      want
      to
      first
      start
      removing
      coal
      and
      oil
      then
      make
      sure
      that
      all
      other
      fissile
      fuel
      power
      stations
      emit
      a
      minimal
      amount
      of
      carbon
      then
      we
      can
      construct
      more
      nuclear
      power
      plants,
      and
      also
      build
      some
      wind
      and
      solar
      plants
      also.

      One
      of
      the
      reasons
      we
      have
      money
      in
      mind
      is
      that
      our
      geopolitical
      rivals
      also
      have
      money
      in
      mind,
      and
      it
      would
      be
      foolish
      to
      cripple
      ourselves
      for
      a
      nevertheless
      important
      cause,
      while
      everyone
      else
      refuses
      to
      help
      fix
      the
      problem
      also.
      Btw
      I
      mixed

      regulate
      and
      deregulate
      in
      my
      previous
      message.
      Sorry,
      so
      let
      me
      clarify
      I
      was
      saying
      that
      we
      should
      not
      regulate
      it
      now
      because
      we
      should
      remove
      the
      greater
      evil
      first
      then
      work
      on
      refining
      or
      practices
      to
      accept

      It's

      you
      aren't

      to
      say,
      don't
