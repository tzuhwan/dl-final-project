      slut
      shamed.

      I
      bought
      an
      S7
      from
      Amazon
      at
      the
      end
      of
      March.
      Since
      then
      I've
      had
      nothing
      but
      trouble.
      It
      will
      shut
      off
      randomly
      if
      I
      plug
      it
      in
      to
      charge
      overnight
      \(which
      has
      made
      me
      late
      for
      work
      on
      more
      than
      one
      occasion\),
      and
      sometimes
      it
      does
      this
      during
      the
      day
      too.
      No
      rhyme
      or
      reason,
      just
      shuts
      down.
      The
      notification
      light
      will
      still
      flash
      though.
      Has
      anyone
      else
      experienced
      this?
      Is
      there
      anything
      that
      can
      be
      done,
      or
      should
      I
      put
      myself
      in
      the
      market
      for
      a

      My
      big
      issue
      with
      the
      app
      is
      that
      I
      don't
      feel
      it
      "teaches"
      you
      the
      language.
      You're
      just
      given
      the
      sentences
      to
      translate,
      with
      no
      real
      explanation
      of
      why
      this
      is
      the
      word
      order,
      or
      why
      this
      verb
      is
      conjugated
      as
      so.
      If
      there
      was
      a
      little
      explainer,
      or
      a
      short
      video
      tutorial,
      before
      the
      challenges,
      I
      feel
      it
      would
      be
      much
      more
      beneficial.

      When

      were
      just

      it
      at
      his
      place,
      me
      at

      He
      revealed
      he
      had
      never
      seen
      the
      movie
      before,
      and
      I
      continuously
      told
      him
      I
      wanted
      to
      be
      there
      to
      see
      his
      reactions
      to
      certain
      parts,
      and
      to
      the
      movie
      overall
      \(to
      throw
      him
      off
      the
      scent
      that
      something
      would
      happen.\)
      I
      had
      been
      saying
      "I
      wish
      I
      was
      on
      your
      couch
      with
      you
      right
      now,
      so
      we
      could
      watch
      it
      together."
      I
      still
      give
      him
      stick
      about
      it
      to
      this
      day.

      Hi
      guys.
      Not
      here
      for
      any
      kind
      of
      beration,
      here
      for
      advice.
      I'm
      not
      a
      very
      big
      fitness
      bunny,
      but
      I
      am
      trying
      to
      get
      myself
      into
      the
      gym
      a
      little
      more
      (than
      never.)
      I
      live
      in
      Germany,
      and
      have
      a
      two
      year
      contract
      with
      a
      gym
      here.
      But
      for
      me
      a
      big
      problem
      is
      the
      discipline
      and
      routine
      of
      actually
      going
      to
      the
      gym,
      so
      if
      I
      know
      I
      have
      to
      meet
      Johanna
      (for
      example,
      that's
      not
      a
      real
      person)
      at
      7pm
      every
      Wednesday
      to
      work
      out,
      I
      will
      go
      and
      meet
      Johanna
      at
      7pm
      every
      Wednesday.
      I
      asked
      my
      gym
      trainers
      yesterday
      and
      they
      said
      this
      isn't
      something
      they
      offer.
      They
      instead
      make
      you
      a
      training
      schedule
      you
      follow
      by
      yourself,
      and
      after
      six
      weeks
      they
      take
      your
      progress.
      I
      know
      in
      my
      heart
      this
      isn't
      good
      for
      me.
      I
      just
      don't
      have
      enough
      discipline,
      it's
      been
      my
      failing
      so
      many
      times.
      Do
      you
      know
      of
      anything
      I
      can
      do
      to
      improve
      it?
      Is
      trying
      to
      find
      my
      own
      PT
      outside
      of
      the
      gym
      to
      bring
      with
      me
      an
      idea?

      to
      train.
       gt;
      Does
      your
      gym
      offer
      exercise
      classes?
      In
      England
      most
      gyms
      offer
      classes
      included
      in
      membership,
      so
      that's
      another
      way
      of
      having
      an
      appointment
      of
      sorts
      to
      keep.
      This
      could
      also
      help
      you
      find
      a
      workout
      buddy
      if
      you
      don't
      currently
      have
      anyone
      viable.
      Yes,
      there
      are
      also
      classes
      available.
      But
      they're
      in
      German,
      which
      isn't
      my
      native
      language
      and
      I
      struggle
      with
      a
      lot,
      and
      it's
      making
      me
      a
      little
      worried
      about
      going.

      So
      I
      went
      to
      a
      Zumba
      class
      with

      I'm

      He

      last
      night
      and
      started
      CoS
      this
      morning.
      He
      sees
      a
      lot
      of
      himself
      in
      Hermione,
      and
      has
      always
      been
      compared
      to
      Hagrid
      (tall
      and

      Wouldn't
      you
      love
      to
      go
      back
      and
      read

      I
      don't
      know
      where
      to
      start
      with
      this
      lad.
      He
      is
      a
      fairly
      new
      guy,
      started
      in
      mid
      June.
      He
      will
      continuously
      ask
      the
      same
      questions
      (what's
      the
      password
      for
      this?
      Should
      I
      be
      writing
      like
      this?)
      A
      fellow
      team
      member
      is
      getting
      frustrated
      that
      it's
      taking
      him
      this
      long
      to
      learn
      some
      basics.
      Likes
      the
      sound
      of
      his
      own
      voice.
      A
      lot.
      Particularly
      at
      8am
      on
      the
      bus
      to
      work
      when
      this
      Young
      Wan
      is
      barely
      of
      this
      world.
      A
      chronic
      mansplainer.
      We
      work
      in
      an
      international
      department.
      I
      have,
      on
      separate
      occasions,
      seen
      him
      explain
      the
      French
      Revolution
      to
      French
      people,
      and
      tell
      the
      Dutch
      team
      all
      about
      the
      Netherlands.
      He
      knows
      all
      about
      it
      because
      he
      has
      been
      there
      once.
      He
      chews
      with
      his
      mouth
      open.
      It
      drives
      me
      utterly
      bananas
      to
      hear
      it,
      and
      another
      co-worker
      has
      also
      picked
      up
      on
      it.
      This
      morning
      he
      also
      roundabout
      way
      called
      a
      co-worker
      fat.
      This
      co-worker
      has,
      in
      recent
      times,
      lost
      quite
      a
      lot
      of
      weight,
      but
      because
      it
      was
      so
      much
      she
      has
      some
      extra
      skin
      that
      she
      feels
      insecure
      about.
      She
      cried
      in
      the
      bathroom
      for
      about
      20
      minutes.
      There
      are
      some
      of
      us
      who
      feel
      like
      we
      should
      say
      something.
      But
      we
      don't
      know
      who
      to
      (him
      directly/his
      manager/another
      co
      worker)
      or
      how
      to
      go
      about
      it.
      So,
      any
      tips
      would
      really
      be
      great.

      growing
      tired
      of
      how
      my
      boyfriend
      (29M)
      acts

      We've
      been
      together
      over
      six
      months,
      and
      there's
      a
      lot
      that
      frustrates
      me.
      Overall,
      he
      is
      a
      lovely
      guy,
      very
      supportive,
      and
      has
      helped
      me
      with
      a
      lot
      of
      issues.
      But
      there
      are
      niggles.
      He
      doesn't
      have
      very
      good
      standards
      of
      cleaning.
      Often
      the
      dishes
      can
      be
      left
      on
      the
      sideboard
      for
      DAYS
      with
      food
      left
      in
      them.
      He
      does
      the
      dishes
      maybe
      once
      or
      twice
      a
      week
      when
      they
      all
      pile
      up.
      He's
      often
      complained
      how
      come
      people
      with
      much
      bigger
      apartments
      or
      houses
      than
      his
      can
      keep
      on
      top
      of
      it,
      but
      he
      can't.
      Another
      thing
      is
      that
      he
      can
      be
      quite
      lazy
      at
      times.
      Take
      last
      night
      for
      example.
      We
      went
      to
      do
      groceries
      after
      work,
      with
      the
      intention
      to
      cook
      dinner
      and
      eat
      together.
      We
      got
      home
      at
      seven,
      and
      he
      went
      to
      take
      a
      nap
      until
      9.15.
      By
      then,
      it
      was
      too
      late
      to
      eat.
      Today
      we
      both
      have
      the
      day
      off
      work.
      I
      would
      have
      loved
      to
      do
      something
      together.
      Get
      out
      of
      the
      house,
      go
      for
      a
      walk.
      Instead,
      he
      and
      I
      watched
      two
      episodes
      of
      Brooklyn
      9
      9
      and
      he's
      taking
      another
      nap
      while
      I
      read
      on
      the
      couch.
      I
      know
      people
      talk
      about
      the
      honeymoon
      phrase
      ending,
      but
      is
      this
      really
      how
      it's
      supposed
      to
      be?
      Or
      am
      I
      just
      setting
      my
      standards
      too
      high?
      TL;DR
      my
      boyfriend
      can
      be
      a
      bit
      messy
      and
      lazy
      at
      times
      and
      it's
      starting
      to
      frustrate
      me.

      I
      have
      a
      (second
      hand)
      Tassimo
      Fidela.
      I
      cleaned
      it
      when
      I
      first
      got
      the
      machine
      (using
      the
      disc,
      ran
      water
      through
      three
      times)
      but
      I've
      had
      to
      clean
      it
      again
      recently
      to
      even
      be
      allowed
      to
      make
      coffee.
      If
      I
      put
      a
      coffee
      capsule
      in,
      it
      won't
      recognise
      it
      and
      will
      just
      flash
      up
      the
      cleaning
      light.
      Is
      the
      machine
      broken?
      Or
      is
      this
      normal?

      I
      work
      in
      an
      international
      department
      in
      a
      media
      company
      in
      Europe.
      Since
      July
      of
      this
      year
      I've
      had
      a
      promotion
      to
      work
      as
      Social
      Media
      Manager.
      I
      have
      never
      felt
      comfortable
      in
      this
      role,
      as
      it
      is
      not
      my
      background.
      I
      am
      expected
      to
      know
      more
      than
      another
      SMM
      with
      a
      strong
      social
      media
      background,
      and
      a
      degree
      in
      the
      field.
      I
      am
      also
      going
      to
      be
      quite
      heavily
      responsible
      for
      the
      turnaround
      of
      a
      project
      that
      is
      badly
      underperforming
      and
      at
      danger
      of
      being
      terminated.
      This
      will
      result
      in
      job
      losses.
      I
      already
      feel
      my
      contract,
      which
      is
      the
      for
      renewal
      in
      June
      2019,
      won't
      be
      continued,
      despite
      all
      my
      best
      efforts.
      Do
      you
      have
      any
      advice
      on
      who
      I
      can
      talk
      to
      to
      dispell
      those
      fears?
      How
      I
      can
      boost
      my
      own
      morale
      or
      performance?

      I
      had
      a
      really
      good
      friend
      who
      was
      insane
      at
      giving
      presents.
      One
      Christmas
      I
      got
      a
      script
      to
      the
      pilot
      of
      Friends.
      For
      my
      21st
      she
      gave
      me
      a
      bottle
      of
      wine
      with
      a
      personalised
      label.
      The
      Christmas
      before
      we
      fell
      out,
      she
      gave
      me
      hand
      lotion.
      It
      was
      obviously
      one
      she
      had
      been
      sent
      in
      a
      press
      drop.

      Ah
      ok!
      I
      was
      wondering
      because
      I'd
      seen
      other
      Kindle
      users
      talk
      about
      it
      but
      mine
      wasn't
      appearing.

      For
      my
      birthday
      this
      year,
      my
      boyfriend
      gave
      me
      an
      electric
      whisk.
      I
      asked
      his
      mother
      if
      I
      could
      borrow
      hers
      for
      an
      evening,
      and
      somehow
      he
      thought
      "this
      is
      clearly
      something
      she
      will
      use
      more
      often."
       #8203;
      It
      wasn't.
      Still
      in
      its
      box.

      Yes.
      In
      school
      I
      was
      immensely
      unpopular.
      One
      of
      the
      most
      popular
      guys
      asked
      me
      to
      meet
      him
      behind
      the
      sheds.
      I,
      being
      incredibly
      naive,
      believed
      this
      was
      a
      serious
      request.
      After
      school,
      I
      went
      behind
      the
      shed
      to
      find
      everyone
      in
      my
      school
      class
      there
      laughing
      at
      me.

      I
      realised
      when
      we
      were
      out
      for
      brunch
      one
      morning.
      I
      made
      a
      jokey
      comment
      about
      one
      of
      the
      other
      girls
      there.
      "Wait,
      you
      can't
      say
      that.
      Only
      we
      can
      say
      that
      about
      her."
      How
      did
      I
      make
      new
      friends?
      I
      spent
      a
      lot
      more
      time
      with
      a
      colleague,
      with
      whom
      I
      am
      now
      incredibly
      close.

      I
      live
      in
      Germany
      but
      am
      not
      from
      there.
      I
      have
      been
      dating
      someone
      for
      just
      under
      a
      year.
      Last
      week
      I
      was
      made
      redundant
      for
      "operational
      reasons."
      I
      have
      seen
      a
      great
      job
      advertised,
      but
      it
      would
      be
      in
      my
      home
      country.
      My
      partner
      is
      not
      in
      a
      position
      to
      move
      with
      me,
      if
      I
      were
      successful
      in
      my
      application.
      I
      can't
      decide
      whether
      to
      apply
      or
      not
      I
      would
      love
      the
      job.
      But
      leaving
      would
      surely
      mean
      the
      end
      of
      our
      relationship.
      We
      could
      visit,
      but
      that
      would
      be
      mostly
      it.
      Any
      advice
      really
      appreciated.
      TL;DR
      :
      thinking
      to
      apply
      for
      new
      job
      in
      a
      different
      country.
      My
      partner
      can't
      move
      with
      me.

      I
      was
      made
      redundant
      recently
      when
      my
      department
      closed
      down.
      I
      decided

      use
      some
      of
      my
      redundancy
      package
      to
      travel.
      At
      the
      end
      of
      February,
      I
      will
      head
      off
      for
      a
      whole
      week.
      I'll
      spend
      time
      in
      Vienna
      (two
      nights),
      Bratislava
      (two
      nights)
      and
      Budapest
      (three
      nights.)
      If
      anyone
      has
      tips
      for
      these
      cities
      please
      let
      me
      know.
      Also
      some
      solo
      travel
      tips
      would
      be
      great
      (aka

      safely
      with

      Hello
      I'll
      be
      coming
      to
      Wien
      at
      the

      for
      two
      days.
      I
      have
      some
      questions
      about
      the
      city,
      what
      to
      do
      there,
      and
      was
      hoping
      you
      could
      help.
      What
      should
      the
      weather
      be
      like?
      I'd
      like
      to
      try
      a
      Wiener
      Schnitzl,
      but
      I'm
      not

      veal.
      Is

      I

      in
      contention
      for
      two
      jobs
      at
      the

      However,
      one
      is
      a
      little
      further
      ahead
      in
      the
      recruitment
      process
      than
      the
      other:
      Job

      second

      coming
      on
      Tuesday
      Job
      #2:

      forwarded
      a
      task
      to
      complete,
      deadline
      Monday.
      I
      would
      prefer
      #2
      over
      #1,
      it's
      a
      much
      better
      fit
      for
      me
      skillwise
      and
      I
      felt
      much
      better
      coming
      out
      of
      that
      first
      interview
      than
      I
      did
      #1.
      Should
      job
      #1
      offer
      me
      a
      position
      before
      #2
      even
      gets
      to
      a
      second
      interview
      stage,
      how
      do
      I
      deal
      with
      it?
      Should
      I
      mention
      in
      the
      second
      interview
      that
      I'm
      interviewing
      elsewhere?
      How
      long
      can
      I
      "decide
      on
      my

      as
      it
      were.
      Any
      tips
      really
      appreciated.
      (As
      my
      partner
      said,
      of
      all
      the

      I
      am
      based

      Job
      #1
      is
      in

      #2
      in
      Berlin.
      I

      willing

      I
      had
      an
      interview
      across
      the
      country
      last
      Monday
      for
      a
      position
      I
      felt
      I
      matched,
      and
      really
      wanted.
      Thought
      the
      interview
      went
      well.
      At
      times
      it
      swung
      between
      interview
      and
      casual
      conversation,
      there
      was
      an
      office
      tour,
      I
      met
      potential
      colleagues,
      they
      asked
      could
      I
      start
      earlier
      than
      the
      date
      I
      said,
      etc.
      I
      was
      told
      I
      would
      hear
      "by
      the
      end
      of
      the
      week"
      but
      I
      haven't
      heard
      anything
      back.
      I
      worry
      it's
      because
      I
      didn't
      send
      a
      thank
      you
      note,
      or
      they
      found
      someone
      else,
      or
      cannot
      get
      in
      touch
      with
      me
      (I'm
      currently
      on
      holiday,
      something
      they
      know.
      I
      was
      even
      asked
      if
      there
      would
      be
      good
      coverage,
      which
      made
      me
      anticipate
      a
      phone
      call.)
      Should
      I
      take
      some
      kind
      of
      action?
      An
      email,
      perhaps?
      And
      if
      so,
      what
      to
      say?
      (Note:
      they
      also
      said
      they
      would
      cover
      my
      travel
      costs.
      Should
      I
      also
      bring
      that
      up?)

      In
      January
      I
      was
      made
      redundant
      when
      my
      department
      closed
      down.
      A
      couple
      of
      weeks
      later,
      I
      saw
      a
      similar
      company,
      with
      whom
      we
      would
      have
      competed,
      advertise
      a
      similar
      position
      to
      the
      one
      I
      had
      previously
      been
      doing.
      As
      my
      old
      company
      no
      longer
      had
      any
      skin
      in
      the
      game
      in
      the
      market,
      I
      decided
      to
      apply.
      I
      went
      through
      a
      phone
      interview,
      a
      task,
      a
      Googke
      Hangouts
      call,
      and
      an
      in
      person
      interview
      in
      their
      head
      office.
      I
      thought
      everything
      had
      gone
      really
      well.
      I
      wasn't
      being
      cocky,
      but
      I
      knew
      thiswas
      a
      job
      I
      could
      do,
      and
      had
      the
      skills
      and
      experience
      for.
      That
      was
      on
      a
      Monday,
      I
      was
      told
      I
      would
      hear
      back
      "by
      the
      end
      of
      the
      week."
      Well,
      it's
      now
      two
      weeks
      later,
      I
      haven't
      heard
      anything
      back
      from
      them,
      and
      the
      posting
      is
      offline.
      I
      have
      been
      driving
      myself
      insane
      trying
      to
      think
      what
      aI
      could
      have
      done
      or
      said
      wrong
      to
      make
      them
      completely
      ghost
      me.
      At
      this
      point,
      IDGAF
      whether
      I
      got
      it
      or
      not.
      Just
      be
      polite
      and
      tell
      me.
      Because,
      candidates
      talk.
      Has
      this
      ever
      happened
      to
      anyone
      else
      here?

      Attempting
      bean
      enchiladas
      from
      BBC
      Good
      Food
      tonight.
      The
      night
      I'm
      entertaining
      guests
      was
      probably
      not
      a
      good
      night
      to
      try!
      Ingredients
      1
      tsp
      olive
      oil
      2
      onions,
      chopped
      280g
      carrots,
      grated
      2-3
      tsp
      chilli
      powder
      (mild
      or
      hot,
      according
      to
      your
      taste)
      2
      x
      400g
      cans
      chopped
      tomatoes
      2
      x
      400g
      cans
      pulses
      in
      water,
      drained
      (I
      have
      mixed
      beans
      and
      lentils)
      6
      small
      wholemeal
      tortillas
      200g
      low-fat
      natural
      yogurt
      50g
      extra-mature
      cheddar
      cheese
      (or
      veg
      alternative),
      finely
      grated
      Method
      Heat
      the
      oil
      in
      a
      large
      frying
      pan.
      Cook
      the
      onions
      and
      carrots
      for
      5-8
      mins
      until
      soft
       #8211;
      add
      a
      splash
      of
      water
      if
      they
      start
      to
      stick.
      Sprinkle
      in
      the
      chilli
      powder
      and
      cook
      for
      1
      min
      more.
      Pour
      in
      the
      tomatoes
      and
      pulses
      and
      bring
      to
      the
      boil.
      Turn
      down
      the
      heat
      and
      simmer
      for
      5-10
      mins,
      stirring
      occasionally,
      until
      thickened.
      Remove
      from
      the
      heat
      and
      season
      well.
      Heat
      grill
      to
      high.
      Spread
      a
      spoonful
      of
      the
      bean
      chilli
      over
      a
      large
      ovenproof
      dish.
      Lay
      each
      tortilla
      onto
      a
      board,
      fill
      with
      a
      few
      tbsp
      of
      chilli
      mixture,
      fold
      over
      the
      ends
      and
      roll
      up
      to
      seal.
      Place
      them
      into
      the
      ovenproof
      dish.
      Spoon
      the
      remaining
      chilli
      on
      top.
      Mix
      the
      yogurt
      and
      grated
      cheese
      together
      with
      some
      seasoning,
      and
      spoon
      over
      the
      enchiladas.
      Grill
      for
      a
      few
      mins
      until
      the
      top
      is
      golden
      and
      bubbling.

      My
      partner
      and
      I
      both
      have
      sleep-talked.
      His
      best
      one:
      "all
      the
      best,
      and
      much
      success"
      said
      in
      German
      (his
      native
      language.)
      He
      awoke
      to
      me
      losing
      my
      shit
      laughing.
      "Why
      did
      you
      say
      that?"
      "Because
      you
      told
      me
      to."
      "When?"
      "When
      we
      were
      going
      on
      the
      submarine
      expedition
      .
      .
      .
      I
      maybe
      was
      asleep."
      Mine?
      When
      I
      sang
      the
      first
      two
      lines
      of
      happy
      birthday,
      then
      went
      right
      back
      to
      being
      comatose.
      It
      was
      neither
      of
      our
      birthday's.

      THIS
      IS
      HYPOTHETICAL
      I'm
      just
      wondering
      what
      the
      stand
      would
      be.
      I
      don't
      have
      children,
      but
      would
      intend
      to
      vaccinate
      if
      I
      do
      decide
      to
      have
      them.
      I
      have
      a
      genuine,
      not
      taking
      the
      piss
      question.
      You
      have
      a
      child
      who
      is
      immuno-compromised.
      Mary
      has
      a
      son,
      Jack,
      who
      she
      refuses
      to
      vaccinate.
      Jack
      gives
      your
      child
      measles,
      and
      your
      child
      passes.
      Can
      Mary
      be
      held
      legally
      accountable?

      I
      use
      the
      Android
      app.
      Since
      this
      afternoon,
      I
      can't
      access
      the
      sidebar
      on

      I
      also
      don't
      have
      "up
      next"
      options
      underneath
      the
      video
      that's
      currently
      playing.
      Anyone
      else
      missing
      these,
      or
      know
      how
      to

      them

      Friend
      and
      I
      were
      having
      coffee
      one
      day
      and
      talking
      about
      how
      we
      both
      wanted
      to
      go
      to
      Hungary
      for
      their
      dental
      tourism.
      I
      go
      home,
      go
      on
      Facebook
      a
      couple
      hours
      later,
      low
      and
      behold
      there's
      a
      lot
      of
      ads
      for
      dentists
      in
      Hungary.

      Dear
      Hiring
      Manager,
      My
      name
      is
      TheYoungWan
      and
      I
      wish
      to

      for
      the
      vacant
      Content
      Manager #160;position
      at
      ABCD
      Agency.
      I
      know
      my
      background
      and
      expertise
      would
      serve
      the
      agency
      well
      and
      leave
      a
      lasting
      impression
      on
      your
      clients.
      I
      most
      recently
      worked
      as
      Online
      Content
      Editor
      and
      Community
      Manager
      for
      [FORMER
      EMPLOYER]
      Here,
      I
      was
      heavily
      involved
      with
      the
      editorial
      department,
      writing
      several
      pieces
      of
      content
      daily
      for
      FE's
      travel
      magazine.
      During
      this
      time
      I
      have
      greatly
      improved
      my
      research
      and
      writing
      skills,
      as
      well
      as
      my
      time
      management.
      I
      have
      also
      received
      extensive
      training
      in
      SEO
      and
      been
      given
      the
      opportunity
      to
      improve
      my
      skills
      on
      the
      job.
      I
      am
      also
      experienced
      in
      translating
      documents
      from
      German
      to
      English,
      and
      vice
      versa.
      Working
      in
      an
      international
      environment
      has
      been
      a
      highly
      rewarding
      aspect
      of
      my
      time
      at
      Holidayguru,
      and
      is
      something
      that
      attracts
      me
      to
      the
      position
      available
      with
      ABCD
      Agency.
      My
      work
      has
      greatly
      enriched
      my
      creative
      thinking
      in
      both
      written
      and
      visual
      mediums.
      In
      each
      project
      I
      have
      undertaken,
      I
      have
      developed
      my
      creativity
      and
      the
      way
      I
      approach
      problems.
      My
      initiative
      and
      creative
      problem
      solving
      are
      strengths
      I
      am
      eager
      to
      bring
      with
      me
      and
      to
      further
      develop.
      I
      also
      believe
      my
      experience
      in
      running
      my
      own
      blog
      makes
      me
      an
      ideal
      candidate
      for
      this
      role,
      as
      I
      have
      a
      wealth
      of
      experience
      in
      several
      of
      the
      important
      responsibilities
      in
      this
      position.
      I
      have
      worked
      on
      my
      blog
      for
      seven
      years,
      and
      in
      this
      time
      have
      gained
      vast
      experience
      in
      content
      creation,
      social
      media,
      and
      community
      management.
      I
      hope
      to
      further
      these
      skills
      professionally
      in
      a
      role
      as
      Content
      Manager
      at
      ABCD
      Agency.
      I
      hold
      a
      Masters
      in
      Magazine
      Journalism
      from
      XYZ
      University,
      and
      I
      have
      been
      awarded
      a
      BA
      Honours
      degree
      in
      Journalism
      from
      ABC
      University.
      In
      both
      of
      my
      degrees,
      and
      throughout
      my
      career,
      I
      have
      received
      extensive
      training
      in
      Microsoft
      Office
      products
      and
      Wordpress
      CMS.
      I
      approach
      every
      new
      task
      and
      challenge
      with
      passion,
      determination
      to
      succeed,
      a
      willingness
      to
      solve
      all
      problems
      that
      arise,
      and
      a
      positive
      attitude.
      I
      am
      highly
      motivated
      when
      working
      independently,
      and
      I
      also
      strongly
      enjoy
      working
      with
      others.
      I
      was
      thrilled
      to
      read
      about
      this
      opportunity
      and
      am
      eager
      to
      learn
      more
      about
      it. #160;I
      would
      love
      to
      meet
      with
      you
      and
      discuss
      the
      contributions
      I
      can
      make
      to
      the
      agency.
       #160;
      Kind
      regards,
      TYW

      Hi
      guys!
      First
      time
      visitor
      to
      these
      shores.
      I'm
      doing
      squats
      at
      the
      moment
      and
      only
      my
      left
      thigh
      is
      hurting
      -
      my
      right
      is
      fine.
      The
      DOMS
      were
      unbelievable.
      Could
      I
      be
      doing
      something
      wrong?
      Is
      it
      my
      stance?
      Too
      high
      /not
      low
      enough?

      Four
      hours.
      Four
      hours
      for
      a

      meringue.

      a
      face
      on
      her
      that
      would
      turn
      milk.
      Didn't

      plating
      up
      in
      front
      of
      the
      judges
      either.
      Has
      that
      ever
      been
      done
      before?
      Also,
      because
      of
      who
      left,
      I
      owe
      my
      brother
      a
      pint.
      I
      had
      them
      in
      the
      sweepstakes.
      But
      I
      get
      a
      second
      choice,
      and
      am
      now

      Pizza
      Express
      in
      the
      UK
      does
      a
      pesto
      and
      chicken
      pasta
      dish.
      I
      was
      in
      Ireland,
      where
      PE
      trades
      as
      Milanos,
      during
      May.
      I
      went
      for
      lunch
      there
      and
      ordered
      the
      pollo
      pesto.
      It
      was
      always
      my
      go
      to
      in
      PE.
      This
      time,
      I
      could
      tell
      the
      recipe
      has
      changed.
      The
      sauce
      was
      a
      lot
      more
      stodgy,
      definitely
      not
      as
      creamy.
      The
      pasta
      also
      didn't
      seem
      the
      same.
      Definitely
      not
      as
      good
      as
      I
      remembered
      it.

      I
      had
      an
      interview
      in
      May.
      And
      they
      scheduled
      a
      call
      with
      me
      for
      this
      afternoon.
      And
      I'm
      not
      sure,
      but
      I
      feel
      like
      if
      they
      were
      calling
      to
      turn
      me
      down
      they
      wouldn't
      schedule
      it?
      But
      I
      might
      just
      be
      hoping
      too
      hard.
      Today
      is
      my
      birthday
      so
      I'm
      hoping
      I
      won't
      get
      news
      that
      might
      dampen
      the
      day.

      have
      a
      healthy

      with
      alcohol

      My

      alcohol
      was

      house.
      My

      and
      I
      do
      drink,
      but
      we
      know
      our
      limits
      and
      when
      is
      when.
      Dislike:
      I
      had
      a
      very
      strict
      childhood,
      and
      was
      never
      really
      told
      about
      a
      lot
      of
      things
      going
      on
      with
      my
      extended
      family.
      There's
      a
      lot
      I
      know,
      but
      am
      not
      meant
      to
      know.

      I
      am
      Irish
      and
      live
      in
      Germany,
      my
      partner
      and
      his
      family
      are
      German.
      When
      we
      are
      at
      his
      mother's
      house
      (which
      is
      every/every
      second
      weekend),
      everyone
      speaks
      German.
      I've
      been
      told
      my
      my
      partner,
      who
      is
      C2
      certified
      in
      English,
      that
      his
      mother
      doesn't
      like
      to
      speak
      English
      around
      him
      as
      his
      level
      of
      English
      intimidates
      her.
      I've
      also
      been
      told
      she
      can
      speak
      relatively
      good
      English
      (around
      the
      same
      level
      as
      my
      German,
      which
      is
      B1.
      I
      often
      struggle
      to
      understand
      the
      family
      when
      we
      are
      together,
      but
      I
      get
      by.)
      My
      partner's
      mother
      has
      English
      heritage
      (her
      father
      is
      from
      SE
      England)
      and
      we
      will
      go
      to
      see
      her
      family
      for
      a
      week
      soon.
      Here,
      she
      will
      have
      to
      speak
      English
      to
      them,
      as
      none
      of
      them
      have
      ay
      German.
      WIBTA

      English
      in
      our

      Yeah,
      that's
      something
      that
      confuses
      me
      too.
      That
      she

      that
      close
      back

      a
      lot/doesn't
      feel
      confident
      to
      speak
      it.
      EG:
      if

      to

      NAH.
      It's
      her
      wedding,
      and
      she
      has
      every
      right
      to
      want
      to
      celebrate
      it
      in
      her
      hometown
      with
      her
      family
      and
      the
      people
      she
      loves.
      However,
      I
      can
      see
      the
      whole
      10
      days
      thing
      being
      super
      long
      (no
      idea
      where
      you
      got
      this
      three
      days
      wedding
      idea
      from
      though.
      Where
      does
      this
      information
      come
      from?
      First
      hand
      experience,
      or
      through

      grapevine?)
      You're
      one
      of
      the
      bridesmaids,
      and
      with
      that
      comes
      the
      power
      to
      party.
      She
      is
      likely
      going
      to
      fly
      home
      before
      those
      10
      days,
      why
      not

      a

      your
      other

      before
      she

      She

      also
      have
      a
      hen
      at
      home
      for

      Not
      married
      but
      still
      applicable.
      I'm
      Irish.
      My
      partner
      is
      German.
      He
      speaks
      pretty
      much
      fluent
      English
      however
      so
      we
      have
      gotten
      on
      fine
      in
      that
      sense.
      I
      am
      still
      learning
      German
      of
      course
      but
      doing
      much
      better
      with
      it
      than
      when
      I
      arrived
      in
      Germany
      two
      years
      ago.
      I
      think
      I
      have
      about
      B1
      level
      (I
      also
      had
      German
      before
      coming
      here.)
      My
      biggest
      issue
      is
      with
      his
      family.
      Despite
      having
      English
      heritage,
      they
      speak
      very
      little
      of
      the
      language,
      so
      there's
      a
      language
      barrier
      there.
      Between
      my
      partner
      and
      I,
      we
      have
      a
      relatively
      simple
      rule.
      German
      question,
      German
      answer.
      English
      question,
      English
      answer.

      do

      We

      love

      We
      love
      to
      cook,

      that
      made
      you
      admire

      I
      love
      how
      much
      he's
      helped
      me
      out
      in
      the
      last
      few
      months
      when
      my
      professional
      life
      pretty
      much
      fell
      apart.
      He's
      done
      a
      lot
      of
      translating
      from
      German
      into
      English
      for
      me.
      Also.
      He's
      trying
      to
      learn

      for
      me

      truly

      We
      actually
      dated
      before
      the
      bedroom
      came
      into
      play.
      He
      asked
      me
      to
      be
      his
      girlfriend
      after
      about
      a
      month
      of
      us
      dating.

      For
      people
      who
      don #8217;t
      have
      Tinder,
      but
      wish
      to
      have
      FWB,
      what
      advice
      can
      you
      share
      when
      approaching
      this
      conversation
      topic
      without
      looking
      like
      a
      creep
      especially
      for
      guys
      who
      initiated
      this
      topic?
      I
      guess
      the
      only
      thing
      I
      can
      advise
      is
      to
      keep
      it
      strictly
      sexual
      with
      no
      emotional
      attachment.
      I
      did
      something
      like
      that
      in
      my
      Masters
      year
      before
      I
      met
      my
      BF
      and
      it
      was
      the
      easiest
      FWB
      situation
      I
      had,
      mainly
      because
      outside
      of
      the
      bedroom
      we
      had
      little,
      if
      not
      no,
      contact.

      It's
      not
      a
      thing
      in
      Ireland.
      At
      least,
      it's
      not
      punishable,
      but
      common
      sense
      is
      advised.
      I
      live
      in
      Germany,
      where
      it's
      regulated.
      If
      you're
      caught
      disrespecting
      the
      red
      man
      it's
      a
       #8364;15
      fine.
      My
      German
      boyfriend
      tried
      to
      "assimilate"
      when
      on
      a
      trip
      to
      the
      UK
      and
      tried
      to
      jay
      walk.
      Because
      he
      and
      his
      friend
      aren't
      particularly
      used
      to
      it,
      they
      almost
      had
      an
      accident.

      My
      boyfriend
      is
      very
      close
      with
      a
      friend
      of
      ours
      who
      used
      to
      live
      here.
      She
      is
      the
      one
      whose
      house
      he
      stayed
      in
      when
      he
      stayed
      out
      all
      night.
      They
      message
      almost
      every
      day.
      It
      makes
      me
      worried
      and
      uncomfortable
      that
      he
      and
      her
      are
      going
      to
      get
      together.
      She
      doesn't
      live
      near
      us
      anymore,
      but
      has
      moved
      back
      to
      the
      Netherlands
      (we
      live
      in
      Germany.)
      I
      found
      out
      today
      that
      they
      wait
      until
      I'm
      not
      around
      to
      talk
      to
      each
      other.
      "Hey
      there,
      GF
      is
      staying
      at
      home
      tonight
      so
      we
      have
      time
      to
      talk."
      My
      gut
      is
      ringing
      alarms.
      Should
      it
      be?

      dialect
      where
      Scots
      Gaelic
      is
      hardest
      to
      understand.
      For
      an
      Ulster
      Irish
      speaker
      it
      would
      be
      much
      easier.

      Yes,
      it's

      for

      Everyone
      on

      of

      can
      be

      are
      automatically
      excused
      for
      the
      next
      seven
      (I
      think)
      years.
      My

      I
      were
      actually
      called

      within
      two

      of
      each

      this

      excused.

      We
      lost
      two
      cats
      in
      2016
      within
      six
      months
      of
      each
      other
      -
      our
      matriarch,
      Alfie,
      and
      one
      of
      her
      first
      litter,
      Lucky.
      Alfie
      disappeared
      for
      about
      three
      and
      a
      half
      weeks,
      two
      months
      before
      she
      actually
      died.
      We
      had
      pretty
      much
      consigned
      ourselves
      to
      her
      having
      made
      an
      Irish
      goodbye
      when
      she
      appeared
      in
      the
      gate
      one
      Friday
      afternoon.
      She
      did
      the
      same
      about
      eight
      years
      previous,
      roughly
      six
      months
      after
      we
      got
      her.
      Just
      to
      bookmark
      it.
      She
      had
      heart
      failure,
      and
      was
      scheduled
      to
      be
      put
      to
      sleep
      on
      Christmas
      Eve.
      My
      mother
      went
      to
      the
      vet
      with
      her,
      and
      took
      a
      surprisingly
      long
      time
      to
      come
      back.
      The
      car
      turned
      in
      the
      driveway
      and
      I
      came
      to
      the
      door
      to
      start
      my
      goodbyes.
      I
      noticed
      Alfie
      was
      in
      her
      carrier,
      which
      I
      found
      odd
      as
      when
      Lucky
      came
      home
      in
      that
      June
      she
      was
      on
      her
      pillow.
      Then
      I
      noticed
      her
      head
      move.
      In
      the
      vet
      surgery,
      Alfie
      had
      a
      sudden
      miraculous
      moment
      and
      was
      given
      a
      steroid
      to
      see
      her
      through
      Christmas.
      She
      passed
      in
      her
      sleep
      in
      the
      early
      hours
      of
      29
      December,
      completely
      ignoring
      she
      had
      a
      final
      journey
      to
      the
      vet
      scheduled
      for
      8am
      that
      day.
      As
      for
      Lucky,
      she
      was
      the
      biggest
      fluffball.
      She
      wasn't
      a
      Maine
      Coon,
      but
      there
      must
      have
      been
      something
      of
      it
      in
      her.
      Lucky
      was
      friend
      to
      all,
      and
      all
      were
      a
      friend
      to
      Lucky.
      If
      my
      brother
      and
      I
      had
      a
      friend
      over,
      we
      lost
      Lucky
      to
      them
      until
      the
      friend
      left
      again.
      I
      was
      especially
      Lucky's
      pet
      though.
      Every
      Saturday
      morning
      I
      would
      hear
      tiny
      peets
      on
      the
      stairs
      leading
      up
      to
      my
      room,
      and
      then
      the
      door
      would
      push
      open
      or
      a
      "mrow?"
      could
      be
      heard
      from
      outside.
      Lucky
      would
      then
      jump
      on
      the
      bed
      and
      curl
      up
      with
      me
      for
      an
      hour
      or
      so.
      It
      was
      the
      best
      start
      to
      the
      day,
      and
      no
      Saturday
      has
      felt
      right
      since
      we
      said
      goodbye.

      My

      and

      have
      a
      pretty
      fail

      requires
      a
      chicken
      fillet
      and
      a
      frying
      pan.
      Cook

      one
      side
      on
      high
      heat
      for

      Flip,
      cook
      this
      side
      for
      three
      minutes.
      Cover.
      Reduce
      to
      low
      heat.
      Cook
      for
      15
      minutes.
      Turn
      heat
      off
      completely.
      Do

      remove
      cover.
      Cook
      for

      10-12

      I
      just
      finished
      doing
      this
      last
      night.
      My

      is
      not
      to
      get
      bogged
      down
      by
      what
      you
      don't
      know.
      Often
      you
      can
      make
      it
      out
      from
      context.
      Keep
      a
      list
      of
      every
      word
      you
      don't
      know.
      Write
      down
      the
      page
      you
      found
      it
      too
      because
      you
      *will*
      forget
      where.
      At
      the
      end
      of
      the
      chapter,
      look
      up
      these
      new
      words.

      I
      have
      a
      strange
      egg
      in
      the
      race.
      I'm
      from
      Ireland
      but
      currently
      live
      in
      Germany.
      I
      like
      it
      here,
      it's
      very
      organised
      (much
      more
      so
      than
      at
      home),
      standard
      of
      living
      is
      relatively
      higher
      and
      the
      cost
      of
      living
      is
      much
      lower
      (I
      would
      never
      be
      able
      to
      afford
      to
      live
      on
      my
      own
      in
      Ireland,
      something
      I
      can
      comfortably
      do
      here.)
      However,
      there
      are
      still
      teething
      problems
      two
      years
      in.
      I'm
      still
      not
      totally
      fluent
      in
      German
      so
      can
      make
      errors
      even
      with
      official
      and
      govt.
      documents.
      A
      lot
      of
      my
      friends
      have
      left
      recently
      so
      it's
      getting
      lonely.
      For
      me?
      Right
      now,
      it
      would
      be
      the
      flip
      of
      a
      coin.
      **NB:
      my
      partner
      is
      German.
      I
      asked
      him
      too.
      He
      picked
      Germany.
      "Because
      I
      was
      born
      here."**

      Year
      the

      was

      was

      191
      D
      (for
      Dublin)
      12345
      Up
      to
      2012,
      the
      year
      was
      just
      the
      last
      two
      digits
      (08,
      11,
      etc).
      In
      2013,
      to
      ward
      off
      the
      superstition
      of
      having
      a
      13
      licence
      plate,
      the
      year
      was
      divided
      in
      two.
      From
      then
      on,
      cars
      registered
      in
      the
      first
      half
      of
      the
      year
      were
      one,
      and
      the
      second
      were
      two.
      For
      example,
      my
      parents
      both
      have
      cars
      from
      2016.
      My
      Mam's
      was
      registered
      some
      time
      between
      January
      and
      June,
      so
      is

      My

      school
      seven
      years
      ago.
      Didn't
      do
      it
      in
      university.
      Big
      regret.
      At
      the
      moment
      it's
      immersion
      learning.
      I
      had
      German
      lessons
      in
      my
      old
      job,
      and
      my
      new
      job
      is
      entirely
      done
      through
      German.
      Good
      luck
      with
      your
      course!
      I
      hope
      it
      will
      help

      I

      English
      is
      rather

      and
      I

      I'm

      fucking
      confused
      by

      Why
      is
      photographing
      a
      building
      a
      fireable
      offence?
      Is
      this
      building
      not
      in
      a
      PUBLIC
      area?
      What
      do
      they
      do
      if
      other
      people
      take
      pictures
      of
      it?
      And,
      finally,
      unless
      it's
      your
      genitalia
      with
      the
      company
      logo,
      why
      the
      fuck
      do
      they
      care
      what
      picture
      you're
      posting?

      The
      Mayo
      Curse.
      Mayo's
      football
      haven't
      won
      an
      All
      Ireland
      since
      the
      1950s.
      The
      last
      time
      they
      did,
      the
      team
      drove
      through
      Foxford
      beeping
      their
      horns
      and
      celebrating.
      However,
      there
      was
      a
      funeral
      in
      the
      town
      that
      day.
      The
      priest
      at
      the
      funeral
      cursed
      the
      team.
      It's
      said
      that
      until
      every
      man
      who
      was
      on
      that
      team
      is
      dead,
      Mayo
      won't
      win
      an
      All
      Ireland.
      There
      are
      two
      men
      still
      alive
      as
      of

      This
      is
      something
      my
      friend
      has
      noticed,
      I
      haven't
      picked
      up
      on
      it.
      She
      said
      to
      me:
      "Watch
      the
      way
      he
      looks
      at
      him,
      honestly
      he
      really
      doesn #8217;t
      like
      him.
      And
      Michael
      either
      doesn #8217;t
      know
      or
      is
      trying
      to
      remedy
      it
      by
      talking
      to
      him
      loads,
      despite
      getting
      nothing
      back.
      Also
      when
      Michael #8217;s
      signature
      fucked
      up
      a
      couple
      of

      Henry

      not
      to
      laugh."
      Have
      you
      also
      noticed
      anything?

      There
      is
      no
      other
      way
      to
      describe
      this
      woman.
      Just
      a
      snippet
      of
      the
      Kevinisms:
       gt;
      She
      has
      been
      written
      sick
      since
      Sept
      16th.
      In
      this
      time
      she
      has:
      driven
      **herself**
      to
      the
      hospital
      with
      a
      40 #176;
      temperature.
      Let
      us
      remember
      that
      basal
      body
      temp
      is
      37 #176;,
      39 #176;
      is
      classed
      as
      a
      fever,
      and
      at
      41
      or
      42
      your
      organs
      shut
      down.
      She
      blacked
      out
      on
      the
      Autobahn-
      you
      know,
      that
      place
      where
      *CARS
      DRIVE
      AT
      WHATEVER
      SPEED
      THEY
      SEE
      FIT*
      and
      crashed.
       gt;
      Last
      night,
      she
      choked,
      couldn't
      breathe,
      and
      turned
      blue.
      Her
      mother
      had
      to
      come
      into
      her
      room
      to
      try
      and
      save
      her.
      She
      only
      decided
      to
      seek
      medical
      attention
      this
      morning.
       gt;
      I
      live
      in
      Germany,
      but
      am
      a
      native
      English
      speaker.
      On
      our
      first
      day,
      we
      were
      talking
      about
      languages.
      I
      asked
      if
      she
      could
      speak
      anything
      other
      than
      German,
      she
      said
      no.
      Odd,
      as
      lots
      of
      Germans
      our
      age
      (she's
      two
      years
      younger
      than
      me,
      I'm
      late
      20s)
      have
      at
      least
      school
      level
      English,
      but
      whatever.
      She
      then
      had
      a
      phone
      conversation
      with
      her
      mother
      in
      perfect
      Arabic.
      She
      couldn't
      discern
      that
      German
      and
      Arabic
      are
      different
      languages.
      This
      woman
      is
      harmless,
      but
      one
      day
      is
      going
      to
      unintentionally
      cause
      her
      own
      death.

      Honestly,
      the
      way
      she's
      going
      it's
      only
      a
      matter
      of
      time
      before
      she
      does
      it
      herself
      while
      trying
      to
      butter
      bread.
