      So
      odds
      just
      went
      crazy
      on
      this
      chinese
      Hots
      game.
      [https://i.imgur.com/ysd1oi0.png](https://i.imgur.com/ysd1oi0.png)
      Map
      2
      is
      normal
      odds
      and
      map
      1
      is
      what
      changed.
      And
      not
      5
      minutes
      later
      turns
      out
      CE
      went
      with
      troll
      draft
      and
      got
      smacked.
      CE
      has
      nothing
      to
      play
      for
      and
      RPG
      wants
      to
      win,
      so
      I
      guess
      it
      will
      be
      clean
      2-0
      for
      RPG

      lost,
      was

      I
      actually
      think
      this
      is
      a
      perfect
      meta
      to
      bet
      live.
      If
      a
      team
      is
      ahead
      with
      even
      comps,
      they
      are
      most
      likely
      to
      win.
      Main
      concern
      is
      a
      team
      with
      adc
      vs
      no
      adc,
      or
      pick
      comp
      vs
      teamfight
      comp.
      Sometimes
      team
      throws
      free
      game
      like
      SKT
      just
      did
      at
      baron,
      but
      they
      are
      just
      dumb.
      I
      had
      a
      lot
      of
      success
      betting
      live,
      especially
      when
      team
      wins
      teamfight
      and
      you
      know
      they
      will
      take
      baron
      in
      a
      minute
      and
      then
      just
      push
      to
      win.

      If
      a
      team
      leads
      like
      3k
      gold
      early
      or
      take
      3
      turrets
      to
      0
      with
      even
      looking
      comps
      it's
      usually
      their
      game
      -
      if
      they
      are
      any
      good
      at

      Yes
      SKT
      really
      blew
      this
      but
      9/10
      times
      it
      would
      be
      won.
      Books
      know
      that
      baron
      =
      win
      most
      of
      the
      time
      so
      they
      close
      it.

      sometimes
      they
      don't
      know

      the

      It

      even
      play,
      their

      were
      just
      atrocious.
      They
      let
      Cho
      become
      unkillable
      game
      1,

      then
      did

      game
      3.

      you

      hated

      other
      pros
      did
      throughout
      esports
      history,
      it's
      laughable.
      In
      Lol,
      there
      was
      a
      guy
      so
      toxic
      he
      got
      banned
      for
      life.
      And
      yet
      he
      got
      hired
      by
      C9
      before
      his
      competitive
      ban
      was
      even
      lifted.

      sadly
      it
      happens
      A
      LOT
      in
      cs,
      teams
      playing
      around
      with
      weaker
      opponents.
      I
      should
      know
      better
      than
      to
      put
      my
      trust
      in
      Ence.
      Still
      2-1
      for
      them
      if
      they
      care
      about
      this
      match
      even
      a

      The

      (-1.5)
      vs
      Beyond
      the
      Game
      (2.2
      odds)
      Every
      time
      there
      is
      a
      tournament
      abroad,
      Chinese
      teams
      are
      crippled
      by
      Visa
      problems.
      This
      time
      it
      was
      CE
      and
      BTG
      who
      had
      to
      bring
      in
      substitutes.
      CE
      already
      got
      eliminated
      without
      getting
      a
      single
      map
      and
      I
      expect
      the
      same
      from
      BTG.
      Actually
      surprised
      at
      how
      high
      the
      odds
      are.

      I'm
      not
      Starcraft
      player
      but
      Zest
      misplayed
      sadly.
      Two
      times
      he
      went
      aggressive
      and
      didn't
      back
      in
      time
      to
      defend.
      There
      was
      no
      cheese
      as
      far
      as
      I
      saw.
      Actually
      odds
      on
      Pinnacle
      went
      to
      1.38
      on
      -2.5
      so
      i
      got
      baited.
      Shows
      there
      is
      no
      safe
      bets.

      vs

      Ravioli

      [lose]
      Ravioli
      seems
      like
      a
      pretty
      weak
      team.
      They
      usually
      play
      without
      adc
      so
      the
      meta
      is
      not
      great
      for
      them.
      This
      is
      a
      super
      small
      scene
      so
      anything
      can
      happen
      but
      the
      difference
      in
      skill
      seems
      too
      big
      for
      the
      odds
      (Adive
      won
      map
      1
      in
      like
      20
      mins
      or
      less).
      Edit:
      Both
      teams
      are
      extremely
      bad.
      But
      I'm
      going
      map
      3
      Adive
      if
      they
      ban
      Yorick
      (1.7
      odds).
      They
      won
      every
      teamfight
      but
      couldn't
      rotate
      properly
      after
      losing
      inhib
      in
      15
      minutes.

      Hi,
      I
      stopped
      playing
      Hots
      around
      Blaze
      release,
      now
      I
      feel
      very
      overwhelmed
      by
      the
      amount
      of
      new
      stuff
      added
      to
      the
      game.
      Can
      You
      tell
      me
      most
      important
      changes
      to
      gameplay,
      what
      new
      heroes
      are
      about
      etc.?
      Thank
      you!

      it's
      a

      parody,
      there

      as

      yes
      it's
      edgy
      but
      I
      still
      find
      it
      more

      very
      similar

      talking
      about
      how
      Blizz
      is
      just
      promises
      and
      no

      swastika

      were
      used

      are

      like
      a

      believer.
      What
      he
      says

      "commercial

      is
      not

      the
      heavy
      propaganda
      machine
      operated
      by
      national
      TV
      and
      the
      government.
      I'm
      also
      fairly
      conservative,
      but
      IMO
      the
      threat
      to
      democracy
      from
      PiS
      is
      quite

      currently

      serious
      conflict
      with
      the
      Supreme
      Court
      and
      the
      recent
      scandal
      is
      not
      just
      a
      simple
      case
      of
      paid
      trolling,
      it's
      a
      very
      deliberate
      smearing
      campaign.

      Reddit
      was
      a
      bit
      more
      sceptical
      about
      politician
      promises.
      Polish
      economy
      is
      growing
      every
      year,
      so
      how
      come
      they
      are
      just
      now
      all
      of
      the
      sudden
      managing
      to
      make
      this
      "miracle"?
      Because
      they
      are
      using
      some
      one-off
      tricks
      like
      selling
      Co2
      emission
      rights
      and
      5g
      mobile
      frequencies
      to
      make
      this
      one
      (election)
      year
      look
      good,
      and
      the
      budget
      will
      go
      back
      to
      shit
      following
      years.

      Nobody
      expects
      them
      to
      fix
      anything
      while
      being
      in
      opposition,
      that
      would
      be
      ridiculous.
      But
      they
      can't
      even
      come
      to
      terms
      about
      who
      is
      starting
      from
      which
      party.
      Both
      main
      parties,
      KO
      and
      Lewica
      had
      huge
      dramas
      regarding
      this.
      So
      we
      can
      say
      they
      are
      pretty
      inept.
      Second
      of
      all,
      why
      are
      you
      assuming
      they
      themselves
      are
      not
      populists?
      Again,
      both
      main
      parties
      (or
      at
      least
      their
      cores,
      SLD
      and
      PO)
      already
      ruled
      in
      this
      century,
      so
      people
      have
      some
      picture
      of
      what
      they
      are
      like.
      This
      is
      what
      attracted
      some
      people
      to
      PiS,
      they
      felt
      previous
      governments
      were
      all
      talk
      and
      no
      action.
      Don't
      assume
      every
      country
      is
      the
      same.

      Little
      backstory:
      there
      is
      a
      huge
      scandal
      going
      on
      with
      current
      president
      of
      Supreme
      Audit
      Office
      being
      implicated
      (according
      to
      journalists)
      in
      criminal
      activity.
      He
      claims
      it's
      a
      conspiracy,
      goes
      on
      unpaid
      leave
      (which
      he
      grants
      to
      himself)
      and
      decides
      to
      fire
      all
      3
      of
      his
      deputies
      to
      install
      this
      woman
      as
      one.
      Now
      she'll
      be
      leading
      the
      office
      while
      he's
      under
      investigation.

      No

      You
      have
      it
      wrong,
      they
      don't
      need
      to
      conform
      to
      reality,
      they
      create
      it.
      All
      I
      hear
      in
      church
      lately
      is
      LGBT
      is
      coming
      to
      kill
      us
      and
      boom,
      turns
      out
      huge
      percent
      of
      Poles
      believe
      it.
      They
      know
      very
      well
      what
      they're
      doing.
