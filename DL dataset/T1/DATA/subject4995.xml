      I've
      been
      a
      heavy
      (6-10
      bowls/day,
      thc
      pen,
      edibles,
      the
      works)
      marijuana
      user
      for
      about
      3
      years
      now,
      and
      I
      love
      the
      shit
      and
      it
      really
      helped
      me
      in
      college
      but
      I'm
      sick
      of
      it?
      It
      does
      absolutely
      nothing
      for
      me
      other
      than
      that
      want
      to
      take
      a
      hit.
      I
      used
      to
      be
      able
      to
      "astral
      project"
      from
      holding
      it
      in
      and
      it
      was
      incredible,
      but
      I
      haven't
      for
      about
      a
      year
      now.
      I
      just
      really
      feel
      like
      weed
      IS
      a
      gateway
      drug
      whether
      most
      stoners
      want
      to
      admit
      it
      or
      not.
      I
      started
      on
      weed,
      loved
      it
      and
      still
      do
      but
      I
      really
      have
      that
      urge
      to
      do
      more,
      chase
      the
      dragon.
      DPH
      I
      recently
      did
      dph
      for
      the
      first
      and
      second
      time,
      never
      again.
      Straight
      up
      28
      Benadryl
      25
      mg.
      It
      was
      absolutely
      insane
      and
      I
      was
      GONE.
      My
      friend
      thought
      I
      was
      dead
      for
      about
      2
      hours.
      I
      saw
      some
      female
      entity,
      which
      I
      never
      experienced
      before,
      basically
      tell
      me
      I'm
      welcome
      anytime.
      I
      only
      saw
      1
      shadow
      person
      and
      strangely,
      no
      "spiders"
      or
      "ants."
      My
      vision
      seemed
      to
      start
      to
      "glitch"
      though,
      like
      when
      a
      video
      game
      screen
      glitches
      and
      it
      was
      very
      disorienting.
      I
      didn't
      do
      the
      research
      like
      I
      should,
      and
      I
      really
      regret
      it.
      I
      cooked
      mac
      and
      cheese
      about
      30
      minutes
      in,
      and
      it
      started
      fine.
      That's
      when
      I
      met
      her
      and
      really
      started
      feeling
      it.
      My
      chest
      started
      to
      get
      tight
      and
      my
      heartrate
      skyrocketed.
      I
      took
      the
      mac
      and
      cheese
      off
      the
      burner,
      and
      I'm
      not
      sure
      for
      how
      long
      but
      I
      left
      the
      burner
      running
      and
      it
      scared
      the
      fuck
      out
      of
      me.
      I
      then
      went
      into
      my
      room,
      layed
      in
      bed
      completely
      disoriented
      and
      had
      trouble
      breathing
      for
      an
      hour
      and
      a
      half
      until
      I
      passed
      out.
      I
      could
      not
      move
      my
      body,
      I
      was
      stuck
      laying
      on
      my
      stomach
      until
      the
      sweet
      release
      of
      sleep
      took
      me
      away.
      Woke
      up
      feeling
      like
      shit.
      Overall
      I
      don't
      recommend
      it.
      I
      read
      it
      can
      give
      you
      early
      onset
      dementia
      so
      yeah,
      no.
      I
      think
      in
      low
      doses
      it
      could
      be
      relaxing
      but
      you'll
      just
      pass
      out.
      MDMA
      My
      friend
      messaged
      me
      and
      I
      asked
      about
      X
      literally
      4
      hours
      after
      waking
      up
      from
      dph,
      about
      16
      hours
      later.
      Never
      done
      it
      before,
      by
      the
      way.
      But
      I've
      heard
      it
      helps
      with
      mental
      health,
      so
      I've
      been
      chasing
      it
      with
      no
      luck
      until
      now.
      Took
      2
      at
      9
      pm
      Tuesday,
      and
      I
      stayed
      up
      until
      10:30
      am
      Thursday.
      Was
      a
      much
      more
      enjoyable
      experience
      than
      the
      dph
      for
      sure,
      but
      I
      read
      the
      same
      enzymes
      that
      break
      down
      dph
      break
      down
      X.
      I
      felt
      the
      speed
      high
      until
      2
      pm
      Wednesday,
      and
      didn't
      trip
      until
      then.
      I
      then
      had
      visuals
      come
      and
      go
      until
      I
      fell
      asleep
      this
      morning
      finally.
      Still
      feel
      pretty
      fucked.
      Sleeping
      16
      hours,
      staying
      up
      for
      like
      38
      then
      sleeping
      for
      4
      1/2
      has
      been
      absolutely
      brutal
      and
      I
      wish
      I
      thought
      it
      through
      more,
      but
      I
      feel
      much
      better
      depression
      and
      bullshit
      wise
      so
      I
      don't
      regret
      it.
      I
      stayed
      up
      reading
      experiences
      of
      basically
      every
      drug
      that
      reddit
      has
      a
      subreddit
      for.
      It
      was
      fun.
      Then
      I
      got
      into
      conspiracy
      theories
      and
      /collapse.
      Idk,
      I
      just
      have
      a
      want
      to
      peer
      into
      the
      void
      and
      my
      mind.
      Reality
      is
      a
      bitch
      and
      I
      like
      to
      escape.

      This
      was
      my
      first
      time
      and
      I'm
      giving
      it
      the
      3
      month
      break,
      but
      I
      haven't
      had
      any
      neurotransmitters
      at
      a
      "good"
      level
      for
      pretty
      much
      my
      whole
      life.
      I'm
      on
      Effexor
      XR
      and
      it's
      bullshit.
      Ssris/snris
      are
      also
      bullshit.
      But
      I
      100%
      agree,
      don't
      abuse

      I

      to
      my

      about
      once

      there,

      recently
      I
      have.

      when

      I

      Only
      thing
      I
      really
      abuse
      is
      weed
      and

      I
      do
      to
      just
      go
      through
      the
      motions.
      I
      think
      it
      could
      be
      incredibly
      beneficial
      for
      physical
      illnesses
      but
      idk,
      mental
      health
      is
      so
      hard
      to
      fix
      or
      even
      get
      better
      at
      all
      and
      weed
      doesn't
      help
      anymore.
      When
      I
      first
      started
      it
      was
      nice
      and
      a
      good
      distraction,
      but
      now
      it
      only
      makes
      me
      cough.
      I
      don't
      smoke
      cigs
      so
      I
      think
      I
      use
      in
      place
      of
      it,
      as
      all
      my
      friends
      use
      nicotine/cigs
      Idk
      life
      just
      fucking
      sucks
      and
      I
      want
      another
      drug
      to
      take
      me
      away

      Air
      duster
      is
      something
      I
      think
      you
      have
      to
      experience
      to
      stay
      away
      from.
      I
      was
      stupid
      and
      tried
      it,
      really
      fuckin
      loved
      it
      and
      went
      through
      about
      a
      whole
      can.
      I
      ended
      up
      falling
      onto
      the
      floor
      trying
      to
      sit
      on
      my
      bed
      fucked
      up
      on
      it
      and
      I
      will
      never
      touch
      the
      shit
      again.
      Felt
      horrible
      the
      next
      day.
      I

      I

      "oh
      don't
      do
      it

      doesn't
      stop
      ANYONE
      needing
      to
      get
      high.
      You

      about
      the
      consequences
      until
      it's

      I
      agree

      though.
      Fuck
      your

      life
      up
      on
      meth
      for

      I

      don't
      drive
      on
      it
      and
      kill
      someone
      else.
      It
      isn't
      their
      fault
      you
      need
      to
      abuse
      substance

      left
      me
      because
      of

      have
      that
      heavy
      "doom

      It's
      so
      neat
      this
      type
      of
      phobia,
      I've
      looked
      at
      a
      lot
      of
      accounts
      of
      orthopteraphobic
      people
      and
      we're
      all
      the
      same.
      I
      completely
      accept
      a
      grasshopper
      can't
      do
      a
      thing
      to
      me.
      I'd
      rather
      get
      stung
      by
      a
      wasp
      than
      even
      LOOK
      at
      a
      grasshopper
      I
      haven't
      seen
      too
      many
      so
      far
      this
      year,
      but
      I
      only
      really
      go
      outside
      at
      night/for
      work.
      I'm
      a
      night
      owl
      as
      it
      is
      but
      I've
      seen
      them
      at
      night
      before
      which
      makes
      it
      so
      much
      worse.
      The
      thought
      they
      can
      be
      anywhere,
      at
      any
      time,
      waiting
      to
      jump
      and
      freak
      me
      out
      runs
      most
      of
      my
      life
      in
      the
      summer.

      Been
      on
      it
      for
      a
      year
      and
      a
      half
      and
      I'm
      going
      through
      exactly
      this.
      I'm
      21
      and
      have
      been
      on
      different
      depression
      bullshit
      meds
      since
      13.
      I
      want
      to
      know
      what's
      it's
      like
      without
      the
      constant
      migraines
      and
      vivid
      PTSD-esque
      dreams.
      It's
      gonna
      be
      hell
      the
      next
      few
      weeks
      but
      I'm
      gonna
      use
      MDMA,
      weed,
      and
      salvia
      to
      cope
      with
      the
      serotonin
      and
      norepenephrine
      loss

      Cutting
      feels
      great.
      That
      release
      of
      endorphins
      when
      you
      start
      to
      feel
      the
      stinging...
      watching
      the
      blood
      drip.
      I
      usually
      only
      cut
      as
      a
      coping
      mechanism,
      but
      I
      have
      cut
      just
      to
      cut
      many
      times.
      It's
      like
      huffing
      air
      duster,
      small
      reward
      for
      a
      big
      risk.
      But
      it's
      a
      risk
      I'm
      willing
      (and
      often)
      take
