      The
      manga
      shows
      him
      using
      his
      arms
      to
      pull
      the
      strips,
      the
      times
      its
      somehow
      floating
      is
      probably
      the
      wind
      or
      just
      for
      a
      cool
      effect.

      speech
      bubble
      Aizawa
      pulling
      in
      the
      strips
      to
      bring
      deku
      closer
      I
      definitely
      remember
      later
      arcs
      him
      using
      his
      hands
      to
      pull
      around
      enemies
      witht

      Yes
      but
      you
      cant
      expect
      that
      to
      happen
      overnight
      for
      a
      guy
      whos
      been
      belittled
      and
      bullied
      his
      entire
      life,
      or
      atleast
      since
      he
      was
      4.
      Not
      sure
      if
      we'll
      get
      into
      it
      in
      the
      13episodes
      we
      have
      but
      theres
      a
      reason
      why
      many
      manga
      readers
      now
      refer
      to
      him
      as
      Absolute
      Madman

      Manga
      had
      10chapters
      translated
      Saw
      some
      screencaps
      appear
      on
      my
      tl
      and
      looked
      really
      cool
      so
      checked
      it
      out

      Nope
      its
      perfect,
      any
      faster
      and
      theyll
      filler
      out
      the
      end
      and
      any
      slower
      they'll
      have
      to
      speed
      through
      things.
      We
      only
      go
      13
      episodes
      and
      doing
      this
      2chap
      per
      episode
      lands
      us
      right
      at
      the
      end
      of
      the
      USJ
      arc
      which
      is
      perfect.
      I
      do
      find
      it
      amusing
      manga
      readers
      were
      calling
      the
      pace
      too
      fast
      but
      now
      that
      its
      animated
      people
      are
      calling
      it
      too
      slow.
      I
      think
      its
      mostly
      do
      to
      us
      knowing
      it
      only
      has
      13episodes
      but
      undoubtedly
      will
      get
      another
      season
      so
      no
      need
      tl
      worry

      Other

      how
      excited
      he
      was
      when
      he
      first
      started
      working
      with
      the
      Panthera
      players.
      "They
      would
      learn
      new
      tactics
      so
      quickly.
      They
      would
      extrapolate
      two
      or
      three
      completely
      new
      insights
      from
      every
      new
      idea
      I'd
      share,"
      he
      said.
      "During
      my
      first
      three
      weeks,
      I
      slept
      at
      6
      a.m.
      every
      day
      because
      there
      was
      so
      much
      I
      wanted
      to
      do.
      Scrims
      ended
      at
      midnight.
      Then
      I'd
      do
      individual
      sessions
      until
      4
      a.m.,
      one
      by
      one,
      for
      all
      12
      players.
      Then
      I'd
      analyze
      scrim
      film
      by
      myself
      until
      the
      sun
      came
      up."
      "I
      know
      the
      first
      season
      will
      be
      played
      in
      LA,
      but
      I'm
      really
      looking
      forward
      to
      living
      in
      London
      and
      going
      to
      football
      matches
      whenever
      I
      have
      the
      time
      and
      really
      immersing
      myself
      in
      British
      football
      culture,"
      he
      said.
      "It
      might
      change
      when
      I
      get
      there,
      but
      right
      now,
      I
      like
      rooting
      for
      teams
      with
      Korean
      players,
      so
      I'll
      probably
      try
      to
      get
      Tottenham
      tickets,
      since
      Son
      Heung-min
      is
      playing
      there."

      "I
      want
      to
      thank
      the
      fans
      out
      in
      London.
      I
      know
      we
      haven #8217;t
      met
      yet
      and
      that

      and
      New

      but
      I
      promise
      you
      we
      deeply
      appreciate

      videos

      and
      the
      tweets
      that
      pour
      through
      our
      timeline
      after
      every
      game.
      It
      means
      so
      much
      to
      us,
      and
      I #160;promise #160;you
      the
      team
      will
      be
      making
      a
      trip
      to
      the
      city
      in
      October,
      so
      we
      can
      finally
      meet
      face
      to
      face.
      In
      the
      meantime,
      keep
      hitting
      us
      up
      on
      Twitter.
      We
      appreciate
      the
      love
      more
      than
      you
      know."
