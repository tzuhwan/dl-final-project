      It's
      worth
      noting
      that
      the
      reason
      that
       #8710;v
      (m/s)
      is
      generally
      more
      useful
      than
      the
      quantity
      of
      fuel
      left
      is
      that
      the
      relationship
      between
      the
      remaining
       #8710;v
      and
      the
      remaining
      fuel
      is
      non-linear.
      Because
      of
      the
      rocket
      equation,
      a
      given
      quantity
      of
      fuel
      produces
      larger
       #8710;v's
      as
      the
      fuel
      gets
      used.
      This
      is
      because
      the
      ship
      has
      less
      mass
      once
      the
      fuel
      has
      been
      burnt
      and
      is
      easier
      to
      accelerate.

      We
      have
      to
      look
      at
      the
      probability
      of
      not
      getting
      the
      bounty
      (97%).
      The
      probability
      of
      something
      not
      occurring
      in
      n
      tries
      is
      the
      probability
      of
      it
      not
      occurring
      in
      1
      try
      to
      the
      n^th
      power.
      If
      we
      repeat
      the
      task
      ten
      times,
      then
      the
      probability
      of
      not
      getting
      the
      bounty
      goes
      to
      (97%)^10
      =
      .97^10
      =
      .737
      =
      73.7%
      So
      if
      we
      subtract
      100%-73.7%,
      then
      the
      probability
      of
      getting
      the
      bounty
      at
      least
      once
      in
      10
      tries
      is
      26.3%.

      Internet
      (IP)
      addresses
      are
      allocated
      in
      blocks.
      Any
      address
      is
      a
      32
      bit
      number,
      which
      means
      it
      is
      composed
      of
      32
      binary
      digits.
      When
      a
      block
      is
      allocated
      the
      first
      bits
      (digits)
      are
      assigned
      and
      this
      defines
      the
      block.
      In
      other
      words
      addresses
      within
      the
      block
      all
      share
      the
      same
      leading
      digits.
      In
      this
      case
      the
      bottom
      10
      bits
      were
      left

      leaving
      2^10
      =
      1024
      possible
      addresses.
      This
      is
      the
      same
      as
      stating
      that
      3

      I've
      found
      with
      honors
      classes
      that
      they're
      incredibly
      inconsistent
      with
      difficulty
      and
      subject
      matter.
      The
      professors
      have
      the
      freedom
      to
      take
      the
      general
      idea
      for
      the
      class
      and
      run
      with
      it
      in
      any
      direction
      they
      want.
      I
      took
      HONOR
      3200
      my
      freshman
      year.
      While
      my
      class
      was
      relatively
      easy,
      my
      friends
      taking
      it
      with
      another
      professor
      had
      5-10
      page
      essays
      every
      week.
      Its
      similar
      with
      the
      Intellectual
      Traditions
      classes,
      you
      can
      get
      a
      professor
      where
      its
      a
      lot
      of
      work,
      or
      where
      its
      super
      easy,
      or
      where
      they
      pick
      a
      different
      topic
      and
      lecture
      on
      that.
      TL;DR
      it
      all
      depends
      on
      the
      prof,
      the
      department
      puts
      basically
      zero
      restrictions
      on
      how
      they
      teach
      honors
      classes.

      Exactly.
      Weight
      is
      a
      force,
      and
      it
      comes
      in
      pairs.
      As
      explained
      above
      they
      both
      exert
      the
      same
      force
      on
      each
      other
      (which
      causes
      different
      accelerations)
      and
      the
      name
      of
      these
      forces
      are
      "weight".
      So
      the
      weight
      of
      the
      earth
      on
      planet
      scale
      is
      equal
      in
      magnitude
      and
      opposite
      in
      direction
      to
      the
      weight
      of
      the
      scale
      on
      planet
      earth.

      Notably,
      researchers
      in
      the
      field
      agree
      with
      him:
       gt;
      One
      way
      to
      measure
      P
      vs.
      NP's
      importance
      is
      this.
      If
      NP
      problems
      were
      feasible,
      then
      mathematical
      creativity
      could
      be
      automated.
      The
      ability
      to
      check
      a
      proof
      would
      entail
      the
      ability
      to
      find
      one.
      Every
      Apple
      II,
      every
      Commodore,
      would
      have
      the
      reasoning
      power
      of
      Archimedes
      or
      Gauss.
      So
      by
      just
      programming
      your
      computer
      and
      letting
      it
      run,
      presumably
      you
      could
      immediately
      solve
      not
      only
      P
      vs.
      NP,
      but
      also
      the
      other
      six
      Clay
      problems.
      (Or
      five,
      now
      that
      Poincar #233;
      is

      Junior
      in
      the
      program
      here.
      The
      vast
      majority
      of
      the
      teachers
      are
      excellent,
      and
      the
      homework
      load
      can
      be
      crazy
      for
      some.
      To
      respond
      to
      the
      claims
      that
      you'll
      have
      no
      free-time/social
      life,
      it
      really
      depends
      on
      how
      much
      you're
      already
      used
      to
      programming
      coming
      into
      the
      program.
      Since
      you're
      more
      than
      a
      year
      away
      and
      are
      already
      talking
      about
      CS,
      you
      probably
      have
      some
      experience,
      so
      that'll
      make
      it
      easier.
      IIRC
      from
      class
      polls,
      typically
      assignments
      take
      between
      8
      and
      20
      hours
      a
      week,
      and
      that
      was
      the
      worst
      of
      it.
      Some
      of
      the
      professors
      are
      better
      than
      others,
      but
      most
      are
      quite
      good
      at
      making
      sure
      that
      their
      students
      are
      engaged
      and
      getting
      something
      from
      the
      lecturing.
      There
      are
      semesterly
      job
      fairs
      that
      apply
      to
      all
      majors,
      but
      they
      consistently
      have
      a
      pretty
      good
      showing
      from
      CS
      companies.
      Can't
      speak
      too
      much
      for
      job
      placement.

      Can't
      speak
      for
      all
      the
      fraternities,
      but
      I'm
      a
      Triangle
      and
      we
      have
      events
      for
      potential
      recruits
      all
      through
      the
      summer,
      I
      think
      most
      of
      the
      other
      fraternities
      do
      this
      too.
      Mostly
      we'll
      do
      things
      like
      BBQs,
      camping
      trips,
      or
      going
      climbing/hiking
      in
      the
      cottonwoods.
      We're
      a
      fraternity
      of
      engineers,
      architects,
      and
      science
      majors,
      but
      we'd
      be
      more
      than
      happy
      to
      include
      you
      into
      our
      recruitment
      events,
      where
      you
      are
      likely
      to
      meet
      several
      guys
      with
      the
      same
      interests.
      Whether
      or
      not
      you #8217;re
      in
      one
      of
      those
      majors,
      PM
      me,
      I
      always
      like
      to
      meet
      more
      people
      into
      outdoors

      It

      Coding
      is
      a
      basic

      that,
      in
      our
      increasingly
      technology
      obsessed
      society,
      is
      incredibly
      useful

      pretty
      much
      any
      kind
      of
      science
      or
      engineering.
      Small
      exposure
      to
      coding
      will
      help
      the

      more
      easily
      and
      efficiently.
      Coding
      is
      becoming
      more
      like
      mathematics,
      a
      useful
      tool
      to
      get
      anything
      else
      done.
      Business
      people
      can
      use
      it
      for
      statistics,
      scientists
      for
      models,
      engineers
      to
      solve
      hard
      math
      problems.

      I
      might
      say
      that
      Java
      is
      the
      primary
      language,
      but
      there
      really
      isn't
      much
      of
      a
      primary
      language.

      you
      need
      to

      Yeah,
      not
      much
      programming
      in
      3100,
      but
      at
      least
      when
      I
      took
      it,
      you
      had
      to
      do
      some
      grammar
      stuff
      in
      Java.
      Other
      people
      in
      this
      thread
      did
      a
      better
      job
      than
      I
      did
      that

      The
      traditional
      approach
      is
      called
      a
      callback
      function.
      In
      main
      you
      would
      would
      pass
      a
      function
      to
      GUI
      that
      the
      GUI
      code
      would
      call
      when
      the
      button
      is
      pressed
      (this
      "callback"
      function
      defined
      in
      main).
      You
      could
      achieve
      a
      more
      elegant
      but
      equivalent
      solution
      in

      What
      I
      was
      taught
      was
      that
      the
      axioms
      were
      simply
      a
      way
      to
      have
      a
      starting
      point.
      From
      a
      mathematical
      perspective
      we
      don't
      care
      whether
      they
      or
      true
      or
      not,
      we
      only
      care
      about
      what
      we
      can
      prove
      from
      them.
      If
      we
      can
      show
      interesting
      truths
      from
      the
      axioms
      then
      we
      can
      make
      inferences
      about
      real
      systems
      that
      appear
      to
      obey
      the
      axioms.
      Is
      this
      what
      philosophy
      of
      math
      deals
      with?

      I'm
      working
      on
      a
      programming
      language/code
      editor
      interface.
      The
      editor
      is
      not
      monospaced
      and
      is
      very
      opinionated
      on
      formatting.
      The
      main
      point
      of
      the
      project
      is
      the
      editor
      interface,
      but
      it
      contains
      a
      relatively
      unoriginal
      novel
      programming
      language
      too.
      Basically
      lisp
      with
      the
      first
      element
      written
      before
      the
      open
      paren.
      (a
      b
      c)
      - gt;
      a(b
      c)
      I
      guess
      it's
      sort-of
      Mathematica-like
      in
      that
      respect.
      Anyway
      I'd
      love
      advice
      on
      the
      editor
      and
      on
      the
      language
      itself.

      So
      what
      you're
      looking
      for
      is
      a
      way
      of
      "classifying"
      songs
      as
      "I
      will
      like
      this"
      or
      "I
      won't
      like
      this".
      Alternatively
      you're
      looking
      at
      the
      "regression"
      problem
      which
      tries
      to
      answer
      "I
      will
      like
      this
      song
      this
      amount".
      I
      think
      the
      easiest
      framework
      to
      view
      the
      problem
      with
      is:
      given
      this
      set
      of
      song
      features
      (X)
      predict
      whether
      I'll
      like
      the
      song
      or
      not
      (Y).
      Here
      lies
      your
      biggest
      challenge:
      turning
      your
      song
      into
      something
      where
      you're
      likely
      to
      actually
      get
      good
      classification
      results
      with
      only
      a
      100
      songs.
      Spotify
      has
      a
      huge
      advantage:
      the
      don't
      need
      to
      classify
      songs
      based
      on
      what
      they
      sound
      like.
      The
      features
      they
      use
      (I
      believe)
      are
      the
      other
      songs
      that
      people
      often
      listen
      to
      with
      any
      given
      song.
      And
      they
      have
      an
      enormous
      dataset.
      Pandora
      solves
      this
      problem
      by
      having
      people
      listing
      to
      songs
      and
      manually
      recording
      a
      massive
      number
      of
      features
      from
      the
      song
      (Pandora
      calls
      them
      genes).
      What
      you're
      looking
      to
      do
      is
      come
      up
      with
      these
      features
      automatically.
      There
      are
      two
      approaches
      here:
      Manual
      feature
      selection.
      This
      is
      the
      more
      traditional
      ML
      approach.
      You'd
      ask
      an
      algorithm
      to
      select
      easily
      computable
      properties
      of
      each
      song
      like
      BPM,
      average
      pitch,
      and
      whatnot
      and
      do
      it's
      classification
      on
      these
      properties.
      The
      problem
      is
      that
      what
      makes
      us
      "like"
      or
      "dislike"
      a
      song
      might
      not
      be
      encoded
      in
      these
      features.
      You
      can
      also
      have
      the
      algorithm
      come
      up
      with
      the
      features
      for
      you.
      This
      is
      the
      central
      idea
      in
      deep
      learning.
      This
      might
      look
      like
      feeding
      the
      song
      into
      your
      algorithm
      raw,
      or
      with
      more
      restricted
      preprocessing
      where
      it
      still
      roughly
      looks
      like
      a
      song.
      As
      a
      first
      guess,
      I'd
      try
      using
      FFT
      to
      produce
      a
      spectrogram
      of
      the
      song
      and
      feeding
      short
      clips
      into
      a
      couple
      layers
      of
      1D
      convolutions.
      The
      problem
      is
      that
      for
      the
      CNN
      for
      find
      useful
      features
      of
      your
      songs
      it
      will
      need
      lots
      of
      data.
      You
      might
      be
      able
      to
      work
      around
      this
      by
      using
      a
      semi-supervised
      approach.
      Maybe
      you
      can
      train
      a
      network
      to
      classify
      whether
      two
      clips
      come
      from
      the
      same
      song,
      then
      use
      the
      learned
      features
      to
      determine
      if
      you'll
      like
      the
      song.
      Hopefully
      this
      at
      least
      starts
      you
      out
      on
      the
      right
      things
      to
      google.
