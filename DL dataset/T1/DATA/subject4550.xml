      I
      seem
      to
      have
      a
      very
      infectious
      energy
      pull.
      All
      my
      partners
      have
      always
      been
      unnecessarily
      high
      energy
      and
      being
      on
      the
      opposite
      end
      I
      mellow
      them
      out.
      Most
      of
      the
      dates
      I #8217;ve
      had
      were
      at
      home
      just
      watching
      tv.
      It
      seems
      to
      make
      guys
      get
      very
      comfortable
      confiding
      in
      me
      and
      trusting
      me
      faster
      leading
      to
      more
      meaningful
      conversations.
      So
      far
      only
      perks
      for
      them.

      Being
      funny
      without
      being
      too
      corny.
      Most
      importantly
      read
      her
      body
      language.
      Sometimes
      we
      are
      polite
      yet
      so
      uncomfortable
      and
      you
      wouldn #8217;t
      know
      coz
      we
      may
      be
      smiling
      (forced
      smile
      mind
      you).
      If
      she
      doesn #8217;t
      keep
      the
      convo
      going,
      move
      on
      bro.

      It #8217;s
      been
      a
      while
      but
      one
      time
      I
      was
      chit
      chatting
      about
      my
      new
      snowboard
      and
      how
      excited
      I
      was
      to
      break
      it
      in
      with
      a
      coworker
      and
      we
      are
      both
      not
      white.
      A
      new
      colleague
      (White
      girl)
      whom
      I
      was
      training
      interrupted
      me
      to
      say
      black
      people
      don #8217;t
      go
      in
      snow.
      I
      was
      speechless:
      my
      jaw
      dropped,
      my
      eyes
      wide
      in
      surprise
      at
      this
      blatant
      racist
      standing
      before
      me.
      I
      didn #8217;t
      finish
      training
      I
      simply
      walked
      away.

      I
      cuddle
      a
      teddy
      bear
      in
      the
      darkness
      of
      my
      home.
      Somehow
      that
      seems
      to
      work,
      depressing
      but
      effective.

      My
      biggest
      fear
      used
      to
      be
      things
      going
      wrong.
      As
      a
      perfectionist
      I
      hated
      not
      having
      everything
      work
      out
      exactly
      as
      planned.
      But
      once
      I
      started
      solo
      travels
      I
      found
      that
      I
      am
      actually
      very
      relaxed
      when
      abroad.
      I
      will
      plan
      and
      over
      plan
      but
      once
      I
      get
      to
      my
      destination
      I
      usually
      throw
      out
      those
      plans
      and
      go
      with
      the
      flow.
      In
      Ireland
      I
      found
      myself
      stuck
      in
      a
      bar
      without
      any
      taxis
      to
      go
      home
      but
      because
      I
      had
      been
      friendly
      to
      a
      local
      farmer
      he
      offered
      me
      a
      ride
      home
      and
      even
      showed
      me
      how
      to
      work
      the
      turf
      fire
      in
      the
      traditional
      home
      I
      was
      renting.
      I
      also
      got
      a
      free
      tour
      of
      the
      region
      the
      next
      day.
      I #8217;ve
      met
      other
      travelers
      and
      joined
      up
      with
      them
      for
      a
      day
      or
      two
      just
      because.
      Always
      be
      aware
      of
      your
      safety
      but
      don #8217;t
      be
      overly
      cautious
      to
      the
      point
      you
      are
      denying
      yourself
      an
      opportunity
      to
      meet
      sweet
      people.

      I #8217;m
      probably
      the
      wrong
      person
      to
      ask
      coz
      I
      always
      overpack.
      I
      have
      an
      airline
      credit
      card
      that
      allows
      me
      to
      carry
      2
      bags
      weighing
      70lbs
      each
      so
      I
      take
      full
      advantage
      of
      that.
      My
      rationale
      on
      that
      is
      that
      I #8217;m
      on
      vacation
      and
      don #8217;t
      want
      to
      be
      regretting
      leaving
      behind
      the
      perfect
      fashion
      piece
      for
      the
      day.
      So
      I
      pack
      enough
      for
      3-4
      outfit
      changes
      daily.
      I
      never
      worry
      about
      having
      to
      wash
      nothing
      and
      most
      of
      the
      time
      I
      can
      wash
      all
      those
      clothes
      on
      my
      last
      vacation
      day
      coz
      I
      always
      stay
      in
      rented
      homes
      so
      I
      can
      feel
      like
      a
      local.
      Do
      what
      feels
      right
      for
      you
      whether
      it
      be
      an
      overpacker
      or
      a
      minimalist.
      It #8217;s
      your
      trip.
      Shape
      it
      your
      way.

      I
      love
      watching
      sad
      movies
      coz
      then
      it
      opens
      up
      those
      darn
      blocked
      tear
      ducts.
      An
      alternative
      I
      accidentally
      found
      works
      for
      my
      warped
      brain
      is
      to
      watch
      comedy.
      I
      end
      up
      laughing
      so
      hard
      which
      then
      morphs
      into
      maniacal
      cackling
      and
      the
      not
      so
      happy
      tears
      start
      flowing.
      Best
      part
      about
      the
      laugh
      cry
      is
      you
      can
      do
      it
      in
      public
      because
      most
      people
      will
      just
      think
      it #8217;s
      a
      good
      laugh
      but
      deep
      inside
      you
      know.

      Back
      when
      I
      first
      started
      I
      could
      never
      leave
      my
      own
      room
      when
      astral
      projecting
      and
      then
      one
      day
      I
      sat
      up
      and
      out
      of
      my
      body
      and
      my
      guide
      was
      like
       #8220;no,
      not
      today. #8221;
      And
      immediately
      he
      gently
      guided
      me
      back
      to
      my
      body.
      Perhaps
      you
      just
      met
      your
      guide.
      I
      knew
      he
      was
      my
      guide
      because
      he
      came
      to
      me
      the
      night
      before
      in
      a
      dream
      so
      when
      he
      showed
      up
      that
      night
      I
      wasn #8217;t
      shitting
      bricks
      at
      having
      an
      entity
      in
      my
      room.
      I
      should
      have
      listened.
      My
      dumbass
      tried
      to
      return
      the
      next
      day
      but
      got
      yanked
      out
      by
      a
      demon.
      I
      was
      terrorized
      for
      months
      to
      the
      point
      I
      couldn #8217;t
      go
      to
      sleep
      coz
      I
      knew
      he
      would
      pull
      me
      out
      the
      moment
      I
      closed
      my
      eyes.
      Listen
      to
      your
      guide
      whether
      or
      not
      you
      see
      them,
      they
      are
      telling
      you
      you #8217;re
      not
      in
      the
      right
      headspace
      to
      be
      getting
      out.

      Absolutely,
      it #8217;s
      the
      best
      therapy.
      It
      sucks
      at
      moments
      when
      you
      are
      traveling
      and
      see
      other
      couples
      but
      then
      you
      get
      that
      euphoric
      feeling
      of
      freedom
      and
      a
      new
      perspective.
      I
      think
      of
      it
      as
      pressing
      the
      reset
      button
      and
      so
      when
      I
      get
      home
      I
      am
      no
      longer
      moping
      for
      them
      as
      I #8217;ve
      scrubbed
      them
      free
      from
      my
      life.

      I
      dated
      a
      guy
      long
      distance
      who
      was
      the
      sweetest.
      We
      would
      both
      do
      homework
      while
      FaceTiming
      each
      other
      in
      college
      and
      help
      each
      other
      out.
      I
      fell
      asleep
      on
      multiple
      occasions
      and
      I #8217;d
      wake
      up
      to
      see
      him
      still
      on
      the
      line
      but
      playing
      video
      games.
      It
      was
      intimate
      moments
      like
      that
      that

      the
      distance
      issue
      seem
      momentarily
      forgotten.

      I
      had
      a
      similar
      situation
      happen
      where
      I
      was
      basically
      your
      friend
      and
      I
      cut
      him
      off
      too.
      But
      obviously
      the
      friendship
      meant
      too
      much
      to
      me
      and
      I
      tried
      to
      reconnect
      and
      he
      no
      longer
      wants
      anything
      to
      do
      with
      me.
      From
      mutual
      friends
      I
      heard
      that
      he
      was
      too
      heartbroken
      and
      would
      prefer
      never
      to
      see
      me
      again.
      It
      hurts
      to
      lose
      a
      friend
      but
      save
      your
      heart
      and
      cut
      her
      out
      too.
      I
      have
      recovered
      and
      so
      will
      she.
      Choose
      your
      happiness
      first
      as
      opposed
      to
      pining
      after
      her.

      I #8217;ve
      failed
      16
      times
      when
      I
      was
      a
      teenager.
      It
      got
      to
      a
      point
      I
      would
      sometimes
      forget
      I #8217;d
      tried
      to
      kill
      myself
      the
      night
      before
      and
      I #8217;d
      go
      to
      school
      but
      then
      collapse
      in
      class
      from
      the
      effects
      of
      my
      chosen
      method.
      This
      would
      freak
      out
      my
      teachers
      and
      I #8217;d
      be
      rushed
      to
      hospital
      where
      I
      would
      stay
      for
      a
      month.
      I #8217;ve
      finally
      stopped
      trying
      now
      that
      I
      know
      I
      wasn #8217;t
      meant
      to
      take
      my
      own
      life.
      The
      thoughts
      are
      still
      there
      I
      just
      am
      not
      motivated
      enough
      to
      suffer
      another
      failure.

      I
      try
      to
      avoid
      my
      triggers.
      The
      only
      bad
      thing
      is
      I
      get
      triggered
      by
      happiness.
      So
      when
      I #8217;m
      in
      a
      great
      mood
      and
      all
      smiley
      and
      shit
      I
      start
      freaking
      out
      because
      I
      know
      sooner
      or
      later
      I
      will
      be
      feeling
      suicidal.
      It #8217;s
      warped.
      I
      hate
      being
      so
      happy
      that
      I
      feel
      that
      that
      is
      the
      perfect
      ending
      of
      a
      pathetic
      life.
      It
      never
      goes
      away.
      You
      just
      have
      to
      let
      the
      episode
      pass
      and
      move
      on.

      not

      growing

      my

      Orgy.
      Absolutely
      horrendous.
      It
      was
      a

      and
      alcohol
      fueled
      night
      with
      porn

      a
      little
      bit
      sober

      One
      Mexican.
      The
      end.
      I
      don #8217;t
      know
      why
      other
      women
      start
      getting
      jealous
      of
      me
      or
      suspicious
      when
      I #8217;m
      around
      their
      SO.
      I #8217;m
      not
      even
      pretty,
      maybe
      cute
      like
      a
      kitten.
      Yet
      all
      my
      female
      friends
      have
      cut
      me
      off
      due
      to
      their
      insecurities.
      I
      wish
      we
      could
      start
      loving
      each
      other
      rather
      than
      viewing
      others
      as
      threats.

      Keep
      on
      keeping
      on.
      I
      motivate
      myself
      with
      stupid
      things
      coz
      god
      knows
      I #8217;m
      always
      on
      the
      edge
      ready
      to
      fling
      myself
      into
      oblivion.
      Today
      my
      motivation
      to
      wake
      up
      tomorrow
      is
      I
      am
      craving
      a
      mango
      and
      I
      get
      to
      buy
      one
      tomorrow
      and
      it
      will
      be
      soft,
      juicy,
      and
      it
      will
      run
      down
      my
      arms
      as
      I
      scarf
      it
      down
      and
      not
      regret
      it
      even
      when
      it
      stains
      my
      white
      shirt
      which
      I
      have
      just
      washed.
      Sometimes
      there #8217;s
      no
      bigger
      picture,
      there #8217;s
      no
      big
      reason,
      not
      all
      of
      us
      can
      have
      an
      epiphany
      on
      why
      we
      exist.
      But
      just
      chug
      along
      for
      the
      ride
      just
      for
      the
      hell
      of
      it
      coz
      why
      not.

      It #8217;s
      not
      about
      the
      method.
      You
      need
      healing.
      Fuck
      the
      stupid
      system
      they
      don #8217;t
      give
      a
      shit.
      Find
      the
      healing
      within.
      I #8217;ve
      tried
      to
      kill
      myself
      over
      a
      dozen
      times
      and
      a
      dozen
      times
      I #8217;ve
      woken
      up
      in
      hospital
      and
      later
      transferred
      to
      a
      psych
      hospital.
      Those
      were
      my
      most
      favorite
      vacations
      growing
      up.
      I
      even
      celebrated
      Halloween
      in
      a
      psych
      ward
      and
      yes
      they
      gave
      us
      costumes
      and
      candy.
      What
      that
      taught
      me
      was
      that
      I
      crave
      that
      childlike
      giddiness
      which
      was
      so
      forcefully
      ripped
      from
      my
      hands.
      Childhood
      trauma
      forced
      me
      to
      grow
      up
      before
      I
      could
      even
      write.
      So
      now
      I
      tap
      into
      my
      inner
      child:
      I
      have
      crayons
      and
      a
      coloring
      book
      to
      help
      me
      when
      I #8217;m
      hurting
      and
      unable
      to
      cope
      with
      living.

      he

      Bro
      I
      cannot
      even
      handle
      25mg.
      Be
      smart
      and
      don #8217;t
      fuck
      yourself
      up
      like
      that.
      My
      first
      time
      I
      took
      80mg
      despite
      being
      told
      not
      to
      do
      that
      and

      stars
      shining
      through
      my
      ceiling
      and
      I
      felt
      like
      I
      was
      dying.
      Play
      it
      safe
      bro.
      It #8217;s
      tempting
      to
      want
      more
      but
      trust
      me
      when
      it
      kicks
      in
      in
      an
      hour
      or
      two,
      you #8217;ll
      be
      regretting
      that
      shit.

      Sorry.
      I
      guess
      I
      take
      for
      granted
      that
      I
      live
      in
      a

      So
      I
      was
      in
      Hollywood
      about
      to
      deliver
      an
      order
      in
      an
      apartment
      when
      I
      saw
      a
      guy
      walking
      up
      and
      down
      the
      street
      pulling
      in
      car
      doors.
      No
      way
      am
      I
      getting
      my
      car
      stolen
      or
      vandalized
      for
      $4
      so
      I
      called
      the
      customer
      to
      explain
      and
      he
      bitched
      saying
      he
      is
      paying
      to
      have
      the
      food
      be
      delivered
      straight
      to
      his
      door.
      I
      was
      polite
      and
      told
      him
      I
      am
      patiently
      waiting
      for
      him
      at
      the
      front
      of
      the
      complex.
      He
      huffed
      and
      hung
      up
      and
      lo
      and
      behold
      it
      was
      a
      buff
      Russian
      guy
      moaning
      about
      reporting
      me.
      I #8217;m
      thinking
      of
      just
      calling
      support
      just
      to
      cover
      my
      behind.
      What
      do
      y #8217;all
      think?

      Yes
      just
      did
      get
      someone
      in
      under
      a
      minute!
      They
      told
      me
      it #8217;s
      okay
      I
      did
      the
      right
      thing
      and
      I
      won #8217;t
      be
      deactivated
      or
      reprimanded.
      Sigh
      of
      relief.

      I
      always
      get
      super
      high
      and
      watch
      horror

      Gotta

      lol.
      I

      enjoy
      your

      An
      edible
      high
      is
      so
      different
      since
      it
      needs
      to
      be
      digested.
      I #8217;ve
      been
      smacked
      3hrs
      later
      and
      thanked
      myself
      for
      waiting
      it
      out.
      They
      be
      slow

      up
      to

      so

      I
      did
      and
      he
      kept
      hanging
      up.
      After
      a
      few
      minutes
      I
      started
      the
      timer.
      The
      timer
      was
      at
      20
      seconds
      left
      when
      the
      jerk
      face
      decided
      to
      show

      I
      believe
      he
      trusts
      you
      enough
      to
      even
      let
      you
      know
      of
      the
      attempt.
      You
      are
      really
      quite
      sweet
      and
      thoughtful
      and
      I
      wish
      you
      happiness.
      Don #8217;t
      worry,
      he
      knows
      you
      care
      and
      you
      can
      rest
      assured
      he
      will
      open
      up
      if
      he
      feels
      like
      crossing
      that
      bridge.

      The
      Alchemist
      by
      Paulo
      Coelho
      never
      fails
      to
      trigger
      my
      yearning
      to
      travel.
      Oh
      how
      much
      I
      wish
      I
      was
      a

      with
      my

      On
      the
      contrary
      it #8217;s
      the
      only
      time
      I
      can
      watch
      such
      videos.
      Last

      I
      was
      watching
      a
      bunch
      of
      car
      crash
      videos
      on
      YouTube
      and
      I
      was
      really
      relaxed.
      When
      sober
      I
      couldn #8217;t
      watch
      it
      due
      to
      my
      anxiety
      levels
      skyrocketing.

      First
      of
      all,
      Happy
      Birthday.
      I #8217;m
      the
      queen
      of
      introverts
      so
      every
      year
      I
      leave
      the
      country
      during
      that
      time
      so
      I
      can
      avoid
      getting
      disappointed.
      I
      give
      myself
      the
      gift
      of
      peace.
      Seriously
      though
      don #8217;t
      sweat
      it
      and
      just
      go
      with
      the
      flow.
      Indulge
      yourself.

      Yes
      I
      usually
      smoke
      socially
      on
      weekends
      but
      take
      edibles
      during
      the
      day.
      If
      I
      have
      a
      busy
      day
      I #8217;ll
      pop
      one
      popcorn
      ~10mg
      daily.
      My
      tolerance
      is
      really
      low
      so
      that
      one
      pop
      keeps
      me
      buzzing
      for
      hours.

      I
      have
      had
      a
      hard
      time
      with
      the
      #metoo
      movement
      as
      it #8217;s
      only
      been
      3
      years
      and
      I #8217;ve
      not
      gone
      to
      a
      therapist.
      I
      have
      even
      cut
      back
      on
      alcohol
      because
      every
      time
      I
      get
      drunk
      I
      get
      intense
      flashbacks
      (I
      was
      drunk
      when
      it
      happened).
      I
      know
      therapy
      is
      necessary
      but
      ignorance
      is
      bliss
      rn.
      I #8217;m
      not
      mentally
      prepared
      to
      rip
      off
      the
      duct
      tape
      and
      properly
      suture
      the
      gaping
      hole.
      I #8217;ve
      found
      myself
      to
      dissociate
      whenever
      the
      topic
      comes
      out:
      my
      ears
      ring
      and
      drown
      out
      the
      topic,
      my
      eyes
      blur.
      Needless
      to
      say,
      social
      media
      kills
      me
      coz
      I
      find
      myself
      paralyzed
      when
      I
      pass
      a
      post
      on
      it.
      Happy
      recovery
      y #8217;all.

      Last
      year
      I
      skipped
      my
      placebo
      pills
      on
      birth
      control
      to
      delay
      my
      period
      due
      to
      a
      tropical
      vacation
      I
      didn #8217;t
      wanna
      ruin.
      But
      if
      not
      I #8217;d
      recommend
      using
      menstrual
      cups
      and
      SheThinx
      underwear.
      I
      get
      very
      heavy
      days
      but
      since
      my
      switch
      I
      can
      go
      6
      hours
      without
      blinking.
      Plus
      it
      helps
      when
      you
      are
      someplace
      without
      trash
      cans
      and
      don #8217;t
      need
      to
      dispose
      hygiene
      products.
      Good
      luck
      hun.

      you #8217;d
      more

      was

      No

      your
      mum
      sounds
      like
      a
      right

      I
      used
      to
      cut
      in
      the
      car
      when
      my
      mum
      drove
      me
      to
      school
      and
      she #8217;d
      be
      like
       #8220;don #8217;t
      get
      blood
      on
      my
      seats. #8221;
      That #8217;s

      a

      is

      sadly
      for

      that #8217;s
      what
      we
      have
      as
      our
      birth
      givers.
      Sorry
      mate.
      Hope
      you
      don #8217;t

      Hey
      it #8217;s
      okay.
      Yes
      the
      guilt,
      the
      heartbreak,
      the
      shame
      will
      feel
      like
      you
      are
      suffocating
      but
      it
      goes
      away.
      As
      a
      college
      dropout
      child
      prodigy
      I
      know
      how
      you
      feel.
      I
      found
      out
      I #8217;m
      happier
      now
      when
      I #8217;m
      not
      trying
      to
      live
      a
      life
      that
      others
      (parents)
      want
      to
      vicariously
      live
      through
      me.
      Cheers
      mate,
      you #8217;ll
      be
      okay.

      I #8217;m
      the
      richest
      person
      alive
      when
      traveling.
      Not
      really
      but
      I
      definitely
      throw
      money
      away
      that
      I #8217;d
      never
      do
      at
      home
      as
      I
      live
      a
      very
      frugal
      life.
      But
      for
      some
      reason
      traveling
      makes
      me
      let
      loose
      and
      I
      only
      start
      regretting
      when
      I
      touch
      back
      at
      home
      base.
      But
      at
      the
      end
      of
      the
      day
      I
      tell
      myself
      a
      splurge
      doesn #8217;t
      hurt
      me
      if
      it #8217;s
      localized
      to
      traveling
      and
      not
      an
      every
      day
      vice.
      Happy
      travels
      y #8217;all.

      Classical

      busting
      a
      solo
      move
      lol.
      When

      intense
      and
      my
      heart
      beat

      I

      drift
      off
      to
      la

      Start
      seeing
      a
      therapist.
      My
      parents
      never
      took
      me
      serious
      one
      bit
      even
      when
      they
      were
      told.
      It
      was
      an
      inconvenience
      to
      them.
      If
      you
      feel
      they #8217;ll
      be
      that
      way
      just
      get
      your
      problems
      addressed
      so
      at
      least
      you
      can
      get
      that
      stability
      back
      into
      your
      life
      and
      not
      be
      taken
      over
      by
      the
      thoughts.

      I
      think
      you #8217;ll
      be
      alright.
      I
      can #8217;t
      stand
      to
      see
      food
      waste.
      My
      ex
      was
      the
      worst
      he #8217;d
      bite
      a
      burger
      and
      be
      done
      with
      it.
      I
      am
      vegan
      but
      food
      waste
      breaks
      my
      heart
      after
      growing
      up
      surrounded
      by
      poverty
      and
      hunger.
      Therefore
      I
      often
      ate
      his
      leftovers
      that
      would
      otherwise
      be
      trashed
      after
      apologizing
      and
      saying
      a
      little
      prayer
      to
      the
      poor
      animal.
      It #8217;s
      hard
      for
      me
      since
      I
      can
      literally
      taste
      the
      death.

      group
      therapy
      sessions.
      I
      loved
      movie
      nights.

      Total

      $4.22.
      I
      love
      the

      and
      their

      Why

      bother
      tipping
      so
      little
      when
      both

      It #8217;s
      a
      slap
      in
      the
      fucking
      face
      getting
      chump
      change.
      I
      remember
      a
      few
      years
      back
      on
      Christmas
      Day
      my
      lonely
      ass
      ordered
      pizza
      and
      it
      was
      a
      new
      kid
      delivering
      for
      the
      first
      time.
      I
      tipped
      him
      $5
      and
      his
      face
      lit
      up.
      I
      said
      fuck
      it
      I #8217;m
      gonna
      make
      his
      night
      and
      dropped
      a
      $20
      in
      his
      pocket.
      He
      deadass
      came
      back
      with
      a
      small
      gift
      for
      me.
      I #8217;m
      the
      working
      class
      so
      I
      feel
      the
      pain
      and
      definitely
      wanna
      help
      each
      other
      y #8217;know.
      It
      doesn #8217;t
      hurt
      being

      It #8217;s
      so
      disrespectful
      when
      men
      can #8217;t
      take
      the
      hint.
      Personally
      I
      don #8217;t
      like
      to
      stand
      my
      ground

      entertain
      anybody
      I
      don #8217;t
      wanna
      fuck
      with.
      I
      feel
      like
      the
      few
      times
      I
      outright
      said
      no
      to
      guys
      all
      it
      did
      was
      enrage
      them
      and
      that #8217;s
      the
      reality
      of
      being
      a
      woman:
      having
      to
      cater
      to
      that
      male
      ego
      to
      avoid
      violence.

      My

      breaks

      you.

      The
      thing
      that

      attractive
      is
      your

      it
      being

      the
      cloak

      Moreover,
      you
      got
      it
      down
      to
      the
      basics:
      taking
      one
      step
      at
      a

      Have
      a
      beautiful

      2
      days.
      First
      day
      I
      got
      food
      poisoning
      from
      spoiled
      milk
      served
      in
      coffee
      machine.
      Manager,
      who
      had
      insisted
      I
      enjoy
      the
      bomb
      break
      room,
      told
      me
      it
      was
      my
      fault
      for
      not
      checking
      and
      smelling
      the
      milk
      first
       #129318; #8205; #9792; #65039;
      second
      day
      same
      manager
      bullshit
      for
      caring
      for
      a
      client
      who
      was
      tweaking.
      I
      dropped
      my
      equipment
      on
      the
      floor,
      slammed
      the
      door
      as
      he
      yelled
      at
      me
      and
      drove
      to
      the
      beach.
      Never
      felt
      so
      satisfied.

      I

      as
      in
      the
      airport
      code
      for
      Seattle,
      Washington
      lol,
      I
      was
      scratching
      my
      head
      how
      the
      hell
      that #8217;d
      be
      a
      destination
      spot
      for
      that
      long.
      Amazing
      experience,
      thanks
      for
      sharing.

      I

      I

      it #8217;s
      okay
      for
      you
      to
      use
      what
      you
      have.
      If

      onto
      something
      more

      friendly
      then
      hooray.

      I
      feel
      your
      pain.
      Someone
      on
      the
      zero

      group
      alerted
      to
      me
      this
      is
      a
      control
      thing.
      My
      ex
      used
      to
      bite
      a
      burger
      and
      be
      done
      with
      it.
      He
      knew
      I
      grew
      up
      poor
      and
      can #8217;t
      stand
      watching
      food
      being
      thrown
      away
      so
      I #8217;d
      finish
      the
      burger
      for
      him
      even
      though
      I
      was
      vegan.
      I #8217;m
      so
      sorry
      hun.
      Get
      rid
      of
      that
      friend.
      They
      don #8217;t
      care
      about
      you
      and
      are
      boxing
      you
      in.
      Peace.

      Just

      took
      a
      beating
      when

      I
      never
      liked
      cheese
      before.
      I
      was
      that
      psycho
      who #8217;d
      pick
      cheese
      off
      pizza
      lol.
      So
      when
      I
      went
      vegan
      I
      tried
      vegan
      cheese
      specifically
      cashew
      cheese
      and
      oh
      it
      was
      dreadful.
      By
      dreadful
      I
      mean
      it
      tasted
      like
      real
      cheese.
      My
      non
      vegan
      friend
      loved
      it
      and
      finished
      it
      off
      for
      me
      so
      that #8217;s
      a
      good
      start.
      Cashew
      cheese.

      Oh
      ok
      I
      see.
      Sorry
      if
      I
      came
      off
      full
      force
      on
      ya.
      Yes
      it #8217;s
      definitely
      okay
      for
      you
      to
      feed
      it
      meat.
      Nobody
      can
      judge
      you
      for
      that
      after
      all
      it #8217;s
      not
      entering
      your
      body.
      But
      if
      it
      does
      physically
      repulse
      you
      then
      it #8217;s
      still
      okay
      for
      you
      to
      leave
      the
      feeding
      to
      your
      sister.
      Have
      a
      beautiful

      Well
      hun
      let
      me
      tell
      you
      I #8217;m
      getting
      super
      bad
      vibes
      from
      this
      situation.
      Let
      me
      be
      paranoid
      for
      you.
      I #8217;d
      rather
      you
      be
      safe
      and
      lose
      the
      money.
      The
      fact
      that
      you
      are
      posting
      this
      shows
      you
      do
      feel
      something
      is
      off
      so
      definitely
      trust
      your
      instincts.
      I
      know
      it
      seems
      dramatic
      to
      cancel
      on
      some
      insignificant
      post
      but
      he
      already
      appears
      to
      be
      getting
      very
      familiar
      and
      comfortable
      with
      you
      as
      opposed
      to
      professional
      which
      he
      should
      be
      given
      this
      is
      a
      business
      transaction
      and
      not
      a
      date.
      I
      hope
      all
      is
      well
      whichever
      way
      you
      choose.
      But
      don #8217;t
      discount
      your
      own
      feelings.

      Thank
      you.
      I
      just
      thought
      how

      it
      was
      having

      foot
      out
      the
      door
      and
      tripping

      living
      for
      some
      insignificant
      reason.

      these

      me
      this
      bad

      doing
      that

      You #8217;ll
      get
      through
      this.
      Breakups
      are
      never
      easy.
      I #8217;m
      sorry
      it
      ended.
      Trying
      to
      stay
      friends
      is
      about
      the
      worst
      thing
      you
      can
      do.
      I #8217;ve
      also
      tried
      and
      failed
      that
      route.
      Do
      not
      go
      to
      work.
      Go
      ahead
      and
      call
      off
      and
      take
      a
      mental
      health
      day.
      Let
      her
      know
      she
      needs
      to
      be
      gone
      by
      the
      end
      of
      the
      day.
      Go
      out
      for
      a
      drive
      or
      entertain
      yourself
      all
      day
      out
      of
      the
      house.
      By
      the
      time
      you
      return,
      it
      should
      be
      empty
      of
      her
      and
      her
      belongings
      and
      a
      chance
      for
      you
      to
      start
      afresh.
      My
      heart
      reaches
      out
      to
      you
      in
      your
      time
      of
      sorrow.
      You
      will
      get
      through
      this,
      trust
      yourself
      and
      protect
      your
      heart.
      Goodnight
      hun.

      Yes
      I
      have
      fallen
      into
      a
      deep
      depression
      lately
      and
      cannot

      sober.
      Spiraling
      can

      times.
      And
      so
      yes,
      reality
      is
      much
      too
      grim

      We
      appreciate
      you
      and
      how
      much
      you
      care
      for
      her.
      If
      only
      you
      knew
      the
      number
      of
      men
      who
      roam
      free
      from
      never
      being
      reported
      or
      justice
      never
      being
      served.
      I
      never
      reported
      my
      rapist.
      In
      fact,
      the
      next
      morning
      I
      apologized
      to
      him
      for
      throwing
      up
      on
      his
      carpet,
      I
      even
      offered
      to
      pay
      for
      carpet
      cleaning.
      It
      hadn #8217;t
      hit
      me
      yet.
      He
      quickly
      refused
      my
      offer
      and
      sent
      me
      on
      my
      way;
      his
      smug
      smile
      should
      have
      been
      all
      I
      needed
      to
      know
      he
      had
      gotten
      away
      with
      something.
      He
      has
      beautiful
      young
      daughters
      that
      rely
      on
      him:
      that
      is
      why
      I
      never
      reported
      him.
      I
      feel
      your
      rage
      for
      your
      sisters #8217;
      rapist
      not
      getting
      justice
      and
      getting
      away
      scot
      free.
      The
      grim
      reality
      of
      this
      sordid
      business
      is
      it #8217;s
      such
      an
      easy
      crime
      just
      like
      taking
      candy
      from
      a
      baby.
      I
      hope
      things
      change
      one
      day.

      no

      live
      a
      cruelty
      free

      I
      started
      dissociating
      around
      your
      age.
      I
      found
      one
      therapist
      who
      can
      ground
      me.
      Sadly
      I
      aged
      out
      of
      foster
      care
      and
      moved
      away
      to
      a
      big
      city.
      You
      don #8217;t
      have
      to
      deal
      with
      all
      your
      problems
      with
      them.
      If
      you
      just
      wanna
      focus
      on
      one
      thing
      then
      state
      it
      clearly.
      Don #8217;t
      keep
      it
      inside
      otherwise
      you #8217;ll
      get
      to
      my
      age
      and
      still
      be
      dealing
      with
      issues
      I
      knew
      I
      could #8217;ve
      resolved.

      I
      get
      what
      you
      mean.
      Nah
      never
      got
      numb
      face
      but
      my
      arms
      go
      numb
      and
      I
      smack/drop
      things
      onto
      the
      ground
      not
      even
      knowing
      I
      was
      close
      to/holding
      them.
      Depression
      is
      a
      trip
      ain #8217;t
      it.
      Stay
      strong
      and
      I
      hope
      you
      recover
      well.

      Don #8217;t
      want
      to
      give
      out
      medical
      advice
      so
      I
      feel
      you
      would
      benefit
      by
      talking
      to
      your
      doctor
      to
      make
      sure
      it #8217;s
      not
      a
      physical
      illness.
      If
      they
      rule
      out
      that
      then
      they
      can
      refer
      you
      to
      a
      therapist
      so
      you
      can
      know
      for
      sure
      what
      in
      the
      world
      is
      going
      on.
      I
      know
      it #8217;s
      awkward
      but
      do
      this
      for
      you,
      seek
      the
      truth
      out.
      You
      got
      this
      fam.

      Look

      a
      reason
      to
      live
      even
      just
      for
      one
      day:
      for

      I
      have
      a

      a

      so
      I

      stay
      alive
      till
      then.

      motivate
      myself
      with
      seemingly
      insignificant

      have
      been
      dead
      over
      a
      decade
      ago.
      You

      ask
      what
      the
      point
      but
      truly

      the

      things
      in

      I

      you
      know
      she #8217;s
      wrong.
      A

      from
      a
      certain
      generation
      cannot
      admit
      to
      their
      mistakes.
      She #8217;s
      clearly
      stressing
      out
      in
      her
      life
      and
      unfortunately
      taking
      out
      her
      frustrations
      on
      you.
      Put
      your
      foot
      down
      and
      don #8217;t
      tolerate
      abuse #8212;
      talk
      back
      if
      you
      must #8212;
      and
      think
      about
      moving
      out
      as
      soon
      as
      financially
      feasible.

      No
      72hr
      hold
      is
      the
      minimum.
      If
      they
      deem
      you
      still
      a
      danger
      to
      yourself
      then
      they
      keep
      you
      longer.
      I
      was
      kept
      in
      one
      time
      for
      3
      weeks
      coz
      I
      refused
      to
      eat
      and
      slept
      all
      day
      every
      day.
      I
      had
      to
      have
      a
      whole
      week
      of
      normal
      eating
      and
      socializing
      before
      I
      could
      be
      released.
      It #8217;s
      not
      imprisonment
      even
      though
      it
      feels
      like
      it.
      They
      just
      want
      you
      to
      get
      back
      to
      normal.

      I
      first
      tried
      this
      dressing
      for
      a
      French
      Potato
      Salad
      on
      the
      Minimalist
      Baker
      website
      and
      now
      I
      use
      this
      dressing
      for
      every
      salad!
      DRESSING
      2
      1/2

      Yes
      they
      want
      you
      to
      substitute
      beans
      for
      beef.
      There #8217;s
      a
      lot
      of
      vegetarians
      and
      vegans
      I
      end
      up
      delivering
      to
      and
      substitutions
      are
      a
      huge
      portion
      of
      deliveries.
      It #8217;s
      kind
      of

      That

      It

      doesn #8217;t
      need

      Also,
      I #8217;ve

      some
      people
      using
      their
      menstrual
      cup
      every
      day,
      period
      or
      no
      period.
      It #8217;s
      an
      option
      to
      explore
      since
      you
      seem
      set
      against
      reusables.

      were

      One

      I

      never

      high
      after
      a
      similar

      I
      always
      have
      my
      snacks
      in
      the
      living

      or

      ooh
      the
      price
      of
      one
      mistake
      is
      too
      damn
      high.
      Sorry

      my

      wash
      the

      It #8217;s
      a

      worth

      Why
      don #8217;t
      you
      go
      to
      the
      product
      site
      and
      read
      it
      rather
      than
      stating
      things
      blindly.
      As
      a
      vegan
      I
      definitely
      do
      thorough
      research
      before
      buying.

      I
      feel
      a
      lot
      of
      ex
      vegans
      make
      us
      look
      bad
      because
      they
      go
      too
      far
      with
      the
      diet
      like
      30
      day
      water
      fasts
      and
      then
      blaming
      veganism
      for
      the
      subsequent
      decline
      in
      health.
      This
      is
      then
      ammunition
      to
      those
      anti
      vegans
      to
      use
      it
      against
      us.
      Sigh.

      I

      don #8217;t

      the

      eat
      like

      Don #8217;t
      eat
      bland
      as
      you

      be
      doing
      a

      Shop
      where
      locals
      shop
      and
      you
      can
      do

      if

      deficient
      it #8217;s
      your

      We

      supplement
      that

      still
      be

      You

      take
      more
      later

      In-n-Out
      burger
      and
      would
      only
      remember
      I #8217;m
      eating
      meat
      after
      my
      tummy
      was
      full.
      I
      started
      stocking
      up
      on
      vegan
      fast
      food
      and
      exploring
      the
      vegan
      options
      in
      my
      city
      so
      I #8217;d
      never
      be
      in
      the
      same
      predicament
      again.
      You
      didn #8217;t
      do
      wrong.
      To
      err
      is
      human;
      to
      forgive,
      divine.
      Let
      it
      go.
      Props
      for
      not
      wasting
      food.

      I
      absolutely
      regret
      it
      too.
      My
      mum
      straight
      up
      said
       #8220;shit
      happens #8221;.
      End
      of
      conversation!
      Not
      every
      person
      was
      meant
      to
      be
      a
      parent.
      I #8217;m
      heartbroken
      for
      you
      and
      hope
      you
      can
      leave
      such
      a
      callous
      woman
      who
      can
      shame
      you
      for
      an
      outfit
      soon.
      I #8217;m
      equally
      terrible
      at
      blurting
      about
      getting
      raped
      while
      black
      out
      drunk
      coz
      I
      was
      black
      out
      drunk
      when
      it
      happened
      probably
      flashbacks.
      You
      are
      worthy
      and
      beautiful.
      Shout
      the
      abuse
      back
      to
      her
      she
      clearly
      does
      not
      respect
      you
      and
      hence
      doesn #8217;t
      deserve
      any
      back.
      I #8217;m
      sorry
      for
      having
      her
      as
      your
      parent.

      I
      just
      recently
      started
      packing
      a
      small
      duffel
      bag
      and
      leaving
      1/4
      room
      for
      whatever
      liquor
      I
      buy
      from
      each
      country.
      It
      boggles
      my
      mind
      when
      I
      go
      to
      hostels
      and
      see
      people
      lugging
      ginormous
      bags
      filled
      with
       #8216;just
      in
      case
      items
      coz
      you
      never
      know #8217;.
      That #8217;s
      the
      beauty
      of
      travel
      to
      be
      caught
      in
      a
      sudden
      rainstorm
      and
      singing
      in
      the
      rain
      or
      laughing
      maniacally
      while
      dashing
      to
      the
      nearest
      shelter.
      If
      only
      people
      could
      be
      like
      us.

      You

      I #8217;m

      Let
      your

      body
      recover
      from
      this.
      If

      cry
      do
      it
      and

      Congrats
      first
      of
      all.
      The
      Harney
      and
      Sons
      company
      is
      amazing.
      I
      have
      been
      loyal
      to
      them
      ever
      since
      stumbling
      on
      them
      while
      at
      a
      restaurant.
      They
      have
      everything
      you
      need
      from
      Earl
      Grey
      Supreme
      (my
      personal
      morning

      Missed
      the

      bus
      from
      Galway
      to
      Doolin
      in

      Taxi
      driver
      saw
      me
      panicked
      and
      promised
      they
      knew
      bus
      route
      and
      would
      catch
      me
      up.
      We
      did
      not
      catch
      up;
      He
      got
      lost.
      Lost
       #8364;80
      on
      that
      taxi,
      in
      comparison,
      bus
      would #8217;ve
      cost
      me
       #8364;15.

      So
      I
      work
      for
      a
      well
      known
      company
      and
      they #8217;ve
      always
      seemed
      to
      make
      efforts
      to
      save
      the
      environment.
      Recently
      they
      rolled
      out
      trash
      cans
      which
      have
      separate
      receptacles
      for
      trash,
      recycling,
      and
      compost!
      I
      was
      overjoyed
      and
      almost
      posted
      the
      picture.
      However,
      I
      happened
      to
      talk
      to
      the
      janitors
      one
      day
      and
      ask
      how
      they
      compost
      and
      imagine
      my
      shock
      at
      being
      told
      it #8217;s
      all
      a
      hoax.
      It #8217;s
      too
      expensive
      to
      actually
      recycle
      and
      compost
      so
      everything
      goes
      into
      the
      trash
      but
      we
      think
      it #8217;s
      all
      being
      separated.
      How
      disheartening!

      I

      I
      was

      and
      I
      ordered
      my

      favorite
      which
      is
      a
      foot
      long
      tuna
      sandwich
      and
      I
      got
      all
      the
      way
      to
      paying
      for
      it
      when
      I
      remembered
      I
      was
      vegan.
      Definitely
      woke
      me
      up

      I

      one
      of

      shelled

      telling

      reason
      I #8217;d
      be
      taking
      the
      week
      off
      effective
      immediately.
      She
      decided
      to
      ask
      me
      why
      and
      I
      broke
      down
      on
      the
      phone.
      After
      that
      when
      I
      call
      off
      they
      don #8217;t
      ask

      lol.
      She #8217;s
      also
      been
      so
      kind
      to
      me
      since
      then.
      I #8217;m
      based
      in
      the
      US
      and
      not
      all
      employers
      are
      hard
      asses.
      We
      all
      go
      through
      hardships
      and
      many
      are
      more
      than
      willing
      to
      accommodate
      all
      types

      I #8217;ve
      lived
      alone
      since
      I
      was
      17.
      I
      refused
      to
      go
      home
      so
      police
      had
      no
      choice
      but
      to
      refer
      me
      to
      child
      protective
      services
      and
      so
      I
      lived
      in
      a
      group
      home
      till
      I
      turned
      18
      and
      have
      lived
      alone
      since.
      I #8217;m
      not
      okay
      rn
      but
      had
      I
      stayed
      home
      I #8217;m
      a
      100%
      sure
      I #8217;d
      be
      dead
      or
      in
      jail.
      Just
      sayin.
      Do
      what
      feels
      right
      for
      you
      and
      removing
      yourself
      from
      a
      toxic
      household
      is
      key
      to
      starting
      to
      get
      better.

      Have
      you
      heard
      of
      skin
      fasting?
      It #8217;s
      basically
      when
      you
      refrain
      from
      using
      your
      daily
      skin
      care
      products
      for
      a
      set
      amount
      of
      time
      to
      let
      your
      skin
      breathe
      and
      recover.
      I
      started
      it
      a
      month
      ago
      and
      it #8217;s
      so
      refreshing
      just
      putting
      a
      dollop
      of
      Vaseline
      on
      after
      washing
      my
      face.
      It
      has
      cut
      down
      on
      the
      ridiculously
      time
      consuming
      ritual
      (which
      I
      do
      miss)
      twice
      a
      day.
      It #8217;s
      not
      a
      permanent
      solution
      but
      a
      nice
      little
      break
      so
      that
      your
      products
      end
      up
      lasting
      longer.

      First
      of
      all
      I
      hate
      delivering
      to
      apartments
      because
      it #8217;s
      a
      multi
      step
      process
      from
      finding
      parking
      to
      entering
      a
      code,
      code
      not
      working
      so
      I
      call
      customer
      and
      they
      say
      it #8217;s
      fine
      and
      then
      I #8217;m
      like
      can
      you
      please
      buzz
      me
      in
      or
      come
      down,
      then
      of
      course
      we
      have
      the
      endless
      walks
      down
      long
      tedious
      hallways.
      Not
      all
      apartments
      are
      as
      complex
      as
      I #8217;ve
      described
      but
      oh
      for
      the
      love
      of
      god
      take
      pity
      on
      us
      drivers
      and
      come
      down
      to
      us.
      It
      also
      sucks
      more
      when
      I #8217;m
      delivering
      multiple
      orders
      and
      now
      those
      people
      have
      to
      wait
      an
      extra
      10
      minutes
      while
      I
      figure
      how
      to
      get
      to
      this
      persons
      door.

       #129315;
      sounds
      about
      right
      even
      in
      LA.
      I
      started
      freaking
      out
      when
      I
      thought
      the
      edible
      was
      rocketing
      me
      off
      to
      space
      but
      by
      the
      time
      I
      realized
      (I
      had
      clung
      onto
      my
      bar
      counter)
      I #8217;d
      already
      made
      a
      fool
      of
      myself.
      The
      neighbors
      had
      quite
      a
      good
      laugh
      over
      it
      smh.
      Stay
      safe
      too.

      of
      last

      My
      go
      to
      is
      usually
      popcorn
      by
      Magooch.
      It
      costs
      me
      $10
      and
      lasts
      me
      quite
      some
      time
      seeing
      as
      how
      I
      never
      take
      more
      that
      4-6
      popcorn
      at
      a
      time.
      But
      honestly
      anything
      by
      that
      company
      is
      bomb.
      I
      have
      their
      olive
      oil
      which
      is
      dope
      so
      now
      I
      can
      dose
      my
      food
      up
      anytime
      lol.
      I #8217;ve
      never
      been
      to
      a
      dispensary
      that
      rips
      people
      off.
      Prices
      are
      straightforward
      (at
      least
      where
      I
      go
      in
      the
      valley)
      and
      the
      bud
      tenders
      are
      super
      helpful.
      Ask
      questions
      and
      listen
      to
      them.
      Edibles
      are
      no
      joke
      so
      listen
      to
      our
      recommendations
      not
      to
      take
      more
      than
      10mg
      for
      your
      first
      time.
      From
      there
      you
      can
      increase
      after
      an
      hour
      or
      wait
      till
      the
      next
      day.
      Trust
      me,
      my
      first
      time
      that
      shit
      kicked
      in
      3
      hrs
      later
      and
      I
      could
      feel
      the
      blood
      moving
      in
      my
      body!

      I
      had
      a
      failing
      kidney
      when

      again.
      She

      laugh
      over
      that

      My
      first
      time
      with
      it
      I
      was
      being
      a
      Debbie
      Downer
      with
      my
      ex
      coz
      I
      had
      a
      massive
      migraine
      and
      wanted
      to
      sleep.
      This
      fool
      picked
      me
      up
      and
      took
      me
      to
      the
      kitchen
      and
      had
      set
      up
      3
      lines
      for
      me.
      He #8217;s
      like
      it #8217;s
      good
      for
      you.
      My
      dumbass
      took
      it
      and
      within
      30
      seconds
      my
      migraine
      (that
      usually
      lasts
      3
      days
      with
      legal
      medication)
      it
      was
      gone
      for
      good.
      And
      so
      there
      I
      was,
      Alice,
      going
      down
      the
      rabbit
      hole
      I #8217;d
      never
      want
      to
      leave.
      Any
      of
      y #8217;all
      experienced
      relief
      from
      coke?

      Just

      My

      I #8217;ve
      tried
      weed
      and
      I
      love
      it
      but
      it
      does
      not
      kill
      the
      pain
      unless
      I #8217;ve
      got
      alcohol
      to
      join
      in.
      I #8217;m
      glad
      you
      found
      an
      unconventional
      treatment
      that
      works
      for
      you.

      The
      strict
      apt
      rules
      are
      kinda
      why
      I
      started
      fucking
      with
      edibles
      full
      time.
      But
      when
      I
      got
      friends
      over
      we
      go
      over
      to
      the
      bathroom
      and
      smoke
      with
      the
      windows
      open
      and
      lights
      off
      and
      door
      closed.
      By
      morning
      there #8217;s
      no

      Omg
      definitely
      no.
      My
      mum
      used
      to
      cut
      off
      therapy
      sessions
      or
      not
      drive
      me
      coz
      she
      refused
      to
      pay
      despite
      it
      not
      being
      a
      financial
      strain.
      Take
      the
      phone
      call
      route
      all
      the
      way.
      I
      kind
      of
      miss
      weekly
      therapy
      just
      so
      I
      could
      talk
      freely
      with
      someone.
      Do
      what #8217;s
      right
      for
      you
      and
      perhaps
      your

      if
      he
      supports
      your
      mental
      health
      journey,
      could
      speak
      to
      your
      mum
      about
      coming
      up
      with
      a
      plan
      if
      cost
      is
      her
      only
      issue.

      I
      figured
      out
      the

      I
      think
      you
      should
      talk
      to
      a
      teacher.
      I
      went
      from
      being
      an
      honor
      student
      to
      straight
      F #8217;s
      in
      all
      classes.
      I #8217;d
      always
      be
      at
      school
      from
      5am
      to
      5pm
      but
      I
      stopped
      bothering
      with
      homework
      or
      tests
      (I
      chose
      to
      doodle).
      They
      noticed,
      they
      confronted
      me,
      I
      broke
      down
      and
      that
      was
      the
      beginning
      of
      getting
      help
      for
      all
      the
      issues
      that
      were
      ruining
      me.
      Don #8217;t
      look
      at
      it
      as
      being
      in
      trouble
      but
      confronting
      the
      issue.
      I
      went
      2
      months
      without
      going
      to
      school
      after
      but
      in
      the
      meantime
      I
      got
      the
      much
      needed
      reprieve
      from
      my
      hurting
      soul.

      Yes
      I
      did.
      That #8217;s
      only
      because
      my
      principal
      was
      very
      much
      invested
      in
      seeing
      me
      succeed
      and
      she
      knew
      about
      my
      depression
      and
      suicide
      attempts.
      She
      gave
      me
      six
      months
      to
      improve
      and
      even
      allowed
      me
      to
      take
      tests
      at
      home
      with
      a
      proctor
      whenever
      I
      got
      overwhelmed.
      Once
      she
      saw
      I
      was
      doing
      much
      better,
      she
      had
      all
      the
      F #8217;s
      from
      the
      previous
      year
      expunged
      and
      I
      went
      back
      on
      the
      honor
      list
      and
      I
      was
      even
      chosen
      to
      be
      valedictorian.
      Sometimes
      we
      need
      to
      ask
      for
      help
      otherwise
      our
      suffering
      might
      look
      like
      general
      laziness.

      I #8217;m

      off.
      It #8217;s
      funny
      how
      they
      never
      advertised
      it
      until
      you
      needed
      it.
      I
      know
      you
      too
      will
      bounce
      back.
      Make
      sure
      to
      take
      care
      of
      your
      well
      being.
      Sending

      to
      extricate
      myself
      from
      my
      parents
      to
      be
      put
      in
      a
      foster
      care.
      Either
      way
      it
      was
      like
      a
      huge
      weight
      off
      my
      shoulders.
      Be
      safe
      and
      I
      hope
      you
      take
      the
      steps
      needed
      to
      improve
      your
      situation
      whatever
      they
      might
      be.
      I #8217;m
      rooting
      for
      you.

      That #8217;s
      so
      silly,
      I
      love
      it.

      I #8217;ve
      dreamt
      of
      a

      agent
      who
      shot
      me
      dead
      point
      blank.
      Definitely
      woke
      me
      up.

      of

      they

      All

      as
      much
      as
      I #8217;ll
      venture

      take.
      I #8217;m

      Yes
      I
      agree
      with
      all
      the
      others
      advocating
      for
      leaving
      it
      in
      the
      sun.
      I
      almost
      threw
      mine
      away
      the
      first
      time
      I
      smelled
      the
      funk.
      I
      boiled
      it
      3
      whole
      times
      and
      nothing
      worked
      so
      I
      left
      it
      in
      the
      sun
      the
      next
      day
      and
      voila,
      stench
      be
      gone.
      It #8217;s
      a
      learning
      process.
      I
      make
      sure
      not
      to
      use
      a
      cup
      the
      last
      two
      days
      because
      the
      dead
      blood
      (brown)
      reeks
      so
      instead
      I #8217;ll
      use
      reusable
      pantyliners
      that
      I
      can
      change
      a
      few
      times
      during
      the
      day.
      I
      also
      avoid
      my
      Thinx
      panties
      during
      the
      last
      two
      days
      because
      I #8217;m
      paranoid
      people
      will
      smell
      it.
      I
      haven #8217;t
      tried
      the
      hydrogen
      peroxide
      but
      I #8217;m
      definitely
      putting
      that
      on
      my
      list.

      Most

      Strangely,
      some
      people
      get
      the
      brown
      blood
      the
      first

      or
      two

      Yes.
      I #8217;m
      not
      throwing
      out
      my
      perfectly
      wearable
      clothes.
      I
      accept
      I
      was
      misguided
      when
      I
      bought
      them
      and
      I #8217;ll
      bare
      the
      shame.
      Likewise
      I #8217;m
      not
      going
      to
      ditch
      my
      car
      because
      of
      the
      leather
      seats.
      We
      need
      to
      stop
      nitpicking
      each
      other
      and
      ourselves.
      The
      perfect
      vegan
      doesn #8217;t
      exist.
      You
      may
      find
      yourself
      on
      a
      plane
      upgraded
      to
      first
      class
      with
      comfy
      leather
      seats
      and
      what
      are
      you
      to
      do?
      Ask
      to
      be
      downgraded?
      There
      are
      items
      in
      your
      life
      that
      are
      unavoidable
      so
      we
      bare
      it
      and
      all
      we
      can
      do
      is
      ask
      the
      brands/companies
      to
      make
      cruelty
      versions.
      We
      don #8217;t
      shame
      each
      other.

      Don #8217;t
      hate

      Perhaps
      take
      the
      issue
      up
      with
      the

      I #8217;m
      about
      5
      days
      away
      and
      the
      cravings
      have
      come
      full
      force.
      I
      just
      came
      back
      from
      a
      Trader
      Joe #8217;s
      run
      with
      non

      ice
      cream,
      crabless
      crab
      cakes,
      miso
      ramen,
      and
      tortilla
      chips
      with
      guacamole.
      Quick,
      easy,
      and
      hits
      the
      spot.

      The
      crab
      cakes
      are
      amazing.
      I
      used
      to
      eat
      the
      meat
      variety
      so
      much
      back
      in
      the
      days
      and
      literally
      this
      version
      is
      just
      as
      good.
      It #8217;s
      made
      of
      jackfruit
      and
      I
      serve
      it
      up
      with
      avocado
      and/or
      salsa
      depending
      on
      my
      mood.
      It #8217;s
      one
      of
      my
      best
      switches
      honestly.
      Can #8217;t
      speak
      about
      Gardein
      though
      lol.

      I #8217;ve
      been
      there
      bud.
      My
      quick
      fix
      for
      that
      is
      to
      grab
      everything
       #8212;
      clean
      and
      dirty
       #8212;
      and
      shove
      it
      in
      my
      closet
      and
      close
      the
      door.
      The
      mess
      only
      exacerbates
      the
      depression
      and
      so
      I
      eliminate
      the
      mess.
      Out
      of
      sight,
      out
      of
      mind.

      Just

      was
      the
      last
      order
      before

      it
      made

      miss

      There #8217;s
      something
      mildly
      comforting
      about
      going
      to
      a
      busy
      bar
      alone.
      I
      enjoy
      going
      to
      a
      crowded
      one
      and
      listening
      to
      music
      in
      one
      ear
      and
      rest
      of
      the
      time
      just
      enjoying
      the
      buzzing
      of
      voices
      around
      me.
      It #8217;s
      funny
      people
      see
      me
      bumping
      around
      to
      music
      (long
      hair
      covering
      Airpod
      don #8217;t
      care)
      and
      strike
      up
      convos
      that
      I #8217;ll
      never
      remember
      lol.
      I
      end
      up
      ordering
      some
      greasy
      food
      and
      sharing
      it
      with
      the
      fellow
      drunks
      around
      me.
      Chaotic
      good.

      I #8217;ve
      survived
      my
      door
      being
      torn
      down
      for
      months
      and
      that
      was
      when
      I
      had
      a
      shit
      social
      worker
      who
      didn #8217;t
      wanna
      remove
      me
      from
      the
      home.
      I
      told
      her
      i
      started
      having
      panic
      attacks
      step
      dad
      would
      hurt
      me
      in
      my
      sleep
      and
      I
      was
      losing
      sleep.
      Door
      went
      back
      up
      immediately
      lol.
      Should #8217;ve
      used
      that
      shit
      excuse
      from
      the
      beginning.
      Play
      the
      game.
      Obvs
      mine
      is
      extreme
      but

      How
      old
      are
      you?
      If
      you
      are
      under
      18
      then
      hospitalization
      ain #8217;t
      all
      that
      bad.
      My
      first
      and
      only
      Halloween
      I
      spent
      in
      a
      psych
      ward,
      they
      even
      had
      little
      costumes
      we
      could
      pick.
      Ate
      lots
      of
      candy.
      Played
      lots
      of
      games.
      Watched
      lots
      of
      movies.
      If
      we
      were
      all
      good
      we
      got
      to
      dip
      our
      toes
      in
      the
      pool
      while
      coloring.
      Think
      of
      it
      as
      a
      mini
      vacation
      from
      this
      dreadfully
      bleak
      life.
      I
      can #8217;t
      speak
      for
      adult
      wards
      as
      I #8217;ve
      stayed
      under
      the
      radar
      since
      turning
      18.
      It #8217;s
      not
      all
      fun
      and
      games
      but
      it #8217;s
      a
      brief
      respite
      and
      you
      can
      have
      your
      meltdowns
      knowing
      mental
      health
      professionals
      are
      right
      there
      to
      deal
      with
      them.

      Date
      yourself
      first.
      I #8217;m
      definitely
      wife
      material
      I
      know
      it
      and
      lots
      of
      ex #8217;s
      have
      said
      it
      but
      like
      someone
      else
      mentioned
      not
      everybody
      is
      ready
      for
      that.
      So
      love
      yourself
      now.
      Go
      on
      and
      take
      your
      sexy
      ass
      to
      that
      movie
      and
      dinner.
      Your
      whole
      happiness
      cannot
      be
      rooted
      in
      being
      mated,
      be
      comfortable
      with
      yourself
      first
      and
      if
      someone
      comes
      along
      then
      that #8217;s
      cool.
      If
      not,
      then
      you
      won #8217;t
      be
      missing
      much
      coz
      you
      got
      yourself
      boo.
      Find
      a
      way
      to
      kill
      that
      loneliness
      that
      brings
      you
      joy.
      Reach
      out
      to
      us
      if
      it #8217;s
      overwhelming,
      we
      got
      you.

      It
      hurts
      like
      a
      bitch
      tryna
      wipe
      your
      ass
      with
      broken
      fingers.
      I
      wish
      someone
      had
      told
      me
      that
      before
      I
      pulled
      that
      shit.
      All
      will
      be
      well,
      maybe
      not
      now
      or
      tomorrow
      but
      one
      day
      you #8217;ll
      be
      smiling
      even
      as
      the
      world
      crumbles
      around
      you
      and
      nothing
      will
      matter
      but
      that
      happiness
      dripping
      from
      within.

      Sorry
      about
      your
      experience,
      guess
      you
      learnt
      never
      use
      your
      own
      money.
      Also,
      I
      never
      text
      the
      customer
      until
      I
      absolutely
      have
      to.
      I
      had
      one
      who
      forgot
      to
      order
      fries
      and
      asked
      me
      to
      pay
      and
      they #8217;ll
      give
      me
      cash.
      Hell
      to
      the
      no
      boy.
      I #8217;ll
      accept
      the
      no
      tip
      but
      I
      don #8217;t
      do
      favors
      for
      strangers
      that
      involve
      money.

      The
      amount
      of
      fear
      you
      feel
      is
      suffocating
      you.
      You

      giant
      strong

      and
      still

      up.
      Change
      your
      outlook
      on
      life
      coz
      it #8217;s
      so

      Not
      everyone
      is
      out
      to
      get
      you.
      Life
      is
      what
      you
      make
      it
      and
      if

      choose
      to
      cocoon
      yourself
      in
      that
      shell
      then
      you #8217;ll
      never
      be
      happy
      and
      get
      to
      experience
      life.
      Love
      yourself
      and
      all
      your
      imagined
      flaws.
      I #8217;m
      4 #8217;11
      and
      happy
      as
      a

      after
      years
      of
      self
      hate.
      As

      sit

      Go

      Oh
      my
      how
      thoughtful
      of
      you.
      I
      know
      if
      I
      go
      to
      big
      events
      where
      vegan
      options
      are
      not
      a
      guarantee
      I #8217;ll
      stuff
      my
      face
      beforehand
      to
      avoid
      the
      awkwardness
      of
      only
      having
      lettuce
      for
      dinner.
      With
      that
      said,
      the
      vegan
      pizza
      option
      sounds
      amazing.
      Honestly
      even
      if
      you
      order
      her
      a
      vegan
      pizza
      she #8217;ll
      be
      thrilled
      with
      you
      thinking
      about
      her
      on
      this
      day
      that
      should
      be
      all
      about
      you.
      Sending
      good
      vibes
      your
      way

      I #8217;ll
      do
      it
      if
      it #8217;s
      among
      the
      first
      orders
      of
      the
      night
      and
      also
      if
      across
      town
      is
      busy
      enough
      that
      I
      can
      hang
      around
      before
      heading
      back.
      I
      remember
      delivering
      pizza
      during
      rush
      hour
      traffic
      and
      it
      took
      me
      35
      minutes
      and
      the
      lady
      was
      waiting
      outside
      and
      she
      apologized
      profusely
      to
      have
      made
      me
      drive
      in
      traffic.
      She
      tipped
      well.
      It #8217;s
      no
      big
      deal
      for
      me
      and
      I
      appreciate
      people
      who
      understand
      the
      inconvenience
      but
      still
      want
      that
      craving
      sated.
      Thanks
      for
      your
      thoughtfulness.

      Yikes
      your
      mum
      sounds
      like
      a
      nightmare.
      You
      have
      your
      own
      money
      go
      ahead
      and
      buy
      some
      food.
      One
      of
      my
      fave
      quick
      yet
      hearty
      meals
      is
      a
      burrito
      filled
      with
      beans,
      avocado,
      salsa,
      and
      rice.
      Simple
      and
      filling.
      You
      are
      depriving
      your
      body
      of
      calories
      and
      that #8217;s
      a
      no
      no.
      I #8217;m
      sorry
      for
      your
      situation
      and
      hope
      you
      gain
      your
      independence
      soon.
      But
      until
      then
      eat,
      eat,
      eat.
      We
      don #8217;t
      want
      you
      passing
      out
      dear.

      I

      your
      own

      to
      provide
      for
      their
      families
      despite

      Heed
      our
      advice
      for

      meals.
      Nobody
      here
      is
      out
      to
      blame
      you.
      You
      went
      into
      this
      very
      unprepared
      but
      we
      believe
      in
      you.
      I

      Aw
      shucks
      I
      got
      a

      Yes

      doesn #8217;t
      help
      and
      mine
      is
      so
      bad
      I
      get
      infusions
      every
      so
      often
      so
      I #8217;m
      sure
      you
      understand
      my
      panic
      with
      excessive
      bleeding.
      I
      appreciate
      your

      you

      Sorry

      I
      can #8217;t
      honestly
      answer
      without
      wanting
      to
      lecture
      you.
      Hope
      you
      get

      I #8217;m
      so
      glad
      you
      had
      someone

      It #8217;s

      that
      I
      sometimes
      forget
      how
      powerful
      it
      is.
      It #8217;s
      mortifying
      and
      so
      scary
      being
      that
      helpless.
      I
      asked
      the
      ER
      doctor
      if
      I
      need
      to
      carry

      It #8217;s
      so
      weird
      I
      have
      suffered
      the
      past
      couple
      of
      years
      and
      finally
      tonight
      I
      decided
      I #8217;m
      okay.
      I
      became
      hypersexual
      after
      the
      incident
      and
      each
      and
      every
      guy
      hurt
      me
      by
      breaking
      my
      heart.
      I
      don #8217;t
      need
      non
      emotional
      sex
      to
      feel
      loved.
      I
      love
      me;
      I
      date
      myself;
      and
      most
      importantly,
      I
      love
      myself
      so
      Boy
      Bye.

      tip:

      lol
      girl
      knows

      Maybe
      they
      are
      restructuring
      the
      way
      they
      tip
      instead
      of
      holding
      on
      to
      tips
      for

      I

      suicide

      It
      breaks
      my
      heart
      coz
      it
      took
      me
      so
      long
      to
      finally
      be
      comfortable
      wearing
      short
      sleeves
      and
      these
      assholes
      don #8217;t
      even
      wanna
      know
      what #8217;s
      wrong
      with
      me
      just
      diagnosing
      from
      visuals
      only.
      The
      doc
      saw
      how
      upset
      I
      was
      and
      apologized
      profusely
      citing
      that
      paramedics
      can
      be
      ignorant
      jerks.
      I
      kinda
      wanna
      tattoo
      my
      arms
      but
      I
      was
      so
      proud
      of
      my
      battle
      scars
      until
      now.
      Sigh.
