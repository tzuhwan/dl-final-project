      I
      knew
      we
      were
      going
      to
      die
      when
      I
      clutched
      my
      three
      year
      old
      sister
      tightly
      as
      she
      screamed
      in
      utter
      terror,
      while
      we
      braced
      for
      the
      end.
      I
      knew
      we
      were
      going
      to
      die
      when
      I
      saw
      the
      lights
      spinning
      violently
      around
      me.
      I
      knew
      we
      were
      going
      to
      die
      when
      I
      heard
      the
      awful
      screeching
      sounds
      and
      the
      awful
      smell
      of
      burning
      and
      torn
      flesh
      afterwards.
      I
      knew
      we
      were
      going
      to
      die
      when
      I
      felt
      my
      head
      slam
      against
      hard
      leather
      for
      what
      felt
      like
      the
      millionth
      time
      as
      my
      sister
      dug
      her
      teeth
      into
      my
      arm.
      It
      wasn't
      her
      fault,
      though.
      It
      was
      an
      accident.
      There
      was
      no
      way
      my
      sister
      could
      have
      kept
      her
      head
      still
      with
      the
      force
      of
      the
      impact.
      I
      knew
      we
      were
      going
      to
      die
      when
      I
      let
      my
      drunk
      mother
      climb
      into
      the
      driver's
      seat.

      To:
      Ella
      Astra
      From:
      Lewandowski
      School
      of
      Science
      and
      Math
      Welcome
      to
      School!
      Today
      is
      your
      first
      day
      here
      and
      above
      all
      else,
      we
      would
      love
      to
      congratulate
      you
      on
      being
      accepted
      into
      such
      a
      prestigious
      school,
      Ms.
      Astra.
      Before
      you
      start
      anything,
      we
      would
      like
      to
      introduce
      you
      to
      our
      school
      rules.
      1.
      Currently,
      you
      are
      standing
      in
      the
      front
      office.
      On
      either
      side
      of
      the
      Welcome
      Desk,
      there
      are
      two
      doors.
      You
      are
      only
      permitted
      to
      use
      the
      left
      door.
      The
      right
      door
      will
      always
      be
      slightly
      opened
      but
      you
      are
      not,
      under
      any
      circumstance,
      to
      use
      the
      right
      door.
      2.
      We
      have
      a
      strict
      dress
      code
      to
      match
      our
      high
      standards
      here.
      Ladies
      are
      to
      wear
      skirts
      no
      shorter
      than
      two
      inches
      above
      the
      knee,
      and
      the
      collar
      of
      your
      shirt
      should
      not
      plunge.
      If
      you
      are
      to
      wear
      a
      sleeveless
      shirt
      or
      dress,
      the
      straps
      should
      be
      no
      thinner
      than
      two
      inches
      in
      width.
      You
      are
      not
      to
      wear
      open-toed
      shoes,
      nail
      polish,
      or
      makeup.
      3.
       #160;There
      will
      be
      absolutely
      no
      sexual
      activity
      on
      campus.
      4.
      There
      will
      be
      no
      cheating
      at
      all
      on
      anything.
      Failure
      to
      abide
      by
      this
      rule
      even
      once
      will
      result
      in
      immediate
      expulsion.
      5.
      You
      may
      notice
      that
      your
      shadow
      is
      missing.
      This
      means
      nothing.
      We
      ask
      that
      you
      do
      not
      make
      a
      big
      deal
      out
      of
      this.
      6.
      If
      you
      think
      you
      hear
      fake
      screams,
      you
      do
      not.
      It
      is
      all
      in
      your
      head,
      Ms.
      Astra.
      7.
      There
      will
      be
      no
      drug
      or
      alcohol
      use
      on
      campus.
      8.
      Sometimes,
      the
      lights
      shut
      off
      for
      a
      few
      minutes.
      This
      is
      only
      a
      technical
      malfunction.
      If
      your
      instructor
      is
      missing
      when
      the
      lights
      turn
      back
      on,
      do
      not
      fret.
      Lest
      you
      release
      the
      beas------
       #8226;We
      have
      a
      very
      diverse
      student
      body.
      We
      ask
      that
      you
      not
      be
      discriminatory
      toward
      any
      other
      student
      regardless
      of
      color,
      creed,
      sexuality,
      religion,
      or
      species.
       #8226;Please
      clean
      up
      after
      yourself
      when
      you
      have
      completed
      a
      meal.
      Make
      sure
      to
      either
      throw
      away
      your
      utensils
      in
      the
      provided
      bin,
      or
      disinfect
      them
      thoroughly.
      It
      would
      be
      unfortunate
      if
      one
      of
      them
      were
      to
      get
      your
      DNA
      off
      of
      a
      used
      fork.
       #8226;We
      would
      just
      like
      to
      emphasize
      that
      it
      is
      important
      for
      you
      to
      not
      go
      through
      the
      door
      at
      the
      right
      of
      the
      Welcome
      Desk.
      You
      must
      follow
      this
      rule
      for
      the
      sake
      of
      your
      physical
      and
      psychological
      health.
      Any
      accidents
      or
      injuries
      that
      occur
      are
      more
      than
      likely
      a
      direct
      result
      of
      your
      refusal
      to
      follow
      these
      school
      rules.
      Ergo,
      We
      are
      not
      liable
      for
      any
      injuries,
      accidents,
      or
      sudden
      deaths.
      We
      do
      hope
      you
      enjoy
      your
      stay
      here
      at
      the
      beautiful
      Lewandowski
      School
      of
      Science
      and
      Math.
      Everything
      will
      go
      smoothly
      as
      long
      as
      you
      abide
      by
      our
      rules.

      Mark

      Staying
      clean
      definitely
      isn't

      I
      don't
      usually
      catch
      people
      staring,
      and
      I
      don't
      think
      people
      sexualize
      me
      when
      I
      go
      braless.
      But
      that's
      probably
      because
      when
      I
      go
      braless,
      I
      wear
      a
      shirt
      or
      sweatshirt
      that
      will
      make
      it
      difficult
      to
      tell
      that
      I'm
      not
      wearing
      a
      bra.
      I
      know
      that
      personally,
      I'm
      not
      phased
      if
      I
      can
      ever
      tell
      that
      a
      girl
      isn't
      wearing
      a
      bra.

      I

      have
      been
      taken
      too

      I've

      I
      work
      in
      a
      pediatrician's
      office
      and
      I
      see
      a
      lot
      of
      young
      boys
      with
      infections
      underneath
      or
      around
      the
      foreskin.
      These
      infections
      would
      have
      been
      avoidable
      if
      they
      were
      circumcised
      as
      a
      child,
      and
      these
      boys
      usually
      end
      up
      needing
      a
      circumcision
      anyway.
      Infections
      like
      these
      are
      a
      lot
      more
      common
      than
      you
      might
      think.
      I
      see
      boys
      like
      this
      come
      in
      at
      least
      every
      other
      day
      if
      not
      everyday.
      I
      can
      understand
      why
      parents
      would
      want
      to
      take
      preventative
      action
      earlier,
      because
      recovery
      as
      an
      infant
      is
      a
      lot
      easier
      than
      recovery
      as
      a
      young
      child/teenager.

      Okay,
      if
      you
      hadn't
      have
      pulled
      out,
      I
      could
      see
      why
      that
      could
      have
      been
      rape
      by
      fraud/rape
      by
      deception.
      She
      consented
      to
      sex
      with
      a
      condom,
      not
      sex
      with
      a
      broken
      condom.
      If
      the
      condom
      just
      happened
      to
      break
      by
      accident,
      then
      you
      wouldn't
      be
      at
      fault
      for
      anything,
      but
      the
      fact
      that
      you
      knew
      the
      condom
      was
      faulty
      and
      you
      didn't
      tell
      her
      would
      probably
      be
      considered
      rape
      by
      deception.
      (Basically,
      she
      consented
      to
      sex
      under
      a
      certain
      condition,
      but
      you
      changed
      that
      condition
      without
      her
      knowledge)
      Since
      you
      _did_
      pull
      out
      before
      you
      came,
      I
      don't
      think
      it
      makes
      you
      a
      rapist.
      .
      .
      but
      it's
      not
      like
      what
      you
      did
      was
      okay.
      Tampering
      with
      your
      condom
      in
      the
      hopes
      that
      it
      would
      break
      and
      give
      _you_
      more
      pleasure
      is
      pretty
      fucking
      selfish.
      This
      escort
      doesn't
      know
      if
      you
      have
      any
      STDs
      and
      she's
      just
      trying
      to
      be
      safe.

      Yes,
      you

      it
      and

      This

      was

      you
      with
      her

      are

      When
      I
      was
      15,
      I
      Ghana
      to
      visit
      my
      family,
      and
      while
      I
      was
      there
      I
      went
      to
      go
      get
      my
      hair
      braided
      with
      my
      cousin.
      I
      have
      a
      really
      thick
      American
      accent
      so
      the
      girl
      braiding
      my
      hair
      assumed
      I
      couldn't
      speak
      Twi
      and
      said
      to
      her
      friend
      "This
      skinny
      American
      girl
      thinks
      she
      belongs
      here
      because
      she
      has
      dark
      skin."
      and
      they
      both
      started
      laughing.
      I
      was
      really
      mad
      and
      I
      really
      wanted
      to
      go
      off
      on
      her,
      but
      this
      lady
      was
      still
      doing
      my
      hair,
      so
      instead
      all
      I
      said
      was
      "I
      can
      understand
      you"
      in
      Twi.
      Later
      that
      day
      my
      cousin
      and
      I
      told
      my
      mom
      and
      aunt
      what
      happened
      and
      they
      both
      went
      over
      there
      and
      screamed
      at
      the
      girls,
      lmao.
      Their
      manager
      came
      out
      and
      apologized
      and
      said
      she
      would
      personally
      do
      our
      hair
      for
      free
      next
      time
      (as
      if
      I'm
      ever
      gonna
      go
      back
      to
      that
      salon)

      A
      good
      friend
      of
      mine
      who
      I'm
      technically
      not
      allowed
      to
      be
      in
      contact
      with.
      We
      were
      roomates
      in
      the
      psych
      ward
      on
      the
      eating
      disorder
      unit,
      ha.
      We
      were
      both
      pretty
      young
      at
      the
      time,
      but
      she
      was
      so
      wise
      and
      kind
      for
      her
      age.
      She'd
      been
      through
      way
      too
      much.
      Mental
      illness,
      violent
      rapes,
      physical
      and
      emotional
      abuse,
      drug
      addiction,
      etc.
      But
      she
      stood
      out
      to
      me
      because
      she
      was
      the
      only
      person
      there
      who
      had
      hope
      in
      the
      future.
      She
      didn't
      allow
      her
      past
      to
      define
      her
      then,
      and
      she
      still
      doesn't
      now.
      One
      night,
      I
      asked
      her
      why
      she
      chose
      to
      stay
      so
      hopeful
      and
      she
      said
      something
      along
      the
      lines
      of
      "I
      don't
      know,
      but
      I
      believe
      my
      hope
      will
      get
      me
      somewhere
      some
      day."
      She's
      still
      struggling
      today,
      but
      she's
      doing
      so
      much
      better
      than
      she
      was.
      I'm
      glad
      I
      met
      her.
      She
      was
      a
      light
      in
      my
      life
      during
      a
      really
      dark
      time.

      Yeah.
      When
      I
      was
      16
      or
      17
      I
      was
      at
      a
      four
      way
      stop.
      I
      had
      the
      right
      of
      way,
      but
      some
      drunk
      and
      speeding
      lady
      t-boned
      me
      and
      my
      SUV
      flipped
      over
      a
      few
      times
      until
      I
      was
      upside
      down.
      I
      screamed
      for
      help
      and
      no
      one
      came
      so
      I
      crawled
      out
      of
      my
      driver's
      window
      and
      when
      I
      got
      up
      there
      were
      like
      7
      people
      just
      standing
      there
      staring
      at
      the
      accident
      instead
      of
      helping
      me
      or
      the
      other
      lady
      who
      was
      stuck
      in
      her
      car
      with
      a
      child
      and
      injured
      a
      lot
      more
      severely
      than
      I
      was.
      No
      one
      even
      called
      911.

      Well
      for
      starters
      he
      was
      a
      Ginger.
      His
      face
      was
      a
      blotchy
      mess
      and
      wore
      too
      much
      black,
      and
      owned
      too
      many
      edgy
      graphic
      t-shirts.
      He
      was
      the
      epitome
      of
      r/iamverysmart.
      On
      his
      very
      first
      day,
      he
      made
      fun
      of
      some
      chick
      with
      old
      self-harm
      scars,
      but
      he
      always
      talked
      about
      how
      he
      loved
      to
      cut
      himself?
      Ginger
      was
      in
      my
      AP
      Physics
      class
      and
      whenever
      we
      had
      a
      test
      coming
      up
      he
      suddenly
      "went
      home
      sick"
      that
      day
       #128580;
      He
      was
      annoying,
      and
      he
      made
      me
      angry.
      There
      was
      a
      girl
      a
      year
      younger
      than
      us
      who
      died
      of
      leukemia,
      and
      most
      of
      my
      tiny
      high
      school
      went
      to
      the
      funeral.
      During
      the
      funeral,
      Ginger
      and
      his
      girlfriend
      (who
      used
      to
      be
      my
      best
      friend)
      went
      into
      the
      bathroom
      and
      fucked.
      They
      straight
      up
      left
      during
      the
      middle
      of
      a
      14
      y/o
      girl's
      funeral
      just
      so
      they
      could
      fuck.
      Ugh.
      He
      used
      to
      ask
      me
      and
      a
      bunch
      of
      other
      girls
      if
      we
      could
      be
      friend's
      with
      benefits.
      He
      went
      so
      far
      as
      to
      rubbing
      his
      body
      against
      mine
      after
      physics
      one
      day.
      I
      got
      angry,
      screamed
      at
      him,
      and
      shoved
      him
      against
      a
      wall.
      I
      got
      suspended
      for
      that
      ((:
      This
      was
      all
      going
      on
      while
      he
      had
      his
      girlfriend.
      I
      legitimately
      feel
      like
      he
      had
      NPD.
      He
      acted
      like
      everything
      he
      did
      was
      an
      accomplishment
      even
      if
      it
      legitimately
      wasn't.
      Something
      he
      always
      gloated
      about
      was
      the
      fact
      that
      he
      tried
      to
      kill
      himself
      twice.
      He
      always
      talked
      about
      how
      much
      sex
      he
      had
      with
      his
      gf,
      and
      he
      also
      always
      talked
      about
      how
      he
      was
      the
      best
      Christian
      he
      knew.
      (?????)
      Anyway,
      he
      and
      his
      gf
      ended
      up
      getting
      expelled
      for
      something.
      They
      broke
      up
      shortly
      after.
      I
      asked
      his
      ex-gf
      what
      happened
      but
      she
      seemed
      really
      shaken
      up
      and
      she
      wouldn't
      tell
      me
      anything.
      I
      was
      hanging
      out
      with
      his
      ex-gf
      and
      another
      friend
      one
      day,
      when
      all
      of
      a
      sudden,
      Ex-GF's
      mom
      gets
      a
      call
      from
      Ginger's
      mom,
      and
      the
      call
      is
      basically
      Ginger's
      mom
      _begging_
      Ex-GF's
      mom
      to
      let
      them
      date
      again.
      She
      was
      saying
      stuff
      like
      "Please,
      my
      son
      is
      _so_
      depressed.
      Please
      just
      let
      our
      kids
      date
      each
      other.
      We'll
      do
      anything"
      The
      whole
      situation
      was
      really
      disturbing.
      Also,
      before
      Ginger
      got
      expelled,
      we
      found
      a
      "Hit/Fuck"
      list
      in
      his
      locker.
      It
      was
      basically
      a
      bunch
      of
      girls
      and
      guys
      that
      he
      wanted
      to
      torture,
      kill,
      and
      then
      rape
      (in
      that
      order).
      I
      was
      on
      the
      list.
      His
      ex
      showed
      me
      some
      of
      her
      text
      messages
      with
      him
      and
      he
      talked
      a
      lot
      about
      hitting
      her
      during
      sex
      and
      shooting
      people.
      Everyone
      in
      my
      grade
      really
      thought
      he
      was
      gonna
      shoot
      up
      the
      school
      after
      that
      lmao.
      I'm
      glad
      I
      don't
      ever
      have
      to
      see
      him
      again.

      I'm
      really
      not
      a
      fan
      of
      abortion,
      but
      what
      the
      fuck?
      That's
      so
      terrible.
      This
      is
      oppression
      and
      misogyny.
      None
      of
      this
      was
      her
      fault
      and
      she
      should
      not
      be
      in
      jail.
      She
      wouldn't
      even
      _need_
      an
      abortion
      if
      her
      brother
      hadn't
      have
      raped
      her
      in
      the
      first
      place.
      Do
      you
      know
      if
      the
      brother
      was
      punished
      at
      all?
      Edit:
      I
      just
      looked
      it
      up
      and
      he
      was
      only
      given
      two
      years.
      .
      .
      he
      raped
      his
      sister
      8
      times
      in
      the
      last
      year
      and
      he
      was
      only
      given
      two
      years.
      .
      .
      I'm
      so
      disappointed.

      Nah,
      man.
      I
      just
      make
      sure
      I
      have
      at
      least
      4
      liters
      of
      water
      and
      my
      daily
      multivitamins
      over
      the
      weekend.
      It's
      tough,
      especially
      since
      a
      lot
      of
      social
      events
      and
      gatherings
      are
      based
      around
      food,
      but
      you
      get
      used
      to
      it
      eventually.

      Y'all.
      .
      .
      yesterday,
      I
      drove
      to
      chic
      fil
      a
      bc
      I
      forgot
      it
      was
      closed
      on

      so
      when
      I
      got
      there
      I
      got
      really
      disappointed
      and
      I
      sat
      in
      the
      parking
      lot
      and
      cried
      for
      2
      minutes
      bc
      I
      was
      really
      looking
      forward
      to
      chic
      fil
      a
      ):
      like
      I
      got
      out
      of
      bed
      and
      drove
      there
      any
      everything

      Seems
      like
      a
      good
      recipe,
      but
      it's
      definitely
      not
      the
      same
      recipe.
      It's
      missing
      the
      pickle
      brine.
      I
      get
      where
      you're
      coming
      from,
      like
      I'm
      openly
      queer
      myself,
      and
      I
      used
      to
      work
      at
      Chick-fil-a
      when
      I
      was
      16.
      I
      guess
      the
      views
      and
      actions
      of
      the
      higher-ups
      don't
      really
      bother
      me
      as
      much
      as
      they
      bother
      other
      people,
      so
      Imma
      still
      eat
      there
      when
      I
      can.

      Religion,
      and
      the
      private
      school
      was
      a
      lot
      smaller.
      The
      students
      generally
      behaved
      the
      same
      way,
      but
      the
      private
      school
      kids
      were
      better
      at
      hiding
      bad
      behavior.
      At
      the
      private
      school,
      everyone
      knew
      each
      other,
      so
      it
      was
      kind
      of
      hard
      to
      keep
      a
      secret
      there.
      I
      preferred
      private
      school,
      though.
      I
      liked
      how
      small
      it
      was.

      harm
      a

      Before

      It's

      I
      can
      do
      about

      bother
      me
      much.

      During
      volleyball
      practice
      one
      day,
      I
      and
      two
      other
      girls
      were
      hanging
      out
      by
      the
      water
      fountains.
      I
      had
      a
      water
      bottle
      with
      me
      that
      I
      put
      in
      the
      freezer
      the
      night
      before
      so
      it
      still
      had
      a
      big
      chunk
      of
      ice
      in
      it.
      One
      of
      the
      girls
      asked
      if
      she
      could
      have
      some
      of
      my
      water
      and
      I
      gave
      it
      to
      her.
      She
      water-fountained
      it,
      and
      as
      she
      was
      drinking,
      the
      ice
      chunk
      slipped
      into
      her
      throat
      and
      she
      made
      this
      really
      weird
      gagging
      sound.
      The
      gag
      is
      what
      killed
      me,
      tbh.
      .
      .
      like
      we
      couldn't
      stop
      laughing.
      After
      we
      calmed
      down
      a
      bit,
      the
      girl
      asked
      really
      timidly
      "Can
      I
      have
      the
      ice?"
      And
      then
      started
      to
      sucking
      on
      it.
      We
      started
      laughing
      really
      hard
      again.
      Honestly,
      that
      was
      one
      of
      the
      funniest
      things
      I've
      ever
      seen,
      but
      it
      doesnt
      sound
      as
      funny
      when
      I
      actually
      tell
      it.

      their

      record,

      in

      record
      that
      we
      keep
      in
      the
      office.
      I
      did
      all
      of
      those
      things.
      The
      girl
      who
      tried
      to
      get
      me
      fired
      whited
      out
      the
      Hep
      B
      vaccine
      information
      I
      wrote
      in
      the
      patient's
      appointment
      sheet
      and
      vaccine
      record,
      replaced
      it
      with
      the
      lot
      number
      for
      a
      saline
      solution,
      and
      then
      forged
      my
      initials
      next
      to
      the
      information.
       #128580;
      Luckily,
      her
      dumbass
      forgot
      about
      the
      seperate
      office
      record
      that
      we
      keep
      and
      that's
      how
      I
      was
      able
      to
      prove
      that
      I
      _did_
      give
      the
      right
      vaccine.
      She
      ended
      up
      getting
      fired
      instead
      of
      me.

      In
      high
      school
      there
      was
      this
      girl
      who
      used
      to
      get
      bullied
      online
      by
      our
      classmates.
      She
      would
      always
      block
      them,
      but
      they
      would
      make
      new
      accounts
      just
      to
      harrass
      her.
      They
      even
      went
      so
      far
      as
      to
      texting
      her
      number.

      I
      think
      you
      got
      downvoted
      because
      you
      tried
      to
      correct
      the
      "will
      never
      have"
      part.
      "Will
      have"
      is
      the
      future
      perfect
      tense
      of
      "will."
      For
      example,
      a
      sentence
      like
      "By
      the
      time
      it's
      night,
      I
      will
      have
      finished
      my
      homework"
      would
      be
      grammatically
      correct.

      he's

      This
      isn't
      unbelievable.
      My
      little
      brother
      is
      7
      and
      I
      could
      see
      him
      saying
      something
      like
      this.

      Swissco
      detangling
      brush.
      I
      got
      it
      from
      Target,
      and
      it
      works
      amazingly.
      I
      know
      for
      a
      fact
      that
      there
      are
      better
      detanglers
      out
      there
      (The
      Tangle
      Teezer,
      the
      Wet
      Brush,
      the
      Cricket
      Ultra
      Smooth
      Detangling
      Brush,
      etc.)
      It's
      a
      matter
      of
      finding
      a
      brush
      that
      works
      best
      for
      your
      daughter's
      hair
      type.
      For
      me,
      it
      helps
      when
      my
      hair
      is
      damp
      and
      I
      have
      a
      conditioner/detangler
      in
      my
      hair
      (SheaMoisture
      Raw
      Shea
      Butter
      Extra-Moisture
      Detangler
      is
      great.
      I
      definitely
      recommend
      trying
      it
      if
      you
      haven't
      already)

      YES!!!
      EXACTLY!!

      made

      Maybe
      I

      It
      doesn't
      really
      bother
      me
      as

      saying
      it
      is
      actually
      from
      Africa
      and
      has
      direct
      roots
      there.
      For

      I'm

      (born
      there,
      raised

      what
      I
      am
      I
      just

      "African."
      I
      do
      get
      a
      little
      annoyed
      when
      black

      say

      I
      stumbled
      across
      this
      sub
      while
      looking
      for
      r/confessions
      and
      I
      honestly
      wish
      I
      hadn't.
      Just
      reading
      the
      title
      hurts
      me
      to
      my
      soul,
      man.
      My
      older
      brother
      has
      severe
      autism
      and
      OCD
      and
      he
      has
      pretty
      violent
      tendencies.
      It
      got
      to
      a
      point
      where
      I
      had
      to
      start
      staying
      in
      hotels
      on
      the
      weekends
      because
      being
      near
      him
      was
      dangerous
      for
      me.
      He
      slammed
      my
      head
      into
      my
      dresser
      once
      because
      I
      turned
      off
      the
      fan
      in
      my
      room.
      Life
      was
      so
      difficult
      for
      me
      during
      that
      time.
      My
      brother
      hurt
      me
      a
      lot,
      but
      even
      though
      he
      did,
      he
      was
      still
      my
      brother
      and
      damn
      it
      I
      _love_
      him
      with
      my
      whole
      entire
      being.
      There
      have
      been
      times
      when
      my
      oldest
      brother
      or
      my
      dad
      had
      to
      be
      quite
      rough
      with
      my
      autistic
      brother
      to
      get
      him
      to
      stop
      attacking
      someone,
      but
      it
      was
      never
      uncontrolled,
      you
      know?
      If
      someone
      ever
      beat
      my
      brother
      the
      way
      you
      beat
      your
      nephew,
      I
      don't
      know
      what
      I'd
      do.
      Just
      thinking
      about
      it
      moves
      me
      to
      tears.
      .
      .
      There
      have
      been
      times
      where
      I've
      almost
      lost
      my
      brother
      and
      thinking
      of
      anything
      else
      bad
      happening
      to
      him
      is
      so
      frightening
      to
      me.
      I
      understand
      where
      you're
      coming
      from,
      though.
      I
      was
      a
      bitch
      to
      my
      brother.
      He
      was
      mean
      to
      me,
      but
      I
      was
      mean
      to
      him
      too.
      When
      I
      was
      younger
      I'd
      look
      for
      _any_
      reason
      to
      hit
      him
      or
      scream
      at
      him.
      I
      tried
      to
      justify
      it
      by
      telling
      myself
      that
      it
      was
      okay
      for
      me
      to
      hit
      him
      because
      I'm
      his
      little
      sister,
      he's
      nearly
      three
      times
      my
      size,
      and
      I'm
      physically
      weaker
      than
      him.
      It
      got
      to
      a
      point
      where
      even
      if
      I
      saw
      him
      glance
      at
      me
      I'd
      shove
      him.
      .
      .
      I
      feel
      terrible
      for
      how
      I
      acted
      towards
      my
      brother.
      It's
      been
      years
      since
      I've
      acted
      out
      like
      that,
      but
      the
      guilt
      has
      stayed
      with
      me.
      I've
      forgiven
      my
      brother
      because
      I
      know
      he
      doesn't
      fully
      comprehend
      his
      actions,
      but
      I
      can't
      forgive
      myself
      because
      I
      _could_
      comprehend
      what
      I
      did.
      Sometimes
      if
      my
      brother
      sees
      me
      approaching,
      he
      turns
      around
      quickly
      because
      he's
      anticipating
      aggression
      from
      me.
      That's
      what
      hurts
      me
      the
      most.
      .
      .
      the
      fact
      that
      I've
      made
      my
      brother
      uncomfortable
      around
      me.
      .
      I
      hope
      you're
      able
      to
      forgive
      your
      nephew
      and
      I
      also
      hope
      you
      get
      the
      opportunity
      to
      apologize
      to
      him.
      Best
      of
      luck.
      I'm
      gonna
      go
      watch
      cat
      videos
      or
      something
      to
      cheer
      myself
      up.

      It's
      not
      a
      matter
      of
      failing
      as
      a

      it's
      a
      matter
      of
      who
      your

      is.
      My
      parents
      tell

      that
      by
      the
      time
      my
      autistic
      brother
      was
      2,
      he
      was
      already
      unreasonably
      aggressive.
      The

      for
      you
      to
      do
      for
      your

      to
      grow
      with
      him
      and
      learn
      with
      him.
      Every
      autistic
      child
      is
      different.
      .
      .
      just
      try
      your
      best
      to
      be
      prepared
      for
      whatever
      comes
      your
      way.
      Always
      remember
      that
      you
      have
      options.

      "I

      about
      future
      generations"
      you
      say
      that
      as
      if
      identifying
      as
      a
      third
      gender
      is
      a
      recent
      fad.
      Evidence
      of
      certain
      cultures
      --Mediterranean,
      Indic,
      Mesopotamian,
      etc.--
      adopting/accepting
      the
      notion
      of
      a
      third
      gender
      dates
      back
      to
      BCE.
      The
      concept
      of
      a
      third

      is
      not
      a
      new
      thing,
      and
      in
      my
      opinion,
      it's
      not
      an
      irrational
      idea
      either.

      My
      dreams
      are
      always
      so
      weird
      and
      they
      make
      no
      sense.
      Like
      last
      night
      I
      had
      a
      dream
      that
      I
      was
      at
      my
      friend's
      house
      and
      we
      were
      all
      eating
      ketchup
      and
      mayo
      sandwiches
      and
      fangirling
      about
      a
      Backyardigans
      episode
      (???),
      and
      out
      of
      nowhere
      the
      fucking
      Unabomber
      came
      in
      and
      started
      shooting
      up
      the
      place.
      I
      escaped,
      but
      I
      left
      my
      ketchup
      and
      mayo
      sandwich
      at
      my
      friend's
      house
      so
      I
      went
      back
      to
      get
      it.
      When
      I
      got
      back
      to
      the
      house
      it
      was
      blown
      up.
      I
      started
      looking
      for
      my
      ketchup/mayo
      sandwich
      in
      the
      wreckage,
      but
      I
      couldn't
      find
      it
      so
      I
      started
      sobbing.
      .
      .
      like
      ugly
      snotty
      scream-crying.
      The
      Unabomber
      was
      nearby,
      but
      I
      really
      wanted
      a
      ketchup
      and
      mayo
      sandwich,
      so
      I
      picked
      up
      two
      slices
      of
      bread,
      ketchup,
      and
      mayo
      and
      started
      frantically
      making
      my
      sandwich
      on
      top
      of
      my
      best
      friend's
      dead
      body.
      The
      Unabomber
      came
      in,
      but
      I
      wasn't
      done
      making
      my
      sandwich,
      so
      I
      asked
      him
      to
      wait
      for
      me
      to
      finish
      making
      my
      sandwich
      and
      he
      did.
      I
      finished
      making
      it
      and
      then
      I
      ate
      it
      and
      then
      I
      told
      him
      that
      he
      could
      continue
      now
      and
      then
      he
      shot
      me
      and
      I
      woke
      up.
      I
      don't
      even
      like
      ketchup
      or
      mayonnaise.

      Pretty
      good,
      to
      be
      honest.
      I

      shopping

      my

      Someone
      insulted
      my
      autistic
      brother.
      I'm
      usually
      really
      passive,
      but
      I
      got
      uncharacterstically
      mad.
      This
      happened
      in
      the
      locker
      room
      after
      soccer
      practice.
      One
      of
      the
      girls
      said,
      "No
      offense,
      but
      do
      you
      ever
      think
      it'd
      be
      easier
      if
      your
      brother
      were
      put
      down?
      He's
      22,
      but
      he's
      not
      really,
      like,
      contributing
      much
      to
      society."
      I
      know
      she
      meant
      it
      as
      a
      joke
      because
      she
      made
      fucked
      up
      jokes
      all
      the
      time,
      but
      it
      really
      wasn't
      that
      funny.
      It
      took
      me
      a
      minute
      to
      register
      what
      she
      said,
      but
      once
      I
      did
      I
      went
      off;
      I
      was
      yelling,
      swearing,
      _and_
      crying.
      I
      could
      feel
      my
      heart
      beating
      through
      my
      head
      and
      hands.
      She
      started
      laughing,
      which
      made
      me
      even
      more
      angry,
      so
      I
      threw
      calculus
      book
      at
      her
      (I
      missed,
      ha).
      I
      yanked
      her
      pony
      tail
      so
      hard
      she
      fell
      backwards.
      I
      was
      honestly
      ready
      to
      fight
      this
      girl
      in
      just
      my
      bra
      and
      spandex,
      but
      our
      coach
      banged
      on
      the
      door
      and
      asked
      us
      what
      all
      the
      noise
      was
      about,
      so
      we
      had
      to
      calm
      down.
      I
      wanted
      to
      hit
      her
      so
      bad,
      but
      I
      couldn't
      so
      I
      punched
      a
      locker
      repeatedly
      until
      my
      hand
      was
      bruised,
      bloody,
      and
      swollen.
      (I
      think
      I
      did
      some
      serious
      damage
      to
      my
      knuckles.
      To
      this
      day,
      my
      knuckles
      start
      hurting
      if
      I
      write
      for
      over
      15
      min).
      Everyone
      just
      watched
      me
      vent
      out
      my
      anger.
      No
      one
      said
      anything.
      After
      that
      I
      put
      on
      a
      t-shirt
      and
      left.
      I
      didn't
      even
      put
      my
      sweats
      on
      over
      my
      spandex
      I
      just
      left.
      She
      texted
      me
      to
      apologize
      later
      that
      night.

      My
      eating
      disorder
      treatment
      was
      pretty
      bad.
      I
      was
      forced
      into
      the
      hospital
      and
      immediately
      I
      was

      to
      go
      from
      200
      calories
      every
      7
      days
      to
      3000
      calories
      a
      day.
      The
      stomach
      pain
      and
      nausea
      were
      excruciating
      and
      the
      fact
      that
      I
      had
      to
      keep
      eating
      through
      the
      pain
      made
      everything
      worse.

      Ever
      since
      getting
      into
      a
      really
      bad
      car
      accident
      with
      a
      drunk
      driver
      (my
      SUV
      flipped
      over
      2
      and
      a
      half
      times
      and
      it
      was
      completely
      totaled
       #128533;)
      I've
      been
      really
      scared
      of
      crossing
      all
      intersections
      that
      don't
      have
      stoplights.
      Just
      recently
      I
      crossed
      a
      busy
      intersection
      near
      my
      house
      and
      I
      was
      SUPER
      proud
      of
      myself.
      I'm
      still
      super
      anxious
      when
      I
      drive,
      but
      I'm
      a
      lot
      less
      anxious.
      Edit:
      Also,
      congrats
      on
      overcoming
      your
      stage
      fright!!

      Yeah.
      In
      high
      school
      I
      was
      at
      this
      super
      intense
      Coding/Engineering
      camp
      and
      I
      was
      in
      the
      robotics
      class.
      My
      class
      had
      22
      people
      in
      it
      and
      I
      was
      the
      only
      girl.
      I
      always
      got
      comments
      like
      "wow
      you're
      actually
      not
      bad
      for
      a
      girl"
      or
      "are
      you
      trying
      to
      impress
      someone
      with
      this?"
      or
      "do
      you
      actually
      know
      how
      to
      build
      and
      program
      or
      are
      you
      just
      here."
      It
      was
      just
      really
      annoying
      because
      you
      had
      to
      apply,
      be
      interviewed
      and
      then
      be
      accepted
      to
      get
      into
      the
      program,
      but
      everyone
      was
      treating
      me
      like
      a
      joke
      ):
      It
      was
      really
      discouraging,
      but
      I
      persevered
      and
      I
      left
      there
      knowing
      more
      about
      robots
      then
      I
      did
      before,
      so
      overall
      I
      guess
      it
      wasn't
      too
      bad.

      This

      true
      for
      every
      pizza
      I've
      ever
      had.
      Pizza
      is
      okay,
      but
      pizza
      crust
      is
      just
      too
      delicious.
      Sometimes
      I
      buy
      pizza
      just
      so
      I
      can
      cut
      the
      crust
      off
      the
      pizza
      and
      eat
      it.

      Um,

      no

      Yes,
      some

      are

      yes,

      but
      it's
      definitely
      not
      the
      majority.
      Life
      in

      isn't

      it's
      not
      because
      statistics
      are
      racist;
      it's

      it

      I
      can

      the

      banned
      crime

      1.
      I
      really
      don't
      think
      this
      is
      an
      unpopular
      opinion
      2.
      I'm
      gonna
      get
      downvoted
      to
      hell
      for
      this,
      but
      here
      we
      go.
      I'm
      black.
      I
      understand
      why
      the
      mods
      of
      BPT
      decided
      to
      ban
      white
      people.
      Am
      I
      saying
      it's
      right?
      No.
      It's
      terrible,
      but
      I
      get
      why
      they
      did
      it.
      I
      experience
      racism
      on
      an
      almost
      daily
      basis
      on
      the
      internet.
      It's
      exhausting.
      People
      always
      bring
      up
      crime
      statistics
      and
      incarceration
      rates
      as
      a
      way
      to
      justify
      blatant
      racism.
      .
      .
      honestly
      it's
      getting
      fucking
      old.
      I
      think
      the
      mods
      were
      trying
      to
      create
      a
      space
      where
      people
      could
      just
      be
      black
      without
      worrying
      about
      the
      thoughts
      and
      opinion
      of
      bigots
      or
      just
      ignorant
      people
      in
      general.
      I'm
      not
      going
      to
      lie,
      now
      that
      white
      people
      are
      banned
      from
      BPT,
      it
      feels
      like
      a
      safer
      space
      for
      me.
      Yesterday
      was
      the
      first
      time
      I
      didn't
      have
      to
      question
      whether
      the
      guy
      who
      commented
      "n*gga"
      was
      truly
      black.
      I
      understand
      why
      a
      lot
      of
      you
      guys
      are
      upset.
      I
      don't
      expect
      a
      person
      who
      is
      not
      a
      minority
      to
      understand
      the
      way
      we
      as
      a
      black
      community
      on
      Reddit
      feel,
      and
      I
      wouldn't
      expect
      them
      to
      support
      the
      decision
      either
      because
      I
      get
      why
      y'all
      are
      upset.
      What
      the
      mods
      did
      is
      infuriating
      and
      if
      I
      weren't
      black
      I'd
      probably
      be
      pissed
      the
      fuck
      off
      too.
      Anyway,
      I'm
      not
      trying
      to
      excuse
      the
      behavior,
      I'm
      just
      tryna
      give
      y'all
      a
      new
      perspective
      on
      the
      situation.
      Have
      a
      good
      night,
      y'all.
      Edit:
      Just
      wanted
      to
      say
      that
      yes,
      I
      also
      agree
      that
      asking
      people
      to
      apologize
      for
      their
      skin
      color--something
      they
      couldn't
      help--is
      really
      fucking
      off.

      Honestly,
      I
      haven't
      racism
      on
      Reddit
      because
      the
      community
      here
      is
      so
      kind,
      but
      on
      Youtube
      and
      Instagram
      and
      even
      when
      I
      used
      iFunny
      (ew)
      I
      would
      experience
      racism.
      On
      IG
      my
      PFP
      is
      my
      face,
      so
      people
      can
      see
      what
      my
      race
      is
      by
      that.
      On
      Youtube
      it's
      a
      little
      different.
      For
      some
      reason
      I
      always
      find
      myself
      watching
      videos
      of
      people
      fighting.
      If
      there
      is
      a
      black
      person
      in
      the
      video,
      there
      is
      always,
      ALWAYS
      a
      comment
      about
      how
      black
      people
      are
      savages
      and
      then
      they
      always
      bring
      up
      the
      infamous
      statistic
      (you
      know
      the
      one)
      to
      try
      to
      justify
      their
      racism
      l,
      and
      then
      when
      I
      reply
      saying
      that
      it's
      not
      fair
      to
      generalize
      all
      black
      people
      based
      on
      one
      video
      they
      always
      come
      back
      at
      me
      with
      something
      like,
      "if
      you
      negroes
      don't
      want
      to
      be
      hated
      then
      stop
      acting
      like
      monkeys"
      idk
      man.
      It's
      just
      really
      tiring
      at
      this
      point.

      I

      Shit
      that's
      why
      I
      loved
      my
      old
      church.
      We
      had
      a
      white
      pastor
      and
      he
      would
      always
      bring
      up
      this
      type
      of
      stuff.
      I
      remember
      when
      the
      shooting
      happened
      at
      the
      Pulse
      Nightclub,
      he
      donated
      our
      offering
      to
      LGBT+
      causes
      and
      charities.
      God
      bless
      that
      man.
      Imma
      miss
      him.

      My
      view.
      Feel
      free
      to
      downvote
      me:
      For
      me,
      the
      problem
      doesn't
      lie
      with
      white
      people
      wanting
      to
      say
      the
      N
      word.
      I
      don't
      care.
      I
      start
      to
      have
      an
      issue
      when
      white
      people
      start
      to
      feel
      _entitled_
      to
      say
      the
      N
      word.
      Like
      why
      do
      you
      have
      to
      make
      such
      a
      big
      deal
      about
      saying
      it?
      Just
      say
      it
      and
      go.
      I
      100%
      believe
      that
      white
      people
      saying
      the
      N
      word
      wouldn't
      be
      as
      big
      of
      a
      problem
      if
      so
      many
      white
      people
      didn't
      say
      shit
      like
      "But
      WHy
      cAN't
      I
      SaY
      It?11!1!"
      No
      one
      really
      cares
      as
      much
      when
      Hispanic
      people
      say
      the
      N
      word
      even
      though
      they're
      not
      black,
      and
      that's
      probably
      because
      they
      don't
      make
      it
      a
      huge
      thing.

      Nah,
      I
      have
      a
      really
      hard
      time
      believing
      that
      there
      are
      people
      who
      completely
      drain
      from
      society.
      I
      think
      we
      can
      learn
      and
      gain
      something
      from
      everyone,
      good
      or
      bad.
      I
      think
      it's
      really
      important
      to
      have
      a
      society
      that
      isn't
      only
      filled
      with
      able-bodied
      people
      or
      people
      in
      "the
      right
      state
      of
      mind"
      because
      w/o
      the
      diversity
      we
      have,
      we'd
      be
      seriously
      lacking
      in
      a
      sense
      of
      compassion,
      empathy,
      justice,
      punishment,
      etc.

      ???
      After
      my
      brother
      graduated
      college
      he
      stayed
      home
      with

      for
      a
      few
      years.

      in

      3rd
      year
      of

      and
      has

      Not
      everyone
      moves
      at
      the
      same
      pace.
      Some
      people
      need
      more

      than
      others
      and
      there's

      I
      know
      what
      sterilization
      is.
      Having
      a
      child
      whose
      parent
      is
      in
      prison
      or
      OD'ed
      could
      be
      good
      for
      society.
      They
      could
      help
      other
      kids
      who
      could
      be
      in
      the
      same
      situation
      as
      them
      and
      they
      would
      probably
      be
      more
      inclined
      to
      empathize
      with
      people
      who
      are
      having
      a
      really
      hard
      time.
      Same
      with
      people
      with
      genetic
      disabilities.
      I
      know
      and
      have
      worked
      with
      a
      lot
      of
      people
      with
      disabilities,
      and
      I've
      seen
      how
      compassionate
      they
      can
      be.
      I
      find
      that
      people
      who
      have
      struggled
      the
      most
      are
      the
      best
      at
      relating,
      so
      why
      shouldn't
      they
      share
      that
      care
      and
      empathy
      and
      knowledge
      with
      their
      children
      that
      they
      are
      100%
      entitled
      to
      have?
      Aside
      from
      the
      fact
      that
      forcing
      people
      who
      have
      disabilities
      or
      criminal
      records
      to
      be
      sterilized
      is
      a
      huge
      invasion
      of
      human
      rights,
      I
      just
      don't
      think
      sterilizing
      people
      who,
      in
      _your_
      opinion
      drain
      society
      is
      a
      good
      idea.
      My
      life
      would
      not
      be
      the
      way
      it
      is
      today
      if
      I
      didn't
      meet
      criminals
      or
      disabled
      people
      with
      children
      or
      children
      with
      dead
      parents.
      If
      all
      disabled
      people/criminals
      died
      off
      and
      were
      sterilized,
      society
      would
      feel
      no
      need
      to
      learn
      from
      them
      anymore.
      That's
      why
      we
      need
      their
      kids.
      To
      continue
      this
      cycle
      of
      compassion
      and
      love
      (I'm
      really
      starting
      to
      sound
      like
      a
      hippie
      I'm
      sorry)
      Maybe
      you
      don't
      see
      the
      good
      and
      profound
      impact
      on
      society
      that
      these
      people
      have,
      but
      I
      and
      a
      lot
      of
      other
      people
      do,
      and
      I
      firmly
      believe
      that
      people,
      disabled
      or
      not,
      criminal
      or
      not,
      should
      have
      children
      if
      they
      want
      to.
      It
      is
      their
      right.

      I
      agree
      it
      is
      a
      privilege,
      and
      there's
      nothing
      inherently
      wrong
      with
      that
      privilege.
      It's
      still
      okay
      if
      people
      who
      live
      with
      their
      parents
      haven't
      gone
      to
      college
      yet.
      Like
      I
      said,
      everyone
      moves
      at
      their
      own
      pace.
      The
      only
      reason
      why
      you
      think
      that
      adults
      still
      living
      with
      their
      parents
      makes
      them
      a
      failure
      is
      because
      society
      has
      told
      you
      that
      that
      is
      the
      case.
      Just
      because
      someone
      is
      21,
      hasn't
      gone
      to
      college,
      and
      is
      living
      with
      their
      parents,
      doesn't
      mean
      they
      can't
      be
      successful
      in
      the
      future.
      Some
      people
      just
      need
      a
      little
      more
      time.

      No
      problem.
      I

      Yes
      you're
      absolutely
      the
      asshole.
      And
      you
      think
      you
      were
      "helping?"
      go
      fuck
      yourself.
      You
      could
      have
      at
      least
      talked
      to
      her
      about
      it.
      You
      don't
      just
      switch
      out
      people's
      clothes
      without
      their
      knowledge.
      Becoming
      comfortable
      with
      one's
      own
      body-image
      is
      a
      hard
      and
      fragile
      process
      and
      needs
      to
      be
      treated
      delicately.
      What
      you
      did
      was
      immature
      and
      inconsiderate.
      Do
      better.

      First,
      I
      wanna
      say:
      Good
      luck
      on
      your
      play!
      If
      it's
      possible
      I
      would
      love
      to
      see
      it.
      My
      story:
      I
      started
      restricting
      in
      junior
      high.
      I
      was
      overweight
      by
      one
      BMI
      point.
      At
      this
      time
      in
      my
      life,
      I
      wasn't
      really
      dissatisfied
      with
      my
      body
      shape,
      just
      my
      weight.
      I
      always
      said,
      "if
      I
      could
      stay
      the
      same
      size,
      but
      be
      a
      normal
      weight
      then
      I'd
      be
      happy"
      So
      I
      started
      high
      restricting
      and
      I
      did
      lose
      weight,
      and
      then
      it
      began
      to
      become
      addictive.
      I
      wanted
      to
      see
      how
      much
      more
      weight
      I
      could
      lose.
      The
      purging
      didn't
      come
      in
      till
      a
      little
      later.
      My
      mom
      started
      suspecting
      something
      because
      I
      wouldn't
      eat
      for
      long
      periods
      of
      time
      then
      I
      would
      binge.
      She
      brought
      pizza
      in
      one
      evening,
      and
      I
      didn't
      want
      her
      to
      become
      anymore
      suspicious,
      so
      I
      ate
      it.
      I
      told
      myself,
      "fine
      I'll
      just
      eat
      it,
      then
      I'll
      throw
      up
      afterwards.
      I
      don't
      care
      anymore."
      So
      I
      ate
      my
      pizza
      and
      then
      I
      tried
      to
      purge,
      but
      nothing
      really
      happened.
      It
      wasn't
      until
      a
      few
      months
      later
      when
      I
      was
      actually
      successful
      at
      purging.
      Eventually
      it
      got
      to
      a
      point
      where
      I
      wouldn't
      eat
      for
      days
      in
      a
      row,
      so
      my
      mom
      took
      me
      to
      my
      doctor
      who
      said
      that
      she
      wanted
      me
      to
      get
      a
      psychiatric
      evaluation
      at
      the
      hospital.
      We
      went
      in.
      I
      only
      told
      them
      about
      the
      restriction
      and
      not
      the
      purging.
      I
      got
      put
      into
      PHP,
      but
      I
      wasn't
      making
      any
      progress,
      so
      I
      got
      sent
      inpatient.
      My
      mom
      was
      beyond
      pissed.
      She
      and
      my
      dad
      are
      immigrants
      from
      Ghana
      and
      she
      kept
      saying
      things
      like,
      "Some
      people
      don't
      even
      get
      to
      eat
      where
      we're
      from"
      and
      "you're
      being
      so
      selfish."
      She
      didn't
      understand
      because
      eating
      disorders
      weren't
      really
      a
      prevalent
      problem
      in
      Ghana.
      Anyway
      after
      inpatient
      I
      did
      PHP
      again,
      then
      IOP,
      then
      I
      was
      discharged
      and
      my
      family
      kinda
      forgot
      about
      my
      ED.
      I
      continued
      to
      engage
      in
      behaviors,
      though.
      In
      the
      summer
      of
      2018
      I
      would
      fast
      for
      2-3
      days
      then
      I
      would
      binge/purge
      then
      fast
      again.
      It
      went
      on
      like
      this
      for
      months.
      It
      got
      to
      a
      point
      where
      my
      toilet
      wouldn't
      flush
      anymore,
      so
      I
      had
      to
      purge
      in
      bags
      in
      my
      room.
      One
      day
      I
      got
      back
      from
      school
      and
      saw
      that
      my
      room
      was
      cleared
      out.
      Literally
      everything
      was
      gone.
      My
      vomit
      bags,
      my
      laxatives
      and
      diet
      pills,
      everything.
      Immediately
      I
      knew
      I
      was
      fucked
      lmao.
      My
      mom
      was
      r
      e
      a
      l
      l
      y
      mad
      this
      time.
      It
      just
      so
      happened
      that
      on
      this
      same
      day,
      I
      had
      an
      appointment
      with
      my
      psychiatrist.
      He
      made
      me
      go
      in
      for
      an
      evaluation.
      The
      counselor
      administering
      me
      eval
      called
      my
      psychiatrist,
      and
      my
      psych
      referred
      me
      to
      inpatient.
      I
      was
      there
      for
      31
      days.
      I
      ended
      up
      getting
      an
      NG
      tube
      (which
      was
      kinda
      awkward
      because
      the
      hospital
      where
      I
      got
      my
      NG
      tube
      is
      the
      same
      hospital
      where
      my
      parents
      work
      and
      the
      nurse
      who
      tubed
      me
      used
      to
      work
      under
      my
      father)
      eventually
      I
      got
      discharged
      again.
      I
      wasn't
      doing
      well,
      though.
      This
      time
      I
      wasn't
      even
      trying
      to
      hide
      my
      behaviors.
      This
      led
      to
      a
      3rd
      inpatient
      trip
      a
      few
      months
      later
      and
      then
      after
      that
      I
      did
      residential
      and
      then
      php
      again
      and
      tomorrow
      is
      going
      to
      be
      my
      first
      day
      of
      IOP.
      That's
      basically
      the
      story
      so
      far.
      (:
      Edit:
      thought
      it
      might
      be
      relevant
      to
      add
      that
      I
      was
      never
      underweight
      at
      any
      point.
      My
      highest
      BMI
      was
      28.3
      (this
      was
      before
      I
      even
      thought
      of
      restricting)
      and
      my
      lowest
      was
      19.6.
      They
      still
      made
      me
      do
      weight
      restoration
      until
      I
      reached
      a
      BMI
      of
      at
      least
      21.

      You're

      the

      here.
      Sometimes
      when
      we're
      having
      emotional
      days,
      we
      don't
      need
      to
      hear
      about
      DBT
      bullshit;
      a

      of
      us
      have
      already
      heard
      those
      things
      numerous
      times.
      Sometimes
      the
      best
      thing
      for
      us
      is
      for
      people
      to
      sympathize
      and
      tell
      us
      that
      yeah,
      our
      situation
      fucking
      sucked.
      Advice
      isn't
      always

      in
      church
      today
      with
      my
      good
      friend
      and
      we
      were
      chilling.
      .
      .
      Listening
      to
      the
      word
      of
      God
      and
      shit,
      and
      I
      was
      starting
      to
      think
      "wow
      this
      is
      a
      good
      message"
      and
      as
      SOON
      as
      I
      thought
      that,
      this
      youth
      pastor
      man
      says
      "Today
      is
      May
      1st.
      .
      .
      May
      is
      mental
      health
      month."
      And
      as
      soon
      as
      he
      said
      that
      I
      swear
      to
      God
      I
      knew
      he
      was
      about
      to
      say
      some
      ignorant
      shit.
      So
      he
      goes
      on
      this
      whole
      spiel
      about
      how
      this
      generation
      has
      a
      problem
      with
      mental
      health,
      and
      then
      he
      says
      "but,
      wait,
      guys.
      I
      had
      an
      epiphany
      about
      this"
      and
      he
      stays
      quiet
      for
      a
      whole
      ass
      30
      seconds
      and
      then
      he
      says,
      "MENTAL
      ILLNESS
      IS
      IN
      YOUR
      HEAD"
      and
      the
      fucking
      room
      started
      screaming
      "amen"
      and
      clapping
      like
      this
      man
      said
      the
      most
      brilliant
      thing
      on
      earth.
      Mental
      illness
      is
      in
      my
      head?
      M
      E
      N
      T
      A
      L
      illness??
      In
      my
      head???
      Who
      would
      have
      thought???
      And
      then
      he
      says,
      "the
      solution
      is
      easy.
      Because
      it's
      in
      your
      head,
      you
      just
      have
      to
      change
      your
      mindset,
      and
      then
      your
      mental
      illness
      will
      go
      away.
      Just
      focus
      more
      on
      God.
      The
      doctors
      try
      to
      give
      you
      all
      these
      pills,
      but
      they
      won't
      work.
      Only
      God
      works."
      At
      this
      point
      all
      the
      students
      are
      hollering
      and
      I'm
      just
      sitting
      there
      tryna
      act
      like
      I'm
      not
      bothered
      bc
      like.
      .
      .
      do
      you
      think
      I
      haven't
      _tried_
      changing
      my
      mindset?
      You
      think
      I
      haven't
      _tried_
      praying
      to
      God
      for
      hours?
      Smh.
      And
      then
      he
      says,
      "I'm
      telling
      you
      guys;
      God
      works.
      Do
      you
      know
      why
      you
      don't
      see
      many
      depressed
      Christian
      people?
      It's
      because
      God
      works."
      Um,
      really?
      Are
      you
      sure
      about
      that
      J.D.?
      Because
      if
      that's
      the
      case,
      please
      explain
      how
      and
      why
      Charles
      Spurgeon,
      an
      amazing
      Christian,
      was
      depressed
      until
      he
      died.
      ((((:
      Please
      explain
      yourself.
      After
      this
      he
      said
      that
      he
      knew
      God
      would
      work
      for
      us
      because
      it
      worked
      for
      him
      when
      it
      came
      to
      his
      own
      depression,
      but
      like.
      .
      .
      just
      because
      something
      works
      for
      you
      doesn't
      mean
      it's
      gonna
      work
      for
      everyone
      :/
      I
      feel
      like
      some
      people
      have
      a
      really
      hard
      time
      understanding
      that.
      Damn,
      I'm
      kinda
      frustrated
      rn.
      I've
      been
      around
      so
      many
      churches,
      looking
      for
      one
      where
      I
      can
      finally
      open
      up,
      and
      it
      sucks
      because
      it
      turns
      out
      that
      this
      one
      isn't
      the
      one
      :/

      I'm
      currently
      doing
      IOP
      after

      residential,
      and
      php
      a
      bunch
      of
      times.
      I'm
      seeing
      my
      therapist
      in
      a
      few
      days
      so
      hopefully
      that
      helps.
      .
      .
      It
      just
      sucks

      Um,
      of
      course???
      Do
      you
      even
      have
      to
      ask?
      Your
      anus
      and
      rectum
      are
      porous
      so
      the
      calories
      can
      seep
      through
      to
      your
      digestive
      track
      VERY
      quickly.
      It's
      like
      eating
      in
      reverse.

      Ah
      I
      feel
      that,
      but
      queen,
      I'm
      sure
      you're
      still
      beautiful
      no
      matter
      what
      your
      weight
      is.
      You've
      probably
      heard
      this
      a
      trillion
      times,
      but
      weight
      is
      not
      equivalent
      to
      your
      beauty
      or
      worth.
      Recovery
      is
      fucking
      hard
      cause
      oftentimes
      we
      gotta
      sacrifice
      what
      we
      view
      as
      an
      ideal
      body
      to
      get
      there,
      but
      the
      fact
      that
      you're
      still
      pushing
      through
      this
      even
      though
      it
      hurts
      and
      it
      sucks
      just
      proves
      how
      strong
      you
      are.
      I'm
      proud
      of
      you,

      You
      right.
      Back
      when
      I
      abused
      lax
      I
      didn't
      think
      this
      could
      happen
      to
      me,
      but
      the
      night
      before
      a
      13
      hour
      bus
      ride,
      I
      had
      taken
      lax,
      and
      yes,
      I
      shit
      my
      pants
      on
      the
      bus.
      On.
      The.
      Bus.
      The
      worst
      part
      is
      I
      didn't
      even
      stop
      taking
      lax
      after
      that.
      You
      would
      think
      that
      that
      would
      be
      enough
      of
      a
      wake
      up
      call.

      this
      American
      boy
      it
      is

      me
      but
      also
      i
      am
      feel
      so
      guilty.
      I
      feel
      extreme
      guilty
      as
      I
      begin
      orgasm.
      I

      so
      guilty
      that
      I

      up
      my
      telephone
      and
      call
      Mother
      in
      Russia.
      I
      awaken
      her.
      It

      late
      for
      stopping
      so
      I
      am

      upset
      and
      guilty
      and
      crying,
      so

      "I
      AM
      CUM
      FROM
      SEX"
      (in
      Russia).
      She

      boy,
      do
      not
      marry
      American

      ASS"
      and

      angry
      me.
      She
      not
      get
      scared
      though.
      I

      I

      why
      do
      I

      But
      I

      because
      when
      it
      spurt
      it
      feel
      very
      good
      in
      American
      ass.

      I
      appreciate
      your
      words,
      and
      I
      agree.
      I've
      found
      that
      meditation
      and
      yoga
      can
      actually
      be
      super
      beneficial
      for
      me.
      Of
      course
      I'm
      still
      seeing
      my
      therapist,
      dietitian,
      and
      psychiatrist
      on
      top
      of
      that,
      but
      the
      yoga
      is
      honestly
      really
      great
      for

      I'm
      at
      Disney
      World
      on
      senior
      trip
      with
      my
      best
      friends,
      and
      I've
      been
      fasting
      for
      a
      bit
      over
      24
      hours.
      There's
      been
      a
      lot
      of
      walking
      and
      I'm
      getting
      really
      dizzy
      and
      my
      hands
      are
      tingly
      and
      numb
      and
      I
      feel
      like
      I
      cant
      keep
      up
      with
      my
      group.
      Right
      now,
      they're
      in
      line
      for
      a
      roller
      coaster,
      and
      I
      couldn't
      go
      on
      because
      I
      felt
      like
      I
      was
      going
      to
      pass
      the
      fuck
      out.
      I'm
      just
      pacing
      in
      the
      park
      right
      now
      so
      I
      can
      reach
      my
      step
      goal.
      I
      saw
      a
      funnel
      cake
      stand.
      I
      wanted
      to
      eat.
      My
      friends
      got
      pizza.
      I
      wanted
      to
      eat.
      They
      all
      got
      iced
      coffees.
      I
      wanted
      one.
      They're
      getting
      ice
      cream
      and
      churros
      later,
      and
      I
      fucking
      want
      some
      but
      this
      stupid
      disorder
      wont
      let
      me
      fucking
      eat.
      For
      fucks
      sake
      how
      is
      eating
      so
      hard?
      Like
      at
      this
      point,
      I'm
      not
      even
      hungry,
      but
      fuck,
      I
      wanna
      eat
      and
      cherish
      these
      last
      moments
      with
      my
      high
      school
      friends.
      We're
      having
      dinner
      as
      a
      class
      tonight,
      and
      I
      have
      no
      idea
      what
      I'm
      going
      to
      do.
      I
      dont
      want
      to
      eat,
      but
      everyone's
      going
      to
      be
      watching
      me.
      Fuck
      this
      sucks.

      Agreed.
      I
      hate
      the
      way
      mainstream
      media
      portrays
      autistic
      people.
      Every
      time
      I
      tell
      someone
      I
      have
      an
      autistic
      older
      brother
      they
      respond
      with
      smth
      like
      "he
      must
      be
      so
      talented."
      Someone
      at
      church
      said
      "what
      a
      blessing
      that
      is"
       #128580;
      Like
      what???
      My
      brother
      is
      23
      and
      he
      only
      recently
      learned
      his
      name;
      he
      doesn't
      even
      know
      mine.
      I
      love
      my
      brother
      to
      death,
      and
      it
      hurts
      me
      so
      much
      to
      see
      how
      hard
      life
      is
      for
      him,
      but
      it
      makes
      me
      angry
      when
      people
      assume
      that
      life
      is
      easier
      for
      him
      just
      because
      he's
      autistic.
      It's
      not.
      My
      brother
      is
      fucking
      suffering
      and
      I
      wish
      people
      would
      stop
      invalidating
      that.

      Issues
      with
      my
      TMJ.
      The
      slightest
      movement
      of
      my
      mouth
      made
      me
      want
      to
      rip
      my
      entire
      jaw
      off.
      I
      didnt
      eat
      for
      days.
      Even
      drinking
      supplemental
      shakes
      were
      so,
      so
      painful
      for
      me.
      The
      pain
      radiated
      from
      my
      TMJ
      to
      my
      ears,
      head,
      shoulders
      and
      left
      arm.
      Fucking
      crazy
      how
      painful
      a
      jaw
      problem
      can
      be.
      But
      I
      mean
      I
      lost
      weight
      so
      that
      was
      cool.

      Shit.

      played
      soccer

      was
      the

      stomped
      on
      my
      hand
      and
      broke
      my
      pinky.
      It
      wasn't
      a
      terrible
      fracture
      but
      it
      fucking

      a
      12
      year
      old
      to
      have
      his
      whole
      ass

      shattered.

      Right?
      First
      time
      I
      was
      in

      I
      saw

      getting

      shit
      beat
      out
      of
      him
      with
      metal
      sticks.
      I
      felt
      kinda
      bad
      for
      old
      dude.
      I
      feel
      like
      my
      uncle
      just
      says
      shit
      like
      this
      so
      he
      doesn't
      get
      himself
      too
      riled
      up
      over
      stolen
      goods
      ha.

      OH
      MY
      GOD
      IM
      SO
      EXCITED
      FOR
      YOU.
      I'm
      thinking
      meat
      will
      be
      hard
      to
      jump
      into.
      Since
      your
      body
      isn't
      use
      to
      it,
      it
      could
      have
      some
      unpleasant
      effects.
      Do
      you
      have
      peanut
      butter
      often?
      Because
      I
      love
      peanut
      butter.
      Eggs
      are
      pretty
      great
      when
      they're
      seasoned
      well
      and
      when
      they've
      got
      cheese
      on
      them.
      It's
      an
      acquired
      taste
      for
      some,
      but
      Greek
      yogurt
      is
      fucking
      great.
      Chobani
      and
      Dannon
      both
      make
      great
      flavors.
      I'm
      honestly
      really,
      really
      happy
      for
      you
      man.

      It
      was
      a
      small
      private
      Christian
      school.
      One
      English
      teacher
      would
      wear
      an
      apron
      and
      masturbate
      behind
      the
      podium
      during
      class.
      I've
      graduated
      now,
      but
      this
      happened
      when
      I
      was
      in
      5th
      grade.

      Last
      time
      I
      was
      inpatient
      I
      was
      there
      for
      a
      month.
      I
      was
      on
      a
      specialized
      unit
      (eating
      disorders
      and
      self-harm)
      but
      it's
      the
      same.
      Compliance
      is
      definitely
      what
      they're
      looking
      for.
      After
      my
      first
      5
      days
      I
      talked
      to
      my
      psychiatrist
      and
      I
      was
      like
      "If
      I
      eat
      100%
      and
      go
      to
      all
      the
      groups
      when
      are
      you
      going
      to
      let
      me
      leave?"
      and
      he
      told
      me
      that
      if
      I
      was
      _compliant_
      with
      the
      treatment
      I
      could
      expect
      to
      be
      gone
      in
      3
      days.
      I
      wasn't
      compliant
      for
      a
      while,
      though
      lmao.

      I
      don't
      think
      I'd
      have
      any
      advice
      to
      give
      him.
      Just
      some
      affirmations:
      Even
      though
      it's
      hard,
      keep
      on
      pushing
      because
      eventually
      you'll
      be
      successful
      and
      happy.
      I
      know
      you're
      scared
      you're
      going
      to
      turn
      out
      like
      you're
      abusive
      father,
      but
      if
      you
      stay
      on
      this
      track,
      you'll
      turn
      out
      to
      be
      the
      best
      father.

      love

      Well,
      what
      defines
      "real
      oppression?"
      I
      think
      that
      there
      are
      definitely
      different
      levels
      of
      oppression
      in
      different
      parts
      of
      the
      world.
      For
      example,
      a
      gay
      man
      in
      the
      Middle
      East
      will
      likely
      experience
      more
      oppression
      than
      a
      black
      man
      in
      the
      U.S.,
      but
      both
      still
      experience
      "real"
      oppression.
      "A
      person
      who
      drowns
      in
      7
      feet
      of
      water
      is
      just
      as
      dead
      as
      someone
      who
      drowns
      in
      20
      feet
      of
      water."

      I
      understand.
      I
      agree
      that
      black
      people
      aren't
      oppressed
      in
      terms
      of
      rights,
      but
      in
      terms
      of
      treatment
      I

      Hmmm.
      .
      .
      That's
      not
      necessarily
      what
      I'm
      talking
      about.
      I
      legitimately
      think
      that
      some
      groups
      of
      people
      are
      still
      at
      a
      systematic
      disadvantage
      in
      our
      country.
      I
      don't
      even
      think
      that
      the
      country
      is
      purposely
      trying
      to
      oppress
      these
      people
      either.
      I
      just
      think
      that
      it's
      been
      happening
      for
      so
      long,
      and
      we're
      all
      very
      used
      to
      it
      at
      this
      point,
      so
      it
      almost
      seems
      as
      if
      there's
      no
      problem
      because
      things
      HAVE
      been
      worse
      in
      the
      past.
      But
      just
      because
      they
      were
      worse
      in
      the
      past
      doesn't
      mean
      that
      they're
      okay
      today.

      really
      out
      here
      posting
      transphobic
      shit
      now?
      I

      Shoot
      your
      shot.
      I
      don't
      think
      leaving
      someone
      on
      seen
      really
      means
      anything.
      My
      friends
      and
      I
      do
      it
      to
      each
      other
      sometimes
      when
      we
      don't
      have
      anything
      else
      to
      say
      because
      just
      abruptly
      saying
      "bye"
      or
      "gtg"
      would
      be
      a
      bit
      strange,
      and
      also
      forcing
      a
      conversation
      just
      to
      let
      it
      trail
      off
      when
      neither
      person
      is
      that
      interested
      in
      it
      is
      awkward.
      Maybe
      that's
      the
      type
      of
      person
      she
      is.
      By
      not
      asking
      her,
      you
      could
      be
      missing
      out
      on
      a
      huge
      opportunity.

      Nah
      saying

      like
      "no

      trying

      pass
      as

      is
      transphobic
      and
      it's
      gross
      behavior.
      It's
      not
      like
      you're
      the
      only
      one.
      I
      see
      people
      putting
      "he"
      in
      quotes
      when
      referring
      to
      him
      as
      if
      he's
      not
      a
      boy.
      Smh.
      Y'all
      are
      yucky.
      Edit:
      and
      wtf
      is

      Hi,
      you
      seem
      like
      a
      nice
      guy.
      I've
      been
      really
      struggling
      through
      my
      recovery
      lately.
      I
      feel
      sick
      and
      tired
      and
      hopeless
      at
      this
      point,
      but
      recently
      I
      watched
      Justice
      League
      vs.
      The
      Fatal
      Five,
      and
      that
      made
      me
      really
      happy

      in

      occasionally
      and
      had
      laughs
      together.
      I
      always
      told/tell
      her
      how
      special
      her
      hugs

      So
      I
      received
      a
      letter
      from
      the
      job
      I
      recently
      did
      an
      interview
      for.
      This
      is
      it:
      **
      Congratulations
      on
      the
      job,
      we're
      happy
      you
      applied.
      Before
      you
      start
      here
      are
      some
      rules,
      guidelines,
      and
      tips.
      1.
      Here's
      a
      rule
      that's
      normal
      so
      that
      you
      don't
      think
      theres
      anything
      wrong
      2.
      Another
      normal
      rule
      3.
      Rule
      that's
      still
      normal,
      but
      slightly
      off
      4.
      If
      you
      see
      an
      Arab
      woman
      wearing
      a
      sombrero
      with
      7
      red
      balloons
      tied
      to
      it
      with
      one
      of
      those
      balloons
      being
      deflated
      and
      she's
      wearing
      a
      gothic
      style
      dress
      from
      12th
      century
      in
      France
      and
      she
      has
      a
      baby
      giraffe
      standing
      next
      to
      her
      AND
      she's
      doing
      the
      Blood
      gang
      sign,
      simply
      acknowledge
      her
      by
      nodding
      in
      her
      direction,
      turn
      around,
      you
      put
      your
      right
      foot
      in,
      you
      take
      your
      right
      foot
      out,
      you
      put
      your
      right
      foot
      in
      and
      you
      shake
      it
      all
      about,
      you
      do
      the
      hokey
      pokey
      and
      you
      turn
      yourself
      around,
      that's
      what
      it's
      all
      about.
      After
      you
      do
      all
      that,
      just
      run.
      Like
      straight
      book
      it,
      fam.
      5.
      Sometimes
      in
      the
      middle
      of
      the
      night,
      you'll
      see
      an
      old
      man
      in
      a
      cookie
      monster
      suit
      run
      past
      you.
      This
      is
      normal.
      That's
      just
      Richard.
      He's
      homeless.
      6.
      Sometimes
      in
      the
      middle
      of
      the
      night,
      really
      weird
      things
      will
      happen.
      This
      is
      not
      normal,
      but
      we'll
      say
      it
      is
      because
      it
      makes
      this
      letter
      sound
      more
      ominous
      7.
      Oh
      your
      mom'll
      probably
      die
      within
      the
      first
      week
      of
      this
      job,
      but
      it's
      fine.
      That
      happens
      to
      most
      of
      us.
      8.
      Why
      are
      you
      still
      reading
      this?
      9.
      Like
      legit
      why
      are
      you
      reading
      this?
      Why

      I
      don't
      have
      a
      sub
      for
      you,
      but
      I
      just
      want
      to
      let
      you
      know
      that
      I
      empathize
      with
      your
      situation.
      My
      older
      brother
      is
      23
      and
      he's
      also
      autistic.
      Sometimes
      in
      the
      middle
      of
      the
      night,
      he
      would
      leave
      the
      house
      and
      we
      would
      have
      to
      call
      the
      police
      to
      find
      him.
      My
      parents
      fixed
      this
      by
      putting
      alarms
      on
      all
      the
      doors
      and
      locks
      that
      required
      passcodes
      to
      get
      through.
      Eventually
      my
      brother
      stopped
      trying
      to
      leave,
      fortunately.

      I'm
      not
      very
      religious
      anymore,
      but
      I
      loved
      the
      two
      churches
      I
      went
      to
      because
      the
      pastors
      were
      so
      sympathetic
      and
      understanding
      of
      the
      LGBTQ+
      community.
      On
      Sunday
      after
      the
      Pulse
      Nightclub
      shooting,
      pastor
      did
      a
      whole
      sermon
      on
      hatred
      and
      then
      collected
      an
      offering
      that
      he
      donated
      to
      the
      victims
      and
      their
      families.

      When

      my

      got
      this

      (she
      was
      a
      terrible
      person.
      She
      told
      my

      she
      developed
      breast

      because
      she

      that

      shouldnt
      go
      to
      a

      to
      come
      pray
      over
      me,
      and
      the
      whole
      time
      she
      was
      yell-praying,
      saying
      that
      the
      demon
      inside
      me
      was
      named
      Darren
      and

      put

      But.
      .
      .
      aren't
      all
      terms
      made
      up?
      Gender
      is
      a
      useful
      term,
      especially
      when
      you're
      referring
      to
      how
      someone
      chooses
      to
      identify/present
      themselves.
      The
      concept
      of
      one
      not
      presenting
      themselves
      in
      a
      way
      that
      typically
      aligns
      with
      their
      sex
      is
      not
      a
      new
      one.
      Maybe
      the
      way
      we
      use
      "gender"
      today
      is
      new,
      but
      it
      describes
      a
      phenomenon
      that
      has
      been
      going
      on
      for
      centuries.
      Gender
      and
      sex
      are
      not
      the
      same
      thing.
      This
      is
      a
      fact.
      Edit:
      stupid
      grammar
      shit.

      I'd
      have
      to
      disagree.
      I
      think
      there's
      a
      difference
      between
      a
      feminine
      man
      and
      a
      transgender
      woman.
      One
      identifies
      as
      a
      man
      and
      one
      identifies
      as
      a
      woman.
      If
      trans
      women
      were
      truly
      just
      "feminine
      men"
      what
      would
      be
      the
      purpose
      in
      fully
      transitioning?
      Why
      not
      just
      dress
      up
      as
      a
      woman?
      The
      fact
      of
      the
      matter
      is,
      the
      definition
      of
      gender
      is
      what
      it
      is.
      According
      to
      that
      definition,
      you
      CAN
      change
      from
      a
      man
      to
      a
      woman.
      Like
      that's
      honest-to-God
      just
      the
      definition
      of
      the
      word.
      We
      can't
      deny
      facts
      here.
      Just
      because
      you
      don't
      like
      a
      concept
      doesn't
      mean
      it's
      not
      factual.

      According
      to
      sex,
      yes,
      but
      your
      _gender_
      is
      your
      choice.

      No,
      it's
      not.
      Cross-dressing
      and
      being
      trans
      are
      not
      the
      same
      thing.
      Transgenderism
      stems
      from
      gender
      dysphoria.
      I
      was
      born
      female.
      I
      identify
      as
      a
      woman.
      Sometimes
      I
      wear
      men's
      clothes.
      People
      used
      to
      mistake
      me
      for
      a
      man,
      but
      I
      would
      always
      correct
      them
      because
      I
      identify
      as
      a
      woman.
      I
      have
      no
      desire
      to
      be
      a
      man.
      I
      just
      like
      how
      men's
      clothes
      look
      on
      me.
      People
      who
      are
      transgender
      were
      born
      in
      the
      wrong
      body.
      They
      don't
      feel
      comfortable
      with
      what
      they
      were
      assigned
      at
      birth.
      Like
      they've
      got
      some
      serious
      internal
      turmoil
      going
      on
      because
      there'sa
      disconnect
      between
      their
      sex
      and
      their
      gender.
      There's
      a
      difference
      between
      someone
      like
      me
      and
      a
      trans
      man
      wearing
      men's
      clothes.
      I
      wouldn't
      trip
      if
      someone
      called
      me
      a
      woman
      because
      I
      am,
      but
      trans
      men
      are
      not
      women.

      I
      see

      you're

      I
      guess
      in
      that
      case,
      gender
      is
      not
      a

      just
      who
      someone
      is,
      I
      suppose,
      but
      I
      do
      still
      think
      gender
      and
      sex
      can
      differ.

      the

      the

      This

      I
      don't
      know
      if
      you
      still
      need
      to
      hear
      this,
      but,
      FUCK,
      I
      was
      a
      bitch
      to
      my
      dad.
      Like
      I
      was
      terrible.
      I
      remember
      my
      Dad
      and
      I
      would
      have
      these
      really
      heated
      arguments
      (that
      I
      sould
      start)
      and
      he
      would
      try
      to
      stay
      calm,
      but
      I
      would
      keep
      getting
      intense,
      and
      then
      he'd
      just
      get
      sad
      and
      ask
      why
      I
      hated
      him
      so
      much.
      But
      I
      don't
      hate
      him.
      I
      never
      did.
      I
      was
      being
      stupid.
      At
      that
      time,
      when
      I
      was
      feeling
      some
      sort
      of
      stress
      or
      tension
      in
      my
      life,
      I
      would
      take
      it
      out
      on
      either
      myself
      or
      my
      parents
      because
      those
      are
      the
      people
      I'm
      the
      most
      comfortable
      with.
      Kids
      are
      constantly
      going
      through
      a
      lot.
      We're
      trying
      to
      navigate
      the
      through
      a
      world
      that
      seems
      so
      big,
      and
      it
      gets
      frustrating,
      so
      we
      lash
      out
      sometimes,
      but
      I
      promise
      there
      will
      come
      a
      time
      when
      your
      kids
      come
      to
      realize
      and
      respect
      all
      the
      love
      and
      attention
      you've
      given
      them.
      Swear
      to
      God
      your
      efforts
      won't
      go
      unnoticed.
      I'm
      the
      person
      I
      am
      today
      because
      of
      my
      Dad.
      Like
      I
      have
      no
      idea
      what
      I
      would
      do
      without
      it.
      I
      love
      him
      with
      my
      entire
      being
      and
      I
      would
      do
      anything
      for
      him,
      it
      took
      me
      a
      while
      to
      come
      around,
      but
      eventually,
      I
      did,
      and
      I'm
      sure
      you're
      kids
      will
      too.

      out
      here
      sneaking
      around
      to
      do
      the
      most
      innocent
      shit.

      Ever
      since
      my
      family
      found
      out
      about
      my
      ED,
      they've
      been
      so
      hypervigilant.
      2
      weeks
      ago,
      I
      had
      to
      take
      a
      shit
      after
      eating
      and
      my
      parents
      start
      banging
      on
      the
      door
      talkin
      bout
      some
      "WHY
      HAVE
      YOU
      BEEN
      IN
      THERE
      FOR
      SO
      LONG???"
      babe,
      I've
      been
      in
      here
      for
      3
      minutes?
      So
      I
      come
      out
      and
      my
      Dad
      was
      like
      "what
      were
      you
      doing"
      and
      I
      said
      "using
      the
      bathroom"
      and
      he
      said
      "you
      couldn't
      have
      gone
      before
      you
      went
      to
      eat?"
      And
      I
      was
      like
      "No.
      Sometimes
      I
      can
      only
      poop
      after
      I
      eat.
       #175;\_( #12484;)_/ #175;"
      and
      then
      he
      was
      like
      "you
      cant
      do
      that"
      IM
      SORRY
      WHAT??
      I
      cant
      do
      WHAT?
      I'm
      no
      longer
      allowed
      to
      take
      a
      shit???
      So
      I
      said
      "would
      you
      rather
      I
      just
      sat
      here
      for
      an
      hour
      with
      a
      stomach
      ache"
      and
      he
      said
      "I
      DON'T
      KNOW"
      and
      then
      I
      just
      left
      smh.
      There
      have
      been
      a
      lot
      of
      incidents
      like
      this,
      so
      to
      avoid
      conflict,
      I
      find
      myself
      being
      super
      sneaky
      and
      shady
      about
      every
      day
      things.
      Gotta
      change
      my
      tampon?
      Let
      me
      sneak
      ever-so-quietly
      up
      these
      creaky
      ass
      stairs
      and
      then
      oil
      the
      bathroom
      door
      hinge
      so
      no
      one
      hears
      me
      close
      it.
      Want
      a
      Hershey's
      kid
      before
      bed.
      Okay
      I'll
      just
      sneak
      downstairs
      at
      12
      AM
      and
      take
      one
      from
      the
      bag.
      Want
      an
      extra
      5
      chips
      after
      a
      meal?
      Lemme
      just
      fucking
      tiptoe
      off
      to
      the
      pantry
      and
      eat
      it
      in
      a
      corner
      so
      no
      one
      thinks
      I'm
      bingeing.
      Need
      to
      stretch?
      Let
      me
      twist
      around
      in
      this
      uncomfortable
      seated
      position
      so
      no
      one
      thinks
      I'm
      trying
      to
      exercise.
      Swear
      to
      God,
      my
      family
      always
      wants
      to
      find
      something
      wrong
      when
      there's
      nothing
      wrong
      UGH.
      "Why
      are
      you
      in
      the
      bathroom"
      BECAUSE
      IM
      USING
      THE
      FUCKING
      BATHROOM
      YOU
      ABSOLUTE
      THROAT
      ASS.
      Ffs.
      Why
      is
      it
      that
      when
      I'm
      not
      doing
      anything,
      everyone's
      worried,
      but
      when
      I'm
      actually
      purging
      4
      times
      a
      day,
      no
      one
      notices???
      How
      does
      that
      work????

      Yeh,
      I
      suppose
      you're
      right
      :/
      I'll
      try
      to
      be
      a
      little
      less
      cynical
      about
      the
      situation.
      Can't
      help
      but
      be
      a
      little
      pissy
      about
      it
      though.

      Exactly.
      .
      .
      the
      more
      they
      let
      me

      that
      they're
      watching
      me

      :/
      it's
      okay
      though.
      I'm
      moving
      out
      in
      like
      2
      weeks,
      so

      like
      this

      Hey,
      my
      situation
      sounds
      really
      similar
      to
      yours.
      My
      brother's
      23,
      pushing
      300
      lbs,
      and
      he's
      also
      autistic.
      I
      always
      tell
      people
      "he's
      got
      the
      mind
      of
      a
      violent
      22
      month
      old"
      he
      can't
      communicate
      very
      well.
      There
      have
      been
      times
      when
      I
      had
      to
      stay
      in
      hotel
      rooms
      for
      the
      weekend
      because
      of
      how
      violent
      my
      brother
      is.
      I've
      gone
      to
      the
      ER
      a
      few
      times,
      I
      felt
      similarly
      to
      how
      you've
      felt
      before.
      Like
      I
      did
      resent
      my
      brother
      for
      some
      time,
      but
      man,
      it's
      really
      not
      his
      fault.
      He
      can
      barely
      communicate
      and
      he's
      probably
      so
      frustrated
      with
      everything.
      I'd
      be
      pretty
      fucking
      mad
      too
      if
      I
      had
      to
      live
      in
      a
      world
      where
      no
      one
      could
      understand
      me.
      Poor
      kid
      can't
      even
      tell
      us
      when
      he's
      got
      a
      headache
      ):
      idk,
      like
      I
      really
      do
      understand
      how
      you
      feel,
      and
      I'm
      sorry
      that
      you're
      in
      that
      situation.
      It
      will
      get
      better,
      though.
      Eventually
      you
      won't
      have
      to
      live
      under
      the
      same
      roof
      as
      her
      and
      you'll
      be
      on
      your
      own.

      Not
      true.
      I'm
      not
      proud
      of
      this
      fact
      and
      I
      hate
      it
      so
      fucking
      much,
      but
      when
      my
      older
      brother
      (who
      is
      very
      similar
      to
      OPs
      sister)
      was
      growing
      up,
      my
      parents
      would
      be
      spank
      him
      after
      he
      had
      an
      outburst.
      Eventually
      they
      started
      doing
      it
      more
      often
      and
      it
      got
      to
      a
      point
      where
      it
      was
      borderline
      physical
      abuse
      (it
      probably
      was
      tbh)
      Since
      I
      had
      seen
      my
      parents
      hit
      my
      brother
      so
      often,
      I
      thought
      it
      was
      okay
      to
      do
      when
      my
      brother
      hit
      me.
      In
      fact,
      if
      my
      brother
      ever
      pinched
      me
      or
      bit
      me
      or
      something
      my
      parents
      would
      tell
      me
      to
      hit
      him
      on
      the
      head.
      It
      doesn't
      help
      anything.
      I
      think
      it
      just
      frustrated
      him
      more
      to
      be
      honest.
      He
      became
      even
      more
      violent.
      Our
      situation
      was
      monumentally
      worse.
      No
      one's
      hit
      him
      in
      years,
      and
      he's
      finally
      getting
      better.
      He's
      still
      hypervigilant
      and
      cautious,
      which
      tends
      to
      come
      out
      as
      violence,
      but
      that's
      only
      because
      the
      poor
      boy
      was
      traumatized
      ):
      Lots
      of
      people
      with
      autism
      don't
      work
      the
      same
      way
      neurotypical
      people
      do.
      Lots
      of
      them
      dont
      learn
      from
      consequences.
      Edit:
      my
      spelling
      was
      fucking
      whack
      I'm
      sorry.

      I
      know
      it
      doesnt
      look
      great.
      I
      do
      it
      to
      keep
      my
      hair
      out
      of
      my
      face.
      So,
      I
      dont
      really
      wear
      the
      style
      to
      formal
      events.

      My
      hair
      is
      too
      thick
      to
      gather
      into
      one
      bun/pony
      tail.
      Pulling
      it
      all
      up
      takes
      a
      lot
      more
      effort
      than
      just
      the
      front
      section.

      This
      is
      so
      upsetting.
      The
      doctor
      and
      the
      nurse
      acted
      completely
      unprofessionally
      and
      I'm
      really
      sorry
      you
      had
      to
      go
      through
      that,
      OP
