      Hpw
      many
      times
      will
      they
      waste
      a
      solid
      start
      from
      Miguel
      Gonzales?
      He's
      been
      good
      with
      the
      exception
      of
      his
      Texas
      start.
      And
      here's
      a
      tip
      for
      Robin:
      dont
      wait
      till
      they
      tie
      the
      game
      to
      make
      a
      move.
      You
      really
      gotta
      wonder
      how
      many
      times
      Robin
      will
      call
      Albers
      in
      to
      completely
      bomb.
      Its
      time
      for
      the
      management
      and
      fans
      alike
      to
      realize
      that
      this
      is
      a
      below
      average
      team
      that
      got
      a
      hot
      start
      because
      they
      were
      the
      only
      team
      fully
      healthy.
      Sure,
      defense
      is
      good
      but
      that
      only
      takes
      you
      so
      far.
      After
      three
      weeks
      of
      hearing
      that
      this
      is
      a
      "fluke"
      or
      "slump"
      the
      excuses
      need
      to
      end
      and
      they
      need
      to
      get
      real.
      There's
      three
      other
      teams
      in
      the
      division
      ready
      to
      compete
      for
      at
      the
      very
      least
      a
      wildcard
      spot.
      My
      only
      questions
      for
      the
      white
      sox
      at
      this
      point
      is
      when
      will
      Robin
      get
      fired?
      And,
      can
      Guillen
      manage
      again?

      I'm
      not
      trying
      to
      defend
      Robin
      by
      any
      means,
      and
      he
      certainly
      does
      need
      to
      go.
      However,
      It's
      somewhat
      on
      the
      players.
      You
      have
      to
      realize
      that
      the
      players
      are
      the
      ones
      performing
      like
      trash
      offensively
      and
      a
      few
      of
      the
      pitchers
      giving
      up
      way
      to
      many
      runs
      (Cough,
      cough,
      James
      Shields).
      It's
      not
      like
      it's
      robin
      out
      there
      hitting/pitching.
      I
      understand
      fully
      what
      the
      job
      of
      the
      coaches
      is,
      etc.
      A
      managers
      job
      really
      just
      depends
      on
      how
      well
      the
      players
      perform.
      Let's
      say,
      for
      instance,
      that
      the
      Cubs
      players
      weren't
      performing
      to
      par
      lately
      and
      it
      has
      made
      the
      team
      go
      under
      .500
      you
      bet
      your
      ass
      Joe
      Maddon
      would
      be
      on
      the
      hot
      seat
      like
      Robin
      is.
      If
      the
      Sox
      were
      performing
      like
      they
      were
      in
      April
      and
      a
      bit
      in
      May,
      there
      would
      be
      absolutely
      no
      talks
      of
      Robin
      being
      fired
      because
      the
      players
      (Namely,
      starter
      pitchers
      that
      aren't
      Sale,
      Quintana,
      and
      for
      the
      most
      part,
      Miguel
      Gonzales)
      are
      doing
      a
      great
      job
      and
      making
      Kenny,
      Robin
      and
      Don
      Cooper
      look
      good.
      I
      know
      how
      much
      a
      good
      coach/manager
      can
      improve
      a
      player.
      However,
      they're
      still
      not
      the
      ones
      performing
      like
      garbo.

      The
      white
      sox
      got
      a
      good
      little
      thing
      going
      right
      now
      called
      "Playing
      winning
      teams
      and
      winning"
      Really,
      that
      last
      series
      with
      the
      Indians
      could've
      gone
      either
      way
      with
      the
      exception
      of
      that
      shields
      start.
      Then
      you
      go
      into
      Boston
      and
      take
      3/4.
      And
      now
      with
      Sale
      on
      the
      bump
      tomorrow
      your
      figure
      you
      got
      a
      decent
      shot
      at
      taking
      the
      series
      with
      the
      Jays
      tomorrow.
      How
      do
      you
      guys
      feel?
      I'm
      still
      not
      exactly
      happy
      with
      the
      teams
      performance
      but
      hey,
      it
      seems
      like
      they're
      somewhat
      getting
      back
      on

      I
      see
      comments
      in
      this
      sub
      regarding
      the
      teams
      record
      and
      that
      dreadfull
      month
      and
      a
      half
      stretch
      of
      bad
      baseball.
      Keep
      in
      mind,
      the
      2006
      St.
      Louis
      Cardinals
      were
      only
      a
      few
      games
      above
      .500
      and
      they
      won
      it
      all
      that
      season.
      That
      being
      said,
      the
      team
      with
      the
      best
      record
      more
      often
      than
      not
      doesn't
      win
      the
      World
      Series.
      The
      2001
      Mariners
      are
      a
      perfect
      example.
      Just
      sit
      back,
      relax
      and
      watch
      the
      season
      unfold.
      Should
      be
      interesting
      the
      rest
      of
      the
      way.

      This

      I
      used

      Joe,
      real
      short

      married
      to
      the
      owner
      toms
      daughter
      who
      works
      at
      the
      same
      place
      as
      a
      waitress.
      I
      was
      a
      table
      busser
      and
      all
      of
      us
      were
      in
      the
      waitress
      station.
      Joe
      for
      whatever
      reason
      decides
      to
      start
      flipping
      the
      lights
      on
      an
      off
      really
      quick.
      Then,
      we
      hear
      some
      weird
      noise
      and
      the
      light
      wouldn't
      turn
      back
      on.
      I
      asked
      him
      "Do
      you
      think
      Tom's
      gonna
      make
      you
      pay
      for
      that"
      He
      replied
      in
      the
      most
      serious
      voice
      "I'm
      stuffing
      his
      daughter
      like
      a
      pig.
      Do
      you
      really
      think
      he'll
      really
      make
      me
      pay
      for
      it?".

      Hipster
      is
      tossed
      aroubd
      to
      much.
      In
      the
      same
      sense
      that
      literally
      doesn't
      mean
      literally
      anymore.
      All
      hipster
      means
      is
      to
      follow
      whats
      outside
      the
      current
      trends.
      So
      right
      now,
      at
      least
      in
      the
      united
      states,
      Rap
      and
      Pop
      music
      is
      the
      most
      popular.
      So,
      anything
      else
      can
      probably
      be
      enterpereted
      as
      hipster.

      I
      was
      at
      an
      Olive
      Garden
      with
      my
      mother,
      sister
      and
      grandmother.
      I
      was
      a
      littke
      kid
      at
      the
      time.
      The
      family
      who
      was
      causing
      a
      disturbance
      was
      literal
      white
      trash.
      The
      kids
      kept
      flicking
      pieces
      of
      food
      with
      their
      spoons
      accriss
      the
      dining
      area.
      The
      parebts
      weren't
      doing
      anything
      about
      it.
      So
      my
      grandmother
      finally
      turned
      around
      and
      said
      something
      after
      a
      puece
      if
      food
      hit
      her.
      The
      father
      got
      in
      my
      grandmothers
      face
      and
      in
      a
      really
      vad
      southerb
      draw
      says
      "Don't
      ya
      tell
      me
      how
      to
      raise
      my
      kids".
      My
      grandmother
      got
      a
      roubd
      if
      applause
      from
      the
      other
      diniers
      and
      the
      other
      family
      left.
      Pretty
      sure
      they
      didbt
      pay
      either.

      There's
      a
      few
      reasons.
      1:
      It
      removes/Moves
      pressure
      from
      the
      bottom
      of
      your
      feet,
      where
      there's
      pressure
      99
      percent
      of
      the
      time.
      Even
      when
      youre
      sitting.
      2:
      it
      helps
      keep
      your
      legs
      elevated
      above
      your
      heart
      which
      is
      really
      good
      for
      circulation.
      3:
      you're
      pretty
      much
      letting
      something
      else
      support
      you
      rather
      than
      you
      doing
      it
      yourself.

      be

      ..Not
      really
      much
      of
      an

      you're

      access
      blocked
      youtube
      videos

      as
      what
      service?
      People
      seem
      to
      like
      HideMyAss
      a

      None
      of

      are
      really
      all
      that
      different
      from

      another.
      There's
      another
      good
      one
      called....CyberGhost(?)

      pretty

      Thats
      actually
      a
      simaler
      reason
      why
      I
      fell
      for
      my
      first
      girlfriend
      and
      love
      at
      13.
      13
      year
      old
      me
      (7
      years
      ago)
      had
      developed
      insomnia.
      Which
      brought
      on
      anxiety
      and
      eventually
      depression.
      She
      was
      the
      only
      person
      who
      could
      make
      me
      crack
      a
      smile.
      So
      I
      just
      eanted
      to
      be
      with
      her
      24/7.
      I
      fell
      for
      her.
      We
      broke
      up
      mutually
      our
      sophmore
      year
      of
      highschool
      just
      because
      we
      got
      kinda
      bored
      of
      each
      other.

      The
      first
      friends
      I
      made
      was
      when
      I
      was
      15
      playing
      cod:
      black
      ops
      on
      the
      wii
      (2012).
      They
      all
      had
      mics
      except
      me.
      Because
      they
      were
      older
      and
      had
      jobs
      like,
      17
      or
      so.
      Not
      in
      contact
      with
      them
      anymore.
      I
      remember
      ones
      name
      was
      Aaron
      and
      the
      other
      was
      Allan.
      There
      was
      a
      chick,
      too
      but
      I
      forfet
      her
      name.

      I
      used
      to
      Buss
      tables
      at
      a
      small
      but
      fancy
      family
      restaurant.
      One
      of
      the
      waitresses
      filed
      a
      report
      against
      me
      for
      stealing
      her
      tips.
      Which,
      I
      did
      not
      do
      and
      no
      one
      but
      her
      thought
      I
      did
      it.
      Anyways,
      the
      law
      actually
      came
      to
      my
      helo
      because
      the
      officer
      told
      her
      that
      there
      was
      no
      real
      evidence
      to
      support
      her
      claims
      as
      A:
      no
      one
      witnessed
      it
      because
      it
      didn't
      happen.
      And
      B:
      there
      was
      no
      security
      cameras
      inside
      the
      restaurant.
      Anyways,
      I
      think
      the
      waitress
      has
      been
      spreading
      bad
      shit
      about
      me.
      Everyone
      thinks
      im
      some
      crook
      now.

      Take

      Tickets
      aren't

      Dodgers
      are
      the
      better
      team
      in
      LA
      but
      the
      Angels
      tickets
      might
      be
      cheaper
      because
      theyre
      not
      very
      good.
      Get
      some
      food
      while
      you're
      there.
      He'll
      have

      you
      can
      drink

      Chicago
      White
      Sox.
      Great
      team
      to
      follow.
      Currently
      1st
      in
      the
      AL
      central
      in
      a
      rebuilding
      year.
      The
      White
      sox
      have
      the
      #1
      prospect
      in
      all
      of
      baseball.
      The
      crosstown
      series
      with
      the
      cubs
      is
      always
      exciting
      to
      watch.
      The
      division
      theyre
      in
      is
      arguably
      the
      best
      in
      baseball
      with
      the
      Indians
      who
      went
      to
      the
      wrold
      series,
      the
      royals
      who
      won
      it
      two
      years
      ago,
      the
      twons
      who
      are
      also
      rebuilding
      but
      are
      good,
      and
      the
      togers
      who
      post
      a
      winning
      record
      almost
      every
      season.
      The
      White
      Sox
      have
      arguably
      the
      worst
      broadcaster
      in
      Hawk
      Harrelson
      but
      all
      of
      us
      Sox
      fans
      absolutely
      love
      the
      guy
      because
      he
      speaks
      his
      mind
      and
      is
      brutally
      honest.
      That,
      and
      everytime
      the
      team
      homers
      he
      yells
      "YOUUU
      CAANNN
      PUUUUTTT
      ITTT
      ONN
      THE
      BOOAARRDD,
      YEEESSS!!!!!"

      Typos,
      im

      Happiness
      above
      anything
      else.
      People
      commonly
      mistake
      your #8203;
      achievements,
      net-worth,
      material
      possesion,
      etc
      as
      success.
      But,
      if
      a
      poor
      person
      was
      happier
      his
      whole
      life
      than
      the
      rich
      person
      then
      I
      deem
      the
      poor
      person
      more
      successful
      in
      this
      twisted
      game
      we
      call
      life.

      I
      agree.
      But,
      what
      I
      mean
      is,
      I
      think
      it's
      more
      important
      in

      existence

      anything

      To

      poor,
      living
      in

      but,
      youre

      can
      possibly
      be
      then
      you're
      doung
      it
      right.

      First, #160;lighting
      occurs
      due
      to
      an
      accumulation
      of
      charge,
      electrons
      if
      you
      like,
      in
      the
      air. #160;As
      a
      storm
      grows,
      electrical
      charges
      build
      up
      in
      the
      clouds.
      At
      the
      same
      time,
      oppositely
      charged
      particles
      are
      growing
      in
      number
      on
      the
      Earth's
      surface.
      As
      you
      know
      opposite
      charges
      attract
      and
      due
      to
      the
      large
      number
      of
      charges
      this
      attraction
      grows
      quickly.
      At
      some
      point
      the
      attraction
      becomes
      large
      enough
      to
      overcome
      air's
      resistance
      to
      electrical
      flow,
      in
      this
      case
      the
      flow
      of
      charges
      between
      the
      ground
      and
      the
      clouds.
      These
      particles
      move
      toward
      each
      other
      at
      incredible
      speeds
      and
      when
      they
      meet
      they
      complete
      an
      electrical
      circuit.
      Charge
      from
      the
      ground
      then
      surges
      upward
      at
      nearly
      one-third
      the
      speed
      of
      light
      and
      we
      see
      a
      bright
      flash
      of
      lightning.
      Now
      to
      answer
      your
      final
      question, #160;the
      lightning
      starts
      at
      the
      ground
      and
      moves
      upward,
      it
      is
      just
      moving
      too
      fast
      to
      be
      able
      to
      tell
      this.
      If
      you
      have
      a
      stream
      of
      weakly
      charged
      particles
      moving
      through
      the
      air,
      sometimes
      the
      particles
      will
      split
      from
      each
      other
      trying
      to
      find
      the
      path
      of
      least
      resistance
      through
      the
      air.
      When
      this
      happens,
      branches
      will
      form
      and
      this
      is
      what
      people
      call
      branch
      or
      forked
      lightning.
      Now #160;does
      lightning
      only
      occur
      in
      storms? #160;I
      am
      not
      sure.
      I
      would
      think
      that
      lightning
      could
      occur
      any
      time
      there
      was
      enough
      charge
      built
      up
      in
      the
      clouds.
      However,
      I
      would
      guess
      that
      only
      during
      storms
      would
      this
      occur.

      I
      used
      to
      buss
      tables
      at
      a
      small-family
      owned
      restaurant.
      There
      were
      three
      bussers
      in
      a
      shift,
      one
      bar
      busser,
      one
      dining
      room
      busser,
      and
      one
      part
      room
      busser.
      I
      was
      the
      bar
      busser
      that
      evening.
      An
      elderly
      couple
      had
      come
      in.
      They
      sat
      at
      a
      table
      that
      is
      too
      close
      to
      the
      bar
      entrance.
      I
      thought
      I
      could
      squeeze
      between
      the
      entrance
      and
      the
      old
      ladies
      chair.
      Couldn't,
      tripped
      with
      a
      tray
      full
      of
      dirty
      dishes
      and
      sent
      salad
      down
      the
      sleeve
      of
      the
      poor
      womans
      jacket.

      I
      suppose,
      but
      at
      the
      same
      time
      Robertson
      just
      wasn't
      pitching
      all
      that
      well.
      Those
      bloops
      to
      the
      outfield
      were
      bullshit
      though.

      Wehn
      I
      was
      in
      kindergarten,
      some
      kid
      shit
      in
      a
      urinal.
      First
      day.
      They
      announced
      every
      morning
      after
      that
      to
      not
      shit
      in
      the
      urinal.
      My
      Junior
      year
      of
      highschool,
      a
      sophmore
      blew
      a
      freshman,
      said
      freshman
      recorded
      it
      and
      sent
      to
      a
      bunch
      of
      people.
      They
      got
      caught
      because
      it
      was
      sent
      to
      the
      parents
      of
      one
      of
      the
      original
      recipients.
      Both
      had
      to
      go
      to
      court
      or
      something.
      My
      senior
      year
      one
      of
      the
      weird
      socially
      awkward
      kids
      left
      a
      post
      in
      facebook
      that
      he
      was
      going
      to
      "Take
      care
      of
      the
      Hillbilly
      issue"
      since
      I
      live
      in
      indiana,
      there
      is
      infact
      a
      "Hillbilly
      issue".
      The
      next
      morning,
      schools
      delayed
      for
      2
      hours
      and
      none
      of
      us
      saw
      the
      kid
      again.

      was

      know

      for

      The

      had
      the
      best
      record
      in

      second
      half
      of
      the
      season
      of
      any
      team.
      They
      (I
      believe)
      had
      the
      lowest
      team
      ERA's
      in
      the
      second
      half.
      Definantly
      the
      strongest
      NL
      competition
      that
      year.

      My
      old
      appartments
      bedroom
      was
      very
      small
      so
      my
      bed
      was
      basically
      just
      left
      of
      the
      door.
      Like,
      immediatly
      left.
      So
      I
      "Wake
      up"
      one
      night,
      unable
      to
      controll
      my
      body,
      then
      I
      saw
      a
      dark,
      slim
      figure
      slowly
      open
      my
      door
      and
      stare
      at
      me
      for
      what
      felt
      like
      an
      eternity.
      It
      then
      hovered
      right
      above
      me
      as
      if
      it
      were
      going
      to
      strangle
      me
      and
      the
      figure
      whispered:
      "I
      know
      you're
      not
      asleep,
      Nick".
      Safe
      to
      say,
      I
      was
      about
      to
      piss
      my
      pants
      once
      I
      fully
      came
      to.

      Fun
      fact:
      The
      Bears
      defense
      has
      allowed
      two
      total
      touchdowns
      in
      October.
      In
      the
      last
      two
      games,
      following
      Jackson's
      historic
      scoring
      outing,
      they've
      scored
      three
      touchdowns.
      That
      is
      the
      most
      "Bears"
      statistic
      of
      all
      time.
      That
      is
      also
      a
      perfect
      representation
      of
      what
      this
      franchise
      is
      historically.

      Kinda
      just
      what
      you'd
      expect
      really.
      Me
      not
      wanting
      to
      play
      and
      them
      pressuring
      and
      constantly
      bothering
      me
      to
      play.
      Though
      I
      do
      love
      baseball
      now.
      And
      played
      it
      through
      HS.
      As
      a
      kid
      I
      was
      just
      scared
      of
      the
      ball.
      My
      stepfathers
      dad
      had
      made
      him
      play
      baseball
      as
      well.
      However,
      he
      co
      stantly
      expected
      from
      a
      child.
      Made
      my
      step
      dad
      hate
      sports
      forever.

      I
      was
      tempted
      at
      times
      but
      just
      didnt.

      Yeah.
      Thatd
      be
      the
      point.
      If
      its
      an
      unkown
      song,
      or
      just
      hasnt
      been
      played
      a
      whole
      lot
      and
      you
      feel
      someone
      would
      like
      it
      you
      should
      say
      "Whats
      a
      song
      that
      is
      relatively
      unknown
      that
      you
      think
      someone
      would
      like?"
      Edit:
      Unpopular
      means
      disliked
      by
      a
      majority.
      Unknown
      is
      that
      they
      have
      no
      opinion
      of
      it
      or
      just
      dont

      of
      its

      She
      said
      I
      pushed
      her
      into
      doing
      it
      because
      I
      didnt
      care
      about
      her
      feelings
      or
      spend
      time
      with
      her.
      When
      A:
      I
      work
      A
      LOT.
      She
      couldn't
      hold
      down
      a
      job
      our
      entire
      relationship.
      She
      was
      fired
      for
      stealing
      from
      the
      register
      of
      the
      Steak
      n'
      shake
      she
      worked
      at.
      Then
      quit
      two
      jobs
      because
      she
      cant
      handle
      people
      telling
      her
      what
      to
      do.
      We
      lived
      together
      too
      so
      i
      did
      spend
      a
      lot
      of
      time
      with
      her.
      B:
      I
      did
      care.
      I
      would
      ask
      her
      what
      was
      wrong.
      She
      would
      refuse.
      Id
      ask
      again
      knowing
      something
      was
      wrong.
      Shed
      refuse.
      Then
      she
      would
      say
      that
      I
      didnt
      try
      hard
      enough
      to
      find
      out
      what
      was
      wrong.
      C:
      She
      claimed
      I
      was
      disrespectful
      to
      her
      family.
      Which
      was
      the
      exact
      opposite.
      I
      was
      always
      respectful
      while
      then
      disrespected
      me.
      I
      had
      to
      ride
      with
      her
      grandparents
      for
      2
      hours
      the
      past
      thanks-giving
      since
      I
      had
      a
      flat
      tire.
      I
      asked
      them
      to
      at
      least
      roll
      down
      a
      window
      when
      they
      smoked
      because
      I
      have
      asthma.
      Did
      they?
      Yeah.
      When
      I
      was
      awake.
      I
      fell
      asleep
      and
      they
      hot
      boxed
      the
      fucking
      car
      with
      cig
      smoke.
      I
      got
      pneumonia
      not
      long
      after.
      Not
      aure
      if
      its
      related
      though.
      D:
      She
      was
      disrespectful
      to
      my
      family.
      Lied
      to
      my
      mother
      just
      because
      she
      didnt
      want
      to
      babysit
      my
      brother
      for
      a
      bit.
      Even
      though
      she
      said
      ahe
      would.
      She
      also
      reffered
      to
      my
      grandmother
      as
      a
      hag.

      If
      I
      remember
      correctly,
      the
      beach
      is

      The
      lagoon
      is
      denser

      water
      so
      the

      She
      said
      I
      pushed
      her
      into

      because
      I
      didnt

      or
      spend

      When
      A:
      I
      work
      A

      She
      couldn't
      hold
      down
      a
      job
      our
      entire
      relationship.
      She

      stealing
      from
      the
      register

      n'
      shake
      she
      worked
      at.
      Then
      quit
      two
      jobs
      because
      she
      cant
      handle
      people
      telling
      her
      what
      to
      do.
      We
      lived
      together
      too
      so
      i
      did
      spend
      a
      lot
      of
      time
      with
      her.
      B:
      I
      did
      care.
      I
      would
      ask
      her
      what
      was
      wrong.
      She
      would
      refuse.
      Id
      ask
      again
      knowing
      something
      was
      wrong.
      Shed
      refuse.
      Then
      she
      would
      say
      that
      I
      didnt
      try
      hard
      enough
      to
      find
      out
      what
      was
      wrong.
      C:
      She
      claimed
      I
      was
      disrespectful
      to
      her
      family.
      Which
      was
      the
      exact
      opposite.
      I
      was
      always
      respectful
      while
      then
      disrespected
      me.
      I
      had
      to
      ride
      with
      her
      grandparents
      for
      2
      hours
      the
      past
      thanks-giving
      since
      I
      had
      a
      flat
      tire.
      I
      asked
      them
      to
      at
      least
      roll
      down
      a
      window
      when
      they
      smoked
      because
      I
      have
      asthma.
      Did
      they?
      Yeah.
      When
      I
      was
      awake.
      I
      fell
      asleep
      and
      they
      hot
      boxed
      the
      fucking
      car
      with
      cig
      smoke.
      I
      got
      pneumonia
      not
      long
      after.
      Not
      aure
      if
      its
      related
      though.
      D:
      She
      was
      disrespectful
      to
      my
      family.
      Lied
      to
      my
      mother
      just
      because
      she
      didnt
      want
      to
      babysit
      my
      brother
      for
      a
      bit.
      Even
      though
      she
      said
      ahe
      would.
      She
      also
      reffered
      to
      my
      grandmother
      as
      a
      hag.

      Is
      a

      continent
      would
      be
      North

      Then
      there's
      people
      who
      say
      The

      As
      far
      as
      I
      know,
      NASA
      is
      severely
      underfunded
      and
      would
      rather
      discover
      things
      about
      Mars/other
      planets
      by
      sending
      rovers
      there.
      Opposed
      to
      blowing
      their
      budget
      on
      what
      is
      essentially
      a
      giant
      asteroid
      that's
      slowly
      being
      pulled
      towards
      us.

      I
      get
      this
      somewhat.
      Sometimes
      I'll
      see
      irrelevant
      glimpses
      of
      my
      future
      that
      hold
      no
      importance.
      Like
      i'll
      see
      myself
      doing
      something.
      I
      got
      it
      once
      when
      my
      5th
      grade
      teacher
      called
      me
      up
      infront
      of
      the
      class.
      I
      had
      a
      vision
      where
      it
      happened
      exactly
      the
      way
      it
      did

      It
      was
      sort
      of
      a
      feeling
      of
      deja
      vu
      but
      rather
      than
      doing
      something
      again,
      it
      was
      me
      doing
      something
      for
      the
      first
      time
      and
      feeling
      as
      if
      it
      were
      familiar.

      I

      to

      Ill

      Just
      got
      "let
      go
      of"
      for
      the
      first
      time
      ever.
      I
      was
      told
      I
      wasn't
      doing
      well
      in
      training
      after
      my
      first
      month
      there.
      Tbh,
      i
      think
      I
      got
      fucked
      over
      because
      I
      started
      the
      job,
      then
      immediatly
      got
      sick
      with
      the
      flu
      so
      I
      missed
      2
      weeks
      of
      my
      training.
      Of
      course
      I
      wouldn't
      "Be
      where
      they
      think
      I
      sould
      be".

      That's
      the
      thing
      though.
      I
      was
      legit
      sick,
      I
      even
      gave
      a
      doctors
      note
      and
      eveything.
      They
      trained
      someone
      else
      twice
      because
      he
      was
      a
      total
      dipshit.
      I
      feel
      slighted.
      Edit:
      I
      was
      even
      back
      for
      a
      week
      after
      the
      flu?
      So
      I
      def
      think
      I
      got
      fucked.

      suppose,
      but
      it's
      still
      a

      If
      I
      were

      I

      For
      me,
      this
      is
      the
      hardest
      division
      to
      judge.
      Cleveland
      has
      been
      on
      the
      downfall
      and
      has
      lost
      a
      few
      key
      parts
      to
      their
      2016
      WS
      run
      team
      but
      is
      arguably
      still
      the
      most
      talented
      in
      the
      division.
      Minnesota
      made
      the
      wildcard
      in
      2017,
      after
      narrowly
      missing
      in
      2016.
      Then
      took
      a
      step
      back
      in
      2018.
      Could
      this
      be
      the
      year
      that
      their
      rebuild
      comes
      together?
      The
      sox
      have
      plenty
      of
      young
      talent
      on
      their
      way
      to
      the
      majors,
      Eloy
      should
      come
      up
      possibly
      around
      may/june/before
      the
      all
      star
      break.
      With
      Moncada
      now
      n
      his
      second
      full
      year,
      this
      may
      be
      his
      break
      out
      year.
      I
      can
      see
      them
      being
      at
      or
      a
      few
      games
      above
      500.
      Only
      a
      few
      games
      above
      500
      may
      be
      enough
      to
      win
      the
      division.
      Not
      gonna
      bother
      to
      mention
      the
      royals
      or
      detroit
      since
      they're
      really
      really
      early
      in
      their
      rebuild.

      I

      it

      to
      the

      early/late
      Eloy
      gets

      thinking
      a
      20%

      the

      My
      girlfriend
      and
      I
      were
      fairly
      damaged
      from
      our
      past
      relationships.
      We
      had
      met
      online
      in
      january
      2018.
      Had
      great
      conversations,
      connected
      really
      well.
      Then
      we
      would
      bicker
      about
      the
      most
      ridiculous
      shit
      because
      we
      both
      still
      had
      our
      defenses
      raised
      stupidly
      high.
      For
      example,
      she's
      older
      than
      me
      At
      the
      time
      I
      was
      20,
      and
      she
      was
      26.
      Now
      Im
      21
      and
      she's
      27.
      She
      would
      refer
      to
      me
      as
      kid
      in
      a
      lighthearted
      manner
      in
      our
      conversations
      but
      I
      was
      so
      insecure
      about
      being
      younger,
      that
      ended
      up
      being
      something
      we
      bickered
      about.
      Stupid,
      right?
      That
      went
      on
      for
      a
      good
      month
      and
      we
      just
      stopped
      talking.
      A
      couple
      more
      months
      go
      by,
      we
      ended
      up
      matching
      on
      tinder
      again
      sometime
      in
      late
      may/early
      june
      2018.
      We
      lived
      an
      hour
      apart
      from
      eachother
      and
      had
      equally
      busy
      schedules
      but
      we
      still
      made
      time
      for
      one
      another.
      By
      Augist
      2nd
      we
      were
      officially
      dating.
      Fast
      forward
      to
      now,
      we're
      living
      together,
      happy
      as
      can
      be
      and
      have
      our
      first
      baby
      on
      the
      way.
      September
      9th
      can't
      come
      fast
      enough!
      I
      can
      honestly
      say
      that
      she
      is
      the
      love
      of
      my
      life
      and
      I'm
      confident
      i'm
      hers
      too.
      :)
      I
      wish
      you
      the
      best
      of
      luck,
      OP.
      Your
      insecurities
      will
      always
      get
      better.
      Just
      takes
      time,
      patience
      and
      the
      right
      person.

      Much,

      uou
      shouldn't

      you
      when
      he
      does

      Hope

      It

      she

      to

      then
      ex
      that
      she
      was

      And
      that,
      y'know,
      she
      openly
      discusses
      this
      shit
      with
      my
      girlfriend
      without

      even
      asking.
      So
      yeah,
      not
      my

      Damn.
      Sorry
      to
      hear
      that.
      Buut,
      I'm
      glad
      you're
      okay.
      Bankrupt
      on
      selling
      had
      the
      biggest
      effect
      on
      me,
      because
      I
      hit
      a
      financial
      low-point
      in
      november
      that
      had
      me
      sell
      a
      lot
      of
      my
      stuff.
      I
      know
      thats
      not
      what
      the
      songs
      means,
      but
      still.

      As
      of
      now?
      81-81
      as
      things
      currently
      are.
      This
      is
      a
      division
      that's
      features
      3
      rebuilding
      teams,
      two
      of
      which
      aren't

      not

      rebuild
      as
      the
      sox
      and
      a
      team
      that's
      probably
      going
      to
      blow
      it
      up
      if
      this
      season
      isn't
      great
      (Minnesota).
      If
      everything
      falls
      into
      place
      with
      Eloy
      early
      on
      and
      Jon
      Jay/,Yonder
      Alomzo
      have
      at

      average
      seasons.

      strikes
      out
      less/
      at
      least
      walks
      more
      then
      there's
      no
      reason
      this
      team
      can't
      produce
      well
      above
      your
      predicted
      70
      win
      mark.
      The
      rotation
      will
      get
      consostant
      throughout
      the
      year
      and
      I
      believe
      they'll
      really
      shine
      after
      the
      all
      star
      break.
      With
      all
      this
      being
      said,
      a
      lot
      has
      to
      go
      right
      and
      while
      a
      winning
      season
      is...perhaps
      a
      bit
      of
      a
      stretch
      I
      don't
      think
      it's
      impossoble.

      Actually,

      throw
      a

      it
      there
      a

      he
      threw
      it.

      This
      may
      not
      be
      fully
      accurare
      but
      im
      doing
      this
      by
      memory
      so
      lets
      see.
      The
      team
      (Or
      Rick
      Hahn)
      announces
      full
      rebuild
      mode
      after
      the
      strategy
      of
      signing
      old
      veterans
      as
      free
      agents
      then
      thinking
      "Heeeeeeyyy
      this
      guy
      doesn't
      perform
      like
      the
      back
      of
      his
      baseball
      card"
      after
      several
      attempts
      and
      failures.
      Since
      the
      team
      was
      in
      full
      rebuild
      mode,
      the
      fire
      sale
      started.
      Players
      of
      any
      value
      were
      sold
      one
      by
      one
      for
      hauls
      of
      prospects.
      Most
      notably,
      Chris
      Sale
      to
      Boston
      for
      Yoan
      Moncada/Michael
      Kopech/other
      prospects.
      Jose
      Quintana
      fto
      Cubs
      for
      Eloy
      Jimmenz/Other
      prospects.
      Adam
      Eaton
      to
      Nationals
      for
      Lucas
      Giolito/Reynaldo
      Lopez/Dane
      Dunning.
      The
      team
      started
      the
      year
      hot.
      Having
      first
      place
      until
      mid
      May
      of
      that
      year.
      Of
      course
      that
      went
      south
      very
      quickly
      and
      the
      team
      finished
      fourth.
      EDIT:
      I
      think
      Chris
      Sale
      cut
      up
      jerseys
      that
      year
      too?

      Na.
      Wasn't
      his
      fault.
      The
      company
      that
      sends
      us
      those
      used
      a
      really
      flimsy
      pallet
      on
      the
      bottom.
      And
      the
      way
      they
      come
      in
      is
      with
      another
      pallet
      of
      2
      litres
      with
      only
      a
      few
      on
      top
      of
      the
      cans.
      The
      bottom
      pallet
      snapped
      in
      two
      and
      the
      second
      fell
      when
      everything
      else
      did.
      Although,
      the
      store
      director
      there
      is
      notorious
      for
      putting
      things
      like
      paper
      towels
      on
      the
      bottom
      racks
      but
      heavy
      stuff
      like
      pop
      or
      water
      up
      the
      top
      of
      theracks.

      But
      thats

      here,
      I
      find
      more

      not
      players
      who
      are

      together
      often
      are
      usually
      around
      the
      same
      rank
      as
      they
      play
      often.
      I
      think
      parties
      like
      this
      are
      85%
      of
      the
      time
      are
      smurfing.

      enough
      their

      Yeah.
      In
      most
      cases.
      Newer
      Os's
      tend
      to
      have
      less
      background
      tasks
      which
      means
      less
      ram
      is
      ate
      unnesecarily.
      The
      only
      instance
      where
      i've
      seen
      newer
      OS's
      be
      a
      worse
      case
      for
      gaming
      is
      when
      you
      install
      pc
      games
      that
      were

      Fallout
      3
      is
      a
      weird
      one.
      It
      usues
      a
      launcher,
      which
      will
      work
      fine
      but
      the
      actual
      executable
      will
      crash.
      I
      had
      to
      dig
      deep
      in
      the
      steam
      message
      boarss
      to
      find
      out
      I
      needed
      a
      .dll
      (I
      think
      .dll?)
      file
      to
      replace
      the
      onr
      that
      was
      currently
      there
      to
      get
      rid
      of
      the
      games
      for
      windows
      live
      crap.
      GTA
      IV
      was
      different.
      Obviously,
      it
      was
      a
      shit
      port
      to
      begin
      with
      so
      tyat
      doesnt
      help
      much
      but
      it
      wouldn't
      load
      the
      game.
      It
      would
      just
      load
      infinantly
      until
      I
      tabbed
      out.
      So
      I
      had
      to
      go
      into
      the
      games
      files,
      remove
      thr
      GFWL
      crap
      and
      run
      it
      in
      compatability
      for
      windows
      vista
      along
      with
      putting
      %appdata%
      (I
      forget
      why)
      into
      a
      command
      on
      steam.

      On
      the
      contrary,
      certain
      brands
      of
      chicken
      (Namely
      tyson)
      load
      their
      chicken
      with
      estrogen
      which
      can
      lead
      to
      a

      female
      traits,
      and
      worstly
      gynecomastia
      which
      is,
      in
      most
      cases
      irreversable
      without

      This
      is
      true,
      but
      it
      does
      happen.
      Espescially
      since
      different
      people
      handle
      estrogen/testosterone
      differently
      which
      is
      why
      the
      artical
      states
      eating
      too
      much
      chicken.
      Not
      just
      eating
      it
      here
      and

      Yup.
      In
      a
      lot
      of
      cases
      when
      you
      see

      overweight
      men
      lose
      weight,
      they
      have
      gynecomastia.
      A
      lot
      of
      different
      foods
      can
      contribute
      to
      it
      too.
      In
      some
      cases
      its
      caused
      by
      a
      long
      sting
      of
      dietary
      choices
      that
      have
      estrogen
      .
      Its
      not
      just

      Breath

      that's
      not
      a

      Baseballs
      in

      a
      joke
      right
      now.
      What
      Miami
      should
      be
      is
      a
      competing
      team
      right
      bow
      but
      they
      traded
      their
      core
      for
      what
      was
      essentially
      as
      good
      as
      pocket
      lint.
      Wouldn't
      shock
      me
      that
      if
      in
      20
      years

      Im
      actually
      guessing
      that
      It
      looks
      like
      amtrack
      actually,
      judging
      by
      the
      cars
      it's
      pulling.
      I
      think
      it's
      an
      amtrack-esque
      paintjob.

      Yeah.
      It
      seems
      that
      there's
      always
      a
      heavy
      leanancy
      to
      GB
      jist
      because
      of
      Rogers.
      Sure
      the
      dudes
      a
      magician
      and
      can
      bail
      them
      out
      time
      and
      time
      again.
      But
      as
      we
      have
      all
      seen
      the
      past
      2
      years
      you
      need
      a
      complete
      team.
      The
      bears
      are
      one
      of
      the
      most
      complete
      teams
      in
      football.
      The
      packers
      are
      looking
      like
      3/4ths
      of
      a
      complete
      team
      right
      now.

      The
      only
      loss
      the
      bears
      really
      took
      is
      Adrian
      Amos
      going
      to
      GB
      and
      replacing
      him
      with
      Haha
      Clinton-Dix
      which
      is
      fine.
      Its
      not
      like
      clinton-dix
      is
      neccedadily
      a
      bad
      safety.
      He'll
      do

      Cordarrell

      (Is
      that
      how
      you
      spell
      his
      name?)
      is
      an
      upgrade.
      In
      my
      eyes
      Roquon
      Smith
      takes
      a
      leap
      forward
      and
      the
      defense
      is
      still
      one
      of
      the
      best
      in
      the
      NFL
      if
      not
      the
      best.
      With
      how
      tough
      this
      division
      is
      though
      I
      can
      ses
      3
      of
      the
      4
      teams
      taking
      it.
      Certainly
      has
      3
      playoff
      caliber
      teams.
      I
      don't
      believe
      in
      the

      Toughest
      in
      the
      nfl
      by
      a
      lot.
      If
      I
      had
      to
      bet,
      the
      top
      team
      in
      the
      division
      only
      wins
      11
      or
      so
      games
      because
      of
      how
      stacked
      the
      north
      is.
      Followed
      closely
      by
      a
      10
      win
      team
      and
      9
      win
      team
      in
      third.
      I
      think
      the
      lions
      are
      around
      .500
      at
      7-9.
      Maybe

      While
      that
      is
      true,
      thats
      kind
      of
      the
      point
      of
      the
      post.
      Fitz
      has
      been
      a
      journey
      man
      in
      the
      NFL.
      Mitch
      is
      a
      pro
      bowler.
      And
      as
      we
      all
      saw
      last
      year,
      Mitch
      made
      him
      look
      terrible.
      So
      IMO
      having
      hin
      the
      same
      rating
      as
      fitz
      and
      a
      point
      lower
      than
      Jameis
      is
      tragic.

      #1
      for
      a

      despite
      there
      being
      a
      lot
      more
      comments
      with
      thousands
      more
      upvotes.
      I
      believe
      reddits
      top
      comment
      is
      whats
      getting
      upvoted
      the
      fastest
      and
      nkt
      what
      has
      the
      most
      upvotes.
      Could
      be
      wrong
      but
      that's
      just
      my
      crack-pot
      theory.

      Poor

      the

      Does
      it
      make
      sense
      though?
      When
      you
      think
      about
      it,
      the
      bears
      have
      the
      third
      largest
      market
      in
      the
      league
      and
      the
      smallest
      stadium.
      It's
      hard
      to
      say
      that
      it
      currently
      has
      any
      historical
      significance
      consideering
      that
      it
      looks
      nothing
      like
      it
      used
      to.
      It
      was
      ecen
      removed
      as
      a
      landmark
      after
      the
      renovations.

      If
      you
      wanna
      get
      technical,
      that's
      LA
      memorial
      collesium
      but
      that'a
      never
      permanantly
      hosted
      an
      NFL
      team.
      Lambeu
      is
      a
      newer
      stadium
      than
      Soldier
      field
      but
      the
      pack
      has
      played
      there
      longer
      than
      the
      bears
      have
      played
      in
      soldier
      field.
      So
      after
      the
      rams
      and
      chargers
      share
      a
      stadium,
      Soldier
      field
      will
      be
      (And
      was)
      the
      oldest
      stadium.

      Ok.
      Well.
      First
      of
      all,
      I
      never

      that
      they

      Not
      neccesarily.
      There
      are
      cases
      where
      teams
      have
      built
      new
      stadiums
      right
      next
      to
      the
      old
      one.
      Look
      at
      what
      the
      white
      sox
      did.
      Look
      at
      what
      the
      patriots
      did.
      Look
      at
      what
      the
      Texas
      Rangers
      are
      doing.
      Look
      at
      what
      the
      giants/jets
      did.
      All
      of
      their
      stadiums
      were
      built
      right
      next
      to
      the
      old
      one
      without
      relocating
      the

      Is

      spot
      is
      Washington
      Park
      close

      Unfortunantly
      it's
      about
      an
      hour
      drive
      from
      our
      location
      in
      Lowell
      but
      well
      worth

      Did
      ROTC
      in
      highschool.
      Instructors

      us
      to
      the
      Air
      Force
      fitness
      test
      (Maybe
      it
      was

      this
      time
      specifically.
      They
      made
      us
      do

      but
      it
      was
      a

      and
      a
      half
      which
      I
      ran
      in
      7:45.
      After

      i
      had

      diahrea
      and
      vomiting

      The
      only
      way
      the
      team
      competes
      in
      2020
      is
      a
      big
      FA
      signing
      in
      the
      offseason
      and
      the
      rotation
      to
      shore
      up
      with
      continued
      improvement
      from
      Cease,
      if
      Giolito
      continues
      being
      dominant,
      Eloy
      improves
      his
      defense,
      Kopech
      returns
      from
      TJS
      to
      be
      atleast
      a
      decent
      pitcher,
      a
      good
      bullpen
      arm
      never
      hurts
      either.
      But
      that's
      a
      lot
      of
      ifs
      not
      whens
      and
      some
      ifs
      (like
      the
      big
      FA
      signing)
      are
      much
      larger
      than
      others.
      I
      mean
      c'mon.
      It's
      the
      sox.
      As
      much
      as
      I
      love
      this
      team,
      I
      know
      damn
      well
      we're
      historically
      inept
      at
      signing
      big
      name
      FA's
      during
      their
      prime.

      conservatives
      say
      that
      libs
      are
      the

      Doesn't

      you
      have
      to

      out
      on
      people
      on
      the

      ternet
      just

      never

      if

      or

      This

      why
      conservatives
      have
      such

      reputation
      instead
      of
      what
      they
      believe
      it
      is.
      Im

      liberals
      are
      any
      better

      What
      an
      insult.
      I'm
      fucking
      destroyed.
      Ill
      never
      come
      back
      from
      that
      one.
      You
      must
      be
      what,
      like,
      16?
      Come
      back
      once
      you
      figure
      out
      how
      the
      world
      works.

      My
      great
      uncle
      passed
      away
      today.
      My
      cousin
      made
      a
      post
      about
      it.
      While
      reading
      all
      the
      heartfelt
      comments
      on
      the
      post
      I
      was
      gonna
      sad
      react
      and
      move
      on
      with
      my
      day.
      Instead,
      as
      you
      can
      guess,
      I
      HAHA
      reacted
      my
      cousins
      post
      about
      his
      dad's
      (my
      great
      uncles)
      death.
      And
      left
      it
      like
      that
      for
      about
      8
      hours
      not
      knowing
      while
      I
      was
      running
      errands
      and
      hanging
      out
      with
      friends.
      People
      saw
      who
      it
      was
      and
      it
      was
      just
      me
      HAHA-ing
      the
      post,
      looking
      like
      a
      complete
      dick.
      Word
      spreads
      fast
      in
      my
      family.
      Which
      sometimes
      is
      a
      good
      thing,
      sometimes
      bad.
      In
      this
      case,
      it's
      very
      bad.
      So
      now
      I
      have
      several
      family
      members
      calling
      me
      disrespectful
      and
      to
      not
      attend
      the
      funeral
      since
      "I
      seem
      to
      think
      it's
      funny."
      My
      other
      cousin
      texts
      me
      (Great
      uncles
      grandchild)
      asking
      wtf
      is
      wrong
      with
      me.
      Then
      what
      do
      you
      know,
      right
      as
      I
      think
      it
      blew
      over
      I
      recieve
      a
      call
      from
      my
      mother
      having
      to
      explain
      that
      for
      what
      felt
      liks
      the
      thousandth
      time.
      Hopefully
      it
      blows
      over
      when
      the
      day
      of
      the
      funeral
      arrives.
      If
      not
      I
      get
      to
      feel
      the
      hot
      wash
      of
      shame
      and
      endure
      weird
      tension
      from
      family
      members
      who
      are
      already
      sad
      and
      touchy.
      TL;DR
      HAHA
      reacted
      to
      my
      cousins
      post
      about
      his
      dad
      dying
      (who'd
      be
      my
      great
      uncle)
      and
      had
      to
      explain
      it
      at
      least
      20
      times
      to
      various
      relatives.

      team
      as

      team
      of

      defense
      was
      statistically
      better.

      I
      would
      say
      it's
      just
      bad
      baseball
      by
      them
      this
      series.
      Not
      luck.
      Keep
      in
      mind
      that
      we
      got
      clobbered
      by
      the
      2nd
      place
      team
      in
      that
      division,
      the
      A's.
      We
      also
      were
      embarassed
      by
      the
      marlins
      3
      weeks
      ago.

      But
      none
      more
      mixed
      than
      diamond
      3.
      I
      genuinly
      think
      that
      champion
      should
      be
      a
      higher
      mmr
      level
      than
      what
      it
      currently
      is.
      Hightening
      the
      requirements
      to
      get
      there
      will
      help
      people
      stay
      there
      as
      this
      would
      make
      your
      teammates
      better
      at
      that
      rank
      too.
      Another
      rank
      would
      also
      make
      things
      more
      exact
      because
      theres
      more
      room
      for
      players
      to
      spread
      out
      too.
      But
      as
      you
      said,
      A
      mid
      c2
      is
      where
      the
      high
      level
      of
      gameplay
      starts
      and
      I
      feel
      that
      higher
      level
      should
      start
      at
      champion
      because
      after
      you
      all
      youre
      dubbed
      "Champion"
      So
      if
      you
      add
      a
      diamond
      4
      before
      hitting
      c1,
      c1
      then
      becomes
      the
      same
      mmr
      as
      what
      the
      current
      c2
      is
      so
      then
      the
      higher
      levels
      would
      beging
      as
      soon
      as
      you
      hit
      champion.

      The
      incident
      happened
      sometime
      in
      april
      but
      the
      news
      article
      is
      just
      now
      spreading
      in
      my
      area
      through
      people
      he
      and
      I
      both
      went
      to
      highschool
      with.
      His
      direct
      family
      kept
      it
      pretty
      hush
      hush
      so
      none
      of
      us
      knew.
      It's
      such
      a
      weird
      feeling
      that
      the
      fun
      guy
      I
      knew
      growing
      up
      and
      looked
      up
      to
      as
      a
      big
      brother
      type
      figure
      killed
      somebody.
      I
      never
      would've
      suspected
      him
      of
      doing
      such
      a
      thing.
      He
      seemed
      like
      he
      couldn't
      hurt
      a
      fly.
      What
      happened
      you
      may
      ask?
      He
      claimed
      to
      have
      a
      felony
      on
      his
      record
      so
      he
      had
      someone
      else
      buy
      him
      a
      gun.
      That
      somebody
      is
      apparantly
      on
      the
      spectrum.
      However,
      my
      cousin
      only
      had
      misdemeanors
      on
      his
      record.
      He
      shot
      somebody
      on
      a
      trail
      that
      he
      supposedly
      had
      beef
      with.
      The
      foot
      prints
      matched
      his
      shoes,
      and
      to
      my
      understanding,
      he
      had
      his
      victims
      clothes
      inside
      of
      his
      bedroom.
      The
      bullet
      wounds
      on
      the
      body
      had
      also
      matched
      the
      type
      of
      gun
      my
      cousin
      had
      obtained
      and
      left
      not
      far
      from
      where
      the
      crime
      had
      been
      commited.
      It's
      not
      determined
      that
      it's
      premediated
      but
      in
      all
      likelihood,
      it
      is.
      I
      have
      so
      many
      childhood
      memories
      with
      him.
      When
      I
      was
      12
      and
      he
      was
      about
      14,
      we
      would
      ride
      this
      purple
      little
      tikes
      car
      down
      a
      big
      ass
      hill
      towards
      traffick
      like
      a
      bunch
      of
      morons.
      But
      it
      was
      some
      of
      the
      most
      fun
      ive
      ever
      had.
      All
      the
      birthdays,
      sleepovers,
      family
      gatherings,
      etc
      are
      now
      kind
      of
      just
      strange
      feeling
      memories
      becausd
      of
      what
      I
      (and
      everyone
      else)
      knows
      now.
      Growing
      up,
      he
      was
      teoubled.
      He
      didn't
      always
      hang
      around
      the
      best
      psople
      and
      he
      didn't
      make
      the
      best
      choices.
      But
      a
      lot
      of
      people
      do
      that
      stuff
      and
      for
      the
      most
      part
      people
      turn
      out
      just
      fine.
      Nobody
      saw
      this
      coming.
      As
      of
      now,
      he
      is
      awaiting
      trial
      which
      will
      take
      place
      in
      september
      and
      I
      believe
      he
      is
      being
      held
      in
      a
      county
      jail
      without
      bond.

      The
      incident
      happened
      sometime
      in
      april
      but
      the
      news
      article
      is
      just
      now
      spreading
      in
      my
      area
      through
      people
      he
      and
      I
      both
      went
      to
      high
      school
      with.
      His
      direct
      family
      kept
      it
      pretty
      hush
      hush
      so
      none
      of
      us
      knew.
      It's
      such
      a
      weird
      feeling
      that
      the
      fun
      guy
      I
      knew
      growing
      up
      and
      looked
      up
      to
      as
      a
      big
      brother
      type
      figure
      killed
      somebody.
      I
      never
      would've
      suspected
      him
      of
      doing
      such
      a
      thing.
      He
      seemed
      like
      he
      couldn't
      hurt
      a
      fly.
      What
      happened
      you
      may
      ask?
      He
      claimed
      to
      have
      a
      felony
      on
      his
      record
      so
      he
      had
      someone
      else
      buy
      him
      a
      gun.
      That
      somebody
      is
      apparantly
      on
      the
      spectrum.
      However,
      my
      cousin
      only
      had
      misdemeanors
      on
      his
      record.
      He
      shot
      somebody
      on
      a
      trail
      that
      he
      supposedly
      had
      beef
      with.
      The
      foot
      prints
      matched
      his
      shoes,
      and
      to
      my
      understanding,
      he
      had
      his
      victims
      clothes
      inside
      of
      his
      bedroom.
      The
      bullet
      wounds
      on
      the
      body
      had
      also
      matched
      the
      type
      of
      gun
      my
      cousin
      had
      obtained
      and
      left
      not
      far
      from
      where
      the
      crime
      had
      been
      commited.
      It's

      Hello,
      C2
      here.
      Also
      a
      recent
      breakee
      into
      c3.
      Watching
      SunlessKahns
      3s
      positioning/rotation
      video
      helped
      a
      lot.
      3s
      is
      cool
      because
      you
      have
      more
      options
      as
      to
      what
      to
      do
      with
      yourself
      than
      you
      do
      with
      22
      and
      espeacially
      1s.
      Think
      of
      the
      pitch
      as
      an
      equally
      split
      pitch
      of
      9
      quadrants.
      3
      on
      their
      side,
      3
      on
      yours,
      and
      3
      in
      the
      middle
      (Looks
      like
      a
      #
      sign)
      .
      Lets
      say
      your
      teammates
      is
      in
      one
      of
      their
      quadrants.
      you
      should
      be
      in
      a
      middle
      quadrant
      or
      in
      one
      of
      your
      own
      quadrants
      if
      your
      other
      teammate
      is
      already
      in
      the
      middle
      quadrant.
      Then,
      your
      teamate
      that
      was
      in
      their
      quadrant
      rotates
      back,
      your
      teammate
      that
      was
      in
      net
      rotates
      into
      the
      middle
      quadrants,
      you
      rotate
      into
      their
      quadrants
      to
      hopefully
      score
      or
      recieve
      a
      pass
      and
      rotate
      back.
      But
      you
      should
      usually
      not
      be
      two
      quadrants
      away
      from
      your
      teammate.
      There'd
      be
      to
      much
      room
      between
      you.
      which
      can
      come
      back
      to
      bite
      you.
      Say
      your
      teammate
      is
      in
      their
      upper
      left
      quadrant.
      You
      should
      be
      in
      the
      middle-center
      quardant
      (or
      behind
      in
      the
      middle-left
      if
      he's
      being
      challenged)
      and
      your
      teammate
      will
      likely
      be
      on
      net.
      Thats
      a
      very
      dumbed
      down
      idea
      of
      rotating/positioning,
      obviously
      situations
      can
      effect
      this
      and
      that
      was
      simply
      in
      an
      ideal
      situation,
      however
      the
      speed
      will
      come
      the
      quicker
      you
      can
      rotate
      up
      quadrants
      and
      are
      aware
      of
      where
      your
      teammates
      are.
      It's
      not
      neccesarily
      about
      speed
      but
      awareness
      and
      positioning
      yourself
      well.
      Trust
      me,
      i've
      seen
      faster
      diamond
      3s
      than
      I
      have
      GC's.
      Difference
      is
      the
      Diamond
      3s
      don't
      know
      where
      to
      be
      and
      when.
      The
      GC's
      certainly

      Personally,
      I
      think
      Lucks
      is/was
      (Could
      be

      dont
      have
      the
      stats)
      better
      pocket
      passer
      than
      wilson.
      But
      I
      think
      on
      the
      move
      wilson
      is
      the
      2nd
      best
      QB
      in
      the
      league
      when
      forced
      out
      of
      the
      pocket
      after

      The

      *Yes*,

      me
      telling

      even
      explaining
      why
      is
      shitty
      and
      defensive.
      Then

      I
      said
      waaaaayyy
      out
      of

      it
      was
      you
      vastly
      misinterpreting

      then
      not
      accepting
      that
      as

      is
      childish

      He

      all

      Rodgers

      either

      he

      Trubisky

      Yeah

      He's
      not
      built
      to
      be,
      or
      has
      ever
      been
      a
      quarterback
      that
      likes
      to
      stay
      in
      the
      pocket
      and
      survey
      the
      field.
      It's
      obvious
      that
      he
      doesn't
      survey
      well.
      Let
      the
      man
      scramble
      and
      throw
      on
      the

      Nevermind
      the
      fact
      that
      the
      Denver
      D
      left
      robinson
      wide
      open?
      Never
      mind
      the
      fact
      that
      the
      bears
      shot
      themselves
      in
      the
      foot
      with
      a
      penalty
      the
      play
      just
      before
      the
      conversion
      that
      set
      up
      Pinero's
      kick?
      Nevermind
      the
      bears
      commited
      a
      penelty
      on
      a
      field
      goal
      that
      went
      wide
      to
      the
      right
      and
      set
      up
      Denver
      for
      a
      successful
      2pt
      conversion?
      Can't
      blame
      the
      refs
      for
      this
      one.
      Denver
      had
      EVERY
      opportunity
      to
      put
      this
      away.

      a

      No

      Mahomes
      wouldve
      developed
      into
      what
      he

      now
      under
      John
      Fox's
      outdated

      If
      he
      had
      Nagy
      from
      year
      one?
      Sure.
      But
      the
      bears
      didn't
      know
      then
      that
      they'd

      Precisely
      this.
      The
      bottom

      have
      a
      plan
      90%
      of
      the
      time.
      The
      top
      teams
      are
      seeing
      their
      plan
      unfold
      aaaannnd
      then
      there's
      the

      consists
      of
      botched

      or

      teetering
      on
      contention
      or
      blowing
      it
      up.
      Had
      the
      sox
      blown
      it
      up
      after
      2012
      when
      they
      blew
      the
      division
      lead
      to
      the
      Tigers
      in

      the

      We

      should
      be

      The
      indians
      wouldve
      absolutely
      won
      that
      world
      series
      if
      the
      pitching
      staff
      wasnt
      so
      injured.
      Had
      they
      not
      started
      Kluber
      3
      times
      in
      the
      series.
      I
      remember
      actually
      cheering
      for
      your
      guys
      as
      a
      White
      Sox
      fan
      (Because
      fuck

      cubs)
      and
      tuning
      in
      to
      game
      7.
      With
      the
      first
      few
      pitches
      you
      could
      see
      Kluber
      didn't
      have
      his
      normal
      stuff.
      He
      was
      exhausted.

      If
      the
      offense
      is
      that
      stacked,
      the
      pitching
      staff
      really
      only
      needs
      to
      be
      slightly
      above
      average.
      Let's
      say
      hahn
      doesn't
      land
      Cole.
      Cease,
      Kopech,
      Rodon,
      Giolito
      and
      who
      ever
      else
      just
      need
      to
      put
      up
      like
      3.5-4.5
      ERAs
      for
      an
      offense
      that
      stacked
      to
      compete.
      Giolito
      will
      be
      a
      Cy
      young
      contender
      next
      year.
      Cease
      and
      rondon
      will
      be
      good
      middle
      of
      the
      roation
      guys.
      Kopech
      is
      entirely
      capable
      of
      being
      an
      Ace
      but
      we
      need
      to
      see
      how
      he

      He'll
      probably
      miss
      a
      few
      weeks
      if
      I
      had
      to
      guess.
      Here's
      a
      paragraph
      from
      NBC's
      article
      about
      it.
      "Bears
      coach
      Matt
      Nagy
      said
      today
      that
      he
      does
      not
      believe
      Trubisky #8217;s
      injury
      is
      season
      ending.
      Otherwise,
      Nagy
      said,
      there #8217;s
      not
      a
      lot
      of
      information
      until
      Trubisky
      undergoes
      more
      medical
      testing."
      Here's
      the
      replay:
      https://youtu.be/XiBXd3TqvPA
      The
      good
      news
      is
      that
      the
      Oakland
      game
      coming
      up
      should
      be
      a
      W
      even
      with
      Chase
      Daniel
      at
      the
      helm,
      who
      was
      on
      fire
      today.
      Then
      the
      bye
      week
      is
      after
      the
      oakland
      game.
      After
      they
      bye,
      we
      play
      the
      Saints.
      He
      could
      possibly
      be
      back
      for
      that
      considering
      the
      Saints
      game
      is
      nearly
      a
      month
      from
      now.

      but
      like
      Nagy

      it's

      pending
      further

      I
      can't
      agree
      with
      this.
      Foles
      has
      never
      been
      a
      consistent
      starter,
      let
      alone
      a
      hall
      of
      famer
      like
      Favre.
      It's
      a
      worlds
      difference
      studying
      under
      foles
      vs
      studying
      under
      favre.
      Foles
      succsess
      in
      Philadelphia
      was
      a
      result
      of
      Pederson
      knowing
      exactly
      how

      past
      two
      seasons.
      I
      mean,
      take
      a
      look
      at
      Foles
      stats
      during
      his
      first
      stint
      with
      philly
      and
      his
      breif
      stint
      in
      KC.
      I'll
      give
      him
      credit
      where
      it's
      dur
      though,
      he
      was
      pretty
      clutch
      in
      both
      playoff
      runs
      and
      the
      philly
      special,
      but
      I
      digress.

      Brady
      was
      an
      example
      of
      a
      simaler
      situation,
      not
      a

      But
      like
      Minshew,
      nobody
      really
      knew
      what

      The
      term
      "Super
      Bowl
      Winning
      Quarterback"
      is
      just
      smoke
      and
      mirrors.
      Jim
      McMahon
      wasn't
      a
      spectacular
      Quarterback
      by
      any
      means
      but
      he's
      still
      a
      "Superbowl
      Winning
      Quarterback."
      If
      Wents
      didn't
      get
      injured
      in
      2017
      Foles
      woild
      still
      be
      a
      "Superbowl
      winning
      Quarterback"
      except
      nobody
      would
      give
      a
      shit
      because
      he's
      the
      back
      up.
      Plenty
      of
      garbage
      QBs
      have
      played
      in
      superbowls
      too
      and
      quite
      a
      few
      came
      close
      to
      winning
      one.
      Like
      Rex
      Grossman
      on
      thr
      06
      bears.
      if
      that
      tern
      really
      held
      as
      much
      weight
      as
      people
      would
      like
      to
      think,
      Joe
      Flacco
      would
      still
      be
      on
      the
      Ravens,
      Eli
      Manning
      would've
      not
      lost
      his
      starting
      job
      to
      a
      rookie,
      etc.
      But
      you're
      correct.
      Nobody
      truly
      knows
      what
      any
      player
      will
      be
      like
      on
      the
      pro
      level.
      There's
      just
      very
      educated
      guesses
      from
      scouts
      and
      GM's.
      I
      personally
      just
      don't
      see
      a
      reason
      to
      try
      and
      fix
      what
      isn't
      broke
      at
      the
      moment
      so
      in
      my
      opinion
      Gardner
      should
      stay
      as
      the
      starter
      until/if
      he
      loses
      it
      dur
      to
      poor
      play.
