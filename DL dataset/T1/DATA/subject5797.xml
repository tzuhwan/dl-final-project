      Now
      I
      really
      want
      to
      do
      it.
      Just
      so
      I
      can
      see
      the
      craftsmanship
      up
      close.
      Make
      sure
      everything
      is
      nice
      and
      secure.
      Maybe
      try
      hitting
      it
      with
      my
      purse.

      I
      was
      just
      singing
      this
      line
      in
      my
      head
      and
      always
      think
      of
      this
      song
      when
      I
      see
      anything
      Warsaw
      related
      anymore.
      Little
      something
      to
      pass
      the
      time.
      I
      can #8217;t
      believe
      this
      is
      the
      last
      day
      before
      the
      New
      Era
      finally
      begins.
      Funk.
       #8220;I
      get
      high!
      Now
      you
      got
      something
      to
      look
      up
      to. #8221;

      I
      listened
      to
      it
      the
      morning
      it
      dropped
      after
      I
      awoke
      from
      my
      slumber.
      Initially
      it
      felt
      like
      it
      was
      6-7
      Tool
      songs
      put
      in
      a
      blender
      with
      a
      twist
      of
      The
      Wrist.
      Got
      up,
      puked.
      Listened
      to
      it
      again
      and
      knew
      it
      was,
      as
      I
      had
      suspected...
      Solid,
      Fuckin #8217;
      Gold.
      Had
      to
      ride
      around
      in
      the
      car
      that
      night
      after
      it
      cooled
      off,
      blaring
      it
      for
      the
      countryside
      to
      hear.
      Ready
      for
      the
      rest
      tomorrow.

      I #8217;d
      wager
      he #8217;s
      still
      in
      More
      Godly
      than
      Not
      Mode
      at

      Saw

      and
      can #8217;t
      wait
      for

      next.
      Hopefully
      some
      more
      Desert

      or
      perhaps
      some
      of

      renditions
      of
      previous
      material
      they #8217;ve
      been
      doing
      here
      and
      there
      in
      another
      live
      album
      format.

      Why
      are
      they

      Prepare
      for
      one
      of
      the
      most
      bone
      breaking
      experiences
      ever.
      I
      wish
      they
      would
      take
      a
      page
      from
      NIN
      and
      do
      their
      sales
      differently.
      Alas,
      it #8217;s
      a
      very
      difficult
      ticket
      to
      get
      firsthand,
      they
      will
      sell
      out
      every
      show
      almost
      immediately
      as
      tickets
      are
      released.
      As
      stated
      above
      you
      kinda
      gotta
      get
      lucky
      and
      be
      prepared.
      You #8217;re
      fighting
      legions
      of
      fans
      and
      the
      bots
      and
      flippers.
      I #8217;ve
      only
      managed
      to
      get
      actual
      tickets
      the
      last
      5
      odd
      years
      twice
      on
      the
      actual
      site
      and
      one
      of
      those
      was
      actually
      APC
      not
      Tool
      now
      that
      I
      think
      about
      it.
      The
      best
      seats
      I
      managed
      were
      bought
      off
      a
      resale
      site
      for
      a
      pretty
      steep
      up
      charge
      but
      totally
      worth
      it
      to
      be
      about
      10
      rows
      back
      center.
      It #8217;s
      already
      an
      expensive
      ticket
      and
      this
      one
      will
      probably
      be
      even
      more
      what
      with
      the
      trade
      war
      and
      all
      that
      Jazz.

      Hahaha.
      Good
      eye.
      It #8217;s
      a
      battle
      in
      that
      room
      between
      Tool/Puscifer
      and
      Hello
      Kitty.
      That
      tray
      is
      a
      new
      item
      at
      World
      Market.
      Don #8217;t
      ask
      me
      how
      I
      know
      that.
      Haha.

      For
      some
      reason
      The
      Synth
      in
      CCT
      reminds
      me
      of
      the
      part
      at
      about
      1:10
      in.
      We

      I
      love
      this
      track
      and
      Jocko
      Homo
      so
      this
      is
      no
      issue.
      I #8217;m
      glad
      Danny
      got
      the
      space
      to
      lay
      this
      down
      and
      actually
      do
      some
      surgery
      on
      it.

      for

      This
      had
      me
      regretting
      softening
      my
      stance
      on
      him
      after
      some
      inspired
      drives
      since
      last
      years
      debacles.
      He
      was
      mad
      and
      driving
      into
      a
      gap
      he
      knew
      was
      going
      to
      close.
      It
      just
      wasn #8217;t
      going
      to
      be
      there
      and
      he
      thought
      he
      was
      just
      gonna
      throw
      it
      up
      there
      and
      bully
      his
      way
      through
      like
      usual
      but
      this
      time
      he
      paid
      the
      price
      for
      being
      reckless.
      I
      think
      the
      guy
      can
      drive
      the
      wheels
      off
      the
      car
      and
      today
      he
      didn #8217;t
      maximize
      his
      potential.

      put
      a

      that
      madness.
      I
      myself
      am
      calling
      from
      a
      Princess
      Phone.
      I #8217;ve
      heard
      Danny
      smash
      on
      some
      variation
      of
      this
      drum
      solo
      since
      2014
      now.
      It #8217;s
      nice
      but
      I #8217;m
      kind
      of
      glad
      he
      did
      a
      short
      and
      sweet
      version.
      I
      can #8217;t
      quit
      hearing
      a
      Devo
      nod
      in
      the
      synth
      now
      though.

      They

      no

      but
      after

      security
      shines
      a

      in

      looking

      criminal

      it

      Yeah
      but
      they #8217;re
      getting
      more
      desirable
      the
      last
      few
      years
      it
      seems,
      usually
      they
      make
      about
      500
      or
      so
      at
      least.
      Not
      sure
      how
      many
      are
      signed
      out
      of
      that
      batch.
      I
      have
      a
      signed
      one
      that
      is
      number
      325/500.
      I
      have
      a
      hard
      time
      imagining
      any
      of
      them
      signing
      fucking
      500
      of
      these
      things
      every
      other
      day
      on
      tour.
      I
      think
      they
      grab
      like
      a
      bunch
      of
      random
      ones
      out
      of
      the
      batches
      and
      sign
      them
      but
      I
      could
      totally
      be
      wrong
      here.
      It #8217;s
      odd
      now
      that
      Adam
      has
      taken
      over
      the
      artwork
      for
      them
      for
      the
      most
      part
      with
      the
      exception
      of
      the
      Adi
      posters.
      Be
      interesting
      to
      see
      if
      the
      Bug
      thing
      ever
      fully
      develops
      or
      he
      brings
      in
      some
      more
      people
      to
      handle
      the
      load.
      Sometimes
      there
      are
      leftovers
      from
      previous
      shows
      on
      their
      website
      not
      sure
      if
      these
      are
      leftovers
      or
      reprints
      or
      what
      exactly
      but
      perhaps
      a
      mixture.

      I

      got
      to

      19th
      album
      from
      the
      Machine
      Elves
      once.
      They #8217;re
      hard
      to
      pin
      down.
      All
      will
      be

      It

      It #8217;s
      cool
      man.
      I #8217;m
      just
      saying
      it
      sounds
      like
      you
      have
      a
      lot
      of
      extra
      layers
      of
      baggage
      to
      drag
      through
      while
      trying
      to
      make
      sense
      of
      this.
      It #8217;s
      not
      what
      it
      seems
      at
      first.
      I
      was
      put
      off
      at
      first
      myself
      at
      times
      but
      it #8217;s
      normal
      for
      their
      work.
      I
      had
      to
      drag
      myself
      through
      the
      fire
      to
      appreciate
      10,000
      Days
      when
      it
      first
      came
      out
      beyond
      the
      stuff
      that
      really
      stood
      out.You #8217;re
      saying
      Jambi
      was
      one
      of
      your
      favorites
      and
      to
      me
      personally
      that #8217;s
      the
      weakest
      song
      off
      that
      record
      by
      a
      long
      shot.
      It #8217;s
      all
      personal
      opinion.
      Maybe
      you
      will
      never
      like
      it.
      It #8217;s
      all
      good.

      I #8217;ve
      done
      this
      about
      5
      times
      now
      in
      the
      last
      decade
      that
      it #8217;s
      turned
      into
      a
      complete
      fucking
      shitshow.
      If
      they
      don #8217;t
      happen,
      they
      don #8217;t
      happen.
      One
      time
      I
      didn #8217;t
      even
      go
      because
      I
      couldn #8217;t
      get
      any
      tickets
      worth
      a
      shit
      to
      pull
      up.
      I
      payed
      to
      see
      them
      from
      a
      shitty
      angle
      before
      and
      won #8217;t
      do
      it
      again,
      although
      you
      can
      get
      in
      and
      just
      move
      around
      if
      you #8217;re
      smooth
      about
      it.
      I #8217;m
      going
      to
      fire
      up
      the
      phone
      and
      computer
      and
      give
      it
      my
      best.
      If
      I
      can #8217;t
      get
      decent
      seats
      I #8217;ll
      wait
      til
      next
      round
      when
      I #8217;m
      hoping
      they
      can
      come
      closer
      and
      I
      don #8217;t
      have
      to
      travel
      and
      get
      a
      hotel
      and
      all
      that
      Jazz.
      I #8217;ve
      had
      to
      buy
      them
      off
      a
      resell
      site
      and
      it #8217;s
      ok
      if
      you
      get
      decent
      seats
      for
      150-200
      a
      piece,
      but
      now
      that #8217;s
      more
      like
      265-350
      now.
      It #8217;s
      a
      been
      a
      crazy
      hot
      ticket
      as
      is
      and
      this
      isn #8217;t
      going
      to
      slow
      it
      down,
      people
      that
      have
      been
      waiting
      on
      new
      material
      are
      gonna
      want
      to
      be
      there.

      It #8217;s
      his
      voice.
      And
      I #8217;m
      not
      sure
      but
      something
      happened
      to
      him
      between
      2014ish
      and
      2017.
      His
      voice
      wasn #8217;t
      as
      strong
      to
      me
      during
      that
      period
      and
      you
      could
      tell
      he
      was
      avoiding
      passages
      and
      doing
      stuff
      different.
      It
      wasn #8217;t
      until
      I
      saw
      him
      with
      APC
      right
      before
      ETE
      dropped
      that
      I
      felt
      his
      voice
      was
      back
      in
      peak
      form.
      I
      actually
      think
      the
      vocals
      on
      this
      are
      very
      fitting
      for
      the
      music.
      This
      album
      is
      very
      nuanced
      and
      seems
      to
      say
      one
      thing
      or
      give
      off
      this
      certain
      vibe
      and
      really
      I
      think
      it #8217;s
      just
      peoples
      own
      mental
      blockage
      of
      what
      this
      was
      supposed
      to
      sound
      like.
      The
      more
      I
      listen
      to
      it
      then
      more
      it
      sounds
      like
      itself.
      Despite
      all
      the
      callbacks
      and
      reminiscing
      going
      on.

      Haha
      this

      I
      was
      there
      man!
      No
      lie
      I
      played
      it
      on
      the
      way
      there
      to
      the
      show
      and
      my
      girl
      who
      is
      a
      huge
      fan
      herself
      was
      like
       #8220;Isn #8217;t
      this
      a
      bit
      much?
      We #8217;re
      going
      to
      see
      them
      right
      now. #8221;
      I
      was
      like
       #8220;they
      will
      probably
      never
      play
      this
      song
      in
      a
      million
      years
      again, #8221;
      and
      she
      agreed.
      So
      we
      were
      laughing
      pretty
      hard
      when
      they
      strolled
      out
      dressed
      up
      like
      Zep
      and
      busted
      this
      out
      first
      fucking
      thing.
      I
      thought
      I #8217;d
      died.
      Honestly
      they
      hadn #8217;t
      played
      it
      in
      forever
      and
      it
      showed,
      Danny
      was
      on
      it
      but
      the
      other
      guys
      seemed
      to
      drop
      it
      here
      and
      there
      slightly,
      still
      better
      than
      I
      could
      do.
      I #8217;d
      seen
      Danny
      with
      Volto
      a
      year
      before
      and
      they
      played
      the
      balls
      out
      of
      that
      song.

      Luckily
      my
      girl
      snagged
      decent
      nosebleeds
      straight
      back.
      I
      was
      actually
      in
      before
      her
      on
      the
      laptop
      and
      it
      did
      that
      to
      me
      twice
      on
      great
      seats
      straight
      back
      in
      the
      lower
      bowl.
      Then
      once
      it
      let
      me
      try
      to
      get
      through
      threw
      up
      the

      telling

      I
      couldn #8217;t
      use
      this

      to
      purchase
      them
      for
      some
      fuckkng
      reason
      at
      this
      juncture.
      I
      was
      about
      to
      snap
      but
      she
      was
      like
       #8220;I
      got
      some. #8221;
      Hahaha
      oh
      well,
      save
      an
      extra
      60
      bucks
      on
      the
      tickets
      and
      just
      go
      and
      enjoy
      the
      show.
      I
      tried
      to
      find
      some
      better
      ones
      but
      they #8217;re
      gone.
      Maybe
      closer
      to
      the
      show
      date
      they
      will
      open
      up
      a
      few
      more.

      At

      mash
      back

      Yeah
      I
      noticed
      they
      had
      shit
      way
      up
      in
      the
      wings.
      Hopefully
      it #8217;s
      worth
      it
      for
      them,
      I
      almost
      got
      some
      but
      I
      don #8217;t
      really
      want
      to
      just
      stare
      down
      at
      Danny
      the
      whole
      time,
      as
      enticing
      as
      that
      sounds.
      I
      want
      to
      be
      able
      to
      take
      it
      all
      in
      from
      a
      nice
      vantage
      point.
      I #8217;ve
      seen
      them
      close
      and
      there
      is
      no
      more
      pit.
      I
      couldn #8217;t
      believe
      they
      were
      that
      expensive
      though.

      I
      pray
      you #8217;re
      right.
      This
      is
      kind

      what
      I
      am
      hoping

      the
      back
      catalogue
      really
      mix
      it
      up
      then.
      Every
      time
      I
      see
      them
      is
      great
      but

      seems

      I #8217;ve
      seen
      lots
      of
      these
      at
      various
      Asian
      restaurants
      over
      the
      years.
      Still
      neat.

      That
      angry
      white
      male
      subset
      hijacks
      everything.
      Lots
      of
      Tool #8217;s
      music
      is
      explicitly
      against
      most
      of
      this
      shit.
      Thinking
      for
      yourself
      and
      questioning
      authority
      etc
      etc.
      I #8217;m
      not
      sure
      the
      sexist
      tropes
      are
      that
      and
      not
      either
      jokes
      or
      actual
      deep
      looks
      at
      darker
      subjects.
      They
      aren #8217;t
      for
      everyone.
      Maynard #8217;s
      Dick
      I
      guess?
      I
      think
      some
      people
      are
      so
      dense
      that
      no
      matter
      how
      woke
      they
      are
      they
      won #8217;t
      ever
      learn
      to
      fucking
      laugh
      at
      the
      absurdity
      of
      it
      all
      sometimes.
      They
      have
      a
      picture
      of
      themselves
      watching
      a
      guy
      autofellate
      himself
      on
      one
      of
      their
      album
      inserts.
      What #8217;s
      became
      of
      subtlety?

      2011-
      Puscifer
      on
      the
      Conditions
      Tour,
      unbelievably
      good.
      2014-
      Tool
      in
      Austin.
      Amazing.
      First
      song
      I
      ever
      heard
      them
      play
      was
      Third
      Eye.
      Had
      great
      seats
      and
      walked
      in
      transfixed.
      2015-
      Volto
      in
      Anaheim.
      Unreal.
      Barely
      got
      in,
      maybe
      100
      people
      max
      standing
      room.
      Finished
      it
      up
      with
      their
      version
      of
      No
      Quarter.
      Got
      to
      watch
      Danny
      up
      close
      and
      personal
      and
      shake
      his
      hand
      and
      tell
      him
      thanks
      for
      everything
      afterwards.
      Mind
      blowing.
      2015
      Tool
      Monster
      Mash
      in
      Tempe
      Arizona
      on
      Halloween.
      Incredibly
      packed
      festival
      show.
      Over
      30k
      people,
      probably
      the
      most
      people
      I #8217;ve
      been
      around
      outside
      of
      a
      college
      football
      game.
      Obviously
      they
      came
      out
      dressed
      as
      Zep
      and
      played
      No
      Quarter
      but
      not
      half
      as
      good
      as
      Volto.
      They
      were
      a
      bit
      rusty
      but
      by
      the
      end
      of
      the
      set
      were
      hitting
      on
      all
      cylinders.
      Got
      super
      high
      and
      then
      black
      lung
      from
      700
      million
      second
      hand
      cigarettes.
      And
      I
      smoked
      then.
      Hahaha.
      2015
      Puscifer
      on
      the
      Money
      Shot
      Tour
      in
      Dallas.
      Had
      VIP
      tickets.
      Could
      actually
      hear
      their
      amplifiers
      and
      hear
      their
      voices
      singing.
      Felt
      like
      you
      could
      reach
      out
      and
      grab
      them.
      Awesome
      performance
      early
      on
      that
      tour
      when
      you
      could
      tell
      they
      were
      figuring
      it
      out
      still.
      2016
      Tool
      in
      Dallas.
      Sort
      of
      a
      repeat
      but
      indoors
      and
      it #8217;s
      me
      and
      girls
      favorite
      band.
      Didn #8217;t
      have
      the
      greatest
      seats
      but
      it
      didn #8217;t
      matter.
      A
      good
      time
      was
      had.
      2017
      APC
      finally
      after
      all
      these
      years
      in
      Dallas.
      Fucking
      badass
      show,
      they
      sounded
      great
      and
      had
      the
      whole
      place
      moving.
      Really
      good
      energy
      that
      night.
      2019
      Tool.
      Finally
      after
      almost
      26
      years
      of
      listening
      to
      these
      goofballs
      on
      cassette
      on
      my
      Walkman
      in
      middle
      school
      riding
      the
      bus
      I
      will
      see
      them
      in
      my
      home
      town
      of
      Tulsa
      Oklahoma.
      I
      passed
      on
      lots
      of
      shows
      when
      I
      was
      younger
      because
      I
      didn #8217;t
      like
      crowds
      and
      had
      other
      shit
      going
      that
      I
      felt
      was
      more
      important.
      Haha
      what
      a
      fool.
      My
      good
      friend
      who
      died
      a
      couple
      years
      back
      would
      never
      shut
      up
      about
      good
      they
      were
      live
      but
      I
      never
      saw
      them
      until
      after
      he
      had
      passed
      oddly
      enough.
      My
      gf
      has
      seen
      them
      Tool
      8
      times
      going
      back
      to
      the
       #198;nima
      tour
      and
      thinks
      they #8217;re
      lame
      now.
      Hahahahaha

      I
      was
      crying
      here
      and
      there
      for
      sure.
      Had
      been
      through
      a
      really
      tough
      time
      leading
      up
      to
      that
      show
      and
      barely
      made
      it
      there.
      It
      was
      like
      going
      to
      Church
      and
      Jesus
      actually
      being
      there.
      Good
      stuff.
      I
      can #8217;t
      wait
      for
      the
      next
      album.

      That #8217;s
      where
      I
      saw
      them
      on
      the
      Money
      Shot
      your.
      We
      raced
      back
      from
      Arizona
      to
      see
      them
      on
      the
      first
      indoor
      show.
      We
      got
      stuck
      in
      the
      awesome
      traffic
      on
      75
      and
      we
      were
      late.
      Walked
      in
      after
      the
      first
      song
      was
      already
      started
      and
      had
      to
      go
      right
      up
      to
      the
      second
      row.
      I
      could
      feel
      Maynard
      giving
      me
      the
       #8220;who
      the
      fuck
      are
      these
      assholes #8221;
      eyes.
      Hahahaha.
      I
      need
      to
      go
      to
      another
      show
      there
      and
      really
      check
      the
      place
      out.
      We
      were
      both
      sick
      from
      traveling
      and
      that
      was
      a
      tough
      show
      physically.
      Monster
      mash
      killed
      us
      as
      well
      3
      days
      before
      that.
      We
      were
      pretty
      close
      but
      we
      had
      to
      stand
      in
      the
      same
      spot
      for
      6
      hours.

      I
      thought
      the
      consensus
      amongst
      the
      rumor
      mills
      was
      2022
      at
      earliest.
      This
      thing
      just
      prints
      money
      still.
      They #8217;re
      outdated
      and
      have
      just
      this
      year
      finally
      gotten
      around
      to
      putting
      safety
      sense
      in
      them
      and
      nobody
      can
      agree
      if
      that #8217;s
      good
      or
      bad.
      They
      didn #8217;t
      put
      all
      that
      work
      into
      doing
      that
      just
      to
      make
      them
      for
      2
      years
      alone
      in
      my
      opinion.
      I
      could
      see
      the
      2022
      6th
      coming
      out
      alongside
      a
      2022
      5th
      gen
      model
      like
      the
      did
      with
      the
      2019/2020
      corolla.
      They #8217;re
      more
      expensive
      than
      ever
      now
      thanks
      to
      tariffs
      as
      well
      which
      will
      have
      an
      unknown
      effect
      on
      sales.

      Right.

      I #8217;m
      at
      the

      dressed
      liked
      you?
      Go
      suck
      a
      fucking

      fighter
      off
      dude.
      I #8217;m
      not
      stopping
      you.
      I #8217;m
      not
      the
      one
      running
      my
      mouth.
      I #8217;m
      also
      not
      the
      fucking
      dude
      laying
      on
      the
      ground.
      And
      never
      fucking
      have
      been.
      So
      go
      on
      and
      watch
      MMA
      shit
      talking
      sessions
      and
      act
      like
      the

      you
      in
      some
      way,
      shape
      or

      no
      argument
      to
      be
      had
      here
      dipshit.
      As
      you
      saw
      in
      this
      video
      above,
      the

      his
      jaw
      ended
      up
      on

      ground.
      You #8217;re
      wanting
      to
      back
      up
      your
      buddy
      who #8217;s
      a

      is
      fine,

      twist
      when
      I
      serve
      your
      bullshit
      back
      to
      you.

      I
      have
      one,
      it #8217;s
      not
      the
      best
      of
      the
      best
      and
      I #8217;m
      sure
      there
      are
      better
      systems
      but
      for
      removing
      lint
      and
      dust
      and
      paper
      bits
      from
      sleeves
      it
      seems
      to
      work
      fine.
      Easy
      to
      rinse
      off
      and
      hasn #8217;t
      damaged
      anything
      to
      my
      knowledge.
      Seems
      to
      be
      alot
      less
      hiss
      and
      pops
      on
      my
      older
      stuff
      that #8217;s
      gotten
      more
      plays.
      I #8217;d
      like
      to
      eventually
      get
      a
      wet
      cleaning
      system
      however
      this
      works
      for
      me
      just
      fine
      for
      the
      meantime.

      This.

      much
      as
      I
      want
      to
      analyze
      this

      and
      really
      not

      Almost

      it #8217;s
      just
      a
      ploy
      to
      launch
