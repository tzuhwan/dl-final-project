      On
      mobile
      so
      apologies
      for
      any
      mistakes
      I
      work
      at
      a
      thrift
      store
      as
      a
      cashier,
      and
      the
      other
      night
      we
      were
      closing.
      As
      per
      usual,
      we
      made
      multiple
      announcements
      about
      coming
      to
      the
      register
      if
      you
      have
      large
      purchases
      so
      we
      can
      get
      you
      out
      of
      the
      store
      before
      close
      (which
      honestly
      never
      happens
      bc
      no
      one
      really
      listens).
      Some
      time
      earlier
      (maybe
      2
      hours
      before
      close?)
      I
      had
      helped
      a
      woman
      put
      something
      on
      hold
      from
      our
      jewelry
      case.
      9
      PM
      rolled
      around
      and
      we
      were
      officially
      closed.
      Mostly,
      the
      purchases
      I
      had
      to
      ring
      up
      were
      small
      until
      I
      got
      this
      one
      woman
      who
      had
      a
      CART
      LOAD
      of
      antique
      books
      and
      housewares.
      When
      I
      finished
      ringing
      her
      up
      the
      total
      was
      388
      dollars,
      give
      or
      take.
      I
      was
      tired
      as
      hell
      and
      just
      wanted
      her
      to
      leave
      so
      I
      didn't
      question
      it,
      helped
      her
      bag
      her
      things,
      wrap
      the
      breakable
      items
      in
      newspaper,
      etc.
      Then,
      when
      she
      put
      her
      debit
      card
      in
      it
      got
      declined.
      So,
      she
      tried
      her
      other
      card.
      Declined.
      She
      tried
      putting
      150
      on
      the
      first
      card
      and
      the
      rest
      on
      the
      second.
      The
      first
      transaction
      went
      through,
      but
      the
      second
      got
      DECLINED.
      I
      called
      my
      manager
      over
      and
      the
      woman
      asked
      if
      she
      could
      get
      rid
      of
      some
      of
      the
      stuff
      to
      bring
      her
      total
      down,
      but
      because
      I
      had
      already
      put
      through
      the
      charge
      on
      the
      first
      card
      and
      our
      system
      is
      wack
      we
      had
      to
      void
      the
      whole
      thing
      and
      rering
      everything.
      Eventually,
      when
      we
      were
      about
      halfway
      through
      ringing
      up
      her
      things
      the
      second
      time,
      she
      just
      decided
      to
      buy
      about
      5
      things
      and
      then
      left
      (half
      an
      hour
      after
      close
      by
      the
      way).
      TLDR:
      Woman
      rolled
      up
      to
      the
      register
      after
      close
      with
      388
      dollars
      worth
      of
      things,
      couldn't
      pay
      for
      it,
      we
      had
      to
      void
      the
      whole
      thing
      and
      start
      over,
      but
      she
      just
      gave
      up
      and
      left
      with
      5
      things

      At
      the
      store
      I
      used
      to
      work
      at,
      we
      had
      buy
      4
      get
      1
      free
      deals
      on
      our
      used
      books
      (which
      were
      already
      super
      cheap
      anyways)
      and
      we
      also
      have
      a
      Senior
      Discount
      Tuesday
      (55
      and
      up
      get
      30%
      off).
      Some
      lady
      came
      in
      and
      bought
      10
      books
      (so
      2
      free
      ones)
      and
      also
      had
      a
      senior
      discount
      (so
      on
      top
      of
      2
      free
      books
      her
      8
      paid
      books
      were
      also
      30%
      off).
      On
      the
      receipt
      it
      will
      display
      the
      amount
      she
      paid
      for
      a
      group
      of
      4
      books
      and
      then
      it'll
      show
      one
      book
      that
      says
      -
      x
      amount.
      That
      amount
      also
      has
      the
      30%
      applied
      to
      it
      automatically
      when
      you
      scan
      it.
      When
      I
      rang
      her
      up,
      I
      just
      scanned
      our
      QR
      code
      for
      books
      (because
      we
      don't
      usually
      have
      individual
      price
      tags
      for
      books)
      and
      entered
      the
      quantity
      as
      10.
      It
      took
      off
      2
      books,
      but
      because
      each
      paperbook
      book
      is
      1.95
      (already
      goddamn
      cheap
      yknow)
      AND
      there
      was
      a
      30%
      it
      was
      2.73
      So,
      a
      few
      days
      later
      the
      lady
      came
      back
      and
      said
      that
      we
      had
      only
      taken
      off
      one
      book
      (because
      she
      thought
      the
      2.73
      was
      just
      one
      hardcover
      book
      we
      had
      taken
      off).
      I
      had
      to
      explain
      her
      so
      many
      damn
      times
      that
      it
      was
      2
      books
      that
      were
      1.95
      WITH
      HER
      30%
      and
      she
      wasn't
      having
      it,
      so
      I
      called
      my
      manager
      over.
      She
      took
      a
      calculator
      and
      literally
      walked
      her
      through
      the
      math
      step
      by
      step
      and
      finally
      the
      lady
      just
      said
      "Well
      okay.
      I
      don't
      want
      these
      then"
      and
      returned
      them.

      Hello
      there!
      I
      was
      complaining
      to
      my
      friend
      that
      my
      old
      laptop
      wasn't
      good
      for
      doing
      anything
      except
      basic
      things
      (like
      typing
      essays---college
      life.),
      so
      he
      suggested
      I
      build
      my
      own
      PC.
      I'm
      really
      not
      experienced,
      but
      my
      dad
      is
      pretty
      tech
      savvy
      so
      he'll
      help
      me
      out
      probably.
      This
      is
      the
      list
      I
      have
      at
      the
      moment--it's
      mostly
      based
      off
      of
      one
      I
      found
      on
      the
      same
      site.
      https://pcpartpicker.com/user/stanleysteamers/saved/TfGtgs
      My
      budget
      is
      $500
      to
      $700.
      I
      really
      don't
      want
      much
      that's
      too
      fancy,
      just
      something
      to
      game
      on
      and
      maybe
      do
      some
      video
      rendering.
      If
      y'all
      have
      any
      advice
      or
      suggestions
      to
      make
      my
      budget
      lower
      that
      would
      be
      swell
      :)

      Burro's
      tail
      has
      been
      dropping
      a
      lot
      of
      leaves
      since
      I
      got
      it
      ~2
      weeks
      ago,
      I
      have
      an
      east
      facing
      window
      and
      I
      moved
      it
      a
      bit
      away
      from
      the
      sun
      to
      see
      if
      it
      would
      help
      but
      no
      change.
      I
      water
      it
      every
      1
      to
      1.5
      weeks.
      Advice?

      Not
      really
      the
      craziest
      dream
      I've
      had
      but
      I
      can
      remember
      this
      the
      most
      and
      it's
      the
      most
      interesting.
      When
      I
      was
      about
      7,
      I
      had
      a
      dream
      my
      grandma
      was
      in
      the
      master
      bedroom's
      bathroom
      on
      a
      ladder
      trying
      to
      get
      something
      from
      the
      closet.
      Everything
      was
      purple
      and
      there
      was
      a
      little
      snail
      crawling
      up
      the
      ladder.
      She
      fell
      of
      the
      ladder
      and
      I
      woke
      up.
      Later
      I
      was
      telling
      my
      sister
      about
      it
      and
      she
      said
      she
      had
      the
      exact
      same
      dream
      but
      in
      green.

      Hi!
      My
      name
      is
      Alice
      and
      I
      do
      a
      lot
      of
      minimalistic
      graphic
      design
      on
      top
      of
      more
      complex
      paintings
      and
      etc.
      You
      can
      see
      some
      of
      my
      work
      on
      Instagram
      @/dododealer,
      but
      it's
      not
      really
      reflective
      of
      my
      graphic
      design
      portfolio.
      If
      you'd
      like
      to
      see
      more
      examples,
      feel
      free
      to
      DM
      me!
      What's
      most
      fitting
      for
      your
      project
      is
      that
      I
      am
      a
      screenprinter,
      and
      I
      would
      be
      able
      to
      print
      your
      design
      (up
      to
      6
      colors)
      for
      you
      on
      a
      11
      x
      14
      quality
      piece
      of
      paper
      :)
      let
      me
      know
      if
      you
      have
      any
      questions!

      Anthem
      Screenprinting
      does
      great
      quality
      transparencies!
      Fast
      turnaround
      and
      shipping
      too,
      even
      when
      a
      digital
      proof
      is
      added.
      If
      you
      choose
      to
      go
      with
      Kinkos
      or
      FedEx
      Office
      make
      sure
      you
      get
      multiple
      copies
      to
      layer
      on
      top
      of
      each
      other
      when
      burning
      your
      screens
      so
      you
      can
      get
      a
      clean
      design
      (since
      often
      these
      places
      print
      with
      toner
      which
      isn't
      dark
      enough

      But
      would
      this

      prevent
      people
      from
      getting
      their

      on
      tobacco???
      I
      think
      that
      once
      people
      reach
      18
      and
      they
      go
      and
      buy
      tobacco
      products,
      most
      likely
      they've
      tried
      it
      already/gotten
      addicted
      before
      they
      reached
      the
      threshold
      age
      anyways...

      MY
      TIME
      HAS
      FUCKING
      COME.
      -not
      a
      donation
      but
      once
      found
      a
      bloody
      pair
      of
      underwear
      stuffed
      in
      a
      purse
      -a
      box
      that
      had
      HUMAN
      TEETH
      IN
      IT.
      Not
      baby
      teeth.
      Adult
      human
      teeth.
      -a
      full
      on
      tomahawk
      with
      animal
      jaw
      decoration
      on
      it
      -20+
      LOTR
      rings???
      -so
      many
      fucking
      cursed
      looking
      dolls.
      So
      goddamn
      many.
      -a
      lot
      of
      limited
      edition
      Mickey
      Mouse
      watches
      (some
      of
      which
      could
      fetch
      quite
      a
      bit
      of
      money)
      -a
      wreath
      made
      of
      baby
      doll
      heads
      That's
      not
      even
      half
      of
      the
      weird
      shit
      we
      got
      but
      I
      can't
      remember
      the
      rest.
      I
      haven't
      worked
      there
      in
      a
      bit
      now.
      Edit:
      sorry
      for
      the
      format
      on
      mobile
      right
      now.
      Also
      I
      remembered
      a
      few
      more
      things:
      an
      Aquaman
      shirt
      but
      the
      face
      was
      some
      random
      Asian
      mans
      face
      superimposed
      on
      it???
      A
      kids
      book
      called
      "What's
      God's
      Name?"
      Or
      something
      and
      I
      think
      it
      was
      written
      by
      some
      sect
      leader
      in
      India
      of
      (basically)
      a
      cult.
      A
      lot
      of
      daggers
      for
      some
      reason??
      Size
      13
      (mens)
      custom
      painted
      Dragon
      Ball
      Z
      boots.
      Edit
      2:
      a
      blunt
      holder
      which
      was
      like
      a
      long
      wood
      totem
      with
      holes
      in
      it
      to
      hold
      your
      blunts
      and
      the
      top
      was
      snoop
      doggs
      face
      carved
      in
      intricate
      detail

      I'm
      working
      on
      a
      black
      poster
      for
      a
      friend.
      I
      know
      that
      printing
      on
      black
      apparel
      (especially
      white)
      is
      really
      hard
      and
      involves
      multiple
      passes
      but
      is
      the
      process
      similar
      with
      paper?
      Any
      ink
      recs?
      The
      studio
      I
      print
      at
      requires
      water
      based
      ink.

      How

      you
      can
      go
      on
      hikes
      with
      him.
      You
      can
      encourage
      him
      to
      get
      into
      nature
      related
      hobbies
      too
      (like
      mushroom

      while

      I
      found
      what
      I
      think
      were
      younger
      specimens
      of
      this
      mushroom,
      they
      look

      little
      white
      knobs
      when
      they're
      young.

      you
      can
      get

      As
      for
      experiences,
      you
      could
      do
      an
      escape
      room,
      I
      find
      that's
      always
      fun.
      If
      you
      live
      near
      a
      city
      you
      could
      probably
      find
      a
      tour
      of
      the
      cities
      breweries
      and
      etc.
      Edit:
      if
      he's
      looking
      for
      wall
      art,
      maybe
      get
      him
      a
      nice
      custom
      map
      (like
      one
      of
      those
      ones
      where
      you
      can
      scratch
      off
      the
      places
      you've

      or
      a

      star
      map
      of
      what
      the

      My

      exactly

      I
      supposed
      to
      explain
      comments
      like
      yours
      to
      her?
      I
      had
      to
      take
      away
      her
      phone
      for
      a
      whole
      week
      just
      so
      she
      wouldn't
      accidentally
      stumble
      upon
      your
      comment.
      Well,
      I
      guess
      I
      hope
      you're
      proud
      of
      yourself.
      I'd
      give
      her
      her
      phone
      back
      if
      you

      I
      thought
      "sleeping
      together"
      meant
      having
      sex,
      but
      I
      thought
      it
      meant
      that
      when
      you
      have
      sex
      you're
      asleep.
      After
      I
      figured
      out
      that
      you
      are
      (hopefully?!??!)
      very
      much
      awake
      during
      sex
      but
      the
      sleeping
      thing
      made
      me
      think
      that
      people
      just
      had
      sex
      in
      the
      dark
      and
      only
      at
      night.

      What
      kind
      of
      hobbies
      does
      she
      like?
      Along
      with
      some
      nice
      jewelry,
      maybe
      something
      that
      goes
      with
      her
      hobbies.
      Depending
      on
      how
      long
      you've
      been
      together,
      maybe
      something
      to
      commemorate
      when
      you
      two
      met?
      Though
      that
      is
      more
      of
      an
      anniversary
      type
      thing.
      Also,
      as
      for
      fun
      things
      to
      do,
      you
      can't
      go
      wrong
      with
      an

      At

      I
      find
      those
      are
      always
      fun.

      I
      live
      in
      a
      really
      rich
      area.
      One
      girl
      I
      know
      constantly
      flexes
      on
      her
      story
      about
      her
      Mini
      Cooper,
      is
      even
      in
      a
      regional
      club
      for
      it.
      Scattered
      in
      these
      posts
      are
      "subtle"
      Coach
      bags
      and
      Gucci
      merchandise.
      Another
      girl
      I
      once
      talked
      to
      briefly
      said
      she
      shattered
      her
      phone
      screen
      so
      she
      went
      with
      her
      family
      to
      buy
      a
      new
      one,
      then
      they
      all
      ended
      up
      getting
      new
      phones.
      That
      not
      ENTIRELY
      that
      insane
      but
      I
      cannot
      imagine
      being
      able
      to
      just.

      So
      not
      me,
      but
      my
      mom
      worked
      as
      a
      waitress
      in
      the
      early
      90s
      in
      a
      fancy
      Chinese
      restaurant
      in
      NYC.
      She
      spoke
      almost
      no
      English
      save
      for
      the
      items
      on
      the
      menu
      and
      "Tea"
      or
      "Ice
      water",
      so
      usually
      her
      job
      was
      just
      to
      bag
      to
      go
      orders.
      She
      would
      wrap
      each
      carton
      of
      food
      in
      an
      individual
      bag
      to
      keep
      it
      from
      leaking
      (waste
      of
      plastic
      I
      know).
      One
      day,
      she
      got
      a
      100
      dollar
      tip
      bc
      someone
      really
      really
      liked
      the
      way
      she
      bagged
      the
      food.
      Turns
      out
      it
      was
      Woody
      Allen.

      Damn
      this
      happened
      to
      me
      to
      a
      much
      less
      extreme
      extent.
      My

      hated
      that
      I
      was
      having
      sex
      at
      17

      yelled

      I
      should
      just
      marry
      him
      and
      move

      she
      didn't

      I
      once
      locked
      the
      dog
      I
      was
      dogsitting
      in

      they
      did
      not
      do
      this
      :/
      eventually
      a
      AAA
      truck
      did
      come
      because
      my
      dad
      called
      with
      his
      AAA
      member
      num
      and
      got
      them
      to
      come
      but
      because

      wasn't
      a
      member
      (even
      though
      I'm
      his
      dependent)
      they
      told
      me
      I
      could
      only
      get
      help
      if

      that
      just

      So
      I
      washed
      out
      this
      screen
      by
      hand
      with
      a
      brush

      emulsion
      remover
      a
      while
      ago,
      but
      it
      didn't
      come
      out
      entirely.
      Recently
      we
      just
      got
      a
      power
      washer
      so
      I
      tried
      that
      today
      and
      while
      it
      did
      remove
      some
      there's
      a
      big
      part
      that's
      still
      stuck
      on
      there
      and
      some
      smaller
      bits
      throughout.
      Is
      this
      screen
      still
      salvageable?

      Hello!
      I've
      been
      lurking
      on
      this
      sub
      for
      a
      while
      now
      and
      decided
      to
      post
      :)
      I'm
      looking
      for
      someone
      to
      send
      some
      letters
      to
      with
      extra
      goodies
      as
      well,
      such
      as
      pressed
      flowers
      and
      small
      art
      pieces
      and
      stickers
      and
      other
      small
      pieces
      of
      where
      I
      live.
      I
      like
      the
      idea
      of
      getting
      a
      small
      package
      and
      taste
      of
      another
      part
      of
      the
      world!
      This
      doesn't
      have
      to
      be
      a
      commitment;
      just
      one
      letter
      is
      enough,
      though
      if
      you'd
      like
      to
      keep
      chatting
      I
      would
      love
      that
      too!
      Feel
      free
      to
      DM
      me
      if
      you're
      interested
      :)

      I'm
      sorry
      ahead
      of
      time
      if
      none
      of
      this
      is
      particularly
      coherent,
      I'm
      just
      writing
      my
      thoughts
      out
      at
      the
      moment
      and
      hoping
      someone
      replies
      lol
      I'm
      a
      rising
      high
      school
      senior
      and
      starting
      college
      apps.
      About
      a
      year
      ago,
      I
      decided
      (or
      more
      so
      was
      heavily
      coerced
      by
      my
      parents)
      to
      major
      in
      game
      design/comp
      sci
      instead
      of
      what
      my
      original
      plan
      was
      to
      become
      an
      animator.
      Basically,
      my
      parents
      have
      always
      wanted
      me
      to
      be
      a
      computer
      engineer
      instead
      of
      something
      in
      the
      art
      field,
      but
      art
      is
      one
      of
      my
      one
      true
      passions
      in
      life
      and
      I
      couldn't
      imagine
      doing
      something
      that
      doesn't
      involve
      it.
      So
      game
      design
      was
      sort
      of
      our
      compromise,
      but
      now
      it's
      starting
      to
      become
      more
      and
      more
      just
      majoring
      in
      comp
      sci
      and
      then
      going
      into
      game
      design
      and
      hoping
      it'll
      have
      some
      art
      involved.
      I'm
      not
      bad
      at
      coding,
      and
      I
      don't
      mind
      it
      either,
      but
      it's
      just
      not
      something
      I
      feel
      overly
      passionate
      about.
      I
      know
      that
      game
      design
      involves
      a
      lot
      of
      coding
      and
      unless
      I
      work
      at
      an
      indie
      studio,
      I'll
      probably
      end
      up
      doing
      more
      scripting
      than
      game
      art
      if
      I
      major
      in
      Comp
      Sci
      or
      Game
      Design.
      Correct
      me
      if
      I'm
      wrong
      though.
      Anyways,
      I
      had
      pretty
      much
      accepted
      that
      game
      design
      would
      be
      my
      career
      path,
      and
      there
      are
      some
      serious
      upsides
      to
      it
      and
      I
      really
      think
      it's
      something
      I
      could
      be
      passionate
      about.
      But,
      I
      was
      with
      some
      friends
      the
      other
      day
      and
      I
      was
      talking
      about
      how
      I
      didn't
      have
      any
      game
      design
      experience
      or
      completed
      products
      to
      put
      in
      my
      portfolio
      and
      she
      said
      "Well
      maybe
      that's
      a
      sign
      you
      shouldn't
      do
      game
      design"
      and
      now
      it's
      been
      bothering
      me
      a
      lot.
      I
      have
      a
      lot
      of
      art
      pieces,
      especially
      life
      drawing
      because
      that's
      what
      I
      was
      prepping
      for
      originally
      with
      my
      animation
      path.
      I
      have
      some
      things
      like
      concept
      art
      and
      level
      sketches
      for
      a
      game
      that
      I
      thought
      about
      making,
      but
      nothing
      substantial.
      I
      have
      entry-level
      Java
      and
      C#
      skills,
      and
      I
      think
      I'm
      pretty
      competent
      at
      coding.
      I
      have
      a
      few
      complicated
      Java
      programs
      I
      made
      for
      my
      CS
      class
      that
      I
      think
      I
      could
      put
      in
      my
      portfolio.
      But
      again,
      most
      of
      my
      art
      pieces
      are
      geared
      toward
      animation
      or
      traditional
      arts.
      If
      I
      had
      a
      choice
      and
      I
      had
      unlimited
      resources,
      I
      think
      I
      would
      go
      to
      school
      for
      printmaking
      and
      start
      a
      textile
      printing
      business.
      At
      my
      core,
      I'm
      most
      passionate
      about
      just
      *making*
      things.
      I
      love
      to
      sew
      and
      screen
      print
      and
      block
      print,
      and
      I
      follow
      a
      lot
      of
      people
      on
      the
      internet
      who
      do
      just
      that.
      But
      my
      mom
      insists
      that
      if
      I
      just
      settled
      down
      with
      a
      computer
      engineering
      job
      for
      a
      while
      I
      could
      build
      up
      enough
      money
      and
      resources
      to
      just
      start
      my
      own
      business
      when
      I'm
      older.
      I'm
      just
      kind
      of
      at
      a
      crossroads
      right
      now.
      All
      the
      college
      apps
      I've
      done
      so
      far
      have
      been
      for
      comp
      sci
      and
      game
      design
      and
      I
      don't
      think
      I
      can
      just
      start
      over
      now.
      I
      have
      one
      or
      two
      art
      schools
      I'm
      applying
      to,
      but
      I'm
      not
      even
      sure
      I
      would
      go
      if
      I
      got
      in
      because
      I
      don't
      know
      what
      I'd
      do
      there.
      Don't
      really
      know
      how
      to
      end
      this
      post
      now,
      but
      thanks
      if
      you've
      read
      this
      far.

      Camry
      shakes
      when
      braking

      So,
      my
      Toyota
      Camry
      has
      been
      shaking
      when
      I
      brake
      for
      a
      while
      now,
      and
      we
      took
      it
      to
      the
      dealer
      to
      check
      out.
      I
      know
      next
      to
      nothing
      about
      cars
      really,
      and
      my
      mom
      has
      been
      handling
      this
      mostly
      so
      far.
      But
      her
      English
      isn't
      great
      so
      I'm
      trying
      to
      figure
      out
      what's
      happening.
      When
      braking,
      especially
      if
      slowing
      down
      really
      fast
      or
      braking
      down
      a
      hill,
      the
      shaking
      can
      be
      felt
      in
      the
      steering
      wheel,
      the
      brake,
      and
      the
      whole
      car.
      When
      we
      went
      to
      the
      Toyota
      dealer,
      they
      inspected
      both
      the
      front
      and
      rear
      brakes
      which
      were
      at
      5
      mm
      and
      2
      mm,
      respectively.
      My
      mom
      figured
      the
      front
      had
      more
      life
      still
      because
      it
      was
      at
      5mm,
      so
      she
      only
      had
      the
      rear
      brakes'
      rotors
      resurfaced
      and
      brake
      pads
      replaced.
      They
      also
      cleaned
      the
      calipers.
      This
      cost
      ~$290.
      After
      this,
      the
      car
      still
      shook
      when
      braking
      but
      not
      as
      badly.
      So
      we
      went
      to
      Firestone,
      and
      they
      told
      us
      it
      could
      either
      be
      the
      rotors
      in
      the
      front
      being
      uneven
      or
      the
      calipers
      being
      uneven
      (?).
      My
      mom
      didn't
      want
      to
      pay
      another
      $300
      so
      she
      checked
      a
      different
      Firestone,
      which
      I
      went
      with
      her
      to.
      The
      tech
      told
      us
      after
      the
      brake
      inspection
      that
      it
      was
      likely
      an
      issue
      with
      the
      front
      brakes'
      rotors,
      and
      that
      we
      can
      resurface
      them
      and
      replace
      the
      brake
      pads.
      He
      said
      the
      calipers
      probably
      weren't
      the
      issue
      here
      and
      he
      wasn't
      sure
      why
      the
      other
      Firestone
      told
      us
      that
      might
      be
      an
      issue.
      The
      estimate
      was
      about
      $300.
      He
      also
      recommended
      we
      go
      back
      to
      the
      dealer
      and
      ask
      them
      why
      they
      OK'd
      the
      car
      when
      the
      brakes
      still
      shook
      (it
      says
      on
      our
      receipt
      that
      they
      test
      drove
      the
      vehicle,
      and
      the
      tech
      at
      the
      Firestone
      says
      that
      means
      they
      OK'd
      it....
      Or
      something?).
      So,
      what
      I'd
      like
      to
      know
      really
      is
      is
      it
      worth
      it
      to
      be
      shelling
      out
      $300
      to
      resurface
      the
      front
      rotors
      or
      are
      they
      giving
      us
      a
      bad
      deal?

      Things
      that
      I
      do
      I
      can
      think
      of
      (not
      representative
      of
      everyone
      ofc)
      :
      Putting
      off
      small
      tasks
      or
      chores.
      That's
      not
      to
      say
      you're
      lazy
      or
      unhygienic,
      but
      often
      I
      just
      disregard
      laundry
      or
      feeding
      my
      lizard
      or
      flossing
      and
      put
      it
      off
      until
      it's
      bedtime
      and
      then
      just
      go
      to
      sleep
      because
      I
      feel
      too
      drained.
      That's
      also
      why
      my
      room
      is
      messy
      a
      lot
      I
      get
      easily
      irritated,
      even
      though
      I
      recognize
      I'm
      being
      unreasonable
      in
      the
      moment
      the
      emotions
      get
      out
      of
      hand.
      I
      find
      this
      is
      mostly
      directed
      at
      my
      parents
      though.
      Probably
      a
      more
      common
      sign
      in
      teens.
      Being
      forgetful.
      Unless
      I
      write
      things
      down
      I
      will
      forget
      things
      are
      happening
      because
      days
      just
      kind
      of
      blur
      together.
      Also
      I
      sometimes
      ask
      what
      the
      time
      is
      and
      then
      have
      to
      ask
      again
      about
      three
      minutes
      late
      bc
      I
      forgot
      I
      asked
      and
      also
      my
      brain
      just
      like.
      Stops
      working
      and
      can't
      add
      three
      to
      the
      number
      I
      was
      just
      given.
      I
      can't
      really
      think
      of
      anything
      else,
      but
      if
      you're
      worried
      about
      yourself
      or
      someone
      else,

      Hit
      up

      or

      I

      they

      pretty
      nice
      quality
      and
      fashionable

      isn't

      most

      I
      would
      say
      an
      average
      price
      is
      $30
      and
      anything
      under
      would

      a
      really

      If
      she's
      into
      true
      crime,
      you
      could
      get
      her
      one
      of
      those
      "mystery
      mail"
      things
      where
      they
      send
      you
      a
      package
      with
      a
      mystery
      you
      get
      to
      solve.
      For
      self
      care
      stuff,
      maybe
      look
      for
      inspiration
      from
      things
      like
      fabfitfun
      and
      ipsy,
      and
      include
      small
      things
      that
      add
      up
      to
      your
      $100
      dollar
      budget
      Edit:
      also
      thought
      if
      she's
      into
      painting
      she
      might
      like
      a
      DIY
      craft
      kit,
      you
      can
      find
      plenty
      of
      neat
      ones
      on
      Etsy!
