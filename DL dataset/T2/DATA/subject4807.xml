<TEXT> Coding is a really valuable skill.

Have you considered volunteering and teaching it to others? I've personally found fulfillment in helping others learn to code. It's fun and free.

Incidentally, one of the people who helped me learn to program was doing so because he head a disease that was going to render him braindead in ten years, so he decided to give back by teaching others. </TEXT>

For example, falling asleep watching tv with my contacts in used to be a major mistake as I'd later have to pry stale contacts off my eyeballs while half asleep. Now, it's just falling asleep. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I highly recommend leaving the ones that make you feel bad. I prune my subs from time to time for a variety of reasons, and it's worked really well for me.

In fact, that's one of the reasons subreddits exist at all in the first place. One of the first subreddits I made was r/politics, and I made it because even though I was interested in the subject, I found I was starting every day pissed off and didn't like it. This was back around 2005, maybe 2006. The front page, which had been mostly programming and internet culture content until then, was being overrun with angry politics. Creating r/politics gave that content a home where it could thrive without drowning out the rest.

I now have a couple of [custom feeds](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/bpfyx1/introducing_custom_feeds_plus_a_community_contest/) that I use depending on my mood, and would love to see us invest more in this line of features. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the beginning...

It was one upvote for one karma point. That's still the basis, I believe, but just as post and comment scoring have some restrictions to prevent cheating (e.g. IP limits), karma scoring has even more.

The biggest gap between karma scoring and post scoring is we undid a (outdated) restriction on post scoring that is still on karma scoring. u/keysersosa wrote a post about it a couple years ago.

u/keysersosa, correct me if I'm wrong, but in theory we could bring karma scoring in line with post scoring if we weren't so busy otherwise ruining Reddit and whatnot. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you, Senator.

As it relates to r/the_donald specifically, we watch them closely, and we do our best to hold them to the same standards and policies as we do all communities. Before we action any community, we also speak to moderators regarding rule breaking behaviors. To that end, we have removed a number of their moderators over the years for not moderating to our standards, and we wouldnt hesitate to do this again, or take additional steps, should their behavior warrant it. While they can be offensive and antagonistic to the rest of Reddit, we have not found them to be in consistent violation of our content policies.

Yes, we do see individual posts and comments that cross the line, but the offending content also gets removed as we ask and expect, and we also take action against those individual users and accounts with suspensions or full bans from the site as appropriate.

I wish there was a solution that was as simple as banning the communitycertainly it would make some things easierbut the reality is that banning a large political community that isnt in violation of our policies would be hugely problematic, not just for Reddit, but for our democracy generally. Political speech is the most protected form of speech in the United States, and we are sensitive to that and take cues from the government when we think about our policies.

I know this isnt the answer many of you are looking for, but as we continue to deliberate and evolve our thinking, my hope is that you appreciate the complexity of this situation and understand our approach. </TEXT>

<TEXT> what can be done to curb manipulation by foreign entities on social media during election cycles?

Pasting from my [previous answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/bwpqqi/we_are_us_senator_ron_wyden_and_reddit_ceo_steve/epzexlh/):

Our primary focus is to detect and stop coordinated or otherwise inauthentic behaviors. Towards that end, weve increased accounts banned for content manipulation by 250% since 2017, and weve increased the rate at which we proactively action accounts from 29% in 2017 to 99% today. Additionally, we have built tools to help moderators proactively combat community interference (ne brigading) that are in alpha testing, and weve built a new reliable reporter system to surface information to our threat team even quicker.

Is there a way to recognize and eliminate bots?

Yes, though detecting and mitigating the impact of bots is a bit of an arms race. As our capabilities get better, the adversary also gets better. 

Detection today is reliant on technical indicators (such as IP) and leveraging our data scientists to detect abnormal behavior.

One common vector of attack is to hack otherwise legitimate dormant or insecure accounts and then use them to manipulate Reddit. Working against that, we have focused on improving account security to prevent malicious bots from taking over these accounts. Please see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/bletrr/how_to_keep_your_reddit_account_safe/) for how you can help improve the security of your account

Of course, not all bots are bad bots: r/subredditsimulator, automod, auto crossposting news bots, etc. One option is to ask helpful community bots to self-identify, leaving the potentially malicious bots for us to deal with. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For Steve Huffman, what are some policy changes that can happen on the company level that protect democracy but still stay true to the company's visions?

Reddits greatest strengths are our users and communities, who are our first line of defense. That communities can create their own rules and enforce them and that users can reject content and behaviors through downvotes and social pressure is very powerful.

Using fake news as an example, we think it is problematic for a private company, or even worse, me as an individual, or the government, to decide which news sources are valid and which are not. Communities, however, are free to choose which news sources they accept and reject. In fact, our news communities are among our most aggressively moderated. There is a huge difference between a private company deciding what is and isnt news vs our users doing the same thing.

That said, we do our best to fight coordinated or inauthentic content, working on both the policy and product fronts to prevent our voting systems from being abused while at the same time increasing the sophistication of community governance, and banning / limiting users that try to manipulate our systems and communities. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi all,

Today weve posted our latest [Transparency Report](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report-2018).

The purpose of the report is to share information about the requests Reddit receives to disclose user data or remove content from the site. We value your privacy and believe you have a right to know how data is being managed by Reddit and how it is shared (and not shared) with governmental and non-governmental parties.

Weve included a breakdown of requests from governmental entities worldwide and from private parties from within the United States. The most common types of requests are subpoenas, court orders, search warrants, and emergency requests. In 2018, Reddit received a total of 581 requests to produce user account information from both United States and foreign governmental entities, which represents a 151% increase from the year before. We scrutinize all requests and object when appropriate, and we didnt disclose any information for 23% of the requests. We received 28 requests from foreign government authorities for the production of user account information and did not comply with any of those requests.

This year, we expanded the report to included details on two additional types of content removals: those taken by us at Reddit, Inc., and those taken by subreddit moderators (including Automod actions). We remove content that is in violation of our site-wide policies, but subreddits often have additional rules specific to the [purpose, tone, and norms of their community](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~sjhaver3/The-internets-hidden-rules-cscw2018.pdf). You can now see the breakdown of these two types of takedowns for a more holistic view of company and community actions.

In other news, you may have heard that we closed an additional round of funding this week, which gives us more runway and will help us continue to improve our platform. What else does this mean for you? Not much. Our strategy and governance model remain the same. Andof coursewe do not share specific user data with any investor, new or old.

Ill hang around for a while to answer your questions.

Steve

<TEXT> A couple years ago, I was wondering this exact question.

Ups and downs are something we've had since *nearly* the first version of Reddit (but not the very first version: early iterations had words instead of arrows, but words were too subjective and restrictive).

Anyway... a couple years ago I considered the idea that downvotes were purely destructive, and that we'd be better off without them. My reasoning was that it feels bad to receive downvotes, and getting downvoted is an especially poor experience if you're a new user. If our goal is to make Reddit more welcoming and accessible, we were working against ourselves. Also, downvotes are weaponized by users and communities to harass and brigade, further compounding the problem.

However, despite their flaws, downvotes are a critical tool for communities to develop and maintain their voice, and without them we couldn't scale moderation. There are only so many moderators and far fewer admins, and by allowing community members to moderate content in a lightweight way, they can develop their own identities and voice and keep out the junk (most of it at least).

I know downvotes have their flaws, but they've been critical to growth of every large subreddit, making addressing their flaws supremely important. Improving downvotes is one of our current initiatives, and hopefully you'll feel the changes in the coming weeks if you haven't felt them already. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is great. There are some really good ideas in here that we might be able to make easier for you.

For example, what do you think about a feature to sync headlines (maybe automatically, or automatically add a flair and allowing a mod to edit?). This has always been complicated for a variety of reasons (title shenanigans on Reddit, and inconsistent publishers), but I think your specific use-case might be a good one to work with to make things easier, whether fancy tech or manual mod editing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sure, I can see how one would interpret it that way. Let me provide another way of looking at things:

Whether in an AMA or interview or in person, not only am I happy to answer hard questions, I generally look forward to it. It's in my nature to do so, often to my own detriment ([example](https://new.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8bb85p/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect/dx5go62/)), but I do look for questions that meet two criteria: questions that are asked politely, and asked in a manner that suggests the questioner will actually attempt to listen to my response (even if we have zero chance of agreeing).

In my AMA yesterday, I didn't see much of either, especially as it relates to r/the_donald. I did attempt to leave a [couple](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9ld746/you_have_thousands_of_questions_i_have_dozens_of/e75s1o8/) [responses](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9ld746/you_have_thousands_of_questions_i_have_dozens_of/e75wos8/) on the topic, and I have attempted to other respond many times in the past, but since my answer is never "yep, they're getting banned," I end up buried. So it goes.

It's really isn't my intention to ignore people. I'll probably do another AMA in the near future, and if someone wants to ask simply "why don't you ban r/the_donald?" I'll do my best to answer honestly and politely, though my answer will probably look a lot like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7u2zpi/not_my_first_could_be_my_last_state_of_the/dth6eq9/?utm_content=permalink utm_medium=front utm_source=reddit utm_name=announcements).

Anyway, long story short, if u/2Grateful2BHateful or any of you want to say Hi this weekend, I'm more than happy to chat about this or anything else. It'll be fine, might even be pleasant.

In addition to the standard best practices, we have a philosophical approach to storing as little personal information as possible. With limited exception, we don't know your names, addresses, genders, dob's, phone numbers, ssn's, or other sensitive information. We can't lose what we don't have.

<TEXT> (some of this I wrote elsewhere in the thread, but it's also relevant here)

In addition to updating the policy, we updated the tool as well. We may use it for both of the cases you mention.

The first version of quarantine was basically a death sentence for a community because it required community members to have verified email addresses. We decided that if we want to ban a community, we should just do so outright.

The quarantine feature is now much more flexible, allowing us to apply a variety of sanctions to a community, including an interstitial page, which is what is applied to WPD.

While we do believe a warning page is appropriate for WPD as the content there can be quite disturbing, I do regret lumping them in with the other toxic communities because the mods at WPD have been completely collaborative with us.

All quarantined communities continue to be subject to our site-wide content policies. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1) What are you referring to? Only new users see it by default. Most everyone else needs to opt in.

2) They've been gone a while, but we are chasing down an issue with incognito users seeing it more often. Please let me know if that's the case, or if you are having a different experience.*

3) Historically it has been optional, and it technically still is, though we're reconsidering it. While I was the original proponent of no-emails, we've found it to be problematic for a couple of reasons over the years: lost account passwords take time for our team to resolve, no emails makes tracking abuse more difficult, and there's more pressure than ever to fight such abuse, and it's generally helpful to be able to reach users where they are with important notifications.

4) Have heard this one before, and we're considering a couple other approaches. I didn't notice myself because my icons are always orange.

<TEXT> Thanks for the question, and thanks for hanging with us. Help is coming.

We know these kinds of accounts have been a problem, and theyre not easy for moderators to deal with alone. Weve talked a bit elsewhere about a relatively new team weve spun up to deal with content manipulation. While their focus has been largely on political manipulation, many of the same tools and methods theyre developing are also effective against these kinds of spam networks. As those things work their way into production, we hope youll see far less of these accounts in your subreddits.

One of the specific focuses of the Anti-Evil team going forward is to "reduce janitorial work" for our team and moderators alike.

Similarly, improved tools that don't require as much technical knowledge are on the roadmap. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **as it relates to the_donald**

Generally the mods of the_donald have been cooperative when we approach them with systematic abuses. Typically we ban entire communities only when the mods are uncooperative or the entire premise of the community is in violation of our policies. In the past we have removed mods of the_donald that refuse to work with us.

This does not mean we are not going to enforce our content policy on the_donald, nor does it mean we don't expect full cooperation from the mods in doing so.

**regarding the Russian interference post from a couple weeks ago**

We didn't remove anything. The [user removed the original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/9hqzb5/rfuckthealtright_mod_made_a_detailed_post_of_his/e6e4dzf/), and resubmissions of that post were removed as spam because some of the domains in the post were subsequently banned by us. </TEXT>

Here are a few of them:

* dedicated teams that enforce our policies, proactively go after bad actors, and create eng solutions to prevent them in the future,
* a new team specifically devoted to investigating efforts to manipulate our site,
* were working on improving communication to/from this team with a trusted reporter system and increasing our presence in subreddits where users are already investigating suspicious activity \[link: [investigations@reddit.zendesk.com](mailto:investigations@reddit.zendesk.com)\], 
* working with industry peers (and parts of the government working to ensure election security) to help us detect and stop emerging malicious activity
* As weve always done, well also have an in-house "war room" monitoring for suspicious activity around election day.

In the meantime, transparency is also critical, to help educate users and the public about techniques bad actors are trying out. We've been forthcoming about suspected influence campaigns with you (recent examples: [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8bb85p/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9bvkqa/an_update_on_the_fireeye_report_and_reddit/)) and will continue to do so as needed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8bb85p/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect/) documented exactly what we know and what we're doing about foreign influence on Reddit. We also listed the accounts that were involved so that you can see for yourself what they were up to.

In August, we wrote a [similar post](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9bvkqa/an_update_on_the_fireeye_report_and_reddit/) regarding an Iranian attempt at manipulation.

A couple weeks ago, we saw another round of posts centered around usareally.com, which is now banned. What we found in this case was that the users behind it were indeed of Russian origin, though we have no technical evidence that they are affiliated with the IRA. Similar to the IRA's previous efforts, this group's efforts were largely not effective: They submitted 953 posts to 130 different communities. Of the 264 posts submitted to r/the_donald, only one made it into the top 100, and 0 made it into the top 25.

We have a team dedicated to finding and preventing coordinated behavior to manipulate Reddit. The first question whenever we find anything is, "what could we have done to find this sooner?" In this case, we would have liked to have caught and banned the domains sooner because they were behaving in a spammy matter, and have adjusted our processes to do so going forward.

If you do find anything of this nature, please send it to directly to investigations@reddit.zendesk.com.

My original answer:

One thing we really haven't nailed yet is onboarding. We have incredible breadth and depth in our communities that isn't well represented in r/popular, which is what new users see when they first arrive to Reddit. I think we can do a much better job highlighting what Reddit's all about. </TEXT>

Hello again!

Its been a minute since [my last post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8bb85p/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect/), so I wanted to take some time out from our usual product and policy updates, [meme safety reports](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8we31l/the_memes_are_safe_repeat_the_memes_are_safe_for/), and waiting for r/livecounting [to reach 10,000,000](https://www.reddit.com/live/ta535s1hq2je/) to share some highlights from the past few months and talk about our plans for the months ahead.

We started off the quarter with a [win for net neutrality](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8jzyb6/update_we_won_the_net_neutrality_vote_in_the/), but as always, the fight against the Dark Side continues, with [Europe passing a new copyright directive](https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17851962/eu-copyright-directive-wikimedia-google-twitter-europe) that may strike a real blow to the open internet. Nevertheless, we will continue to fight for the open internet (and occasionally pester you with posts encouraging you to fight for it, too).

We also had a lot of fun fighting for the *not-so-free* but perfectly balanced world of r/thanosdidnothingwrong. Im always amazed to see redditors so engaged with their communities that they get [Snoo tattoos](https://www.reddit.com/r/thanosdidnothingwrong/comments/8zcga8/perfectly_balanced_as_all_things_should_be/). 

Speaking of bans, youve probably noticed that over the past few months weve banned a few subreddits and [quarantined](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9jf8nh/revamping_the_quarantine_function/) several more. We don't take the banning of subreddits lightly, but we will continue to enforce our policies (and be transparent with all of you when we make changes to them) and use other tools to encourage a healthy ecosystem for communities. Weve been investing heavily in our Anti-Evil and Trust   Safety teams, as well as a new team devoted solely to investigating and preventing efforts to interfere with our site, state-sponsored and otherwise. We also recognize the ways that redditors themselves actively help flag potential suspicious actors, and were working on a system to allow you all to [report directly to this team](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/9hjkv5/so_about_those_suspicious_activity_reports/).

On the product side, our teams have been hard at work shipping countless updates to our [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=reddit+Inc. hl=en) apps, like universal search and News. Weve also expanded Chat on mobile and desktop and launched an opt-in subreddit chat, which weve already seen communities using for game-day discussions and chats about TV shows. We started testing out a new hub for [OC (Original Content)](https://www.reddit.com/original) and a [Save Drafts feature](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8k8d1x/beta_new_save_draft_feature_for_text_and_link/) (with shared drafts as well) for text and link posts in the redesign. 

Speaking of which, weve made a ton of improvements to the redesign since we last talked about it in April. 

Including but not limited to night mode, user   post flair improvements, [better traffic pages for ](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/954a8p/traffic_page_update_see_your_subreddits_traffic/)

[mods](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/954a8p/traffic_page_update_see_your_subreddits_traffic/), accessibility improvements, keyboard shortcuts, a bunch of new community widgets, fixing key AutoMod integrations, and the ability to [have community styling show up on mobile as well](https://i.redd.it/l12cv7lqmwf11.png), which was one of the main reasons why we took on the redesign in the first place. I know you all have had a lot of feedback since we first launched it ([I have too](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8d8qws/despite_everyone_saying_the_redesign_is_perfect/)). Our teams have poured a tremendous amount of work into shipping improvements, and their #1 focus now is on improving performance. If you havent checked it out in a while, I encourage you to [give it a spin](http://new.reddit.com/).

Last but not least, on the community front, we just wrapped our second annual Moderator Thank You Roadshow, where the rest of the admins and I got the chance to meet mods in different cities, have [a bit of fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/8u5cca/quick_while_we_are_all_at_the_game/), and chat about Reddit. We also launched a new [Mod Help Center](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/9bnj3a/we_launched_a_new_knowledge_base_for_mods_and_we/) and new mod tools for Chat and the redesign, with more fun stuff (like Modmail Search) on the way.

Other than that, I cant imagine we have much to talk about, but Ill hang to around some questions anyway.

<TEXT> I left a longer [explanation](https://new.reddit.com/r/science/comments/8khscc/rscience_will_no_longer_be_hosting_amas/dz8nky8/) in that thread, but the gist of it is r/science isn't a default anymore and their tactic of removing more popular posts to promote AMAs is not allowed.

The "best" sort should actually help communities like r/science get more visibility. That's the whole point. Though it's not really relevant right now since their AMA shenanigans predate any algorithm changes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The decision for r/science to no longer host AMAs is disappointing, and blaming us at Reddit is counterproductive.

u/nallen, having met you personally a number of times and after personally trying to work through this issue with you over the past months, I'm disappointed you've taken this approach to mislead your community about what's going on.

So here's what's really going on:

**How it used to work**

r/science used to be a default community, which means it was one of one hundred communities that made up the front page of Reddit for most of 20112016. As a result, r/science and the other defaults had high visibility at the expense of non\-default communities.

r/science used to promote AMAs by removing other more popular posts so that the AMA could be top of r/science without the votes. This, combined with being a default community, sent a lot of traffic to these AMAs.

**How it works today**

We replaced the defaults with r/popular, which is basically a SFW version of r/all. This puts all communities on an equal footing.

We don't allow the post manipulation for obvious reasons. Here is a [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/77o0wm/friday_discussion_thread_what_unique_challenges/donto0j/?context=3) we had with u/nallen on this topic months ago.

We are indeed testing new sorting algorithms, but if anything they should help communities like r/science get more visibility. One of our engineers recently wrote a [pretty good post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/8kf5wm/reddits_first_pass_ranker/) about it.

**Going forward**

Regardless of u/nallen's decision, we will continue to work to improve our onboarding and sorting so that users get to see more of what they love, and we have in mind some specific features that will help promote "event" posts \(AMAs, game threads, episode threads\) in the future. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You can use the old layout indefinitely. Go to [https://www.reddit.com/prefs/](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/) and uncheck "use the redesign as my default experience." I know the prefs page is a bit of a mess. It's one of the things we're rebuilding in the redesign. We have no plans to turn off old.reddit.com. 

As for why:

1. New tech stack. The existing codebase is nearly impossible to build in. The redesign gives us a modern platform in which to develop. In the redesign we're able to ship lots of stuff every week. [Here's our most recent update.](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8jgu1q/51518_release_notes_inbox_count_post_flair/)
2. Easier to use. r2, our name for the legacy site, is quite difficult to grok. We see and lose a lot of potential users every day because they don't know wtf Reddit is. Engagement in our native apps is 25x higher even though the content is identical. Part of this is due to the phone form factor, but part of this is do to a more visceral UI.
3. Adapt Reddit to its content. When r2 was built, Reddit was 100 #37; outbound links and self\-posts. Today, we have a lot more media and have plans to add more post types. The UI should support that.
4. Ads. In\-feed ads are what advertisers want to buy. Yes, they're in\-feed, which I know isn't popular, but it also means our top post is an organic post now instead of an ad. We will continue to iterate on the styling.
5. Perception. We will no longer have to explain our ancient UI to potential partners, which really was quite a hurdle. Reddit being synonymous with "old and difficult to use" isn't good for business.
6. Portable styles. I know there's a lot of heat around this one as well, but structured styles allow community styling to work across platforms, which is important given the majority of our traffic today is mobile. It also makes community styling easier and therefore more accessible to more communities.

We've still got a lot to do, but we started rolling it out because we decided it was good enough to get going, and if we waited until it was perfect, we'd never ship. Plus, having the user base providing constant "feedback" is highly motivating to the team.

Personally, I've switched my desktop Reddit\-ing to the redesign and am pretty happy. I'd encourage folks to give it a try. If you don't like it, opt\-out and hopefully check back in in a month. It's updating rapidly. </TEXT>

That said, it was useful in the early days when spam was more of an arms race, we didnt have moderators or reporting, and our content policy was limited to spam.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's one of the [discussions](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/7spgg0/best_is_the_new_hotness/) from when we first started rolling it out.

As for creating a feedback loop, Reddit is different from other sites in that your Home feed is comprised of communities to which you've explicitly subscribed, which makes that effect less likely to happen unless a user intentionally does it to themselves. That said, we do look at others online as cautionary tales. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes. The "Best" sort on your home feed is the new version of the algorithm\(s\). We're constantly running tests here with the goal of surfacing content from your subscriptions that you're more likely to engage with. It also removes content you've already seen, which creates the appearance of much faster turnover.

The old algorithm, which was effectively a random selection of top posts from your subscriptions, is still accessible under "Hot." </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Update (4/12):** In the heat of a live AMA, I dont always find the right words to express what I mean.  I decided to answer this direct question knowing it would be a difficult one because it comes up on Reddit quite a bit. Id like to add more nuance to my answer:

While the words and expressions you refer to arent explicitly forbidden, the behaviors they often lead to are. 

To be perfectly clear, while racism itself isnt against the rules, its not welcome here. I try to stay neutral on most political topics, but this isnt one of them.

I believe the best defense against racism and other repugnant views, both on Reddit and in the world, is instead of trying to control what people can and cannot say through rules, is to repudiate these views in a free conversation, and empower our communities to do so on Reddit.

When it comes to enforcement, we separate behavior from beliefs. We cannot control peoples beliefs, but we can police their behaviors. As it happens, communities dedicated racist beliefs end up banned for violating rules we do have around harassment, bullying, and violence.

There exist repugnant views in the world. As a result, these views may also exist on Reddit. I dont want them to exist on Reddit any more than I want them to exist in the world, but I believe that presenting a sanitized view of humanity does us all a disservice. Its up to all of us to reject these views.

These are complicated issues, and we may not always agree, but I am listening to your responses, and I do appreciate your perspectives. Our policies have changed a lot over the years, and will continue to evolve into the future. Thank you.

**Original response:**

It's not. On Reddit, the way in which we think about speech is to separate behavior from beliefs. This means on Reddit there will be people with beliefs different from your own, sometimes extremely so. When users actions conflict with our content policies, we take action.

Our approach to governance is that communities can set appropriate standards around language for themselves. Many communities have rules around speech that are more restrictive than our own, and we fully support those rules. </TEXT>

<TEXT> On the contrary, user privacy has been paramount since our founding. From the beginning and through to this day we've not collected PII (Personally Identifying Information). We don't know your name, address, age, race, gender, and we don't want to know, and we'll never force you to share it to use Reddit. We only store the IP addresses you use to access Reddit for 100 days.

We do this for a couple of reasons:

* We don't want the burden of storing this information
* We don't want to risk compromising it
* What makes Reddit special is that people can be themselves. We believe disconnecting from your real world identity makes this possible.
* We want to minimize the surface area against which we can be subpoenaed

We haven't made any significant changes to our tracking in the last year beyond updating our endpoints to avoid site-breaking changes by ad-blockers (though not to block ad-blockers themselves).

We do track your clicks. We do this so we can better rank which subreddits you see in your home feed. You can opt out at https://www.reddit.com/prefs/. Furthermore, you can opt out of other advertising related tracking at https://www.reddit.com/personalization/. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Reddits 2017 transparency report and suspect account findings </TITLE>
<DATE> 2018-04-10 22:46:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi all,

Each year around this time, we share Reddits latest transparency report and a few highlights from our Legal teams efforts to protect user privacy. This year, our annual post happens to coincide with one of the biggest national discussions of privacy online and the integrity of the platforms we use, so I wanted to share a more in\-depth update in an effort to be as transparent with you all as possible.

First, here is our [2017 Transparency Report](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report). This details government and law\-enforcement requests for private information about our users. The types of requests we receive most often are subpoenas, court orders, search warrants, and emergency requests. We require all of these requests to be legally valid, and we push back against those we dont consider legally justified. In 2017, we received significantly more requests to produce or preserve user account information. The percentage of requests we deemed to be legally valid, however, [decreased slightly for both types of requests](https://i.redditmedia.com/pFVOHUupWLqk_MRNKJVgGzuKhSXkN4j0xym2LCdlnrU.png?fit=crop crop=faces%2Centropy arh=2 w=960 s=28bc738a240d9a7b240e6c54e7955eb3). \(Youll find a full breakdown of these stats, as well as non\-governmental requests and DMCA takedown notices, in the report. You can find our transparency reports from previous years [here](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/).\) 

We also participated in a number of amicus briefs, joining other tech companies in support of issues we care about. In Hassell v. Bird and Yelp v. Superior Court \(Montagna\), we argued for the right to defend a user's speech and anonymity if the user is sued. And this year, we've advocated for upholding the net neutrality rules \(County of Santa Clara v. FCC\) and defending user anonymity against unmasking prior to a lawsuit \(Glassdoor v. Andra Group, LP\).

Id also like to give an update to my last post about the [investigation into Russian attempts to exploit Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/827zqc/in_response_to_recent_reports_about_the_integrity/). Ive mentioned before that were cooperating with Congressional inquiries. In the spirit of transparency, were going to share with you what we shared with them earlier today:

In my post last month, I described that we had found and removed a few hundred accounts that were of suspected Russian Internet Research Agency origin. Id like to share with you more fully what that means. At this point in our investigation, we have found 944 suspicious accounts, few of which had a visible impact on the site: 

* 70 #37; \(662\) had zero karma
* 1 #37; \(8\) had negative karma
* 22 #37; \(203\) had 1\-999 karma
* 6 #37; \(58\) had 1,000\-9,999 karma
* 1 #37; \(13\) had a karma score of 10,000\+

Of the 282 accounts with non\-zero karma, more than half \(145\) were banned prior to the start of this investigation through our routine Trust   Safety practices. All of these bans took place before the 2016 election and in fact, all but 8 of them took place back in 2015. This general pattern also held for the accounts with significant karma: of the 13 accounts with 10,000\+ karma, 6 had already been banned prior to our investigationall of them before the 2016 election. Ultimately, we have seven accounts with significant karma scores that made it past our defenses.

And as I mentioned last time, our investigation did not find any election\-related advertisements of the nature found on other platforms, through either our self\-serve or managed advertisements. I also want to be very clear that none of the 944 users placed any ads on Reddit. We also did not detect any effective use of these accounts to engage in vote manipulation. 

To give you more insight into our findings, [here is a link to all 944 accounts](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/suspiciousaccounts). We have decided to keep them visible for now, but after a period of time the accounts and their content will be removed from Reddit. We are doing this to allow moderators, investigators, and all of you to see their account histories for yourselves.

We still have a lot of room to improve, and we intend to remain vigilant. Over the past several months, our teams have evaluated our site\-wide protections against fraud and abuse to see where we can make those improvements. But I am pleased to say that these investigations have shown that the efforts of our Trust   Safety and Anti\-Evil teams are working. Its also a tremendous testament to the work of our moderators and the healthy skepticism of our communities, which make Reddit a difficult platform to manipulate.

We know the success of Reddit is dependent on [your trust](https://www.reddit.com/r/CircleofTrust/comments/89slln/lets_see_if_you_can_hold_off_betraying_long/). We hope continue to build on that by communicating openly with you about these subjects, now and in the future. Thanks for reading. Ill stick around for a bit to answer questions.

<TEXT> This post is really the first time we've said anything of consequence regarding Russia, and we wanted to share it with you, the community, first.

 A lot of words were used, but very little was said.

Let me try again, with at least fewer words, but hopefully a little more clearly as well.

1. In regards to ads, we haven't seen much on Reddit. It's been an issue elsewhere online, but not a factor on Reddit. We'll stay vigilant going forward.

2. As it relates to actual Russia accounts on Reddit. We have found a few hundred accounts through a variety of means. The vast majority of these accounts were rejected by our communities back in 20152016 before Russia was even a topic of conversation. Our spam filters, community rules against self-promotion, and moderators banned nearly all of them. I don't want to give the impression the work stops there. That's what we've seen so far, and we're still looking deeply.

3. As for propaganda (Russian or otherwise, and there was plenty of American propaganda to go around) hosted elsewhere that was amplified by real organic users, weve seen a lot of that, both on Reddit and elsewhere. Reddit is a huge place with thousands of communities and opinions. That's both what makes us special and what creates conflict. That's not to say there isn't plenty of work for us: we will continue to invest in better tooling, both for our internal teams and for moderators; we'll continue to ensure our voting systems aren't being manipulated; and we'll continue grow our teams so we can enforce our policies at scale.

<TEXT> Point taken. Didn't mean to mislead. I was referring to ads bought directly on Reddit either through our sales team or ads.reddit.com.

We do also run programmatic ads that are bought through ad networks that include Reddit. These don't go through the same approval process, but they're also not specific to Reddit. We have had occasional problems in the past where an ad with sound or video sneaks through, usually when an ad is misclassified as non-video. These issues are uncommon, and we've basically eliminated them in the last year. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We dont take banning subs lightly. Each sub is reviewed by a humanand in some cases, a team of humansbefore it is banned for a content policy violation. In cases where a subs sole purpose is in direct violation of our policies (i.e. sharing of involuntary porn), we will ban a sub outright. But generally before banning, we attempt to work with the mods to clarify our expectations and policies regarding what content is welcome.

Communities do evolve over time, sometimes positively and sometimes negatively, so we do need to re-review communities from time to time, which is what's going on in this case. Revenue isn't a factor. </TEXT>

As I mentioned in the post, we've been taking action for a long time. We have been cagey about it publicly I know, which frustrates us as well, but it's an active investigation, and it's difficult to share specifics without undermining it.

I know this isn't a satisfying answer, but I promise you this is something we are deeply focused on.

<TEXT> These are the important questions we should be asking, both on Reddit and more broadly in America.

On Reddit, we see our users and communities taking action, whether it's moderators banning domains or users downvoting posts and comments. During the same time periods mentioned in this [Buzzfeed analysis](https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/viral-fake-election-news-outperformed-real-news-on-facebook), engagement of biased news sources on Reddit dropped 58% and engagement of fake news sources (as defined at the domain level by Buzzfeed) dropped 56%. Trustworthy new sources on Reddit receive 5x the engagement of biased sources and 100x the engagement of fake news sources.

The biggest factor in fighting back is awareness, and one of the silver linings of this ordeal is that awareness is higher than ever.

We still have a long way to go, but I believe we are making progress. </TEXT>

<TITLE> In response to recent reports about the integrity of Reddit, Id like to share our thinking. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2018-03-05 19:16:52 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In the past couple of weeks, Reddit has been mentioned as one of the platforms used to promote Russian propaganda. As its an ongoing investigation, we have been relatively quiet on the topic publicly, which I know can be frustrating. While transparency is important, we also want to be careful to not tip our hand too much while we are investigating. We take the integrity of Reddit extremely seriously, both as the stewards of the site and as Americans.

Given the recent news, wed like to share some of what weve learned:

When it comes to Russian influence on Reddit, there are three broad areas to discuss: ads, direct propaganda from Russians, indirect propaganda promoted by our users.

On the first topic, ads, there is not much to share. We dont see a lot of ads from Russia, either before or after the 2016 election, and what we do see are mostly ads promoting spam and ICOs.  Presently, ads from Russia are blocked entirely, and all ads on Reddit are reviewed by humans. Moreover, our [ad policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/advertising/policy-and-guidelines/reddit-advertising-policy) prohibit content that depicts intolerant or overly contentious political or cultural views.

As for direct propaganda, that is, content from accounts we suspect are of Russian origin or content linking directly to known propaganda domains, we are doing our best to identify and remove it. We have found and removed a few hundred accounts, and of course, every account we find expands our search a little more. The vast majority of suspicious accounts we have found in the past months were banned back in 20152016 through our enhanced efforts to prevent abuse of the site generally.

The final case, indirect propaganda, is the most complex. For example, the Twitter account @TEN\_GOP is now known to be a Russian agent. @TEN\_GOPs Tweets were amplified by thousands of Reddit users, and sadly, from everything we can tell, these users are mostly American, and appear to be unwittingly promoting Russian propaganda. I believe the biggest risk we face as Americans is our own ability to discern reality from nonsense, and this is a burden we all bear.

I wish there was a solution as simple as banning all propaganda, but its not that easy. Between truth and fiction are a thousand shades of grey. Its up to all of usRedditors, citizens, journaliststo work through these issues. Its somewhat ironic, but I actually believe what were going through right now will actually reinvigorate Americans to be more vigilant, hold ourselves to higher standards of discourse, and fight back against propaganda, whether foreign or not.

Thank you for reading. While I know its frustrating that we dont share everything we know publicly, I want to reiterate that we take these matters very seriously, and we are cooperating with congressional inquiries. We are growing more sophisticated by the day, and we remain open to suggestions and feedback for how we can improve. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Generally the mods of pics have been cooperative when we approach them with systematic abuses. Typically we ban entire communities only when the mods are uncooperative or the entire premise of the community is in violation of our policies. In the past we have removed mods of pics that refuse to work with us.

At Reddit, we try to separate behavior from beliefs. People are free to have whatever beliefs they want, but we do care about your behavior, specifically whether or not you are violating our content policy.

During the election, I defended that community because they represented a frustration in the US that a large part of the population needs random pictures about nothing.

We are on the eve of the Presidents SOTU and, sadly, alienation and cynicism are still deeply felt by much of our population, and were more divided than ever. I dont believe banning a community that represents no viewpoints does anything but make the problem worse. Its much more powerful for the greater population to reject these views than for us to ban them and turn them into martyrs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's how I see things going: we'll do our very best to get the redesign out. This is a massive effort, involves much of our team, and thousands of user testers (increasing to hundreds of thousands over the next month). The redesign will include another pass at profile pages. We don't have plans to shut off the legacy site, though it may run under a different domain. We'll leave old profile pages there.

Most of the feedback we've received on the new profiles are very addressable, so I'm confident we'll get it to a place most users like, but we'll have the old site just in case.

update: No this wasn't the plan from the beginning, but we also didn't plan on diverting resources to finish up the redesign. We still have a vision for profiles that we believe we be really good for the site, but we're not there yet. We hear your frustration, and will do our best to work out of the situation. </TEXT>

We recently gave our [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reddit.frontpage hl=en) apps major updates that, in addition to many of your most\-requested features, also includes a new suite of mod tools. If you havent tried the app in a while, please check it out! 

We added a ton of new features to Reddit, from spoiler tags and post\-to\-profile to chat \(now in beta for individuals and groups\), and were especially pleased to see features that didnt exist a year ago like crossposts and native video on our front pages every day.

Not every launch has gone swimmingly, and while we may not respond to everything directly, we do see and read all of your feedback. We rarely get things right the first time \(profile pages, anybody?\), but were still working on these features and well do our best to continue improving Reddit for everybody. If youd like to participate and follow along with every change, subscribe to r/announcements \(major announcements\), r/beta \(long\-running tests\), r/modnews \(moderator features\), and r/changelog \(most everything else\).

Im particularly proud of how far our Community, Trust   Safety, and Anti\-Evil teams have come. Weve steadily shifted the balance of our work from reactive to proactive, which means that much more often were catching issues before they become issues. Id like to highlight one stat in particular: at the beginning of 2017 our T S work was almost entirely driven by user reports. Today, more than half of the users and content we action are caught by us proactively using more sophisticated modeling. Often we catch policy violations before being reported or even seen by users or mods.

The greater Reddit community does something incredible every day. In fact, one of the lessons Ive learned from Reddit is that when people are in the right context, they are more creative, collaborative, supportive, and funnier than we sometimes give ourselves credit for \(Im serious!\). A couple great examples from last year include that time you all created an [artistic masterpiece](https://redditblog.com/2017/04/18/place-part-two/) and that other time you all organized [site\-wide grassroots campaigns](https://redditblog.com/2017/12/11/an-analysis-of-net-neutrality-activism-on-reddit/) for net neutrality. Well done, everybody.

In 2018, well continue our efforts to make Reddit welcoming. Our biggest project continues to be the web redesign. We know you have a lot of questions, so our teams will be doing a series of blog posts and AMAs all about the redesign, starting soon\-ish in r/blog. 

Its still in alpha with a few thousand users testing it every day, but were excited about the progress weve made and looking forward to expanding our testing group to more users. \(Thanks to all of you who have offered your feedback so far!\) If youd like to join in the fun, we pull testers from r/beta. Well be dramatically increasing the number of testers soon.

Were super excited about 2018. The staff and I will hang around to answer questions for a bit.

Happy New Year,

Steve and the Reddit team

update: I'm off for now. As always, thanks for the feedback and questions. </TEXT>

<TITLE> The FCCs vote was predictably frustrating, but were not done fighting for net neutrality. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-12-14 18:10:15 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Following todays disappointing vote from the FCC, Alexis and I wanted to take the time to thank redditors for your incredible activism on this issue, and reassure you that were going to continue fighting for the free and open internet. 

Over the past few months, we have been floored by the energy and creativity redditors have displayed in the effort to save net neutrality. It was inspiring to witness [organic takeovers](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/7j8fkt/an_analysis_of_net_neutrality_activism_on_reddit/) of the front page \(twice\), read touching [stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/6mtgtp/we_need_your_voice_as_we_continue_the_fight_for/) about how net neutrality matters in users everyday lives, see bills about net neutrality [discussed on the front page](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/7j6kn4/congress_has_set_out_a_bill_to_stop_the_fcc/) \(with over 100,000 upvotes and cross-posts to over 100 communities\), and watch redditors exercise their voices as citizens in the [hundreds of thousands of calls](https://thenextweb.com/insider/2017/11/22/reddit-net-neutrality-fcc-protest/) they drove to Congress.

It is disappointing that the FCC Chairman plowed ahead with his planned repeal despite all of this [public concern](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/12/12/this-poll-gave-americans-a-detailed-case-for-and-against-the-fccs-net-neutrality-plan-the-reaction-among-republicans-was-striking/?hpid=hp_hp-cards_hp-card-technology%3Ahomepage%2Fcard utm_term=.d11780a12cc2), not to mention the [objections expressed by his fellow commissioners](https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/12/16766324/fcc-commissioners-clyburn-rosenworcel-net-neutrality), [the FCCs own CTO](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/13/net-neutrality-repeal-warning-eric-burger-fcc-259968), [more than a hundred members of Congress](https://doyle.house.gov/sites/doyle.house.gov/files/documents/20171213DoyleNDelayLtrAll.pdf), [dozens of senators, and the very builders of the modern internet](https://www.salon.com/2017/12/12/senators-internet-pioneers-pen-letters-to-fcc-asking-to-cancel-thursdays-net-neutrality-vote/). 

Nevertheless, todays vote is the beginning, not the end. While the fight to preserve net neutrality is going to be longer than we had hoped, this is far from over.

Many of you have asked what comes next. We dont exactly know yet, but it seems likely that the FCCs decision will be challenged in court soon, and we would be supportive of that challenge. Its also possible that Congress can decide to take up the cause and create strong, enforceable net neutrality rules that arent subject to the political winds at the FCC. Nevertheless, this will be a complex process that takes time.

What is certain is that Reddit will continue to be involved in this issue in the way that we know best: seeking out every opportunity to amplify your voices and share them with those who have the power to make a difference. 

This isnt the outcome we wanted, but you should all be proud of the awareness youve created. Those who thought that theyd be able to quietly repeal net neutrality without anyone noticing or caring learned a thing or two, and we still may come out on top of this yet. Well keep you informed as things develop.

u\/arabscarab \(Jessica, our head of policy\) will also be in the comments to address your questions.

update: Please note the FCC is not united in this decision and find the dissenting statements from commissioners [Clyburn and Rosenworcel](https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/14/16776712/fcc-commissioners-democrat-statements-net-neutrality).

update2 (9:55AM pst): While the vote has not technically happened, we decided to post after the two dissenting commissioners released their statements. However, the actual vote appears to be delayed for security reasons. We hope everyone is safe.

update3 (10:13AM pst): The FCC votes to repeal 32. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's hard to say exactly, and that's part of the problem.

Most Americans have little or no choice of ISPs, and as it happens, the largest ISPs in the US are also some of the largest media companies.

For consumers, this means the ISP you are practically forced to use also can control what media you have access to.

For business, this means you are at the mercy of the ISPs, who as media companies are also likely competitors, to reach your customer. Bandwidth intensive, yet worldly important companies like Netflix and YouTube would have a really hard time getting off the ground if they existed at the whims of the major ISPs/media companies. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Update**: Thank you, everyone! We were in touch with Congressman Mike Doyle's office yesterday sharing some of your great stories from his home district in Pennsylvania (thanks, u/Bones_MD!), and they've heard you loud and clear. They are leading an effort to get Congress to ask the FCC to delay their December 14 vote, but they need as many Congressional members as possible to sign on. You can help them by calling or writing your member of Congress (look them up [here](https://www.house.gov/htbin/findrep) or through [www.battleforthenet.com](https://www.battleforthenet.com/)) and specifically asking him or her to sign onto Representative Doyle's letter to the FCC. We'll be doing the same. Keep it up, we're being heard!

*****

Hi All,

If you spent any time on Reddit last week, you [may have noticed a common theme](https://i.redditmedia.com/IhvWlif94HFLCRp0uNqDNjOEsSn2IdI6NVm-OaNnYvM.png?s=2fe8fbb8cd76df11a24f8a105e8a8fae) in the posts on your front page, so we wanted to take a moment to recap whats happened so far in the fight for net neutrality, underscore how important this issue is to Reddit, and share how we plan to continue to stand up for an internet that remains open and free.

On Tuesday, FCC chairman Ajit Pai [announced his intention to vote on a full rollback of the 2015 net neutrality rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/7ej943/fcc_announces_plan_to_repeal_net_neutrality/). While the pre-Thanksgiving timing of the announcement might have helped the news sneak by over the holidays, you all have helped prevent that from happening. Aside from ensuring that net neutrality was discussed IRL around Thanksgiving tables across the country, you brought the conversation about the open internet to almost every community on the site, from r/dataisbeautiful to r/trashpandas. Youve made [high-quality gifs](https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs/comments/7eklnu/when_i_hear_net_neutrality_is_under_fire_again/), flooded [the meme market](https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/comments/7eqxtf/ea_memes_and_fcc_memes_have_a_quick_return_of/), explained the issue to people who are [out of the loop](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/7elxew/whats_going_on_with_net_neutrality_ask_all_your/), and [given a history](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/7elqw7/redditor_lists_all_the_times_ipss_have_illegally/) of why net neutrality rules are essential. 

In just one week, you made 50,000 unique posts and over 350,000 comments related to net neutrality, generating over 21 million votes. While Tuesdays news hits close to home, we are grateful that the Reddit community cares just as much about net neutrality as we do at Reddit HQ.

As many of you know, the FCCs vote will happen on December 14 and is expected to pass. However, the vote is also expected to be challenged almost immediately in court, likely kicking off a long process that will take years to work through. During this time, Congress will likely try to legislate a fix. As a still-small company that owes its existence to net neutralitys giving us a fair chance in the marketplace, we will take every opportunity to share our perspective and give constructive input to this process. The [data says](https://www.scribd.com/document/353285485/Freedman-Consulting-Net-Neutrality-Poll) that Americans dont see this as a partisan issue, and neither do we.

Most of the activism right now is focused on driving messages to Congress and the FCC before December 14 \(including a protest in DC the day before the vote\).  The FCC has received a record 22 million comments on net neutrality but has indicated they have not reviewed comments that dont introduce new facts into the record or make serious legal arguments. Additionally, they believe a number of the comments are fake. While we are unlikely to change the FCCs decision, we encourage you to follow [Commissioner Rosenworcels suggestion](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-rosenworcel-fcc-net-neutrality-repeal-20171122-story.html) and continue to make a ruckus to let the FCC hear your individual stories on the importance of net neutrality.  

A few months ago, u/kn0thing [asked you to leave comments explaining why net neutrality is important to you](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/6mtgtp/we_need_your_voice_as_we_continue_the_fight_for/), and thousands of you delivered. Today, were asking you again to leave personal stories that we can use in the battle ahead. When we shared these stories with members of Congress this past July, we saw firsthand how effective they are at humanizing an issue that is too often perceived as an abstract battle between big corporate interests. 

We will continue to share these personal testimonials with more members of Congress, with the media, and potentially file them in court briefs. Our goal in this effort is to keep the personal dimension of the open internet top of mind for everyone who wants to repeal net neutrality. We know how powerful redditors banding together for a common cause can be, so our focus will continue to be on amplifying *your* voices, from Capitol Hill to  if it comes to it  the Supreme Court. 

So, please tell us in the comments:

*How would your life change if internet service providers started blocking or throttling certain internet traffic, or creating paid prioritization channels for certain content?* 

Include as much detail as you feel comfortable sharing. Generally, the more specific, the better. Mentioning your state and Congressional representative is especially useful.

Thank you.

u/ArabScarab \(Jessica Ashooh, our Head of Policy\), and I will hang around to answer questions. </TEXT>

Honestly, there have been times over the years, but they are few and far between.

<TEXT> The original vision for Reddit was quite small. We wanted to build a place where people could find new and interesting things online. Specifically, we wanted the site to have the community feel of Slashdot but with content curated by users.

As Reddit has grown, so has our vision. Reddit provides human connection and belonging, for which we believe people have a fundamental need. People come to Reddit to stay informed, to laugh, to learn, to argue, for support, to talk about freaky sex stuff... Reddit means a lot of things to a lot of people, and we want to provide our service for everyone on the planet.

Of course, the increase in size means we attract people who want to exploit us. We at Reddit Inc will do our best to prevent this, and the greater Reddit community will fight it as well.

Reddit is the most human place on the Internet, we'll fight to preserve this as hard as we can. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ah, well let me share another perspective.

A really important target user of this feature is the original content creator. Back in the beginning, we created the 1-in-10 rule, which meant that you were only allowed to submit 1-in-10 pieces of content from the same domain. This was in response to folks who would show up on Reddit, not know their way around, and submit every piece of content from their blog. We only had one community then, and this behavior was considered rude at best, and spam at worst. Keep in mind we had only links back then as well.

Skip ahead to today, we have many thousands of communities, proper spam prevention, and a massive userbase to curate good content. More than 60% of the content on Reddit exists in self posts. The users who create original, unique, relevant content off-site would be huge on Reddit if their content was in text posts hosted on Reddit instead. The only difference is in hosting. Profile pages are intended to be hosting for these users.

I was talking to a friend the other night who writes a blog dedicated to news for our neighborhood. It's great content, it would be right at home in a couple of places on Reddit. She is a writer, not a social media expert. I think it's unfair that in addition to creating good content we expect her to source nine other things from around the web so her stuff will be seen by the audience that will probably like it (I'm speaking on behalf of these communities. I'm a part of them). With new profile pages, she can submit her stuff to her profile, and if the relevant communities like it, they can crosspost it in. If they don't, she can build her own following on her profile. The end result is the can write and post without being treated like a spammer.

Hope this gives a little more context to what we're trying to build. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Reddit Inc looks for bots and other forms of manipulation. Whether around politics, advertising, or general cheating, we spend quite a bit of time on this, and have since pretty much the beginning. Everyone once and a while someone gets the best of us, but we continually improve, and it's rare they succeed twice.

Reddit itself is more resilient than other places online because our community is generally pretty good at sniffing out bullshit, and structure of our site means any one viewpoint isn't seen and accepted by everyone.

People have this notion that something is either misinformation or not, but the reality is there is a lot of space between misinformation, satire, people just being wrong, trolling, and biased reporting.

That said, our largest news communities strictly enforce specific rules about which sources are considered valid. </TEXT>

The result is that we are in fact getting to toxic communities far quicker than we have in the past. This is evidenced by the size of communities themselves. In 2015/16, these communities were often 50k+ subscribers. In the most recent wave, the largest community was about 7k. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. Great question. Subreddit governance is a huge challenge. We've not tackled it directly to date because there has been so much foundational work to get out of the way first (e.g. moderator guidelines, real mod tools, fully developed community team). We're getting closer.

2. We are still a small company, fewer than 300 people. We're actively hiring for weekend coverage right now, so hopefully the next time we chat we have this problem solved. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not sure the forum in which you're not getting responses. If you clarify, I will follow up with the team. However I can assure you we are receiving great feedback and even if you don't get a direct response from us, we are making a ton of improvements based on what we're hearing from testers.

There are a variety of goals, but chief among them is decreasing the bounce rate of first-time visitors and increasing time on site for everyone.

More generally, Reddit grows primarily through word of mouth. Many of us evangelize Reddit and tell people how awesome it is, what an impact it's made in their life, how much it makes them laugh, etc, and then when those new people decide to check out Reddit for the first time they're greeted with dystopian Craigslist. We'd like to fix that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We're taking another pass at r/popular, Reddit's default listing, as we speak, and I expect their remove.

r/all will remain unfiltered, but it's opt-in.

edit: you added a second question after I answered. See my [response re the_donald](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7a4bjo/time_for_my_quarterly_inquisition_reddit_ceo_here/dp708xx/). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Many of these links are probably in violation of our policy, but most are unreported, which is what alerts the mods and our team, especially when there are few votes. We'll consider them reported now.

Generally the mods of the_donald have been cooperative when we approach them with systematic abuses. Typically we ban entire communities only when the mods are uncooperative or the entire premise of the community is in violation of our policies. In the past we have removed mods of the_donald that refuse to work with us.

Finally, the_donald is a small part of a large problem we face in this countrythat a large part of the population feels unheard, and the last thing we're going to do is take their voice away.

<TEXT> There were two main reasons. The first is that we take our time on policy changes. We want to be thoughtful about the policy itself, which takes time, and the policy roll-out was done in conjunction with mass enforcement actions, which also take time to plan and coordinate.

The second reason is that we waited until we had more staff on our Trust and Safety team so we guarantee coverage.

Finally, in the wake of Charlottesville, which was my home for five years, I was quite emotional, and it took time to think clearly about what we were going to do. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 2FA is opt-in, though we highly encourage it for high-value accounts (e.g. moderators of large subreddits).

The new profile pages will eventually be enabled for everyone, but the migration will be slow. Whether you use the new features they enable (namely, posting directly to your profile) is optional. In the case where you don't use it, the new profile pages are basically an easier-to-read version of the current overview page.

We'll never require you sync your FB account, not that it's even an option now. </TEXT>

I can't get too specific in this forum, but we detect and prevent manipulation in a variety of ways, generally looking at where accounts come from, how they work together, and behaviors of groups of accounts that differ from typical behavior.

Folks have been trying to manipulate Reddit for a long time, so this is not a new problem for us. Their tactics and our responses do evolve over time, so it's been constant work for us over the years. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello Everyone!

Its been a few months since I last did one of these, so I thought Id check in and share a few updates.

Its been a busy few months here at HQ. On the product side, we launched [Reddit-hosted video and gifs](https://www.reddit.com/domain/v.redd.it/); [crossposting](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6vths0/beta_crossposting_better_attribution_for_cat/) is in beta; and Reddits web redesign is in alpha testing with a limited number of users, which well be expanding to an opt-in beta later this month. Weve got a long way to go, but the feedback weve received so far has been super helpful \(thank you!\). If youd like to participate in this sort of testing, head over to r/beta and subscribe.

Additionally, well be slowly migrating folks over to the new profile pages over the next few months, and two-factor authentication rollout should be fully released in a few weeks. Weve made many other changes as well, and if youre interested in following along with all these updates, you can subscribe to r/changelog.

In real life, we finished our moderator thank you tour where we met with hundreds of moderators all over the US. It was great getting to know many of you, and we received a ton of good feedback and product ideas that will be working their way into production soon. The next major release of the native apps *should* make moderators happy \(but you never know how these things will go\).

Last week we expanded our content policy to clarify our stance around violent content. The previous policy forbade inciting violence, but we found it lacking, so we expanded the policy to cover any content that encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence or physical harm against people or animals. We dont take changes to our policies lightly, but we felt this one was necessary to continue to make Reddit a place where people feel welcome.

Annnnnnd in other news:

In case you didnt catch our [post](https://redditblog.com/2017/10/18/announcing-the-reddit-internship-for-engineers-rife/) the other week, were running our first ever software development internship program next year. If fetching coffee is your cup of tea, check it out!

This weekend is [Extra Life](https://redditblog.com/2017/10/26/extra-life-is-almost-here-join-team-reddit-on-nov-4th-to-raise-money-for-childrens-hospitals/), a charity gaming marathon benefiting Childrens Miracle Network Hospitals, and [we have a team](https://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=cms.page id=1251). Join our team, play games with the Reddit staff, and help us hit our $250k fundraising goal.

Finally, today were kicking off our [ninth annual Secret Santa exchange on Reddit Gifts](https://www.redditgifts.com/exchanges/secret-santa-2017/)! This is one of the longest-running traditions on the site, connecting over 100,000 redditors from all around the world through the simple act of giving and receiving gifts. We just opened this year's exchange a few hours ago, so please join us in spreading a little holiday cheer by [signing up today](https://www.redditgifts.com/exchanges/secret-santa-2017/).

Speaking of the holidays, Im no longer allowed to use a computer over the Thanksgiving holiday, so Id love some ideas to keep me busy.

-Steve

update: I'm taking off for now. Thanks for the questions and feedback. I'll check in over the next couple of days if more bubbles up. Cheers! </TEXT>

You're not wrong. It's more like, once we've released more, your feedback will be more valuable, but right now the product is in its infancy so it doesn't make much sense. That said, we've actually have learned a lot, so I'm content with the current situation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I more or less answered this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/6qptzw/with_so_much_going_on_in_the_world_i_thought_id/dkz5xi4/).

The short answer is: there was some good feedback in that thread, but also plenty that isn't super relevant. With profile pages in particular, I think showing will be better than telling. It's going to take some time for it to be a cohesive product.

The feedback was received, and I think when the dust settles it'll be received much better.

Update: I realize I didn't actually give you a a product update. Profile pages as a feature are about 25% complete. We have a lightly redesigned page (temporary) and personal subreddits. This gives people a place to post, but not much incentive to do so. What we're missing that we believe makes this feature more cohesive are privacy controls, smart comment display (most reddit original content are in comments), and x-posting as a first-class feature (e.g. u/shitty_watercolour can post to his profile and he or others can x-post in r/comics or r/funny or whatever). I generally don't like sharing features before they actually exist, but that's the gist of what's to come over the next couple of months. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That was an outdated rule from before users could make their own subreddits. Reddit was one community, and we felt it was unfair to promote only one thing. Reddit was all links (this was before self posts as well) back then with very little original content.

However, times have changed. 

The 10% rule was hostile to original content producers, which is ironic because original content is the most valuable. Why would we require you post 9 random posts for every 1 original post?

Moderators are free to moderator however they like, however.

<TEXT> Assuming we're talking about profile pages...

 If there is negative feedback during the beta stage of a feature, isn't it much more beneficial for a company to roll back

Not always. It takes time to get these things right, which is why we're moving slowly. We received a lot of feedback, some of which was actionable (e.g. more privacy controls), some of which isn't useful (e.g. you're turning in Facebook!).

The reality is the feature isn't yet cohesive, so much of the user feedback lacks context. I wish we could do a perfect job explaining what we're trying to do, but sometimes it's better to just build it, launch it, and see how it's used. In this case, we're still early in the process. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You are making a couple of incorrect assumptions.

We've reduced spam by 95% over the last year. There is significantly less spam to report. Yes, there is still spam, and reporting it is still valuable.

It's true you don't get an admin response on every report. We receive millions of reports every month. The entire company is 230 people, with the T S team being significantly smaller, so we can't possible respond to every one of them. The reports are valuable, however. They point the T S and AE teams in the right direction so they can fight abuse at scale.

You may feel we're less sincere, but we're not. We all love Reddit as much as ever, and our goal is to make it as good as possible. We can't do everything at once,  and we know we have a long way to go, but we've made a lot of progress.

Stop. Reddit is 300M+ people. It's a big place, and according to users, it has been in steady decline for over a decade now.

The reality is not everyone is interested in an English-only, US-centric view of the world.

On one hand, we want the site to be more relevant to folks all over the world, and geo-specific versions of Reddit increase the odds that a first time user will find something relevant to them.

However, if we get really good at relevancy that means we've gotten really good at creating echo-chambers, which is not our goal.

For as far as we can see, there will continue to be a few different ways to interact with Reddit: your Home feed, which is stuff you've explicitly chosen, r/popular, which is stuff the whole world finds interesting, and optional geo versions of r/popular, which are a little more specific to your location.

The product evolution is fluid, and we'll keep an eye on things as we evolve. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi All,

Weve got some updates to share about Reddit the platform, community, and business:

First off, thank you to all of you who participated in the Net Neutrality Day of Action earlier this month! We believe a free and open Internet is the most important advancement of our lifetime, and its preservation is paramount. Even if the FCC chooses to disregard public opinion and rolls back existing Net Neutrality regulations, the fight for Internet freedom is far from over, and Reddit will be there. Alexis and I just returned from Washington, D.C. where we met with members and senators on both sides of the aisle and shared your [stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/6mtgtp/we_need_your_voice_as_we_continue_the_fight_for/) and passion about this issue. Thank you again for [making your voice heard](https://redditblog.com/2017/07/14/redditors-rally-on-the-day-of-action-to-save-net-neutrality/).

Were happy to report Reddit IRL is alive and well: while in D.C., we hosted one of a series of meetups around the country to connect with moderators in person, and back in June, Redditors gathered for Global Reddit Meetup Day across 120 cities worldwide. We have a few more meetups planned this year, and so far its been great fun to connect with everyone face to face.

Reddit has [closed another round of funding](https://www.recode.net/2017/7/31/16037126/reddit-funding-200-million-valuation-steve-huffman-alexis-ohanian). This is an important milestone for the company, and while Reddit the business continues to grow and is healthier than ever, the additional capital provides even more resources to build a Reddit that is accessible, welcoming, broad, and available to everyone on the planet. I want to emphasize our values and goals are not changing, and our investors continue to support our mission.

On the product side, we have a lot going on. Its incredible how much were building, and were excited to show you over the coming months. Our video beta continues to expand. A few hundred communities have access, and have been critical to working out bugs and polishing the system. Were creating more [geo-specific](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6j3dkw/testing_geo_popular_your_local_frontpage_of_the/) views of Reddit, and the web redesign (codename: Reddit4) is well underway. I cant wait for you all to see what were working on. The redesign is a massive effort and will take months to deploy. We'll have an alpha end of August, a public beta in October, and we'll see where the feedback takes us from there.

Were making some changes to our [Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy). Specifically, were phasing out Do Not Track, which isnt supported by all browsers, doesnt work on mobile, and is implemented by fewif anyadvertisers, and replacing it with our own [privacy controls](https://www.reddit.com/personalization). DNT is a nice idea, but without buy-in from the entire ecosystem, its impact is limited. In place of DNT, we're adding in new, more granular privacy controls that give you control over how Reddit uses any data we collect about you. This applies to data we collect both on and off Reddit  (some of which ad blockers dont catch). The information we collect allows us to serve you both more relevant content and ads. While there is a tension between privacy and personalization, we will continue to be upfront with you about what we collect and give you mechanisms to opt out. Changes go into effect in 30 days.

Our Community, Trust   Safety, and Anti-Evil teams are hitting their stride. For the first time ever, the majority of our enforcement actions last quarter were proactive instead of reactive. This means were catching abuse earlier, and as a result we saw over 1M fewer moderator reports despite traffic increasing over the same period (speaking of which, we updated [community traffic](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6pxyvy/traffic_page_update_now_includes_data_from_all/) numbers to be more accurate).

While there is plenty more to report, Ill stop here. If you have any questions about the above or anything else, Ill be here a couple hours.

Steve

<TEXT> That's right. We ran Reddit out of a long-living CMUCL process. Instead of reloading everything, I (I'm always hesitant to use I instead of We, but it was really just me doing the dev at the time) updated the process one function at a time by pasting in newly updated code. Because of this, the instance of Reddit running in production wasn't necessarily documented in any specific code. It resembled more a well-aged cheese cultureimpossible to reproduce.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It was u/powerlanguage. I've been telling him for weeks he's crazy, but r/place really went to his head.

But, actually... Everything I said in the last post is still true. CSS shouldn't be the only way to customize a community. We are still going to build a structured system, which will be more accessible, cross-platform, and less brittle. If we do a job with this and the widget system, I expect CSS to be less required, but we can leave CSS for more advanced use-cases.

Happy Cakeday! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi Mods,

I wanted to follow up on the [CSS and redesign post](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/66q4is/the_web_redesign_css_and_mod_tools/) from a few weeks back and provide some more information as well as clarify some questions that have emerged.

Based on your feedback, we will allow you to continue to use CSS on top of the new structured styles. This will be the last part of the customization tool we build as we want to make sure the structured options we are offering are rock solid. Also, please keep in mind that if you do choose to use the advanced option, we will no longer be treading as carefully as we have done in the past about breaking styles applied through CSS^1.

To give you a sense of our approach, were starting with a handful of highly-customized communities (e.g. r/overwatch and r/gameofthrones) and seeing how close we can get to their existing appearance using the new system. Logos, images, colors, spoilers, menus, flairs (all kinds), and lots more will be supported. I know youd like to see a list of everything, but we think the best approach will be to show instead of tell, which were racing to as quickly as possible.

The widget system I mentioned in the last post isnt directly related. Many communities have added complex functionality over the years (calendars, scoreboards, etc). A widget system will elevate these features to first-class status on Reddit, with the aim of making them both more powerful and reuseable. Yes, were evaluating how we would accept user-created widgets.  We intend for widgets to be able to be updated via the API, so youll still be able to create dynamically updating content in your subreddit sidebar.

This change, and the redesign in general, is going to happen slowly.  We will will not be abruptly cutting everyone over to the new site at once.  We know it wont be perfect at first (unlike the current site), and plan to include plenty of time to solicit feedback and make iterations.  Sharing our plans for subreddit customization this far advance with you is part of this process.

Well start with a small alpha group and create a subreddit to solicit feedback.  As we continue to add features, well expand the testing group to an opt-in beta.  If youd like to participate in the alpha please add a reply to [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6auyq9/reddit_is_procss/dhhmebb/).  Please note, signing up does not guarantee a spot in the alpha.  We want to be able to be responsive to the alpha testers, and keeping the initial group small has proved to be effective in the past.

Id like thank everyone who has provided feedback on this topic.  There have been some very [constructive](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/677rba/some_brainstorming_about_potential_widgets_in_the) [threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/66rdiy/crowdsourcing_new_subreddit_widgets/).  Id also like to take a moment to appreciate how civil the feedback has been.  This is a topic many of you feel passionate about.  Thank you for keeping things constructive.

Cool?

Cool.

I appreciate all the feedback so far (and the fact that its been overwhelmingly polite!).

I had a script that would scrape a bunch of websites (Slashdot, Boingboing, etc) and print all the links it had never seen before. The first day it printed a bunch of navigational garbage, but on the second day it was all interesting content. We'd write titles for the those links and submit them to Reddit.

Our submit page looked a little bit different: we had an extra field for username. Reddit would automatically register that name if it was available and submit the link as that "new" user.

We did this for about 4 months, if I recall. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Do you think this leads to any "cliquey-ness" in the industry?

I suppose it can. It really depends what you mean by culture. Culture are the things we have in common, so it depends on what you want those things to be. For example Reddit hires a lot of optimists. Does that make us cliquey? Maybe. It also makes Reddit a cheery place to work.

 Are there certain personality traits that, while maybe not flaws per se, just don't gel with your workplace culture?

Ego that outpaces your skill really grinds my gears.

 How much can a great attitude make up for underdeveloped skills?

A great attitude leads to great skills!

 How much can great programming skills make up for an underdeveloped personality? What is a "bad personality"?

I think if you're the sort of person asking these questions, you're probably fine. It's the people unaware of themselves that are unpleasant to work with.

As for how to make something big, that's a broad question. I suppose if I were to distill it into a single point: it's put yourself in a position to build something big:

* It's more fair. We're paying people for their level of work, not their ability to negotiate.
* I'd rather start our relationship happy that we found a good fit rather than tense from a negotiation.
* I get no enjoyment getting someone for cheap, but the hire gets a lot of disappointment.
* It's easier. We look up your level in the chart, and that's it. We don't have to do any internal negotiation either.

Every company is different. Some will lowball you because they think they have to. Some will lowball you because they're assholes. Some will come in really high because they have tons of money.

One thing that helped me is acknowledging my strengths and weaknesses, and playing to the former while minimizing the latter. I'm a good mentor and coach, but I can also be scattered and aloof. I still love working with beginners, but I'm not great a project managing.

When I fire people, I try to get myself into a mental state where I want to do it. Sometimes it's because the person who we're letting go will actually be happier elsewhere. Other times, I think about the time and stress I'm saving someone else on the team. </TEXT>

hahaha. Have you seen the Reddit code base? The stuff I wrote is a mess. There are lots of reasons for this:

* I was a worse programmer back then
* Ten years and dozens of engineers in a code base often leads to a mess
* We made tradeoffs to ship quickly.

Quality is something that has always been important to me, but more important has been results. Users don't care about your code quality. Plus, every line you write, you probably be able to write it better in a year (because you have more skills and context). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've had favorites over the years for different reasons:

* Lisp: It's so flexible you can adapt to almost any style. The first version of Reddit was written in Common Lisp.
* C: you can't program C without really knowing how computers work.
* Python: My favorite language to read, write, and teach in. Reddit is primarily Python.
* Go: As I've aged, I've developed a deeper and deeper appreciate for types. Go seems to have the right balance of real-word practicality, modern features, and a Python-like feeling of coherence when you finally get it right. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are few things you are learning now that *aren't* transferable into the future, so don't worry too much about that.

There are two paths to becoming a CTO:

* Start your own company and be the CTO (that's basically what I did).
* Be the best engineer at the company you work for, and by best engineer, it's more than just being a good programmer. You need to be able to communicate up and down; have a high enough ego to be confident in your decisions, and a low enough ego to constantly be learning; and be flexible enough to take on all sorts of challenges, engineering or not.

<TEXT> I often talk to students who are struggling with the decision of whether to go to a company, join a startup, or start their own thing. The truth is, there isn't a wrong answer. The only wrong answer is to do multiple things at once. No matter what you choose, work hard and keep your mind open to learning. There is plenty of time in life to do all these things. You can always change your mind. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The strongest newbie's I've hired have a couple things in common:

* They have a great attitude. They work on every problem thrown at them, and when they have nothing to do, they find more work. One guy I work with (who worked with me at Hipmunk and is now at Reddit), used to sit next to me and just fix my bugs. I could move a lot faster, and he learned a ton.

* They study outside of work. I think this advice holds true forever, but it's certainly true in the beginning: even a single weekend of studying a specific technology will make you dramatically better. The aforementioned engineer was trying to get better at frontend. Instead of waiting for the work to come to him, he learned an incredible amount of CSS in one weekend and came to work on Monday ready to take on a never level of work he couldn't do on Friday. </TEXT>

Not sure. PM me, and I will investigate.

 Also, I noticed you have a lot of Senior positions available. How do you feel about engineers who don't have the required number of years experience applying to those positions?

If you can walk the walk, years of experience don't matter.

We're not doing a formal internship program this yearwe just have too much going on to do a good job on it. That said, every once and a while someone slips through the cracks into a job here...

**Generic Advice**

Whenever I'm looking at interns / beginners, I'm primarily looking for someone who both has a great attitude and a passion for programming. I know we're hiring someone who doesn't know everything (and hopefully they know that as well...), but the hope is that we're finding the people who will never actually be on the job market (i.e. they get hired as an intern and their employer never lets them go). We have a handful of such folks here. </TEXT>

These are all great examples of cool stuff folks have done with CSS, and there are many more.

My goal today is to affirm that while CSS isn't the technology of the future for us, subreddit customization is important, and we're going to continue to evolve it.

I doubt I can convince you today with anything I say, but we're going to move forward, test carefully, and I hope you'll be a part of the process. </TEXT>

<TITLE> The web redesign, CSS, and mod tools </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-21 18:04:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi Mods,

You may recall from my [announcement post](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/5q4qmg/out_with_2016_in_with_2017/) earlier this year that I mentioned were currently working on a full redesign of the site, which brings me to the two topics I wanted to talk to you about today: Custom Styles and Mod Tools.

##**Custom Styles**

Custom community styles are a key component in allowing communities to express their identity, and we want to preserve this in the site redesign. For a long time, weve used CSS as the mechanism for subreddit customization, but well be deprecating CSS during the redesign in favor of a new system over the coming months. While CSS has provided a wonderful creative canvas to many communities, it is not without flaws:

* Its web-only. Increasing users are viewing Reddit on mobile (over 50%), where CSS is not supported. Wed love for you to be able to bring your spice to phones as well.
* CSS is a pain in the ass: its difficult to learn; its error-prone; and its time consuming.
* Some changes cause confusion (such as changing the subscription numbers).
* CSS causes us to move slow. Wed like to make changes more quickly. Youve asked us to improve things, and one of the things that slows us down is the risk of breaking subreddit CSS (and third-party mod tools).

Were designing a new set of tools to address the challenges with CSS but continue to allow communities to express their identities. These tools will allow moderators to select customization options for key areas of their subreddit across platforms. For example, header images and flair colors will be rendered correctly on desktop and mobile.

We know great things happen when we give users as much flexibility as possible. The menu of options well provide for customization is still being determined. Our starting point is to replicate as many of the existing uses that already exist, and to expand beyond as we evolve.

We will also natively supporting a lot of the functionality that subreddits currently build into the sidebar via a widget system. For instance, a calendar widget will allow subreddits to easily display upcoming events. Wed like this feature and many like it to be accessible to all communities.

How are we going to get there? Well be working closely with as many of you as possible to design these features. The process will span the next few months. We have a lot of ideas already and are hoping youll help us add and refine even more. The transition isnt going to be easy for everyone, so well assist communities that want help (i.e. well do it for you). u/powerlanguage will be reaching out for alpha testers.

##**Mod Tools**

Mod tools have evolved over time to be some of the most complex parts of Reddit, both in terms of user experience and the underlying code.  We know that these tools are crucial for the maintaining the health of your communities, and  we know many of you who moderate very large subreddits depend on third-party tools for your work. Not breaking these tools is constantly on our mind (for better or worse).

Were in contact with the devs of Toolbox, and would like to work together to port it to the redesign. Once that is complete, well begin work on updating these tools, including supporting natively the most requested features from Toolbox.

The existing site and the redesigned site will run in parallel while we make these changes. That is, we dont have plans for turning off the current site anytime soon. If you depend on functionality that has not yet been transferred to the redesign, you will still have a way to perform those actions.

While we have your attention were also growing our internal team that handles spam and bad-actors. Our current focus is on report abuse. Weve caught a lot of bad behavior. We hope you notice the difference, and well keep at it regardless.

##**Moving Forward**

We know moderation can feel janitorialthankless and repetitive. Thank you for all that you do. Our goal is to take care much of that burden so you can focus on helping your communities thrive.

Big changes are ahead. These are fundamental, core issues that well be grappling with togetherchanges to how communities are managed and express identity are not taken lightly. Well be giving you further details as we move forward, but wanted to give you a heads up early.

Thanks for reading.

update: now that I've cherry-picked all the easy questions, I'm going to take off and leave the hard ones for u/powerlanguage. I'll be back in a couple hours. </TEXT>

It depends on the nature of the request. For something like child pornography, yes, we have to report. For something like how to make drugs, we don't. It doesn't mean we won't see a subpoena, though.

 If so, how do you reduce false positives? If not, how do you handle such a large load?

<TITLE> It's that time of year again. We just published our 2016 Transparency Report. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-03 21:58:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello Everyone,

We just posted our [2016 Transparency Report](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/2016). It details government and law-enforcement-agency requests for private information about our users. We publish it each year, and you can find previous versions [here](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/).

Our goals in publishing the report are to demonstrate Reddits commitment to remaining a place that encourages authentic conversation and to share with you the ways in which we work to protect the privacy of our users.

Generally, the types of requests we receive are subpoenas, court orders, search warrants, and emergency requests. We require all requests to be legally valid, and, in 2016, we did not produce records in response to approximately 40% of them, which is on par with previous years.

Another way in which we stand up on behalf of users is through participation in [amicus briefs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amicus_curiae). Basically, we say we support a party and their position. In tech, it is one of the few areas in which many companies work together to send a strong message to courts.

We participated in a couple amicus briefs this year, including one on [behalf of Facebook](https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/In-re-381-Search-Warrants-Amicus-Brief.pdf) in the state of New York, who was served with a bulk warrant for account information, photos, private messages, and other information for 381 individuals. Reddit joined with a number of other tech companies in supporting Facebooks arguments that questioned the legal validity of the bulk search warrant and the associated gag order which prevented Facebook from notifying its users.

Again, in support of Facebook, we joined a group to fight against a Section 230 ruling in the state of California. Section 230 essentially allows platforms like Reddit to exist because it grants broad immunity to online service providers from harms arising out of third-party content. In this case, the trial court had held that Jason Cross a/k/a Michael Knight (Knight) could seek to hold Facebook liable for failing to remove third-party content that Knight found objectionable.  Amici [filed a response](http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/historical/1378/) in support of Facebook and to argue against the trial courts order finding that California right of publicity claims fall outside the broad scope of Section 230s immunity. 

Thank you for reading. I hope that you take this report as a sign of our commitment to your privacy and trust.

Ill answer any questions that I can, but please understand I cant always be completely candid when it comes to legal matters.

Steve (subject4807)

<TEXT> Thanks for your thoughts. While the scenario you paint is possible, I think it's the bleakest possible outcome, and one nobody wants to see happen. We still have plenty of work to do, and the feature will continue to evolve as we roll it out.

Instead of the total destruction of Reddit, what we'd like to accomplish is to make it easier for folks to find a place to share on Reddit.

Remember that time when u/GovSchwarzenegger wrote an op-ed for Reddit about marriage equality and then was immediately banned? That is so silly. Reddit is a place to share, discuss, and express yourself, and you should be able to do so without fear of immediately getting crushed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What we really want to see is for users who have things to share, they have a place to put it. Even I have this problem. I often have ideas for a post, but don't know which community I should submit it to. r/announcements, my main home, probably isn't appropriate. Even if I know the right community, I may not know the community norms and rules. This gives me a place to put my thoughts without worry that I'm going to get insta-banned. If someone decides it's appropriate for their community, they can x-post it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Will you counteract SEO spam posted on user's profiles at all?

We'll continue to fight spam wherever it is. We have made a lot of progress in the last year, reducing spam reports by over 90%. The vast majority of spam is not caught by automod or humans.

 How will I be able to find OC creators if not by their real name?

It's important to us that Reddit is useable without real names. Folks can choose to disclose this if they want, of course.

As for discoverability, a user's posts could be x-posted elsewhere, which is how Reddit works today, or the user may have their own community, which a handful already do now.

 Will personal posts be included in the reddit-wide search (please no)?

Search is getting a complete overhaul at the moment, so this will likely be an option.

 Will we be able to differentiate between profile and subreddit posts i.e. will Toolbox still be able to compile an accurate report of submitted domain percentages (only subreddit posts)?

That's up the toolbox devs, but it should be apparent which subreddits belong to a user and which are traditional communities.

<TEXT> I hear you. The designs aren't finalized, we're mostly focused on the tech at the moment.

I would like to share an interesting learning. Since the beginning of Reddit, our product design philosophy has been to cram as much content into view as possible, our thinking being that it increases the odds that a user will see something they like. In our native mobile apps, we use a card view, which basically shows one piece of content at a time. Interestingly enough, engagement in the native apps is approximately 4x higher than the desktop.

I see this in my own usage as well. I go through a ton more content on mobile than I do on desktop. This could be because everything is pre-expanded or because the apps have infinite scroll. We'll test these things thoroughly before deploying to a wide audience, of course, but it goes to show that our intuition isn't always correct. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi All,

I would like to take a minute to look back on 2016 and share what is in store for Reddit in 2017.

2016 was a transformational year for Reddit. We are a completely different company than we were a year ago, having improved in just about every dimension. We hired most of the company, creating many new teams and growing the rest. As a result, we are capable of building more than ever before.

Last year was our most productive ever. We shipped well-reviewed apps for both [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reddit.frontpage hl=en). It is crazy to think these apps did not exist a year agoespecially considering they now account for over 40% of our content views. Despite being relatively new and not yet having all the functionality of the desktop site, the apps are fastest and best way to browse Reddit. If you havent given them a try yet, you should definitely take them for a spin.

Additionally, we built a new web tech stack, upon which we built the long promised new version [moderator mail](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/5h1j48/new_modmail_now_available_for_all_subreddits) and our [mobile website](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/58ir49/reddit_change_mobile_website_architectural_revamp/). We added [image hosting](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4p5dm9/image_hosting_on_reddit/) on all platforms as well, which now supports the majority of images uploaded to Reddit.

We want Reddit to be a welcoming place for all. We know we still have a long way to go, but I want to share with you some of the progress we have made. Our Anti-Evil and Trust   Safety teams reduced spam by over 90%, and we released the first version of our [blocking tool](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4dmnn6/new_and_improved_block_user_feature_in_your_inbox/), which made a nice dent in reported abuse. In the wake of [Spezgiving](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/5frg1n/tifu_by_editing_some_comments_and_creating_an/), we increased actions taken against individual bad actors by nine times. Your continued engagement helps us make the site better for everyone, thank you for that feedback.

As always, the Reddit community did many wonderful things for the world. You raised a [lot](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/5j7z3d/rcfb_buys_donates_6250_in_toys_and_cash_to_toys/) [of](https://www.donorschoose.org/reddit-gifts-for-the-teachers) [money](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExtraLife/wiki/leaderboard); stepped up to help [grieving](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/5k5xjn/does_anyone_know_a_place_that_will_remove/) [families](https://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/4v2jbv/odd_request_for_help_my_wife_recently_died_during/?sort=top); and even helped [diagnose](http://abcnews.go.com/Health/girl-diagnosed-rare-genetic-disorder-reddit-years-inconclusive/story?id=38876898) a rare genetic disorder. There are stories like this every day, and they are one of the reasons why we are all so proud to work here. Thank you.

We have lot upcoming this year. Some of the things we are working on right now include a new frontpage algorithm, improved performance on all platforms, and [moderation tools on mobile](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/5pxvlg/mod_tools_on_mobile_web_approveremovespam/) (native support to follow). We will publish our yearly transparency report in March.

One project I would like to preview is a rewrite of the desktop website. It is a long time coming. The desktop website has not meaningfully changed in many years; it is not particularly welcoming to new users (or old for that matter); and still runs code from the earliest days of Reddit over ten years ago. We know there are implications for community styles and various browser extensions. This is a massive project, and the transition is going to take some time. We are going to need a lot of volunteers to help with testing: new users, old users, creators, lurkers, mods, [please sign up here](https://reddit-research.typeform.com/to/TdKcop)!

Here's to a happy, productive, drama-free (ha), 2017!

Steve and the Reddit team

<TEXT>  Why did you need administrative access after quitting?

When I left, Reddit was six people, and I had the majority of the engineering knowledge, so I continued to help out even after I left.

 What supervision was there of a non-employee with admin access?

There were six of us, and we were all close friends. My actions were limited to quick fixes here and there.

 Have there been other non-employees with admin access? Are there any right now?

No, that was disabled long ago. A few notable ex-employees have distinguish mode in recognition of their contributions to Reddit.

 How was it acceptable (or even legal) to use "a back door" to take back privileged access that the company clearly didn't want you to have?

That's just bad reporting. Someone made a patch to remove my access. I made a patch to add it back. Nothing was done in secret. This was back in 2010. My access was removed sometime in 2010 when Reddit and I had fully separated. </TEXT>

In the past, when a community was deliberately wasting our time, we would look for general solutions that wouldn't single out a specific community. Unfortunately, that usually causes civilian casualties (e.g. when we removed all stickies from r/all and broke sports communities).

<TEXT>  Can any admin edit a comment/post? How would we know?

No. Only engineers with access to production data, and that is being limited.

 Has this ever happened before?

In 2009 I replaced the word "fag" with "fog". Over the years I have fixed typos in titles when people ask since we don't allow title editing by default.

This whole experience has been pretty painful. Even with the best of intentions, I (we) won't do this again.

 Are there any clear cut policies for what constitutes a ban-worthy offense for a sub-reddit?

The clear cut policies are in our [Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy).

<TEXT> **tl;dr:** I fucked up. I ruined Thanksgiving. Im sorry. I wont do it again. We are taking a more aggressive stance against toxic users and poorly behaving communities. You can filter r/all now.

Hi All,

I am sorry: I am sorry for compromising the trust you all have in Reddit, and I am sorry to those that I created work and stress for, particularly over the holidays. It is heartbreaking to think that my actions distracted people from their family over the holiday; instigated harassment of our moderators; and may have harmed Reddit itself, which I love more than just about anything.

The United States is more divided than ever, and we see that tension within Reddit itself. The community that was formed in support of President-elect Donald Trump organized and grew rapidly, but within it were users that devoted themselves to antagonising the broader Reddit community.

Many of you are aware of my attempt to [troll the trolls](https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs/comments/5eo8rq/the_donald_gets_infiltrated_by_reddits_ceo/?st=IVWNCVHU sh=a9c7a036) last week. I honestly thought I might find some common ground with that community by meeting them on their level. It did not go as planned. I restored the original comments after less than an hour, and [explained what I did](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5ekdy9/the_admins_are_suffering_from_low_energy_have/dad5sf1/).

I spent my formative years as a young troll on the Internet. I also led the team that built Reddit ten years ago, and spent years moderating the original Reddit communities, so I am as comfortable online as anyone. As CEO, I am often out in the world speaking about how Reddit is the home to conversation online, and a follow on question about harassment on our site is always asked. We have dedicated many of our resources to fighting harassment on Reddit, which is why letting one of our most engaged communities openly harass me felt hypocritical.

While many users across the site found what I did funny, or appreciated that I was standing up to the bullies (I received plenty of support from users of r/the_donald), many others did not. I understand what I did has greater implications than my relationship with one community, and it is fair to raise the question of whether this erodes trust in Reddit. I hope our transparency around this event is an indication that we take matters of trust seriously. Reddit is no longer the little website my college roommate, u/kn0thing, and I started more than eleven years ago. It is a massive collection of communities that provides news, entertainment, and fulfillment for millions of people around the world, and I am continually humbled by what Reddit has grown into. I will never risk your trust like this again, and we are updating our internal controls to prevent this sort of thing from happening in the future.

More than anything, I want Reddit to heal, and I want our country to heal, and although many of you have asked us to ban the r/the_donald outright, it is with this spirit of healing that I have resisted doing so. If there is anything about this election that we have learned, it is that there are communities that feel alienated and just want to be heard, and Reddit has always been a place where those voices can be heard.

However, when we separate the behavior of some of r/the_donald users from their politics, it is their behavior we cannot tolerate. The opening statement of our [Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) asks that we all show enough respect to others so that we all may continue to enjoy Reddit for what it is. It is my first duty to do what is best for Reddit, and the current situation is not sustainable.

Historically, we have relied on our relationship with moderators to curb bad behaviors. While some of the moderators have been helpful, this has not been wholly effective, and we are now taking a more proactive approach to policing behavior that is detrimental to Reddit:

* We have identified hundreds of the most toxic users and are taking action against them, ranging from warnings to timeouts to permanent bans.
Posts stickied on r/the_donald will no longer appear in r/all. r/all is not our frontpage, but is a popular listing that our most engaged users frequent, including myself. The sticky feature was designed for moderators to make announcements or highlight specific posts. It was not meant to circumvent organic voting, which r/the_donald does to slingshot posts into r/all, often in a manner that is antagonistic to the rest of the community.

* We will continue taking on the most troublesome users, and going forward, if we do not see the situation improve, we will continue to take privileges from communities whose users continually cross the lineup to an outright ban.

Again, I am sorry for the trouble I have caused. While I intended no harm, that was not the result, and I hope these changes improve your experience on Reddit.

Steve

PS: As a bonus, I have enabled filtering for r/all for all users. You can modify the filters by [visiting r/all on the desktop web](https://g.redditmedia.com/34sCU-v1SO7xXrFliAOHfMR2bVjuoC2xYPV3OnH6C9Y.gif?w=1024 fm=mp4 mp4-fragmented=false s=c4127836f34b00ac6a66b1b429e02440) (Im old, sorry), but it will affect all platforms, including our native apps on iOS and Android.

<TEXT> I started Reddit with my college roommate of four years, Alexis Ohanian (u/kn0thing), immediately after graduation in 2005. Not having a big vision for the company, we more or less went with the flow, building whatever we felt like each day. As a result, when an opportunity to sell came along, we took it, selling to Cond Nast in 2006. We had little expectations for the company, so it seemed at the time like we were getting away with something.

Alexis and I stayed with Reddit, under contract with CN, through 2009. I left because I wanted to try something else. I started Hipmunk in 2010 with another buddy, Adam Goldstein. He was the CEO and I was the CTO. I worked on Hipmunk for the next five years, learning many important lessons and unlearned many bad habits I had developed at Reddit. Meanwhile, Reddit continued to grow, eventually spinning out from Conde in 2012, and raising more money towards the end of 2014.

Reddit went through some hard times (yadda yadda yadda...), and in July of 2015, I returned as CEO. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dearest Redditors,

We have been hard at work the past few months adding features, improving our ads business, and protecting users. Here is some of the stuff we have been up to:

Hopefully you did not notice, but as of last week, the m.reddit.com is powered by an entirely new tech platform. We call it 2X. In addition to load times being significantly faster for users (by about 2x) development is also much quicker. This means faster iteration and more improvements going forward. Our recently released [AMP site](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/53q42z/read_reddit_faster_via_google_with_amp/) and moderator mail are already running on 2X.

Speaking of modmail, the beta we [announced](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/4wwzzs/new_modmail_a_demo_and_a_call_for_beta_testers/) a couple months ago is going well. Thirty communities volunteered to help us iron out the kinks (thank you, r/DIY!). The community [feedback](http://reddit.com/r/modmailbeta) has been invaluable, and we are incorporating as much as we can in preparation for the general release, which we expect to be sometime next month.

Prepare your pitchforks: we are enabling basic interest targeting in our advertising product. This will allow advertisers to target audiences based on a handful of predefined interests (e.g. sports, gaming, music, etc.), which will be informed by which communities they frequent. A targeted ad is more relevant to users and more valuable to advertisers. We describe this functionality in our [privacy policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy/) and have added a permanent link to this [opt-out page](https://www.reddit.com/adsprefs). The main changes are in 'Advertising and Analytics. The opt-out is per-browser, so it should work for both logged in and logged out users.

We have a cool community feature in the works as well. Improved [spoiler tags](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/59jkbq/reddit_change_spoiler_tags_beta/) went into beta earlier today. Communities have long been using tricks with NSFW tags to hide spoilers, which is clever, but also results in side-effects like actual NSFW content everywhere just because you want to discuss the latest episode of The Walking Dead.

We did have some fun with Atlantic Recording Corporation in the last couple of months.  After a user posted a link to a leaked Twenty One Pilots song from the Suicide Squad soundtrack, Atlantic petitioned a NY court to order us to turn over all information related to the user and any users with the same IP address. We pushed back on the request, and our lawyer, who knows how to turn a phrase, opposed the petition by arguing, "Because Atlantic seeks to use pre-action discovery as an impermissible fishing expedition to determine if it has a plausible claim for breach of contract or breach of fiduciary duty against the Reddit user and not as a means to match an existing, meritorious claim to an individual, its petition for pre-action discovery should be denied." After seeing our opposition and arguing its case in front of a NY judge, Atlantic withdrew its petition entirely, signaling our victory. While pushing back on these requests requires time and money on our end, we believe it is important for us to ensure applicable legal standards are met before we disclose user information.

Lastly, we are celebrating the kick-off of our eighth annual Secret Santa exchange next Tuesday on Reddit Gifts! It is true Reddit tradition, often filled with great gifts and surprises. If you have never participated, now is the perfect time to [create an account](https://www.redditgifts.com/profiles/signup/). It will be a fantastic event this year.

I will be hanging around to answer questions about this or anything else for the next hour or so.

Steve

<TEXT> I am sad to share that u/deimorz is leaving Reddit (just the company, not the site, hopefully). Chad joined us back in 2013 when the company was only about ten people. He is the author of AutoModerator, which enabled Reddit to grow to its current size, and he is the creator of r/SubredditSimulator, which will ensure our survival after you are all gone. If you have spent any time in r/bugs, r/help, r/ModSupport, r/AutoModerator, r/modhelp, r/redditdev, r/Games, r/TheoryOfReddit, and many others, you have probably met Chad and have likely been helped by him.

Chad, Reddit would not be what it is today without you, and we will miss you dearly. Best of luck out there! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I would like to share some of the things we have been up to since we last chatted.

On the product side, weve been busy. Both our [iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reddit.frontpage hl=en) apps have had [multiple releases](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditmobile), and were proud at how well they are progressing. Mobile web (m.reddit.com) is undergoing a major overhaul that were testing internally, and hope to start showing to users in the next couple weeks. We have been running many experiments on desktop web to increase user engagement, particularly for users who are new to Reddit. You can see what experiments we are running on this [live thread](https://www.reddit.com/live/x3ckzbsj6myw/), and notable changes to the site are listed in r/changelog.

Weve started development on a new frontpage algorithm. The current algorithm is outdated and is no longer meeting our needs. There are a number of problems wed like to solve: increased velocity, improved personalization, reduced dependence on /new, and not requiring us to choose the defaults. Were still in the early days, but Im happy were dedicating resources to it.

As it relates to monetization, weve made a handful of changes: we [tested adding affiliate tags](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4mv578/affiliate_links_on_reddit/) to e-commerce links, which we ended up turning off; we announced [Promoted User Posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4upf11/new_ad_type_promoted_user_posts/); and we announced [tests well be running](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4phzsi/sponsored_headline_tests_placement_and_design/) on sponsored headlines. Changes and additions to ads can be met with skepticism, and this is why we test changes carefully and listen to feedback. As we evolve our ads platform, we are working to do it in a way that that complements the core experience and engages redditors. These changes and experiments will continue to happen, but while it is critical that we build Reddit into a sustainable business, we dont want to compromise whats brought us here. Going forward, we will list these in r/changelog so all these kinds of announcements are in one place.

Yesterday, we previewed [new moderator mail](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/4wwzzs/new_modmail_a_demo_and_a_call_for_beta_testers/) to moderators. This has been a long time coming, and were excited to show it off. The current moderator mail system is a hack on top of our messaging system, which is itself a hack on top of our commenting system. The new tool should save a lot of time for everyone, and new tech stack will allow for better future iterations and builds. Well be working with moderators to refine it while we work towards a full rollout.

Weve seen great results from our Anti-Evil, Trust   Safety, and Community teams. The mandate of these teams is to eliminate spam and abuse and to ensure Reddit is a welcoming place for all. In the last quarter, weve reduced harassment reports by 15%, spam reports by 66%, and moderator spam removals by 15%. Weve also reduced our support ticket backlog substantially, dropping our average response time from 64 hours to 7 in the process.

Happy to chat about this stuff, or anything else.

You basically describe the new frontpage algorithm I've been fantasizing about. We started work on this, in fact, but we re-allocated that brainpower (u/KeyserSosa) to focus on anti-evil for a while. We have since hired more brainpower and have less evil, so I'm hopeful we can get back to it soon. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi All,

A few days ago, we talked about a few technological and process changes we would be working on in order to improve your Reddit experience and ensure access to timely information is available.

Over the last day we rolled out a behavior change to r/all. The r/all listing gives us a glimpse into what is happening on all of Reddit independent of specific interests or subscriptions. In many ways, r/all is a reflection of what is happening online in general. It is culturally important and drives many conversations around the world.

The changes we are making are to preserve this aspect of r/allour specific goal being to prevent any one community from dominating the listing. The algorithm change is fairly simpleas a community is represented more and more often in the listing, the hotness of its posts will be increasingly lessened. This results in more variety in r/all.

Many people will ask if this is related to r/the_donald. The short answer is no, we have been working on this change for a while, but I cannot deny their behavior hastened its deployment. We have seen many communities like r/the_donald over the yearsones that attempt to dominate the conversation on Reddit at the expense of everyone else. This undermines Reddit, and we are not going to allow it. 

Interestingly enough, r/the_donald was already getting downvoted out of r/all yesterday morning before we made any changes. It seems the rest of the Reddit community had had enough. Ironically, r/EnoughTrumpSpam was hit harder than any other community when we rolled out the changes. Thats Reddit for you. \\\_()_/ 

As always, we will keep an eye out for any unintended side-effects and make changes as necessary. Community has always been one of the very best things about Redditlets remember that. Thank you for reading, thank you for Reddit-ing, lets all get back to connecting with our fellow humans, sharing ferret gifs, and making the Reddit the most fun, authentic place online.

Steve

<TEXT> Honestly, I'm quite upset myself. As a user, I was disappointed that when I wanted to learn what happened in Orlando, and I found a lot of infighting bullshit. We're still getting to the bottom of it all. Fortunately, the [AskReddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/4nqnrm/breaking_news_orlando_nightclub_massshooting/) was quite good.

All of us at Reddit are committed to making sure this doesn't happen again, and we're working with the mods to do so. We have historically stayed hands off and let these situations develop, but in this case we should have stepped in. Next time we will get involved sooner to make sure things don't go off the rails.

<TITLE> Let's talk about Orlando </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-14 00:10:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi All,

What happened in Orlando this weekend was a national tragedy. Lets remember that first and foremost, this was a devastating and visceral human experience that many individuals and whole communities were, and continue to be, affected by. In the grand scheme of things, this is what is most important today.

I would like to address what happened on Reddit this past weekend. Many of you use Reddit as your primary source of news, and we have a duty to provide access to timely information during a crisis. This is a responsibility we take seriously.

The story broke on r/news, as is common. In such situations, their community is flooded with all manners of posts. Their policy includes removing duplicate posts to focus the conversation in one place, and removing speculative posts until facts are established. A few posts were removed incorrectly, which have now been restored. One moderator did cross the line with their behavior, and is no longer a part of the team. We have seen the accusations of censorship. We have investigated, and beyond the posts that are now restored, have not found evidence to support these claims.

Whether you agree with r/news policies or not, it is never acceptable to harass users or moderators. Expressing your anger is fine. Sending death threats is not. We will be taking action against users, moderators, posts, and communities that encourage such behavior.

We are working with r/news to understand the challenges faced and their actions taken throughout, and we will work more closely with moderators of large communities in future times of crisis. WeReddit Inc, moderators, and usersall have a duty to ensure access to timely information is available.

In the wake of this weekend, we will be making a handful of technology and process changes:

* Live threads are the best place for news to break and for the community to stay updated on the events. We are working to make this more timely, evident, and organized.
* [Were introducing a change to Sticky Posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/4ny8y6/renaming_sticky_posts_to_announcements/): Theyll now be called Announcement Posts, which better captures their intended purpose; they will only be able to be created by moderators; and they must be text posts. Votes will continue to count. We are making this change to prevent the use of Sticky Posts to organize bad behavior.
* We are working on a change to the r/all algorithm to promote more diversity in the feed, which will help provide more variety of viewpoints and prevent vote manipulation.
* We are nearly fully staffed on our Community team, and will continue increasing support for moderator teams of major communities.

Again, what happened in Orlando is horrible, and above all, we need to keep things in perspective. Weve all been set back by the events, but we will move forward together to do better next time.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a tricky one. The problems we see are a result of a couple of decisions we made a long time ago, not understanding their longterm consequences: simplistic moderator hierarchy and valuable real-estate in r/ urls. Unwinding these decisions requires a lot of thought and finesse. Reddit wouldn't exist as it does today without the good moderators, and we need to be very careful to continue to empower them while filtering out the bad actors. I'd like to be more specificour thinking is more specificbut we're not ready to share anything just yet. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not a lot new, but I can repeat how we feel: privacy colors many of our conversations around here. We have a good [privacy policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3tlcil/we_are_updating_our_privacy_policy_effective_jan); we released a thorough [transparency report](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/2015), which will be even more thorough next year because we're keeping better records; and that whole techno-libertarian, super-paranoid viewpoint that exists on Reddit? That came from me, and has been upheld by many others around here over the years.

 Can you see the main account of a throwaway?

Sort of. No one's looking. If they happen to share an IP, it's possible, but many IPs, for example at a college, have many hundreds of accounts on them.

edit: I should clarify. There is no such thing as a "super mod," and only select Reddit employees have access to IPs.

<TEXT> Today we are excited to announce that [Philippe Beaudette](https://www.reddit.com/u/AchievementUnlockd) has joined us to lead our Community team. He comes from Wikipedia by way of Wikia. At the Wikimedia Foundation (which hosts and supports Wikipedia, among other sites) he was responsible for the team that did community management, user trust and safety, and strategic change management, guiding the community through a time of immense growth and maturation. He spent almost 7 years there, as one of their first community hires, and managed to have his fingers on a huge number of projects, from fundraising (raising money from nearly every country in the world and accepting Wikipedias first donation from Antarctica) to community governance and their international elections processeswhile dealing with communities working in almost 200 different languages.  Hes particularly proud to have led their community interactions around a worldwide [24 hour site shut-down](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/17/wikipedia-blackout_n_1212096.html?slideshow=true) to drive awareness of the SOPA bill two years ago, an effort that Reddit also joined.

After leaving Wikipedia, Philippe joined Wikia and ran the Community Support and Engagement team there, supporting Wikias 350,000 fan-created communities. We are honored to have him on our team. Please welcome Philippe!

In addition to Philippe, we have brought on an additional five members to the Community and Trust and Safety teams this week. See if you can collect them all! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am sad to share that u/krispykrackers is leaving Reddit. Over the past five years, she has done an incredible amount of work for us and the Reddit community. She has been the face of our Community team at Reddit; helped us write many of our policies and was indispensable working through countless tricky situations; and she lead our efforts in support of Extra Life, raising hundreds of thousands of dollars for Childrens Miracle Network Hospitals. She has been a friend to me and many others here. While we are sad to see her go, we wish her the best going forward.

Actually replacing Kristine is impossible, but next Monday, four (maybe five!) new members of our Community and Trust and Safety teams will be starting, which will give the team even more horsepower. </TEXT>

<TITLE> A few updates on what has been keeping us busy </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-04-26 05:47:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi All,

I want to give you all an update with the things that are keeping us busy, and hopefully as a result, making you less busy:

* **Spam**: Last quarter we saw a huge increase in spam, including a handful of heavy attacks. We diverted resources to combat this, and we have made quite a bit of progress, lowering user reported spam by over 60% from its high point last quarter. We still have plenty of work to do, but we are making steady progress. Removing as spam or reporting as such are still the most effective ways to help.

* **Account Take-Overs** (ATOs): In response to our improved spam-fighting measures, the bad-guys have been targeting existing accounts, compromising them for the purpose of spamming and vote cheating. We are fighting ATOs on the engineering side, but ATOs also create a burden on our community team to notify affected users, send password reset emails, etc. We are working on automating the notification and recovery processes to free up our community managers. The root cause of the issue is poor passwords. Please use strong and unique passwords.

* **Support Backlog**: Because of the aforementioned issues, our community team is swamped with support tickets. We are doing a good job keeping up with the incoming flow, but we do have a backlog that is taking time to work through. We are sorry for any delays. The good news is we have a number of new people joining the team over the next few weeks that will help.

* **Modmail**: I am happy to report that we finally have a team dedicated to working on a new system for moderator mail. To this point, we have tried a number of approaches and have had a handful of false starts, but we have not made the sort of progress we would like. The current system is a series of hacks built on an old code base, and because of this, we have decided to build modmail as a new, separate system. This will allow us to develop it without disrupting your current workflows. We know this is where you spend a lot of your time, and we are working hard to make it more effective.

We appreciate all you do for Reddit as moderators, and we appreciate seeing the questions you ask in this community. We are particularly thankful for those of you who jump in and help the other moderators here and elsewhere.

Instead of swipe to collapse, there is a little button in the lower right to skip to the next thread. You can move it around with press-and-hold. Swipe to collapse was my favorite feature ever, and I think this button is a nice improvement.

 Switching to Compact view appears to work for individual subreddits, but my front page is still in Card view?

There is a global preference for compact view as well.

update to answer some questions:

When a user deletes a comment, we keep the body of the comment, but we don't display it anywhere. The reason was it simplified the implementation at the time. That's not a sacred horse, and it's something we can reconsider. In the context of this conversation, I don't believe we've ever turned over deleted comments (I don't think anyone has asked, either).

If you modify a comment, we don't keep previous versions.

<TITLE> For your reading pleasure, our 2015 Transparency Report </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-03-31 19:06:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In 2014, we published our first Transparency Report, which can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/2014). We made a commitment to you to publish an annual report, detailing government and law enforcement agency requests for private information about our users. In keeping with that promise, weve published our [2015 transparency report](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/2015). 

We hope that sharing this information will help you better understand our [Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy) and demonstrate our commitment for Reddit to remain a place that actively encourages authentic conversation.

Our goal is to provide information about the number and types of requests for user account information and removal of content that we receive, and how often we are legally required to respond. This isnt easy as a small company as we dont always have the tools we need to accurately track the large volume of requests we receive. We will continue, when legally possible, to inform users before sharing user account information in response to these requests.

In 2015, we did not produce records in response to 40% of government requests, and we did not remove content in response to 79% of government requests.

In 2016, weve taken further steps to protect the privacy of our users. We joined our industry peers in an amicus brief [supporting Twitter](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/foundation/3/3d/Twitter_versus_Lynch_Amicus_Brief_February_2016.pdf), detailing our desire to be honest about the national security requests for removal of content and the disclosure of user account information.

In addition, we joined an amicus brief [supporting Apple](http://images.apple.com/pr/pdf/Airbnb_Atlassian_Automattic_CloudFlare_eBay_GitHub_Kickstarter_LinkedIn_Mapbox_Medium_Meetup_Reddit_Square_Squarespace_Twilio_Twitter_and_Wickr.pdf) in their fight against the government's attempt to force a private company to work on behalf of them. While the government asked the court to [vacate the court order](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/03/28/technology/document-us-filing-dropping-apple-case.html) compelling Apple to assist them, we felt it was important to stand with Apple and speak out against this unprecedented move by the government, which threatens the relationship of trust between a platforms and its users, in addition to jeopardizing your privacy. 

We are also excited to announce the launch of our [external law enforcement guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/law_enforcement_guidelines). Beyond clarifying how Reddit works as a platform and briefly outlining how both federal and state law enforcements can compel Reddit to turn over user information, we believe they make very clear that we adhere to strict standards. 

We know the success of Reddit is made possible by your trust. We hope this transparency report strengthens that trust, and is a signal to you that we care deeply about your privacy.

(I'll do my best to answer questions, but as with all legal matters, I can't always be completely candid.)

edit: I'm off for now. There are a few questions that I'll try to answer after I get clarification.

Were only sampling over a small number of users. Down the road wed like to use this information this data to make recommendations, fight spam, make better sorting algorithms, and improve the front page (e.g. not show you the same links over and over). The information isnt being used on an individual basis, and before it is, well give you a way to clear your history. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been pushing a strategy change to build modmail as a separate app on our api. Building things in our current desktop codebase is painfully slow because of all the tech debt.

That was the same reasoning for the modmail - email experiment, which didn't work out that way I had hoped. (It's not completely dead, though. We're going to use it internally and iterate). </TEXT>

<TEXT> 3 of the top 10 posts in r/ModSupport are from us. I'm sorry we don't get to every question, but we're absolutely in there. We are very aware of the spam issues.

 I don't think I've heard a peep around what's going on with the anti-brigading tools.

You won't really. We've improved here, and we're continuing to invest in it, but anti-brigading is something we do quietly so the bad guys don't know what's working.

 A year ago, reddit hired a "Community Engineer" to rebuild modmail. There are literally no signs of progress on this.

I'm sad to say that although we invested quite a bit, my favorite feature [didn't work out](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/42o57u/modmailtoemail_beta_closing/). I had thought by forwarding mail out of Reddit we could do an end-run around the problem. I was trying to avoid a wholesale rewrite of the system because that will take forever with our current resources. We're not doing nothing, but we haven't succeeded either. We're still on it.

 AlienBlue was taken over by reddit recently and seems to be dead in the water.

We bought it years ago, actually, and have put out a number of releases in the past few months, [at least five](https://www.reddit.com/user/alien-blue). We are working on a new iOS app as we speak, and that will be the future for us, but we're continuing to maintain AB during the meantime.

<TEXT>  Will this come back into the pipeline at some point this year?

Very likely. As you said, we put it on the back burner because we had more acute pains to deal with. One of our big company goals this year is to increase engagement, and a great way of doing this is to convert our casual users into redditors, which requires education.

At this very moment, however, we're working on a few other things. Mobile is getting a lot of attention. That's where the users are going, whether we are prepared or not. The A/B testing system is critically important as well. This allows us to see if changes (e.g. to onboarding) are actually having the intended effect. </TEXT>

But if you think our best revenue idea is *making a book*, I'm a little insulted. I mean, I know we have a lot to improve on, but we'd at least sell your personal data to advertisers before getting into publishing for profit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Our position is still that shadowbanning shouldn't be used on real users. It's useful for spammers, but that's about it. That's why we released the [better banning](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3sbrro/account_suspensions_a_transparent_alternative_to/) tools a couple months ago, which allows us to put a user in timeout with an explanation. This helps correct behavior.

Moderators can still ban users from their communities, and it's not transparent. I don't like this, and I get a lot of complaints from confused users. However, the moderators don't have a ton of alternatives. [Improving reporting with more rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/42o2i0/moderators_subreddit_rules_now_available_for_all/) is a step in the right direction. It's my desire that moderators will rely on banning less and less as we build better tooling. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The T S team is mandated to do two things: make sure users don't see spam, and to enforce our policies.

Spam is fairly straightforward to explain. You shouldn't see it. Reporting helps, but the real solution involves investing in more automated tools. We'll never be able to solve the problem one spammer at a time.

Their second job is to enforce the [Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy). The better banning feature we released a couple months ago is helpful here. Now we have the ability to actually enforce behavior without outright banning someone, which doesn't really work.

<TITLE> Reddit in 2016 </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi All,

Now that 2015 is in the books, its a good time to reflect on where we are and where we are going. Since I returned last summer, my goal has been to bring a sense of calm; to rebuild our relationship with our users and moderators; and to improve the fundamentals of our business so that we can focus on making you (our users), those that work here, and the world in general, proud of Reddit. Reddits mission is to help people discover places where they can be themselves and to empower the community to flourish.

2015 was a big year for Reddit. First off, we cleaned up many of our external policies including our Content Policy, Privacy Policy, and API terms. We also established internal policies for managing requests from law enforcement and governments. Prior to my return, [Reddit took an industry-changing stance on involuntary pornography](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/2x0g9v/from_1_to_9000_communities_now_taking_steps_to/).

Reddit is a collection of communities, and the moderators play a critical role shepherding these communities. It is our job to help them do this. We have shipped a [number of improvements](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/new/) to these tools, and while we have a long way to go, I am happy to see steady progress.

Spam and abuse threaten Reddits communities. We created a Trust and Safety team to focus on abuse at scale, which has the added benefit of freeing up our Community team to focus on the positive aspects of our communities. We are still in transition, but you should feel the impact of the change more as we progress. We know we have a lot to do here.

I believe we have positioned ourselves to have a strong 2016. A phrase we will be using a lot around here is "Look Forward." Reddit has a long history, and its important to focus on the future to ensure we live up to our potential. Whether you access it from your desktop, a mobile browser, or a native app, we will work to make the Reddit product more engaging. Mobile in particular continues to be a priority for us. Our new Android app is going into beta today, and our new iOS app should follow it out soon.

We receive many requests from law enforcement and governments. We take our stewardship of your data seriously, and we know transparency is important to you, which is why we are putting together a Transparency Report. This will be available in March.

This year will see a lot of changes on Reddit. Recently we built an A/B testing system, which allows us to test changes to individual features scientifically, and we are excited to put it through its paces. Some changes will be big, others small and, inevitably, not everything will work, but all our efforts are towards making Reddit better. We are all redditors, and we are all driven to understand why Reddit works for some people, but not for others; which changes are working, and what effect they have; and to get into a rhythm of constant improvement. We appreciate your patience while we modernize Reddit.

As always, Reddit would not exist without you, our community, so thank you. We are all excited about what 2016 has in store for us.

Steve

edit: I'm off. Thanks for the feedback and questions. We've got a lot to deliver on this year, but the whole team is excited for what's in store. We've brought on a bunch of new people lately, but our biggest need is still hiring. If you're interested, please check out https://www.reddit.com/jobs. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Introducing new API terms </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-12-18 19:18:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Today we are introducing standardized [API Terms of Use](/wiki/api). You, our community of developers, are important to us, and have been instrumental to the success of the Reddit platform. First and foremost, we want to reaffirm our commitment to providing (and improving!) a public API.

There are a couple of notable changes to the API terms that Id like to highlight. The first is that we are requesting all users of the API to register with us. This provides a point of contact for when we have important updates to share; provides a point of contact for when things go wrong; and helps us prevent abuse.

We are also no longer requiring a special licensing agreement to use our API for commercial purposes. We do request that you seek approval for your monetization model in the registration process.

We have added clarity about the types of things that the API is not intended fornamely applications that promote illegal activity, disrupt core Reddit functionality, or introduce security risks. But you werent doing any of these things anyway.

We still require users of our API to comply with our User Agreement, Privacy Policy, API Usage Limits, and any other applicable laws or regulations. We will continue to require the use of OAuth2.  We understand moving to OAuth2 can take time, so we are giving developers until March 17th to make this change.

We look forward to working with you more to create great experiences for our communities. There are many wonderful projects built on our API, and we would love to see even more. Thank you for all that you do.

You can contact the api@reddit.com alias to ask questions about the API service. </TEXT>

<TITLE> We are updating our Privacy Policy (effective Jan 1, 2016) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-11-20 19:00:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In a little over a month well be updating our [Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy). We know this is important to you, so I want to explain what has changed and why.

Keeping control in your hands is paramount to us, and this is our first consideration any time we change our privacy policy. Our overarching principle continues to be to request as little personally identifiable information as possible. To the extent that we store such information, we do not share it generally. Where there are exceptions to this, notably when you have given us explicit consent to do so, or in response to legal requests, we will spell them out clearly.

The new policy is functionally very similar to the previous one, but its shorter, simpler, and less repetitive. We have clarified what information we collect automatically (basically anything your browser sends us) and what we share with advertisers (nothing specific to your Reddit account).

One notable change is that we are increasing the number of days we store IP addresses from 90 to 100 so we can measure usage across an entire quarter. In addition to internal analytics, the primary reason we store IPs is to fight spam and abuse. I believe in the future we will be able to accomplish this without storing IPs at all (e.g. with hashing), but we still need to work out the details.

In addition to changes to our Privacy Policy, we are also beginning to roll out support for [Do Not Track](http://donottrack.us/). Do Not Track is an option you can enable in modern browsers to notify websites that you do not wish to be tracked, and websites can interpret it however they like (most ignore it). If you have Do Not Track enabled, we will not load any third-party analytics. We will keep you informed as we develop more uses for it in the future.

Individually, you have control over what information you share with us and what your browser sends to us automatically. I encourage everyone to understand how browsers and the web work and what steps you can take to protect your own privacy. Notably, browsers allow you to disable [third-party cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie#Third-party_cookie), and you can customize your browser with a variety of privacy-related [extensions](http://lifehacker.com/the-best-browser-extensions-that-protect-your-privacy-479408034).

We are proud that Reddit is home to many of the most open and genuine conversations online, and we know this is only made possible by your trust, without which we would not exist. We will continue to do our best to earn this trust and to respect your basic assumptions of privacy.

Thank you for reading. Ill be here for an hour to answer questions, and I'll check back in again the week of Dec 14th before the changes take effect.

-Steve (subject4807)

<TEXT> I've answered this a couple times here and there.

Any engineer should want to work at reddit for a variety of reasons:

* You get to work on interesting problems (scaling, abuse, search, data, ML, mobile)
* Your work will be seen by millions of people
* Your work will affect the lives of millions on people
* You get to work with smart people in a fun environment
* We have really generous benefits. Full health, dental, vision. We pay for parking, gyms, daycare, and a bunch of other random stuff.

As for no negotiation, we had a similar policy at Hipmunk, and it worked well. I think my reasoning might be different from Ellen's. The reason I like it is because many people are not good at negotiating, or just don't like it. We do our best to ensure comp is fair both internally and externally. A critical part of this policy is that we *always make our best offer up front*. That way, if someone comes back to us and asks for more, we can say "no" with a clear conscience. I have found in practice this is almost never required.

We're in the business of getting the best people we can, not the best people for as cheap as possible. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  What is your opinion on free speech today?

It's important to both our society and to Reddit, and both inside and outside of Reddit it's an incredibly complex issue. My position as it relates to Reddit is that we try to let as much go as possible because it's important to have a realistic view of the world. I believe in many ways that Reddit is the online reflection of humanity, and we want to preserve that. However, we also feel obligated to take steps to prevent real-world harm to people and to protect Reddit itself. Often, this puts us in a position of having to make some very difficult decisions.

 do you agree with the statement "Subreddits should be banned if they make reddit look bad, even if they are technically legal."?

No, but the inverse isn't true either.

 Does reddit thinks about adding a "nsfl" button?

Yes. That was an alternative name suggestion to quarantining, incidentally. Our work isn't done in this department.

 What do you think?

Totally on board. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. It's something we discuss somewhat regularly around here. We all agree it's a problem. It's not our largest problem at the moment, but we will address it.

2. I don't think the notion of blessing a specific set of communities is sustainable. It requires too much intervention on our side, and it also prevents new communities from breaking into popularity because they hit the "default ceiling". I'm looking forward to tackling this.

3. We don't control the content of the defaults, so it's largely up to them. We do work with them from time to time on more "event"-like situations. For example, if we have connections to a prominent candidate, we can help find them a place on Reddit.  </TEXT>

There are many legal and tax implications that need to be worked through. I'm sad to say we haven't spent a ton of time on it since I've returned other than to reaffirm, that yes, we are going to do it.

Because I don't anticipate a liquidity event for a while (nor are we profitable), we don't have anything to distribute, so we're not in a huge rush. </TEXT>

update: I can't tell if everyone disagrees, or if I wasn't clear, so I'll try again. I think the best solution to overzealous mods is to make it easier to create new communities under new leadership. The mods basically have one blunt tool right now, automoderator, and not a lot of time. Our first step is to provide better tooling for mods to enforce their own rules, and better defenses against abusive users. When all of this is combined, I expect far fewer abuses. </TEXT>

It's worth noting the admins (Reddit employees) and moderators (Reddit users) have different tools, both inadequate. Second, we need to get everyone comfortable (admins, moderators, users) with new tools (basically, non shadowban enforcement). Third, we need to make it easier for new communities to grow.

It's since been reverted, but that's what got this conversation started.), we want to make sure we test things better. In order to do that, we need to rebuild the testing infrastructure for the front page, which is nearly finished.

Longer-term, we've outgrown the current algorithm and need to devise a new one. We've got a lot of ideas here. It's just a matter of time / engineers. </TEXT>

That said, we used to tweak constants in the hot algorithm as traffic grew, but we haven't done that in a while. Before we make any changes (big or small), we're testing them internally.

[1] We did make a change a while ago to fix a different issue, but we reverted it because it had unintended side-effects.

<TEXT> The big feature we lack right now is keyword targeting, and perhaps more importantly, anti-keyword targeting. Right now, advertisers have very little control over who actually sees their ads because they can only target at the community level, and they're very concerned about brand safety. Basically, they want to say, I want my ad to show around conversations about *this* topic, but not *that* topic.

As far as tracking, we will continue to serve ads in an iframe, which dramatically limits what information an advertiser sees (e.g. they don't see what urls you're on), and we will provide ways to opt-out (more than we offer now).

Philosophically, I'm as paranoid as anyone about advertisers knowing what I'm up to onlineit's a common characteristic of most Reddit employees, in factso that guides our thinking. </TEXT>

<TEXT> First, traffic is higher than ever. We're considering a more consistent CEO change schedule as a result. Stay tuned.

The front page algo is the same as it has been for the past while (year? more?), with the exception of a couple weeks ago when we started fiddling with it. We often fiddle with the constants in the algo to make sure there is fresh content on the front page, but the change last week didn't work right. It's back to the way it was before. As traffic grows, front page behavior changes. So, while the algo is the same, the content very well might be aging differently from what you've been used to (we haven't measured it yet). 

My suspicion is that it isn't much different than before, just that people are more sensitive to it. That doesn't mean there isn't an issue, but rather that there has been an issue for longer than you might think.

All that said, the front page algorithm is something I'd like to spend time on sooner rather than later. I've got a bunch of ideas for improvement. Given our resources at the moment, it's going to be a bit until we get to it, so we'll look for short-term fixes in the meantime. </TEXT>

I don't want to get stuck considering too many hypotheticals, but I will entertain this one. If a government wants to ban Reddit entirely because we're the center of an uprising, there's nothing we can do to stop them. However, if they send us a takedown request for specific content, and give us a chance to consider it, we will absolutely take into account the greater context of what's going on.

The issue in this case is we faced the dilemma of either banning content in specific regions or having Reddit blocked entirely in these regions. Unfortunately, there isn't a middle ground in this case.

While we believe government censorship of the Internet is wrong (not to mention futile), we also need to make practical decisions to ensure Reddit is accessible to as many people as possible around the entire world.

By making it more difficult to access, we can slow the negative feedback loop of: have heinous content, attract more people to contribute heinous content, Reddit becomes known more for heinous content than all the amazing stuff it does for the world. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Content Policy Update </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-08-05 22:17:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Today we are releasing an update to our [Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy). Our goal was to consolidate the various rules and policies that have accumulated over the years into a single set of guidelines we can point to.

Thank you to all of you who provided feedback throughout this process. Your thoughts and opinions were invaluable. This is not the last time our policies will change, of course. They will continue to evolve along with Reddit itself.

Our policies are not changing dramatically from what we have had in the past. One new concept is Quarantining a community, which entails applying a set of restrictions to a community so its content will only be viewable to those who explicitly opt in. We will Quarantine communities whose content would be considered extremely offensive to the average redditor.

Today, in addition to applying Quarantines, we are banning a handful of communities that exist solely to annoy other redditors, prevent us from improving Reddit, and generally make Reddit worse for everyone else. Our most important policy over the last ten years has been to allow just about anything so long as it does not prevent others from enjoying Reddit for what it is: the best place online to have truly authentic conversations.

I believe these policies strike the right balance.

update: I know some of you are upset because we banned *anything* today, but the fact of the matter is we spend a disproportionate amount of time dealing with a handful of communities, which prevents us from working on things for the other 99.98% (literally) of Reddit. I'm off for now, thanks for your feedback. RIP my inbox. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Are there any hard deadlines for any of these changes? Projected ETA's other then ASAP?

No, but we are on a very short timeline. Weeks, not months, and we've been at it two weeks.

 Is there a place (like a dedicated subreddit?) that we can tune into to see progress, or maybe offer support when needed? (Community developed tools that have become official come to mind.)

Not presently, but I'm open to ideas. The challenge is that during development we go through a lot of bad ideas, and it's easier to iterate on things when you don't have 100M people breathing down your neck.

 And on that note, can we as the community do anything to enhance our corner of the Internet with you and the Admin team?

Remember that we are people too, and our primary motivation is to make Reddit an awesome place to hang out. We are way less cynical than everyone thinks we are. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I thought I'd start my day with a quick status update for you all. It's only been a couple weeks since my return, but we've got a lot going on. We are in a phase of emergency fixes to repair a number of longstanding issues that are causing all of us grief. I normally don't like talking about things before they're ready, but because many of you are asking what's going on, and have been asking for a long time before my arrival, I'll share what we're up to.

Under active development:

* Content Policy. We're consolidating all our rules into one place. We won't release this formally until we have the tools to enforce it.
* Quarantine the communities we don't want to support
* Improved banning for both admins and moderators (a less sneaky alternative to shadowbanning)
* Improved ban-evasion detection techniques (to make the former possible).
* Anti-brigading research (what techniques are working to coordinate attacks)
* AlienBlue bug fixes
* AlienBlue improvements
* Android app

Next up:

* Anti-abuse and harassment (e.g. preventing PM harassment)
* Anti-brigading
* Modmail improvements

As you can see, lots on our plates right now, but the team is cranking, and we're excited to get this stuff shipped as soon as possible!

I'll be hanging around in the comments for an hour or so.

update: I'm off to work for now. Unlike you, work for me doesn't consist of screwing around on Reddit all day. Thanks for chatting! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can give you examples of things we deal with on a regular basis that would be considered harassment:

 * Going into self help subreddits for people dealing with serious emotional issues and telling people to kill themselves.
 * Messaging serious threats of harm to users towards themselves or their families.
 * Less serious attacks - but ones that are unprovoked and sustained and go beyond simply being an annoying troll. An example would be following someone from subreddit to subreddit repeatedly and saying youre an idiot when they arent engaging you or instigating anything. This is not only harassment but spam, which is also against the rules.
 * Finding users external social media profiles and taking harassing actions or using the information to threaten them with doxxing.
 * Doxxing users.

Its important to recognize that this is not about being annoying. You get into a heated conversation and tell someone to fuck off? No one cares. But if you follow them around for a week to tell them to fuck off, despite their moving on - or tell them youre going to find and kill them, youre crossing a line and thats where we step in. </TEXT>

This is the only one worth considering as harassment. Lobbing insults or saying offensive things don't automatically make something harassment.

Our Harassment policy says "Systematic and/or continued actions to torment or demean someone in a way that would make a reasonable person (1) conclude that reddit is not a safe platform to express their ideas or participate in the conversation, or (2) fear for their safety or the safety of those around them," which I think is pretty clear. </TEXT>

Content Policy

1. Harboring unpopular ideologies is not a reason for banning.

2. (Based on the titles alone) Some of these should be banned since they are inciting violence, others should be separated.

3. This is the area that needs the most explanation. Filling someones inbox with PMs saying, Kill yourself is harassment. Calling someone stupid on a public forum is not.

4. Its an impossible concept to achieve

5. Yes. The whole point of this exercise is to consolidate and clarify our policies.

6. The Report button, /r/reddit.com modmail, contact@reddit.com (in that order). Well be doing a lot of work in the coming weeks to help our community managers respond quickly. Yes, if you can identify harassment of others, please report it.

Brigading

1. Mocking and calling people stupid is not harassment. Doxxing, following users around, flooding their inbox with trash is.

2. I have lots of ideas here. This is a technology problem I know we can solve. Sorry for the lack of specifics, but well keep these tactics close to our chest for now.

1. The content creators one is an issue Id like to leave to the moderators. Beyond this, if its submitted with a script, its spam.

2. While we didnt *create* reddit to be a bastion of free speech, the concept is important to us. /r/creepshots forced us to confront these issues in a way we hadnt done before. Although I wasnt at Reddit at the time, I agree with their decision to ban those communities.

3. The main things we need to implement is the other type of NSFW classification, which isnt too difficult.

4. No, weve been debating non-stop since I arrived here, and will continue to do so. Many people in this thread have made good points that well incorporate into our policy. Clearly defining Harassment is the most obvious example.

5. I know. It was frustrating for me to watch as an outsider as well. Now that Im here, Im looking forward to moving forward and improving things.

<TEXT> There are many reasons for content being removed from a particular subreddit, but it's not at all clear right now what's going on. Let me give you a few examples:

* The user deleted their post. If that's what they want to do, that's fine, it's gone, but we should at least say so, so that the mods or admins don't get accused of censorship.
* A mod deleted the post because it was off topic. We should say so, and we should probably be able to see what it was *somehow* so we can better learn the rules.
* A mod deleted the post because it was spam. We can put these in a spam area.
* A mod deleted a post from a user that constantly trolls and harasses them. This is where I'd really like to invest in tooling, so the mods don't have to waste time in these one-on-one battles.

edit: A spam area makes more sense than hiding it entirely. </TEXT>

There are many subreddits whose contents I and many others find offensive, but that alone is not justification for banning.

/r/rapingwomen will be banned. They are encouraging people to rape.

/r/coontown will be reclassified. The content there is offensive to many, but does not violate our current rules for banning.

<TEXT> We started Reddit to beas we said back then with our tongues in our cheeksThe front page of the Internet. Reddit was to be a source of enough news, entertainment, and random distractions to fill an entire day of pretending to work, every day. Occasionally, someone would start spewing hate, and I would ban them. The community rarely questioned me. When they did, they accepted my reasoning: because I dont want that content on our site.

As we grew, I became increasingly uncomfortable projecting my worldview on others. More practically, I didnt have time to pass judgement on everything, so I decided to judge nothing. 

So we entered a phase that can best be described as Dont Ask, Dont Tell. This worked temporarily, but once people started paying attention, few liked what they found. A handful of painful controversies usually resulted in the removal of a few communities, but with inconsistent reasoning and no real change in policy.

One thing that isn't up for debate is why Reddit exists. Reddit is a place to have open and authentic discussions. The reason were careful to restrict speech is because people have more open and authentic discussions when they aren't worried about the speech police knocking down their door. When our purpose comes into conflict with a policy, we make sure our purpose wins.

As Reddit has grown, we've seen additional examples of how unfettered free speech can make Reddit a less enjoyable place to visit, and can even cause people harm outside of Reddit. Earlier this year, [Reddit took a stand and banned non-consensual pornography](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/2x0g9v/from_1_to_9000_communities_now_taking_steps_to/). This was largely accepted by the community, and the world is a better place as a result (Google and Twitter have followed suit). Part of the reason this went over so well was because there was a very clear line of what was unacceptable.

Therefore, today we're announcing that we're considering a set of additional restrictions on what people can say on Redditor at least say on our public pagesin the spirit of our mission.

These types of content are prohibited [1]:

 * Spam
 * Anything illegal (i.e. things that are actually illegal, such as copyrighted material. Discussing illegal activities, such as drug use, is not illegal)
 * Publication of someones private and confidential information
 * Anything that incites harm or violence against an individual or group of people (it's ok to say "I don't like this group of people." It's not ok to say, "I'm going to kill this group of people.")
 * Anything that [harasses, bullies, or abuses](http://www.redditblog.com/2015/05/promote-ideas-protect-people.html) an individual or group of people (these behaviors intimidate others into silence)[2]
 * Sexually suggestive content featuring minors

There are other types of content that are specifically classified:

 * Adult content must be flagged as NSFW (Not Safe For Work). Users must opt into seeing NSFW communities. This includes pornography, which is difficult to define, but you know it when you see it.
 * Similar to NSFW, another type of content that is difficult to define, but you know it when you see it, is the content that violates a common sense of decency. This classification will require a login, must be opted into, will not appear in search results or public listings, and will generate no revenue for Reddit.

We've had the NSFW classification since nearly the beginning, and it's worked well to separate the pornography from the rest of Reddit. We believe there is value in letting all views exist, even if we find some of them abhorrent, as long as they dont pollute peoples enjoyment of the site. Separation and opt-in techniques have worked well for keeping adult content out of the common Redditors listings, and we think itll work for this other type of content as well. 

No company is perfect at addressing these hard issues. Weve spent the last few days here discussing and agree that an approach like this allows us as a company to repudiate content we dont want to associate with the business, but gives individuals freedom to consume it if they choose. This is what we will try, and if the hateful users continue to spill out into mainstream reddit, we will try more aggressive approaches. Freedom of expression is important to us, but its more important to us that we at reddit be true to our mission.

[1] This is basically what we have right now. Id appreciate your thoughts. A very clear line is important and our language should be precise.

[2] Wording we've used elsewhere is this "Systematic and/or continued actions to torment or demean someone in a way that would make a reasonable person (1) conclude that reddit is not a safe platform to express their ideas or participate in the conversation, or (2) fear for their safety or the safety of those around them."

edit: added an example to clarify our concept of "harm"
edit: attempted to clarify harassment based on our existing policy

<TITLE> Content Policy update. AMA Thursday, July 16th, 1pm pst. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-14 23:06:56 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey Everyone,

There has been a lot of discussion lately on reddit, in the news, and here internally about reddits policy on the more offensive and obscene content on our platform. Our top priority at reddit is to develop a comprehensive Content Policy and the tools to enforce it.

The overwhelming majority of content on reddit comes from wonderful, creative, funny, smart, and silly communities. That is what makes reddit great. There is also a dark side, communities whose purpose is reprehensible, and we dont have any obligation to support them. And we also believe that some communities currently on the platform should not be here at all.

Neither Alexis nor I created reddit to be a bastion of free speech, but rather as a place where open and honest discussion can happen:  These are very complicated issues, and we are putting a lot of thought into it. Its something weve been thinking about for quite some time.  We havent had the tools to enforce policy, but now were building those tools and reevaluating our policy.

We as a community need to decide together what our values are. To that end, Ill be hosting an AMA on Thursday 1pm pst to present our current thinking to you, the community, and solicit your feedback.

PS - I wont be able to hang out in comments right now. Still meeting everyone here! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think I've said many times that my intention isn't to make anyone's duties more difficult. I believe we can build better tools that will save everyone time.

I also believe that shadow banning shouldn't be the only option because it isn't needed in many cases. It happens that in practice is *is* the only option, but we can build a better variety of tools.

After seeing all the discussion over the weekend, I think the most important thing we can do is work on tools to curb harassment of mods. I won't have time for an AMA tomorrow, but I'll find some time later this week. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not even talking about modtools in that quote. It's about the perception of reddit the company banning users, which I don't want us (the company) doing.

Everyone, let me be clear. My intention is to make your jobs easier. I'm not going to come in and remove a bunch of features you depend on, but rather to add more tools so clumsy things like shadowbanning aren't necessary. This is going to require some tech cleverness, but I know we can do it because I've done stuff like this plenty of times before.

I have a lot of ideas. We'll try them out. If things improve, we proceed, if they do not, we try something else. My goal is for you all to spend way less time doing mundane things like tracking down trolls, removing spam, arguing with idiots, etc.

My other goal is to remove some of the mystery from how communities are managed from the reader's perspective. Seeing people cry "censorship" every time a spammer is caught doesn't do anyone any favors. 

(I'm x-posting this in the other mod subreddits)

<TEXT> We're working on a couple of things that will hopefully help avoid future eruptions like the one of the past few days:

 * We're improving the popularity metric for reddits. Specifically, attacking a reddit will not boost its popularity. This will take some time, but we'll get there.

 * No mercy for attacking a reddit. Starting now, anyone who mass-downvotes every link on a reddit will have their voting privileges removed.

**FAQ**

*Why was /r/atheism removed from the default reddit list for non-logged-in users again?*

For the past few months the default reddits have been the top ten most popular reddits, which are automatically computed each morning from the previous day's activity. /r/atheism went through a couple of weeks under attack from other users causing it to appear more popular than it should have been. At the time this was an isolated issue, so we didn't do much about it. When the same thing happened to /r/moviecritic, we addressed the issue by removing the two less popular reddits from the list by hand. Given the two bullet points above, this will no longer be necessary.

*Why was /r/atheism removed from the top bar as well?*

This was a side-effect of how we removed it from the front page. We used the same function for both returning the list of reddits for the front page and returning the list of reddits for the top bar. It was a mistake, and is fixed now.

*Why is the /r/christianity reddit so popular all of a sudden?*

Contrary to popular belief, this isn't my or anyone else at reddit's handy-work. It is because a handful of /r/atheism users are downvoting every story on /r/christianity. As I have previously mentioned, this actually makes a reddit more popular, an unintended side-effect of how we rank reddits. I'm working on undoing the attack, but this will take time. Of course, I will also undo any attacks against any other reddits as well.

*Will /r/atheism ever appear on the front page?*

If it gets more popular, it will be possible.

*But it has more than 50,000 subscribers, it must be popular!*

Subscribers aren't a factor in a reddit's popularity. It's popularity is determined by level of activity.

*You said something previously about not all content being appropriate for the front page. What's the deal with that?*

In the past we chose the front-page reddits by hand, and in the future we might do that again, but it's not something we're actively working on. There are over 25,000 communities on reddit, and only 10 appear on the front page. It's nothing personal. We want to have a large variety of content on the front page to demonstrate that there is something here for everyone. If we start engineering the front page again, it'll be clear what we're doing, and how we're doing it.

*Everything you say is a lie. You clearly hate atheists. Why should I believe you now?*

Ever since Alexis and I founded reddit.com over four years ago, we've worked hard to make this a place where anyone can come and share new and interesting links. We've (and me, specifically) have made mistakes, but we've done our best to fix them and move on, and I think our actions over the past four years speak for themselves. You're free to dislike me/us, and we will proudly continue to provide a forum for you to do so on this site. </TEXT>

<TITLE> An explanation of why the atheism reddit does not appear on the default front page. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2009-08-26 22:29:00 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Skip to the second half if you don't care about how we got to this point.

First, a little history: When we first allowed users to create their
own reddits, every link from every reddit had an equal chance at being
seen on our front page. We had to tweak this slightly with the rise in
popularity of the [nsfw](http://www.reddit.com/r/nsfw) reddit and put some reddits behind an "are
you over 18?" barrier, a change that was welcomed by most users. Next,
we allowed users to choose which reddits appear on their front page,
but it wasn't until we started normalizing the front page that we ran
into issues.

When the front page is normalized, a link that is #1 in a small reddit
is basically equal in hotness to a link that is #1 in a large reddit.
This helps prevent small reddits from being washed out by the larger
ones. Because of this change we had to also limit the number of
reddits that make up the front page, otherwise things would jump
around wildly (a user could create a new reddit, submit one link, and
since that link was #1 in its reddit, it could appear on the front
page). For quite some time we maintained this list of front page
reddits by hand.

Maintaining the list of front page reddits became tedious after a
while, so we added a new algorithm to find the most active reddits
automatically. This algorithm purposefully ignores the number of
subscribers when choosing reddits since that number is so easy to
game. The popularity of a reddit is based on the number of
submissions, votes, and general level of activity of the reddit. The
algorithm changes from time to time, and we don't describe it fully to
mitigate gaming it. We use the top ten reddits returned by this
algorithm to make up the default non-logged-in front page.

**Here's the explanation part you're looking for**

A couple of weeks ago the [moviecritic](http://www.reddit.com/r/moviecritic) reddit popped into the top ten
reddits, causing quite a stir. The reddit isn't used for new and
interesting links, but rather for links to movies: sometimes old and
sometimes new. Users were upset that moviecritic was taking up
front-page space and started attacking the reddit by downvoting
everything in sight. Users of the [atheism](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism) reddit had been under
attacks like this for weeks. Unfortunately, attacking a reddit
generates a lot of activity on that reddit and makes our algorithm
think the reddit is more popular than it really is, making the problem
even worse. 

Seeing as this might become an ongoing problem, we added the ability
to prevent certain reddits from appearing in the top ten. We flagged
moviecritic and atheism as two such reddits, hopefully allowing these
reddits to grow in peace. I should have posted this explanation then
instead of waiting until now, and for that I apologize.

Given the nature and somtimes polarizing tone of the
content on the atheism reddit, it will likely always garner the ire of
many other users. Showcasing religious flame-wars only serves to lower the level of discourse on the site as a whole, and unknowingly walking into such a flame-war isn't the first-time experience we'd like new users to have here, which is why we think it best to leave things the way they are.  

There are thousands of communities on reddit covering a wide range of
topics. Most are for sharing new and interesting content from around
the web, and others are strictly for discussion. We hope there is a
place for everyone on reddit, and we also hope you realize not
everything found on reddit is appropriate for the front page.

UPDATE: I'll try and rephrase a point that I didn't get across before. /moviecritic and /atheism aren't legitimate top ten reddits. They appeared that way because they were under attack, making them appear even more popular. Removing atheism from the top ten by hand isn't about censoring, it's about a shortcoming in our popularity metric. We'll fix the problem, and that'll be the end of it. </TEXT>
