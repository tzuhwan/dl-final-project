<TEXT> One good side of Minecraft is freedomof play, this is what makes Minecraft so incredible, it's a lego game, a farming sim, an adventure, an open world, a survival game, a battle royal, etc... This is something you noted

The reason why the deviation of styles is so strong is due to Minecraft's design, but that's not to say that it makes it bad for multiplayer. Most of multiplayer games restrict what you can do. Let's take the pokemon games, many people play those games differently, some enjoy the simple story and having an adventure with your own pokemon team and the stories created by their capture, others want to 100% the game at any cost and complete the pokedex and others just want to battle and be the best. If you take pokmon and go online with it, what can you do? You can only battle.

Imagine if you could only play Minecraft multiplayer in creative mode. You would be arguing that it's wasted potential even though it would solve the issue.

My point is that what makes people online have similar styles is because of its restrictions on the players. Your analogy with shooters is not so valid because even though you have different styles, you have the same goal as the others. The goal in Minecraft is abstract and subjective, it's no wonder why a server with no guideline shows so much diversity of style.

Because the player choose the goal of the game, the popular servers also make the rules: this is a creative server, this is a battle royal server, this is a survival server, etc...

Those servers make people have similar playstyles but it requires work, diplomacy, establishings the rules of the game. Therefore, I wouldn't say that Minecraft is bad with it, but rather that its solution is social: making the players decide beforehand of the rules.

And lack of a large community isn't so much an excuse. You don't expect all your friends to like the same game, and thus you guys should have decided what you were going to do rather than expecting a game that gives you no long-term goals to give you a reason to play. 

But does this absence of a goal make Minecraft bad for multiplayer? I would argue no, because from my experience of play with the game, it is fun when people have the same goal, play style doesn't really matter. You can have a situation where someone is in creative mode and protect or harass survival mode players and it can be quite fun if people agree that they want to have fun this way. Other games don't give you this choice and you could find this issue for other games like GTA. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mais c'est pas 15-25% de terroristes n'est-ce pas ?

Sur l'ensemble des gens qui pensent que manger de la viande est immorale, quel faible nombre ont agress des humains ? Sur ceux qui pensent que les non-blancs mnent  la ruine financire et culturelle de la France, combien en ont dj tu ? 


Il faut dcider si on veut rgler le problme du terrorisme ou si on aime juste pas le conservatisme des gens dans d'autres pays, et si le second est vrai, faut-il vraiment faire des lois contre les citoyens qui suivent la mme religion ou faut-il modifier nos relations avec ces pays ou stopper de projeter notre pouvoir sur le fonctionnement ?

Et puis comment sont dtermins ces chiffres ? Je sais par exemple qu'une question qui revient souvent c'est si ils veulent appliquer la Sharia, la lecture occidentale de cette question c'est "voulez-vous des lois sexistes et liberticides ?" Mais l'interprtation que les musulmans au Moyen-Orient par exemple auront de cette question c'est plus "Voulez-vous prendre le chemin pour respecter la loi de Dieu?" </TEXT>

<TEXT> Tu noteras que je me suis limit  transposer les propos disant qu'il avait en gros t inspir par Zemmour en substituant le vieux RN assassin et Zemmour par les terroristes islamistes et le Coran.

Bien sr, le sophisme de la cause unique peut s'appliquer au terroriste islamiste comme au terrorisme d'extrme droite, dans tous les cas, une seule cause ne peut expliquer le pourquoi un individu passe  l'acte.

Mais je pense que c'est assez diffrent ce que tu as fait, d'une part on a un gars ayant toujours eu accs  des plateaux, des diteurs pour donner des opinions politiques qui incitent  la haine voire  l'acte de violence. De l'autre tu prends un livre interprt diffremment par plus d'un milliard de personnes.  quel point la comparaison est-elle possible ? Je suis totalement d'accord pour que soient condamns Imams ou influenceurs prnant la haine. Le discours de haine des islamistes n'est pas lgitime aujourd'hui - ou pas autant lgitim pour les extrmes-droites - que la position de Zemmour, d'o une influence assez dangereuse de par la facilit d'accs  son discours.

Le sophisme auquel tu as rpondu est donc plus raisonnable que le tiens, naturellement c'est mon avis, mais c'est pour a que j'ai rpondu au tiens plutt qu' l'autre et que je crois aussi que le tiens mritait plus de critique. Voil, quelqu'un critique quelqu'un d'autre sur internet, rien de surprenant ni de trs violent pour le coup.

 Pour ce qui est des hadiths, je crois qu'aucun courant ne prend comme sacr la totalit des hadths, selon la lgitimit que les pratiquants et les clergs ont envers les diffrents compagnons de Mahomet. Il y a des histoires de terroristes qui font une rinterprtation de ces textes et du Coran mais celle-ci est toujours en raction  une situation politique. Le Coran est un livre qui peut tre interprt pour satisfaire des besoins politiques, comme la Bible pour d'autres, les philosophes des Lumires encore pour d'autres. Mais ce que Zemmour fait c'est justement l'tape suivante de l'incitation  la haine, c'est l'interprtation de diffrents matriaux religieux et philosophique pour encourager un changement politique, qui passe par une dshumanisation d'un groupe peru comme extrieur.

Regarde comment les chrtiens ejectent certains messages de la Bible, comment les philosophes ont ject toutes les dimensions racistes que l'on peut trouver chez Kant par exemple ou le sexisme si prsent que je ne peux citer un auteur en particulier. C'est le contexte politique et idologique qui faonne le sens des crits. Et les humains font a, on dirait, de manire assez universelle. </TEXT>

Ah oui ahah pas mal du tout.

Je sais pas si il va me rpondre, il a sans doute pas le temps avec les islamo-gauchos qui veulent vraiment pas comprendre. 

Genre on a tous compris que les musulmans allaient instaurer un systme thologique o ils sont les seuls vrais citoyens, nous on veut juste une bonne position dans la pyramide des sous-citoyens en servant leurs intrts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> C'est plutt 24% de la population mondiale aime le Coran, et 0,01% sont des terroristes.

100% des terroristes islamistes invoquent cependant des ides fascistes comme le retour  un califat dont ils exagrent les traits, la plupart voquent aussi la ncessit de dfendre leur terre contre les influences occidentales (en mme temps, vu les expriences qu'a connu le Moyen-Orient depuis la guerre froide), et 100% des islamistes influents utilisent des hadths dont la croyance est loin d'tre partage par tous les musulmans.

Enfin la grande majorit du terrorisme islamiste est arm (par vente, soutien stratgie, financier ou pillage) par des pays  qui l'occident ou la Russie vend des armes et commerce. Et que les dynamiques de pouvoir sont incroyablement complexes, tout ceci s'tant dclar aprs diffrentes priodes de scheresse du fait du changement climatique.

Mais oui c'est videmment juste parce que ce livre est lu que mcaniquement, a chie des terroristes, c'est vraiment l'explication la plus plausible et la plus explicative </TEXT>

<TEXT> Transgender people and other LGBTQ+ categories all fight gender norms because of their existence even though they might not wish to be political

Lesbian, gay and bi challenge the heterosexual norm, that you should be in love or have sexual relationship only with the opposite gender.

Trans challenge the norm that your gender is defined by the sex you're born with

These people didn't leave the issue of traditional gender roles through these identities, they experience them in a context where it is in conflict with who they are, and they get their own perspective.

I disagree with the idea that changing your gender makes you disengaged with your former one. Like you can be a homosexual man before your transition or your decision and become therefore a heterosexual woman. Before and after, you are still sleeping with men, but it unreasonable to assume that this transwoman would disregard gay rights because they "fled" their previous situation.

That's why they are formed under one banner of non-majority: LGBTQ. If you add asexual, polyamourus, non-binary, gender-fluid and others. All of these people are the not so small exception to gender as a dual system in which there are supposedly only male and female and that those categories are assigned and not chosen.

When you change your gender, you question or invalidate some aspects of gender, and therefore how could this not question traditional gender roles? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah but, my point is that in a world where you would be totally free to choose your gender, where no physical, monetary, administrative and social consequences would exist, there would be no gender.

The category and the privileges and/or sufferings linked to the category would be meaningless. If people were like chameleon, able to change their skin color at will. The category of race with skin color as its primary differencing factor would not exist.

 Being transgender is political, it is fighting gender norms because their existence is in opposition with the norm. If at a point in time being trans is as accepted as in OP's example, gender would be no more, being cis, being trans, would be invalid categories, having no basis in reality </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi,

If you agree with OP,  you can't express it as a top comment. You can however take part in the conversation by responding to people who challenge OP's view. 

CMV is about being open to have your view challenged by the other side, thus we don't want comments that OP can see directly as reinforcing their initial view. Non-OP can talk freely with everyone and defend any side of the view between them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I mean, there are no other country with a higher share of the population being vegetarian, and that is noteworthy. I never claimed that India was entirely vegetarian. I said that there was a cultural and religious tradition in India with veganism and vegetarianism. And this has still influence as no other country than India has a bigger number of vegetarian.

Emperor Ashoka said 300 years BCE:

Formerly, in the kitchen of Beloved-of-the-Gods, King Piyadasi, hundreds of thousands of animals were killed every day to make curry. But now with the writing of this Dhamma edict only three creatures, two peacocks and a deer are killed, and the deer not always. And in time, not even these three creatures will be killed

The point here is that contrary to what you said, vegetarianism or veganism isn't new, it has more than 2000 years of history as a human behaviour. It also has a religious significance in Hinduism and Buddhism even if you apparently wish it to be false </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the issue here is that you treat gender and "an internal sense of being a certain gender" as the difference between social pressure of being a certain gender and your inner-soul feeling of which gender your are, of which this would be kind of natural?  If I understand correctly.

But at what point do we hear our inner sense of gender? I think your hypothetical example works only in a world where gender roles don't exist. Obviously if there were no social pressure of following a certain gender, waking up as the other gender may not be lived by many people as a strong issue.

The issue I have is that in your example, there are no social norms on gender, sexuality and so on, meaning that it should apply to all people quite equally no? How can cis-gender people exist in your example? Why do these categories make any sense in such a world?

If we agree that cis-gender is this group of people who are influenced by the norm (which you kind of imply), preventing them from being truly open about their being, unable to find their "internal sense of gender", a lot of non-cis people construted their identity in opposition to these. It may be then said that a strong internal sense of being a man or a woman is always linked with the social context - NOT by a somewhat inner feeling free from it. 

I don't see if I'm being clear so I'll just sum it up:
I believe that:
- In a world free from social pressure, a lot of non-cis people might also not have a strong feeling about their identity because dysphoria is born of the social pressure that they did not fit their category.
- So how can we say that we have an inner sense of gender? Free from the social constructs of gender?.

So my response to your view, depending on what you think is true is that either it also applies to non-cis, or that the internal sense of being a man or a woman doesn't really exist if I understood it correctly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The problem with this argument is that it can be used for anything new.

No successful long term culture has ever existed as "connected to the internet" or "using dating apps" or "having nuclear weapons" or "being open to transgender", doesn't mean those societies are going to crumble or even get worst.

The second problem with this argument is that it is empirically false. For centuries, vegan traditions in the Indian subcontinent are still important, make Indians more likely to be vegetarians. Hinduism and Buddhism also contribute to some history and culture being strongly favorable to vegetarianism and veganism. </TEXT>

<TEXT> (NSFW dans le texte)

Je suis pass par une cole catholique prive sous contrat [dont je ne nommerai pas le nom](https://www.chevreullestonnac.fr/). Je me souviens en troisime du "cours d'ducation sexuelle" dont je ne sais jamais si tous les cours en France sont censs suivre la mme prsentation.

Bref, pas de prservatif sur une banane, que des paroles, et j'avoue que je ne me souviens pas de tour ce qui a t discut (je ne me souviens pas par exemple si on a parl de contraception, mais on a parl, du consentement). Cependant, et le dtail que j'ai bien retenu, c'est  quel point cette dame nous expliquait que la sodomie c'tait pas bien, mme avec consentement des deux.

Et j'avais trouv a trs bizarre parce qu'il n'y avait aucun argument  a, c'tait juste pas bien, ce  quoi un lve qui voulait clairement faire le beau s'est oppos  cette dame (parce que lui sodomise tu vois). S'en est suivi un "bah non" "bah si"

Je me souviens ne pas avoir compris sur le moment que c'tait quelque chose pour dire "les relations sexuelles entre hommes c'est pas bien" mme si la sodomie avec des femmes tait aussi condamne.

Aujourd'hui je crois que j'ai un certain plaisir  parler de sodomie avec vous tout en mettant un lien vers mon ancienne cole. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pour moi il y a deux scnarios d'influence entres femmes:

- La mre un peu tradi qui aimerait bien que sa fille mette le voile parce que voil a le fait bien et tout
- Les rseaux sociaux ou des femmes expliquent leur raison de porter le voile

Le premier point, en partant du principe que le voile n'est pas une raison lgitime d'tre discrimine par la socit, ne se distingue en rien des autres formes d'influences patriarcales arbitraires comme le maquillage, les talons, le choix du mtier... Si la justification n'est pas trouve dans des interprtations religieuse, elles se justifient par une espce de biensance sociale aka le rle genr. La mre musulmane tradi n'a pas besoin d'avoir une forte culture religieuse pour se dire que sa famille est bien vue si sa fille porte le voile, c'est la mme source de motivation dans un milieu social diffrent.

Pour le second point, et de mon exprience, les femmes portant le voile influentes sur les rseaux sociaux n'en font jamais l'loge comme leur confrant un degr de supriorit de hlelitude. Tu trouveras toujours certaines qui feront la belle avec a, comme des gamins qui feront les beaux  l'cole parce eux font dj le ramadan et donc nananre j'suis le meilleur (ouais il a pas compris le ramadan). Les gens sont des connards diffremment selon l'ge et la religion en gros.

Mais les musulmanes devraient tre parfaites. Si elles portent le voile, elles doivent dmontrer (ce qui est impossible) au monde entier que oui c'est bien son choix et personne ne l'a forc. Il n'y a que pour ces gens pour qui le choix doit tre diffus.

On est tous en train de juger les autres parce que c'est des moutons, ils sont gauchos "c'est une phase", ils sont transgenres "c'est une mode", ils portent un tatouage "ah a c'est les rseaux sociaux"

On peut toujours expliquer arbitrairement les influences qui jouent dans nos choix, mais seul le voile doit faire l'objet d'une interdiction, indpendamment de ce que la principale intresse pense. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Si l'homme musulman est forcment un dictateur chez lui, quelqu'un peut m'expliquer en quoi interdire le voile, qui entranerait l'interdiction de la femme de sortir, va contribuer  sa libration ? Mme sous les propres hypothses anxiognes des anti-voiles, la finalit est l'oppression et l'isolation des femmes.

Dans la ralit, beaucoup de personnes sont apparemment aveugles ? Je ne peux pas compter le nombre de familles dans la rue et les magasins avec la mre portant le voile mais pas la fille, qu'elle ait 15, 20 ou 30 ans.

Non, disent-ils, la psychologie du musulman ne peut tre qu'un monobloc, tous rflchissent de la mme manire, aucune distinction n'existe entre ces gens l, et si il en existe c'est l'exception plutt que la rgle.

On ne peut pas se tromper, nous ne pouvons pas tre influencs par une mauvaise perception de la ralit li  diffrents biais nous menant  faire un rapprochement entre le terrorisme et les musulmans, ou bien mal comprendre le sens que les pratiquantes donnent  leur pratique de la religion. Elles ne veulent que provoquer et c'est nous les plus intelligents!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, mod here!

Your post covers quite the controversy, so I'm not surprise that you could be lost in how to award it.

So:

Deltas must be awarded to any argument that "changes somewhat your view" and you're really the only one who can define this. However you need to explain what the argument did to your view when you award a delta. "This made me change this part of my view because of this". Any delta given without an explanation showing that something changed your perception is a rule 4 violation.

Therefore you should not award deltas to comment that are well written, funny, that look like good arguments but don't convince you.

You should award deltas to comment that makes you doubt your original view, that correct a thing you thought was true, but in fact no, etc...


Don't forget to be cordial with others, and enjoy the challenge!

Edit: any comment having contributed to changing your view should receive a delta. Deltas also don't mean the conversation ends </TEXT>

<TEXT> People being different and income inequality being good are two different things though.

People are economically different for reasons beyond their choices. This is because strong inequality prevents people from being free (because they are too poor to choose and need to survive).

For example, trying to explain the state of many poor African countries as the sum of individual decisions makes you ignore history. The fact that colonization was organised in order to export raw materials instead of developing the political and economic infrastructure. The fact that decolonization by force led to miltary regimes actively supported by the previous colonial powers are things that reduce drastically your potential (and leads to income inequality). The same histories of slavery, racism, sexism and class can explain inequality in the US.


This idea that current inequality is this kind of natural hierarchy where everyone is at its place cannot be verified empirically. First of all, you'll hardly find modern economist who would argue that the market is actually so efficient and currently perfect that inequality can only be explain by the merit of individuals. (Either because policies ruin it or because the perfect market is more an irrealist ideal rather than something we can observe)

Then, if you so believe that inequality is good because everyone is at their best place, this asks the question of what does it mean when income inequality increases or decreases. 

In what ways enforcing better equality through policies is not the expression of people's freedom in bettering their situation through work: political work?

In what ways does the increase of inequality cannot be the result of technologic changes, lobbying, and international trade? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Je sais pas si j'en connais beaucoup, mais je suis sr que beaucoup prennent la parole. Il est vrai que certaines prfrent discuter de ce genre de choses au sein de mdias cres par la communaut qui leur permet d'aller dans la nuance.

[Exemple d'une Youtubeuse mode qui prend souvent la parole sur ces questions](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbZG-0SLWjNIP8tqtKEVoNg/videos)

[J'ai eu l'occasion d'couter Fatima Khemilat](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcI8ryTY3BVpiVBUq7os9Cw/videos) sur les questions de vaginisme mais il semble qu'elle soit aussi active sur ces sujets l. Elle ne porte pas le voile mais elle est particulirement bien place en tant que sexologue pour les comprendre et en parler (je sais pas si c'est sa vraie chane ou si a reprend juste des interviews)

Sur twitter elles sont trs nombreuses, mais je vous avoue que je ne peux pas faire une bonne synthse de toutes leurs opinions et beaucoup refuseraient sans doute d'aller sur les plateaux vu que l'exprience consiste en un interrogatoire pour dterminer la non-radicalit de leur pratique religieuse. Elles veulent cependant tre entendues. [Exemple](https://twitter.com/louzlapoetesse) et des [assos comme Lallab](https://twitter.com/AssoLallab)

Le fait est que les femmes musulmanes non-voiles ont plus facilement une visibilit mdiatique puisque porter le voile est disqualifiant.

Cette recherche ma fait un peu changer mon analyse prcdente. Non seulement presque aucune femme voile n'a t invit mais pas de musulmanes tout court. </TEXT>

<TEXT> C'est gnial, on est parti d'un gars qui voulait faire sortir une personne d'un conseil rgional, le rglement contre lui, parce qu'il associe le voile avec le terrorisme.

Un dbat avec trs peu de reprsentantes des musulmanes s'en est suivi dans lequel on a plutt discut de si l'accompagnement scolaire devrait tre religieusement neutre, en prtendant librer ces femmes par cette action.

Et maintenant on en est  discuter de l'interdire compltement dans l'espace public ainsi que la kippa histoire d'tre cohrent.

L'acte anti-dmocratique d'un lu du RN a dplac le sujet tellement qu'il apparat normal et lgitime de:

1. Associer le port du voile  un soutien implicite du terrorisme islamiste
2. Associer le port du voile comme un refus d'intgration, sans avoir raliser d'enqute ou aucun travail rigoureux sur la question
3. De refuser la parole des femmes portant le voile car elles seraient soumises et victimes d'un lavage du cerveau

On a ouvert la porte o des personnes majeures considrent qu'ils savent mieux que les autres ce qui est bon pour eux d'un point de vue philosophique et idologique, et o cet avis a le potentiel de faire loi.

Quand un musulman dit "l'Occident est en guerre contre l'Islam" c'est un radicalis et potentiel terroriste. Pourtant depuis 30 ans ils entendent  la tl que "l'Islam est en guerre contre l'Occident" et ces mmes personnes sont toujours en train d'tre coutes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The video is quite fun!

I wonder if it causes all the hell, weird thoughts, superstition, coincidences, and all the bad and weird stuff is thanks to that evil son of a bitch that needs to pay the price for his unreasonably and pure evil sadistic acts.

But what makes you think an evil guy would be needed for this kind of things to happen? concidence can statistically occur, superstition is a human trait. 

If we only have our brain and if our brain interpret these fake signals as real, the interpretation of our brain is still real, and so having superstition, being in pain, has a purpose even though the signals are artificial.

and it probably makes sense that true evil exists, because why else would a neuroscientist want to put my brain in a vat and make me stimulate a fake reality?

What if he wanted to test different situations over and over again to learn about human behavior and save lives? Imagine you've had an accident and we could only save your brain. Doing this lets you live without your body. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A lot of CO2 is used to make windmills

As if building nuclear power plant was carbon neutral? 

are very dangerous and costly to place in the ocean

Wind energy is one of the cheapest, building nuclear power plant of newer generation also requires a lot of money.

 there is not enough place on land for them

This is not true, we have space for coal mines, uranium mines, solar plants, highways, fields to feed animals. Solar panels and little wind turbines can be put on houses.

The problem with local is that we have a massive overpopulation problem and big cities can't just use a dam or some windmills.

When I say local, I'm talking about inside the country's territory where they can build dams and renewable power plants. Have you seen a nuclear power plant in the middle of a city? Electricity can travel.

This is about the strategic advantages of renewables: no countries can prevent you from having sunlight, but they can stop you from getting uranium if they don't like you.

There are no worst case senario's for wind enery but windenergy alone is not enough to safe us from mass extinction.

Isn't this moving the goalposts quite a bit? You never claimed that nuclear power plant could save us from mass extinction. In fact nuclear energy has beneffited from a lot of political support after WWII, but still, solar and wind are growing faster than nuclear ever could.

This is because solar and wind technologies are cheaper, more accessible and don't really require the control of nuclear weapons-armed countries to look if you're not developping nuclear weapons.

Finally, the low cost of manufacture of solar in particular makes it more attractive to developing countries. Solar has been the main contributor of making these country have a low-carbon source of electricity. Nuclear is expensive, hardly accessible compared to solar and wind, which btw complement each other very well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> However wind and sun energy cost a lot of chemicals to make and those chemicals are deadly.

I agree that solar uses chemicals but wind?

Nuclear is the safest source of energy, producing only one-quarter the number of deaths per terrawatt hour as wind. Wind is the second safest and coal the most dangerous with 800000 premature kills a year!

If we put the polluting effects of nuclear waste a moment, nuclear energy can't take all of the energy needs by itself. Nuclear energy comes from uranium which is limited and highly concentrated by a handful of countries like Russia, some African countries and North America. Meaning that for a lot of countries, nuclear energy means importing on a regular basis highly radioactive material, making them dependant on other countries.

If you take wind, solar or dams, the energy production only depend on local, renewable ressources. Nuclear plants are big and sensitive places outside of the citizen control. Solar and wind energy gives the possibility to develop self-production. 

Furthermore, the worst case scenario for nuclear plant mismanagment is contamination of a large area for hundreds of years. What is the worst for wind? for solar? The loss can only be lighter.

If you have any questions please ask me. I hope to change your opinion on nuclear energy with this because solar and wind energy are bullshit and not really helping the enviroment.

This is CMV, you are supposed to be open to changing your view, not convince us that your view is the best. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not trying to say this was wrong, I think the Gini coefficient is a good although flawed summary of the CBS.

Now if you say you only want to look at this data, the Gini did increase, but I'm going to make a better argument, using the data you have provided.

[I have made some graphs using data from Table A4](https://infogram.com/income-inequality-in-the-us-1h8n6mvdojdj6xo?live)

**Graph 1**

The mean household income from the highest quintile went from 43.6% in 1967 of total income to 52% in 2018, while the lowest quintile went from 4% to 3%. The share of 75% of the population went down in some ways between these two dates while the top quintile was the sole and biggest winner.

**Graph 2**

The fact that the GINI coeff is calculated to the hundredth for each year should hint us at the sensivity of this measure. Remember that it goes from Everyone owning an equal part of the total income (Gini=0), 1 person owning 100% of all income (gini=1). You don't expect it to move a lot if not for a revolution.

The point here is that **CBS data does not suggest that greater income inequality is a myth, quite the contrary.**

**Graph 3**

The same as graph 1 but in centile and abolute income </TEXT>

<TEXT> The point I want to make is that the data you shared doesn't really say a lot about relative inequality.

Your data has an absolute part: yearly median incomes according to households type

And relative parts: Gini, relative increase of each type of households, etc...

All of this can be summarized in the gini coefficient: it has slightly increased (you're saying it has remained stable, yes, but not on the "more equal" part of this stability, GINI coefficient isn't supposed to jump by 10 percentage points it's very sensitive) So relative indicators don't show that income inequality has significantly increased nor decreased.

What is sure is that absolute inequality is increasing (all over the world I might add) and this can be seen in the number of new billionaires, reduction in State income redistribution will also add to this trend.

And I don't see how this does not demystify to a point your view that greater income inequality is a myth. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The issue with this is that on one side, everyone seems to be gaining more money (with only a few categories being statistically significant) but the GINI coefficient is still stable? How come?

Say you have person A wins 1000$ one year and B wins 2000$ a year. The GINI coeff for this year is 0.66 (one person out of two has 66% of the income)

Now the next year, A makes 2000$ and B makes 4000$, income has increased the same way for everyone, GINI stays at 0.66. 
However, if we look at absolute inequality, it has double. Before B had 1000$ more than A and now he has 2000$ more.

So as a share of income, everything seems stable, but if everyone's income was to double, the richest people would get a lot more money than anyone else.

What this means is that aggregates only show part of the reality (like anything really). If A was the bottom 10% and B the top 10%, doubling their income has very different impact on their life. A can now eat, pay the debt contracted by predatory lendings but will fall back in poverty the moment they have a medical bill to pay (if they are not covered by medicaid, I'm not American, I don't know how this works)

B will be able to buy a third mansion and accumulate more wealth.

Wealth is also an important part of inequality, the 1% richest people might still represent 10~20% of all income, but they own around 50% of the wealth.

Finally, two kinds of data are hard to actually measure:

- How much do the very poor make, because some of it is not declared or illegal.

- How much do the very rich make, because they move their money in property, other countries with financial secrecy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bon dsol, c'est long...C'est pas spcialement contre ta rponse, c'est juste que j'avais aussi besoin d'exprimer a. :) (naturellement tu peux juste ignorer cette rponse)

 De l'autre ct on parle de civils qui sont obligs de se couvrir

Je comprends tout  fait l'histoire des pressions et tout, mais tu as quand mme dit qu'il y avait obligation vis--vis de cette tradition. Cependant le fait de ne pas porter le voile est - en dpit des pressions - quelque chose d'accept pour la majorit des musulmans et quelque chose qui connat des niveaux d'acceptance varis entre les pays musulmans et  l'intrieur de ces pays. 

Aujourd'hui il n'y a pas de pression religieuse vestimentaire applique aux hommes chrtiens, aux femmes chrtiennes (excepts ceux du clerg) et aux hommes musulmans.

La pression n'est pas forcment justifie par la religion mais il y a toujours des pressions sociales sur la manire de s'habiller. Pour le coup, au sein du clerg c'est de l'ordre de l'obligation. Les femmes connaissent trs bien la ralit de leur pre ou de leur frre ou de leur partenaire qui font des remarques sur leur tenue. Qu'une manire de s'habiller les font tantt passer pour une pute, tantt pour celle  marier, dans tous les cas, elles connaissent des pressions pour s'habiller d'une certaine manire

D'une part il y a une hypocrisie lorsque l'on parle de a, o les gens deviennent dterministes sur la question du voile (les femmes le portant tant victimes de pressions qui les mnent  le porter, en les persuadant malgr leur volont initiale) mais vacuent alors la question du dterminisme pour tous les autres choix religieux, identitaires, vestimentaires, etc...

La femme est libre de porter une robe des talons, l'homme serait libre de ne pas en porter.

La socit franaise et l'Etat franais ont probablement fait plus pour encourager les femmes  se voiler que leur maris. Rejet du burkini juste parce qu'on a pas envie de montrer son corps, rejet du voile dans le collge, lyce avec la question de l'universit qui revient souvent. 

Il y a une provocation dans le fait d'interdire des choses pour lesquelles elles avaient auparavant le droit de choisir, en crant le mood "qu'est-ce que tu vas faire? Je suis musulmane". Quelque chose qu'on retrouve pour les choses les plus banales et les plus importante "tu veux plus de manifestations dans les rues? On va te montrer ce que c'est une manifestation"

Je ne vois pas en quoi, rguler, interdire le voile, faire pression sur une marque pour ne pas commercialiser un voile spcifique pour le footing ou la natation "libre" ces femmes de l'emprise des pressions qu'elle aurait chez elle. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Elles ne sont pas obliges de se couvrir par tradition culturelle et religieuse, je crois que seulement 20~30% des musulmanes portent le voile.

 part a je suis d'accord avec la critique du dessin, contrairement  une none le voile islamique n'est pas tant un indicateur de sa religiosit qu'il n'est le rsultat d'une interprtation de sa foi, ce qui mne  mal encore plus la comparaison des deux. Une femme musulmane ne portant pas le voile peut en fait tre plus religieuse (nb de prires, basant plus ses valeurs sur son interprtation religieuse, aller  la mosque, etc...) qu'une le portant. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're making a lot of generalisation about disabilities. Not all of them are as expensive as you think they are.

People with disabilities do have relationships, marry, work and I don't know where you're getting this idea that they play video games.

Disabled people around the world participate in the paralympics to show their determination to suceed despite of their disabilities

All disabilities do not come from birth and a lot of them are people having an accident in the middle of their life, with children, parents living this situation around them. Some of them got this disability because of their work.

Finally being autistic doesn't prevent someone to contribute to society. They can do work, manual, artistic, intellectual in sometimes better ways than "normal people" can. But being disabled puts you in a more fragile position due to the physical world or the societies organisation. </TEXT>

I wasn't trying to trick you. Pointing out a logical fallacy is never associated with a rule 2 violation but with rule 3. However, none of your comments were removed for rule 3. It wasn't the reason why they were removed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your comment from 7 month ago was removed because you asked your conversation-partner if they had reading comprehension issues, and also said that they were a moron.

You could have appealed and edited your comment in order to reinstate it. Just to be clear, your comment wasn't removed for pointing out a logical fallacy.

Although it was true that "moving the goalposts" was considered a rule 3 violation (it seems your comments were only removed for rule 2), moderation guideline around this specific issue have changed recently and are more open to it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wikipedia says that as of April 2016 Russia has the lowest suicide rate in 54 years, 54 years ago it was still the Soviet Union.

[But there was a spike after the fall](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/suicide-rates-by-country?time=1980..2005 country=RUS) but I will agree that Russia's suicide rate has always been higher than other capitalist countries.

The point was rather than you can enjoy capitalism in retrospective, but developing in a capitalist manner included unfairness in that development and a certain suffering. The industrial revolution was terrible for a lot of people, as many died and were injured because of manufacturing. People were displaced from their farms due to lower food prices and plunged into poverty as they reach the city. There's many process and the argument still holds that this was all worth it or that a different system would have shown similar results (working in communist USSR and China was worst). But the point is that capitalism and its development had and still has its human and environmental cost. bringing those issues on a stronger manner can be lead to being tagged a SJW while adressing serious issues

It really bugs me how you justify my dislike of SJWs because I am less left than SJWs, because that is completely false. I'm from Sweden, and I love the Nordic Model, I think it's amazing. Now the Nordic Model is what Bernie Sanders wants to base the American economy on, and Bernie Sanders is as left as you can go in the US.

I mean this applies to everyone, no offense was intended. I think anyone think that your own political vision is the correct one, and boxes in which you put stronger or weaker version of your political views are used in order to classify those people. People more at the left exagerate, while people more on the right are biggoted. I'mnot saying you're thinking that but you get the point I hope.

My argument is that all (what right-wing calls) SJW aren't trolls, some are very capable of talking reasonably about cultural appropriation, those are labelled as SJW (which is pejorative) because of the most noisy being heard the most on stupid things like the examples you gave. 

Basically, trolls didn't invent cultural appropriation but they use it horribly on social media. And I think it's useful to the right and far-right to give exclusivity to SJW/trolls for these real issues.

The issue on cultural appropriation was never an individualistic one, and it doesn't make sense to solve it by censoring individual people who never thought of this. I agree. The main way to adress it might be to recognise a property of the ways in which cultural items are made and distributed. Maybe it shouldn't be free (and I'm not arguing for money but maybe educate the customer on the item and its significance, ask for authorisation from institutions, etc...) for Zara to be "inspired" by small creators from all other the world. In the same way, maybe it shouldn't be free for manufacturers to just take the material without the culture behind it.

If the definition of SJW is to be left-wing trolls, then we shouldn't think of the issue we're talking about as the only version of this issue. They are toll after all.

Look at /r/MensRights which apprently wants to promote equal rights but is just an anti-feminist group. It also only argues with extreme feminists or decontextualised feminist quotes or discussions. And we don't let /r/MensRights define what mens rights should look like. Feminists are concerned about this because it is linked with womens rights, and also because feminists are more often on the left than on the right, so they are for parental leave like you have in Sweden (it would be great if it was socially acceptable in France), they are for less incarceration, more education, etc..

A bit of a long post sorry, I'll understand if you don't read it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree, but at this point it's important to see that people concerned with cultural appropriation aren't all trolls. Harrassing is not a good strategy to educate.


I don't think they would like a US manufacturer of kimonos as big as the Kardashians might be able to create. They want to keep the traditionnal label behind the term. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The point about not being colorblind but rather racially conscious stems from the fact that we play roles society leads us to play.

Even if you intellectually and morally don't see the difference between people based on their origin or their color (and you shouldn't see any difference), you can still act in ways that reinforce racism even unintentionnally.

It's the same way with sexism. If, especially as a male, you stay silent when confronted with sexism, you're not challenging the status quo and helping culturally making a change. It can be a collegue bragging about his sexual performance while describing sexual assault, rape, or just talking about women as an object.

For race, being colorblind means that you can't control your biases as much as someone who thinks about the effects of racism. Being racially colorblind doesn't contradicts racism, it's indifferent to it, which won't change anything.

So obviously internet is really bad in expressing what it really means, also because a lot of SJW don't actually read the research behind it and talk a lot about those things mixing up individual intention and the roles given by society. Meaning the feeling perceived by people like you is one of agression rather than an invitation to question yourself about the racial role you play. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why shouldn't we be allowed to name our brand "Kimono" just because the kimono is a traditional Japanese dress?

This isn't a good example as trademarking the name of common items can be argued to be an overreach of private property. Furthermore, it wasn't leftist SJW who led the Kardashian to not name their brand kimono but Japan's ministry of trade who demanded that they don't do it. The point here is that SJW can be the voice of people who didn't previously complained about those things, there's an economic and political interest for every culture to keep the authenticity of their cultural practices. Cultural appropriation can lead to removing that exclusivity and the power it brings behind it.

If native-american hats became or become more of a toy than the traditionnal and important role it holds for the natives, how can people who use it as toys can recognize the cultural importance of those items? It's mostly a toy in their eyes.

I don't think however that wealth should be equally distributed. Why? Because look at the Western World! Europe and North America is so much more developed than the rest of the world because of Capitalism. Look at pictures of Moscow before and after the fall of the Soviet regime, it's incredible how prosperous capitalism makes a country. People should get more money for their services if they provide better and more important services than other people who provide lesser services.

So are you putting SJW and people who think capitalism is bad together? There are sound arguments against capitalism. Moscow may have developped but since the fall of the Soviet Union, suicide rates have skyrocketted.

There's also another dimension: because capitalism was in some ways responsible for a long development of the west, it doesn't mean that this is the best system today for us. For example, most economists argue that financial liberalisation is good for the economy, but they also say that the developed nations don't need it as much anymore.

Maybe you're putting people in the SJW category just because they seem to be more leftist than you, it doesn't mean they all belong to the cyber bullies as OP puts it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> AOC never initally differentiated between Nazi concentration camps and Nazi death camps.

She did say concentration camp and not death camp. Why does the "never again" only applies to the death camp? There's an argument to be made that never again should encompass the process by which human rights are deeply violated. Would we not have a "never again" nazis did everything they did but the industrial assassination? The holocaust didn't start with the deaths but with normalised racism and institutional oppression of jews.

Furthermore the video you posted on the previous comment is not really a pertinent response in ly opinion. For any comparison you can find differences and only include these differences in order to give the impression that two events have nothing in common.

If you put aside the "imprisonned without a trial on a massive scale", "dishumanising of the victims", "mistreatment of those detained" yeah those two events have nothing in common.

If a republican were to use the swastika in some advertisement and try to defend it because it predated the third Reich, you would rightfully be upset. Same idea goes here.

Of course, and for the same reason AOC might be right to make that comparison with the holocaust. We're not in the context where Nazis are no longer, we're in a context of strengthening far right and fascist views and acts. Just because the target is different doesn't mean that we're not witnessing the beginings of a giant human right abuse. 

A comparison to a terrible event can give light on an ignored issue, and in order to not give attention to this ignored issue, the logical counter-argument is to attack the comparison. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi,

Rule 1 does state that change must go in the opposite direction of the view.

The wiki on rule 1 states as an example of violation:

Positively expanding the view while leaving the original view unchallenged; comments that argue OP's suggestions "don't go far enough"

This is why your comment was removed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Il y a quoi que tu comprends pas par "reprendre les bases"? Mme si ils ne se donnent pas ce nom, les noclassiques ont des hritiers dans leur pense (surprise c'est comme si il n'y avait de forte rupture dans la pense et que tout tait une histoire de processus). Tu as volontairement ignor ma rfrence aux conomistes comportementaux, on peut aussi inclure les thoriciens des jeux.

Tu te concentres sur l'tiquette noclassique, tu m'accuses du coup de ne pas connatre ou lire les tudes modernes alors que tu ne rponds pas  ma description de en quoi consiste la plupart des tudes modernes orthodoxes.

Tu es en train de me dire que la plupart des tudes orthodoxes ne sont pas des tests statistiques sur une base quantitative ou sur un modle pour juste voir si x a un effet sur y? Serais-tu en train de me dire que les tudes orthodoxes ne reprennent jamais les concepts dvelopps par les conomistes noclassiques ? Tu n'as jamais lu une tude o  l'quilibre partiel est cit ? O l'externalit est cite? O la thorie de l'agence est cite ? 

Tu crois que les conomistes modernes apprennent quoi au juste ? Je n'ai jamais dit que ces courants n'avaient pas volu, j'ai dit qu'ils reprenaient les bases, notamment les hypothses plus ou moins problmatiques.


Il est vrai que marxistes et autrichiens ont tendance  tre normatifs maintenant. Mais leur opposition avec le courant noclassique et leurs hritiers part vraiment de la dconstruction des hypothses des noclassiques, pareil que les keynsiens

<TEXT> Hey /u/Serialk, si /u/Argh3483 se fait modrment downvot, c'est parce que sa comparaison est inexacte.

Par orthodoxe, on englobe surtout deux coles de la pense: les noclassiques dont leur forme moderne peut tre caractrise par les behavioralist (conomie comportementale) et les no-keynsiens comme Stiglitz.

Leur point commun ? Tous continuent d'utiliser  les bases microconomiques et macroconomiques dvelopp par les noclassiques aprs la fin de la thorie de l'quilibre gnral.

Si on les appelle les orthodoxes, c'est parce que c'est la norme, les conomistes qu'on retrouve couramment. La plupart des tudes en conomie raliss par les conomistes de ces coles consistent souvent  faire des tests statistiques sur un de leurs nombreux modles mathmatiques pour expliquer ce qu'il peut se passer en changeant des conditions sans expliquer pourquoi.

L'orthodoxie change, pendant une courte priode aprs la seconde guerre mondiale, la fin de la thorie de l'quilibre gnral comme but des conomistes noclassiques a laiss la place aux Keynsiens. Dans ce temps, les Keynsiens ont particip  la prolifration de la comptabilit nationale et la prise en compte de la monnaie dans la theorie conomique.

L'heterodoxie, c'est le reste, et c'est vraiment pas l'homopathie. a va de l'cole marxiste  l'cole autrichienne ou montariste en passant par les institutionnalistes. Ils sont pas allergiques aux maths mais ils ont pour point commun une volont d'analyser l'conomie comme elle est plutt que comme elle devrait tre.

Plutt que de parler de "dysfonctionnement" de marchs (par quels symptmes le march ne correspond pas  notre ide du march parfait), les htrodoxes diront "ah voil comment fonctionne ce march et voil pourquoi il est comme a".

Franchement "minuscule minorit" c'est un gros mot. Considre que beaucoup des plus grands conomistes (dans le sens: qui ont t les plus influents) ne sont pas des orthodoxes:

Friedmann, Hayek, Coase, Becker, North, Sen, Ostrom et tout rcemment Romer sont des exemples d'conomistes nobliss et donc reconnus qui se situent dans des courants htrodoxes.

Avant de parler d'homopathie je t'invite donc  consulter la notice. Les htrodoxes ne sont pas victimes, ils ont en commun une opposition avec ceux qui s'ancrent dans les hypothses et les mthodes employes par les noclassiques.

Les orthodoxes se percevant comme la science conomique, ils ne se posent que rarement la question de la pertinence de ce qu'ils font, pour une partie en tout cas.

C'est plus facile de considrer les contre-arguments comme prononces par des victimes illumines plutt que de prendre en compte les contre-arguments </TEXT>

<TEXT> I mean, as long as we want to think it doesn't, historically it kind of have.

If words didn't promote actions, why would political discourse even exist? What's the point of sharing ideas if there are no actions wanted?

Did Hitler's speech at the time enabled antisemitic and xenophobic behaviours? I would think yes

When the Pope says that contraception isn't compatible with christian values, I think he tries to change the actions of certain people.

In the same way, provocation, moral harrasment has led to actions which can take the form of violence. I'm not sure about it, but I think that school shooters are often bullied before they act.

Now it might never be a justification for those actions, but it's irresponsible to not be careful about what you say on the public space. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Certes, mais dans la mthode c'est injuste de comptabiliser le CO2 produit plutt que consomm, donc c'est pour a que c'est abandonn et qu'on utilise la mthode du CO2 consomm.

Oui pour la premire partie et non pour la seconde parce que c'est vraiment plus dur. Estimer les missions de CO2 demandent des statistiques prcises sur toutes les chelles de l'conomie. Imagine un pays en dveloppement pour qui investir dans ces estimations n'est vraiment la priorit. Mesurer l'mission d'un produit import est trs compliqu (sauf quand ce sont des matires premires) et c'est aussi cet obstacle technique qui ralentit l'implmentation d'une taxe carbone  la frontire par exemple.

Si, plutt en fait. On calcule les imports et les exports, mme avec l'espace Schengen on a une ide trs claire de qui achte quoi  qui, on a mme un systme de TVA intracommunautaire.

C'est vrai, on sait ce genre de choses mais pas sur les processus de productions et leurs missions, qui peuvent varier d'un lieu de production  l'autre. Mme les grandes entreprises ne connaissent pas tous les dtails de leur processus de production  l'instant o ils sous-traitent ou importent une partie de leur consommation intermdiaire ncessaire  la fabrication de leur produit.

Mesurer la production de CO2, c'est simple en comparaison: telle quantit de vaches sur le territoire, telle quantit de charbon consomme, tant d'nergie  tel taux de carbone utilis pour l'industrie, tant de trajets raliss par tels moyens de transport par chantillonnage.

L'une des richesses de l'UE, c'est d'avoir oblig certains secteurs  faire ces estimations  leur place, mais la pression de le faire n'est certainement pas la mme chez tous les pays.

Il existe des estimations qui prennent en compte les effets du commerce, mais pour ce qui est de l'accord de Paris, c'est uniquement les missions produites par chaque pays qui sont observes. De plus il est comprhensible que les pays occidentaux prfrent politiquement la mthodologie n'incluant pas les effets de l'importation, a donnerait vraiment une mauvaise image, mme quand c'est l'UE. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Je suis plutt en dsaccord avec l'ide que cette approche est utilise. Le document de eurostats spcifie par exemple que le charbon import met du CO2 comptabilis uniquement lors se sa consommation.

Il est plus facile d'estimer les missions produites plutt que consommes du fait du march des quotas europen qui donne un chantillon important des missions industrielles plutt que d'estimer les missions des processus de production des biens imports. Les institutions europenne n'ont pas une connaissance parfaite de quelle quantit de quel type traverse les frontires de l'Europe en un an. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Je vais faire le commentaire de l'colo relou:

- C'est cool d'avoir une rduction aussi petite soit-elle, et c'est normal que les missions en Europe de l'Est augmentent puisque c'est l o est une grande partie de l'industrie. L'augmentation serait moins grande si ces pays, notamment la Pologne, pouvaient rduire l'utilisation du charbon.

- Il faut rappeler que les missions de la plupart des pays europens sont sous-estims de par l'absence des missions industriels des produits que l'on importe. Un pays qui importe au lieu de produire soit-mme verra ses missions se rduire, bien que la production d'nergie soit la plus importante ici.

- Comme le Monde le signale, peu d'engagements pris par ces Etats nous mne  un monde en dessous de 2C d'augmentation. [Cette carte trs intressante montre  quelle temprature le monde serait si la plante entire suivait l'engagement du pays cibl (si on tait seul sur terre mais qu'on polluait  l'chelle d'une plante de la taille de notre pays genre)](https://paris-equity-check.org/warming-check.html#). La carte a perdu son certificat de scurit j'sais pas quoi mais promis a risque rien </TEXT>

2. Even if the post is removed for good, you still broke a rule, to which you can still appeal.
3. We don't go individually under each post to moderate, we use a modqueue which centralises comments

If you have questions about how CMV works or why we make certain choices, you can read the wiki and/or feel free to message us. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Within 1 minute he was ordered to leave because of the danger! 

This also happens when the police don't want things to escalate. From the police perspective, it might entirely be to stop him continue his provocative behaviour

 You don't need permission to protest.

I then don't understand why he said he wanted to protest and arguing on the phone that he isn't protesting 

Because one side is violent the other isn't? That is where I draw the line?

It might be easy to making you believe anything if you don't see beyond the physical violence. Words and demonstration of power is violent in its own way.

 You sure he didn't try to open the door to drag him out of the car?

Honestly, he wasn't desperate to try to go this far, he stopped when he got seen by the cop. A more violent intention would have not stopped here.

You're still kind of making the argument that those people should've had a perfect behaviour against this provocation rather than recognizing the provocation as a political tool. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not sure you are following? But the guy is being psychically attacked?

Oh yes, he is being threatened, and pushed a bit. Being surrounded by police I was never really worried for him really. It's hardly an attack where he was in real danger. In this short situation the politician calls security even though he was already sourrounded by policemen, claiming to be attacked while he wasn't. This was the final provokation which led him being "attacked" meaning here, pushing his bodyguard and insulting him. 

Why do you make apologize for people attacking him? Why do you think this is about something else? Or that it isn't "that bad"?

The reasoning is very simple: 

- The subtitles consider that every people he interacts with in this video are immigrants

- He wanted to protest, didn't seem to have an authorisation to do so, but came anyway to do his political demonstration

- He comes with a bulletproof vest as if it was nothing, and you're asking me why I think this is about "something else" than him being attacked? 

- He calls 112 while surrounded by police and bodyguard to say that he is being attacked by muslims, while at the time not being attacked, acting the final provocation of the afternoon

- The cameraman says that it is "exciting' to see how they react

You can notice how it's really only one guy being violent, one of his friend trying to stop him

Honestly, I don't see how you can claim this is only about someone being attacked. I'm not making an apology for the people spitting on him, pushing someone and trying to open the car's door just to annoy.

Why are you putting all the responsibility of this event on "immigrants" as they are portrayed, and not even a bit on the bulletproof-oh-so-innocent guy? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  If you become violent after you seek a person who you know only searches the attention in order to prove the point, that immigrants are violent and Islam is dangerous and you are a muslim and immigrant.
 
 Then you have no business in Denmark and you should leave the country and if you attack him, during a political demonstration, you should be kicked out and your residence should be canceled.
 
 It's that simple.

May I make the hypothesis that this only applies to immigrants who would be there illegally? Because for the rest, they have as much freedom to shout at the guy, film him, argue with him, even annoy him during the filming of his political video as any other citizen. So your reasoning should only applies to violence, being a muslim or an immigrant shouldn't really matter here.

In the end you're saying "aha you shouldn't have fallen for this political trap this guy made, now get out of Denmark because you're being violent". Still this is a dickish move to make from this politician, not because it targets muslims or immigrants but because it is a political trap made to show the bad side of some people because they don't agree with you. It's an easy trap to fall in, because you want to make a response, in the same ways that people argue with trolls on the internet

A lot of mild violence happens between people who disagree on things, but you expect muslim or immigrants to have a perfect psychologic resistance when it might hit their personal values or misrepresent their actual behaviors and motivations? </TEXT>

<TEXT> A lot of people who don't really like islam or immigrants can express their opinion in a different way than costly provocation.

It's easy to defend provocation as a right of expression and as a way to prove a point, but if someone harasses you claiming you are violent or that you shouldn't be here, you might become violent with this person at some point. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The point is: that if they had been adults, they would've gone to jail, but because of juvenile law they weren't.

Probation doesn't mean they weren't condemned, the title kind of implies nothing happened to them, but they are condemned to probation. It might not suits you, but saying they aren't punished is technically false.

The goal here is that they never do this again, jail is not the best place to grow as a human being. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I found the story and it's always more nuanced than the title says:

On Thursday the gang was convicted of rape, with the court saying they treated the girl "like an object".

But only the adult, named as Bosko D, was handed a four-year jail sentence.

Zivora S, 17, Alexander K, 16, and Dennis Masser, 15, were given probation under juvenile law.

The judge said that despite the "terrible and repulsive" attack, the gang had shown "real shame and remorse" during the trial. </TEXT>

<TEXT> J'aime beaucoup comment Marianne reconnat France24 comme l'quivalent d'al-jazeera et de TRT : un mdia qui prsente la vision du monde de son pays.

Je trouve assez malhonnte de la part de Marianne de rsumer a  une sorte de tratrise. Il arrive  Al-Jazeera de fournir un travail journalistique trs srieux, sans pour autant lui enlever le reproche d'tre un mdia soumis  des pressions de son Etat comme c'est en gnral le cas dans tous les pays (certains plus que d'autres)

Bref, ce reproche qu'ils avaient dj fait  AJ+ pour les deligitimer car oh mon dieu, c'est la proprit d'une dictature/rgime autoritaire musulman est juste l pour faire un titre pute  clic, prsentant Diallo comme une sorte de traitre  la France.

Ensuite les critiques sont sur quelques mots mal choisis par Diallo, comme le terme d'"unanime" alors que "majoritaire" aurait t sans doute plus adapt.

Marianne laisse penser que l'argument derrire la tribune de Diallo sur l'exportation de l'islamophobie franaise est lie aux actions de Macron alors que celle-ci ne cite pas Macron mais Camus et la sphre des essayistes ractionnaires franais.

Marianne base un peu sa critique sur une certaine hypocrisie de Diallo en publiant sur un mdia turc li au pouvoir. Ceci vite  Marianne de rpondre aux arguments plus intressant de Diallo, ceux qui au fond motivent les positions de la journaliste.

Marianne ne traite pas ces arguments de l'article :

- La controverse autour du hijab de sport pose la question que l'identit franaise qu'il faut avoir pour tre accept dpasse l'identit franaise comme dfini par nos lois. Ainsi la controverse a exist parce que certaines personnes trouvent que les femmes voiles ne devraient pas avoir accs  un quipement sportif qui convient  leurs valeurs.

- L'interdiction du voile dans les collges et lyces comme mauvaise ide est dfendue par la citation d'une tude de Stanford faisait le constat que l'interdiction a eu un effet ngatif sur les notes de ces lves.

- Diallo cite de nombreuses controverses autour du voile comme remettant en question la lgitime de raliser certaines tches. Elle cite, participer aux missions de tl, accompagner des enfants lors d'activits extrascolaires, tre invite sur un plateau tl, tre candidate  une lection, avoir un stand au march de Nol. Elle cite des liens  chaque fois.

- Sa critique du fait qu'on ne demande jamais aux femmes concernes ce qu'elles pensent, en citant l'Institut Montaigne

Elle finit par poser la question qui rsume l'argument cur du fminisme dcolonial: Comment est-ce possible de faire la promotion du fminisme tout en excluant des femmes de la sphre publique.

Le problme n'est pas qu'il faut tre d'accord avec Diallo parce qu'elle a des arguments, le problme c'est que Marianne critique (comme ils ont beaucoup l'habitude de faire) sur d'o une personne crit et sur quel mdia avec quels liens financiers, en faisant des petites corrections factuelles sans s'engager dans le dbat en rpondant aux vrais arguments des gens qu'ils critiquent.

Marianne qui trs rcemment se considre le rempart contre les thories decoloniales pointent souvent du doigt l'origine amricaine de ces thories. Ils ne veulent dcidment pas passer par wikipdia pour dcouvrir que... surprise... la vraie origine de ces thories est en France (cf french theory). Di ils veulent dbattre, ils feraient mieux d'entrer dans le dbat d'ides plutt que de s'attaquer  ses auteurs </TEXT>

<TEXT> Le patriarcat ne dsigne pas "les hommes" comme le matriarcat n'est pas le synonyme de "les femmes". Les deux systmes ne peuvent pas coexister car ils renvoient  qui appartient le pouvoir finale.

On pourrait se dire que le systme est matriarcal si il y avait une pression particulire sur les hommes qui les placerait dans une situation o ils n'ont pas la libert d'exprimer le pouvoir. Or, ici, si la virginit a une valeur c'est parce que sinon c'est difficile/impossible de marier la femme et que son honneur est dfini par si oui ou non elle est marie (dans les familles traditionnelles).

Dans une socit patriarcale (qui a ses points ngatifs pour les hommes, puisque pression sociale  correspondre aux attentes), l'homme est charg d'tre le gagne-pain, tre en contact avec l'extrieur de la maison, et dans le cas prsent il n'est pas vraiment affect par le concept de virginit. Aucun signe physique fiable n'est employ pour dfinir si il a perdu sa virginit ou non, et aucune relle pression ne les empchent eux de copuler avant le mariage (tandis qu'on emploie pour les femmes un signe physique non-fiable pour dfinir si elle est vierge).

On peut difficilement parler de matriarcat  mes yeux </TEXT>

<TEXT> C'est ce qu'on appelle "l'intriorisation" de valeurs et normes sociales.

Je fais mon fministe dans ce post, parce que a ne remet absolument pas en question le patriarcat d'observer ce genre de situation, bien au contraire.

Pourquoi la virginit est-elle un bien prcieux pour ces personnes? C'est parce que sinon tu ne peux pas tre marie, et il en va de soi:  un homme. Mais aussi tu mets la honte sur ta famille (mre ET pre). En gros juste parce que linteraction est mre-fille, ne va pas croire que les hommes n'existent pas.

Imaginons un anti-capitaliste: il est oppos au systme, mais il est bien oblig d'entrer dans des mcanismes capitalistiques si il veut tre intgr  la socit capitaliste. Il est oblig de consommer des produits qui ont t produits ailleurs, par des firmes avec qui il est en dsaccord idologique.

Du coup dire l'quivalent que le problme du capitalisme, c'est que les anti-capitalistes se l'imposent souvent  eux-mmes, a ne permet pas vraiment de dire quoique ce soit.

La rponse c'est que  lorsque les femmes sont dans le patriarcat, elles n'ont justement pas le choix de faire autrement que de soumettre  un rle dfinit par la classe masculine, et a inclut d'duquer les filles  ce que la virginit c'est si important pour le mariage qu'il faut pas qu'elle fasse de btises non plus. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would argue that not getting an education has a more direct effect on your own power than wearing or not a piece of fabric on your head. Fewer women are arguing that they shouldn't get an education than that they should have the right to wear a hijab

If someone would go and see muslim feminists, they would observe a mix of veiled and unveiled women criticising the male-centric interpretation of Islam, in Iran or Saudi Arabia, they would fight for their right of not wearing it. In the occident they would fight for their right of wearing it.

As a response to your argument, I'm really not seeing how these are women influenced by this Islam in a way that prevents them from saying male oppression in this instance. 

A ban on hijabs would certainly make the legislator a new kind of oppressor where women should not wear a hijab because supposedly that means they are "not free" in their head. Which is the same reasoning behind the alcohol prohibition era of the US " people are not free when drinking alcohol, they are free when they are sober, therefore they shouldn't have the freedom to drink". But again arguably, drinking alcohol is worst than wearing a certain clothing

<TEXT> Note: I am someone else

You should consider the limits of the study you have linked. First of all because not a lot of people can access the study further than its abstract, and because you overinterpret the reach of this study.

I have linked to an actual scientific study that says while boys are more aggressive girls are more manipulative

The study's conclusions can be summarized like this:

The principal finding was that girls of the two older cohorts overall make greater use of indirect means of aggression, whereas boys tend to employ direct means.

Our studies suggest that the differentiation between direct and indirect strategies of aggression presents a more exact picture. Indirect aggressive strategies were not yet fully developed among the 8yearold girls, but they were already prominent among the 11yearold girls. Aggressive behaviour was assessed overall by the children themselves to be the highest in this age group.

Indirect means of aggression does not mean that they are being more manipulative, at least the researchers don't go into the details of what that entails and you shouldn't do. Also consider that the study only looks at young girls and boys, and claiming that your argument is scientifically valid while covering older aged women and men is not accurate.

Reaching other arguments of your in your thread shows that you do not really consider any feminist theory to be accurate, but counter-studies which benefit your view seems to be as accurate as one can wish. You recognize that the Duluth model has been critically analysed by feminists. I find it to be an overeach to use women's supposed tendency to manipulate more than men as an explanation fo their success as a feminist lobby when most of lobbies and high business positions are mostly held by men. Truly the positions where manipulation takes place in the world are mainly held by men, so I guess manipulation is something that one can learn.

And this is because I think you interpret academic studies in a way that fits your vision of how women are like and why logically they should be in a position to dominate men. Bu by many metrics, this is not the case, and a lot of arguments masculinist group make are not contradictory to what feminists defend.

Sometimes, a public policy might be poorly implemented, many policies are, and a lot affect certain categories of people, sometimes by design. Black people, women, immigrants, rural citizens, men... And there's a difference between what feminist wants, and what lobbies have been pushing for.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In fine lIslam est une religion de domination et  moins que ses instances religieuses nadoucissent leur interprtation des sourates, cela restera une menace pour nos dmocraties.

A quel point les sourates doivent tre adoucies pour correspondre  tes attentes de non-menace dmocratique? On pointe souvent du doigt le fait que les pays musulmans sont bien souvent des rgimes autoritaire, et dans les dictatures, le contrle du corps et de la sexualit est trs important. En gros je vois pas la religion comme un facteur explicatif du progrs ou de la rgression du droit des femmes ou des droits de l'homme.

Ces phrases du genre "l'Islam est un religion de domination", a veut pas dire grand chose, surtout quand l'Islam ressemble plus au protestantisme dans le sens o l'interprtation est beaucoup plus individualiste que chez les catholiques par exemple. Le fait que l'Islam doit dcentralis, qu'il existe la ["science"](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/tudes_islamiques), et que la religion connaisse ses mouvement fministes en pleine expansion aux multiples interprtations laisse ce genre de gnralisation assez ubuesque  mon humble opinion, et a vaut pour toutes les religions. 

Il est clair que l'islam joue un rle politique dans ces pays, comme il est employ par les terrorismes pour lgitimer leur action de la mme manire que le nationalisme est employ pour lgitimer une rvolution, un coup d'Etat ou des guerres. Une doctrine religieuse pourra toujours tre un obstacle  certains droits, l'avortement notamment, mais il ne faut pas surestimer son impact non plus. </TEXT>

<TEXT> lhumanit  admis depuis que la terre est ronde et que la femme est lgale de lhomme... 

a fait depuis l'antiquit qu'on sait que la terre est ronde, un fait qui n'a jamais t contest par l'Eglise, et de plus pendant l'antiquit on ne pensait surtout pas que la femme tait l'gal de l'homme.

Donc je crois que tu confonds avec l'ide de Copernic et Galile sur le fait que la Terre n'tait pas au centre du systme solaire mais gravitait autour de notre toile, ce que l'Eglise,  l'poque, n'admettait en effet pas.

Et la encore, c'est pas du tout au XV, au XVI, au XVII, etc que la femme a t considre l'gal de l'homme. Si pour simplifier l'galit on entend le droit de vote des femmes, il aura fallu attendre 1944 en France. Il aura fallu 1984 pour que les femmes puissent courir le marathon aux JO. Le progrs des droits des femmes ne date en occident que d'un seul sicle...soit  peu prs pareil que le monde musulman

Je trouve que c'est un contre-sens d'accuser l'Islam d'avoir sept sicles de retard pour ensuite dire que ces problmes ne concernent au final que "certains" musulmans. Je veux dire, soit le problme est avec certaines personnes, soit le problme est avec l'islam. C'est comme si je disais que l'Eglise est profondment raciste et sexiste mais que seuls certains catholiques le sont.

<TEXT> Je ne prsentais pas Arrow et Stiglitz comme des htrodoxes loin de l...Je montrais que ceux qui taient derrire l'ide du march pur et parfait sont aussi ceux qui crivent sur les "exceptions" du march.Le projet des noclassique est trs normatif "le march devrait tre comme a" et "voil les obstacles  sa perfection". Je suis pas clich en invoquant une malhonntet des noclassiques, loin de l.

Le truc qui m'agace c'est lorsqu'on parle de philosophie en conomie...

En conomie on parle conomie,  partir du moment o c'est de la philosophie spcialise en conomie, c'est un peu de l'conomie. Tu utilises juste ce terme pour dsigner l'conomie qui n'utilise pas que des maths. Mme Walras, l'conomiste qui a fond le mouvement noclassique et a mathematis l'conomie, exprimait sa vision du monde et des marchs au-del des mathmatiques. 

Les noclassiques sont conscients de la limite de leurs modles, mais force est de constater que ce sont les htrodoxes qui ont eu tendance  critiquer les hypothses des noclassiques et  construire une analyse moins simpliste que de celle des noclassique (faisant que les modles htrodoxes sont plus difficiles  formuler mathmatiquement, mais je t'en prie, lis le livre de Sbastien Charles "macroconome htrodoxe" si tu veux voir des maths compliques). Sans Keynes, les noclassiques auraient sans doute mis plus de temps  questionner leurs hypothses et  s'intresser aux dfaillances de march.

Tu revendiques une suprmatie des noclassiques parce qu'ils song matheux alors-mme que ce ne sont absolument pas les seuls  employer les maths ou la thorie des jeux. Personnellement, tout ce que j'ai fait dans mon premier commentaire c'est juste dire que la thorie noclassique part de l'hypothse de l'acteur rationnel comme l'conomie classique tendait  le considrer </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ils y a plein de bouquins trs compliqu qui traite le sujet... gnralement un diplme en maths ou en physique est requis pour comprendre les papiers srieux sur le sujet (jexagre  peine) Vraiment il faut arrter avec la culture conomique YouTube a fait peur lorsquon vous lit car cest presque de la dsinformation

Dit-il  un tudiant de master en conomie, en tout cas pour ma dfense Youtube ou sa culture conomique n'est pas ma source.

Il y a en effet une diffrence entre les no-classiques de l'quilibre gnral et les no-classiques/no-keynsiens qui s'intressent aux dfaillances de march dont l'asymtrie d'information. Mais trs peu de modles conomiques employs par les no-classiques (c'est gnralement tout ce qu'ils font dans leurs papiers) partent du principe qu'il existe des dfaillances de march, ils partent aussi du principe que les agents sont rationnels et ont des capacit cognitives totales ainsi qu'une information totale.

L'conomiste noclassique Arrow qui a mis fin  la poursuite de l'quilibre gnral des marchs est le mme qui s'intressa ensuite  l'quilibre partiel et  la thorie de la dfaillance des marchs comme stiglitz dont tu sors le terme d'asymtrie d'information. 

a peut arriver qu'un journaliste se trompe sur la philosophie conomique qu'applique les Etats-Unis ou l'Europe parce qu'aucun pays n'adopte entirement une seule philosophie conomique. Et clairement ma correction n'est pas de la dsinformation.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> a me fait un peu penser  la manire dont l'ifrap faisant l'argument que la suppression de l'isf tait bien parce que cet impt faisait fuir les capitaux.

[article ici](http://www.ifrap.org/budget-et-fiscalite/ce-que-lisf-fait-perdre-la-france)

Le problme c'est que donner un chiffre qui fait gros (143 Mds partis) sur une priode longue (presque 40 ans) sans contextualiser ce chiffre ( 1082 Mds d'IDE vers la France entre 1984 et 2017 par exemple, sans prendre en compte la rentabilit de ces investissements comme l'ifrap le fait pour son chiffre) sans non plus arriver  dmontrer que c'est  cause de l'ISF que cette fuite de capitaux a eu lieu fait qu'en face les arguments sont aussi extrmes et globalement assez malsain.

Mon argument ici, c'est que tu critiques le camp contre l'isf de la mme manire dont je critique le camp pour l'isf: il semble qu'il y ait de l'idologie des deux cts

Je dirais que gnralement le PIB est un assez mauvais indicateur pour ce genre de choses, regarder les emplois ou les investissements semblent tre une meilleure piste.

Je crois que l'ISF a une importance grossie des deux cts, mais le camp "il aurait fallu le garder" a plus de sens  mes yeux pour des raisons politiques. Dans tous les cas l'ISF tait un impt qui reprsente peu dans le budget de l'Etat et sa prsence comme son absence dans l'conomie est assez marginale. Parce que le ruissellement n'est pas une chose qui existe, la fin de l'ISF ne boostera pas vraiment l'conomie, et du fait du peu de nombres de personnes qui y taient imposes et du taux plutt raisonnable (je vais me faire des ennemis ici), le niveau de vie de ceux imposs n'a jamais t remis en cause par cet impt (sauf si ces personnes adorent se comparer aux riches trangers qui eux ne sont pas soumis  cet Etat communiste qu'est la France). Voil, "sans idologie" je dirais que l'ISF c'est marginal dans tous les cas.

Mais bon, les APL aussi c'est marginal dans le budget, et il me semble que la suppression des deux tait assez proche. D'un ct, il faut rduire la dette et donc les dpenses...mais pourquoi se priver d'une source de revenu aussi marginale soit-elle si partout l'on sait que la suppression d'un tel impt a peu d'intrt au niveau de l'activit? C'tait juste une assez mauvaise ide aprs la crise de s'ancrer dans une tendance de privilgier les mnages aiss alors mme que les contribuables ont d sauver les banques et voient aujourd'hui la ncessit de rduire les dpenses directement  cause de la crise conomique. La France est le premier pays depuis 2010  supprimer un tel impt et des pays trs performants comme la Norvge, la Suisse (ironiquement) et les pays-bas en ont un. </TEXT>

<TEXT> De plus, nous sommes rests  la dfinition du march de l'cole classique d'Adam Smith: un lieu o l'acheteur rencontre le vendeur, et o les deux possdent le mme niveau d'information. Or les Amricains,  partir de l'cole noclassique, conoivent le march comme un lieu o se rencontrent des gens qui n'ont pas le mme niveau d'information, un lieu de concurrence. Cela, nous Europens, nous ne l'avons toujours pas compris. On s'est content d'une analyse du march qui a trois sicles.

a c'est compltement faux d'un point de vue conomique, autant tu peux dfinir correctement l'conomie classique comme il le fait, autant l'cole no-classique ne conoit pas du tout le march comme un lieu o les agents n'ont pas la mme information. C'est une des principales critiques que les htrodoxes font aux no-classiques. On peut faire l'argument que l'conomie Amricaine est plus autrichienne que noclassique et que l'UE suit par contre  la lettre les principes no-classiques pour organiser son march.

Encore une fois Le figaro continue sa mauvaise habitude de faire une citation dans le titre sans en fait rien citer. Ali Ladi ne dit pas dans l'interview que la France et l'UE sont "compltement dsempars".

Aprs les annes 80, la recherche conomique mainstream s'est dsintresse du nationalisme conomique qui pourtant n'a jamais vraiment disparu depuis la seconde guerre mondiale, on peut citer les banana republics comme un exemple supplmentaire du nationalisme conomique amricain qui a toujours projet son pouvoir conomique par la politique.

Beaucoup de pays en dveloppement ont opt pour des stratgies de nationalisme conomique pour dvelopper leur pouvoir politique, l'Inde a pendant une priode grandement contrl l'acier et l'automobile sur son territoire, et aujourd'hui on a des multinationales indiennes qui permettent au pays de se projeter  l'tranger. Le Japon est un autre exemple o l'Etat joue le rle de stratge gnral pour l'ensemble de l'conomie, et n'a jamais hsit  s'insrer dans les dcisions des grosses entreprises parce qu'elle considrait que c'tait mieux pour elles, ne parlons mme pas de la Chine sur ce sujet.

Les Etats Europens sont perdus parce qu'ils ne pensaient pas faire la guerre conomique avec leur alli Amricain comme le dit trs bien l'article, mais ce n'est pas pour autant que l'UE et ses membres sont incapables de faire la guerre conomique. En fait on la fait, mais moins au sein de l'occident. La guerre Airbus-Boeing est extrmement politique et aussi une dfaite amricaine  l'OMC, de mme les viandes aux hormones font l'objet d'une interdiction en Europe mais elle avait t conteste par les Amricains et vice-versa pour les fromages.

Le nationalisme conomique n'est cependant pas forcment bnfique pour le consommateur, les entreprises amricaines dominent le cadre juridique l-bas et sont dans des situations de monopoles chez eux pour mieux vendre ailleurs au dtriment du consommateur amricain. Je suis personnellement satisfait que l'UE souhaite interdire la fusion Alstom-Siemens, le but de la fusion (soutenue par Bruno Le Maire, objectivement nul en conomie) est videmment de pouvoir mieux exporter son activit  l'tranger, pas d'amliorer la situation au sein de l'UE, mais l'UE devrait probablement se doter d'une protection de la concurrence qui empche plus les investisseurs tranger de la dtruire chez nous.

Tl;Pl : le titre veut nous accompagner vers l'ide que l'UE perd une guerre qui a l'air neuve mais qui a en fait toujours exist depuis la fin de la seconde guerre mondiale. L'interview se trompe sur les coles de penses en conomie mais  part a propose une bonne analyse. Je complte avec plus d'exemples pour dire que tout le monde fait "la guerre conomique"  sa manire </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have made a "study" on the place of female characters in the Super Smash Bros franchise. It illustrates how Smash changed with each title to include more and more choice for the players in terms of character's gender. It's a bit long, so you can skip to the more interesting graphics

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IEEoE_2Z393cnqgNovbEjTqKC-ETYrd-/view?usp=sharing

Before you read:

- English is not my natural language, I'm sorry if some sentences don't make sense or aren't clear

- This is not a perfect study, I wouldn't call myself an expert of Smash or all of the franchises represented

- This was made for fun

- While I believe the industry could be representing more female (and diverse) characters in general, I'm not trying to convince you of anything, nor that Smash is bad or sexist.

Enjoy :) </TEXT>

<TITLE> Looking for information about the carbon tax in Sweden </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-12-29 15:49:36 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello dear Swedish people

I'm a french student in economics and was looking to make a comparison between the french carbon tax and the Swedish one. What I was looking for is specifically how clear is it for most Swedish that this tax exists, how it works and how it is commonly accepted.

[I've read a bit on the matter (PDF)](http://www.un.org/esa/ffd/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/13STM_Article_CO2-tax_AkerfeldtHammar.pdf) but I wanted some feedback from actual people. I've got some questions for you but anything you know about it would contribute to improve my understanding of it.

- Who pays the carbon tax?
- Is it questionned in politics as not sufficient or too much?
- Could you give a simple description of the Swedish carbon tax?
- What do you think of it? (are you proud it exists? Do you think it serves its purpose, is its purpose clear in your opinion?)

As you can see, I'm really looking for general information about it, I'll take any technical knowledge you have on it but for now I'm really interested in how the carbon tax presents itself to the taxpayers. </TEXT>

<TITLE> CMV: Netflix's Deathnote was far from a bad death note movie </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-08-27 22:40:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> *This view contains spoilers for the Death Note serie*

I feel like part of the death note fan base is outraged at the recent movie. The movie keeps the concept and universe while adding its own ideas into the mix.

It is far from perfect, and I will address what I really dislike about the movie:

* Mia is a bad character, she is simply too mean and not realistic enough. At first I was pleasantly surprised to see a girl who can actually act contrary to Misa. I have nothing against Misa, it's just refreshing to see another personality. However, the relationship she has with Light was unrealistic, unsettling, maybe it was aimed to be like this but it came too fast. And Mia's only goal was to screw Light and be the bad guy of the story.

* The beginning of the movie seemed rushed, and sadly because it could have took time from the unecessary pursuit scene later on for the opening. Character development was needed and it feels like they rushed it to advance the plot. However, even if it was weird, I found it quite effective for setting the pieces for a newcomer to the serie, and soon enough this rumbly start was shadowed by the new different plot

* The last thing I dislike is how the film disobeys original death note rules, such as one cannot be told by the death note to kill or to write in the death note for the owner (which happens). This rule in particular is disobeyed for details which I find not relevant at all near the end of the film (firing L is useless and unrealistic at this point of the movie). Other rule violations are really not so important like only the owner can see Ryuk, and how Watari receives orders as he's possessed.

Then I see the light:

* L and light are different from the manga in a really fun and interesting way. Light is not as much as a psychopath he is in the manga, nor a mastermind which is realistic for his age. L is great, more sociable, more punchy than the original character, he's actually going outside but keeps his anonymity is a more realistic way than in the manga. Overall the characters are attaching even for the small time of the movie (except Mia). The way Light reacts to Ryuk was very funny and obviously the way anyone would've react to seing Ryuk, which helps to make him human and identifying to him.


* The death note rules have been simplified in a good way for the film, with the one exception cited earlier. The film isn't boring us with the rules, it presents them as they go. I think it is a good way to keep the audience surprised and not to bore them with too many explanations. Fans already know the rules, they don't need it, and it would have been too much material for one movie.

* The plot is good enough, a good introduction to the concept and doesn't spoils a lot from the manga, which I think is key here. You're left wanting more and wanting going back to the original serie. Not because the movie is bad but because it presents the most captivating of death note: the textbook, the concept of justice, and the impact on people living with such a power in our word.


To change my view, I guess I would need to be shown that the movie is detrimental to the serie: killing the key ideas, or being so badly played that it is really a bad movie even if it didn't have death note in its name.

I think there's a comparison that needs to be done between the live action - Japanese movie - and this one. The latter being better than the first because it didn't lived to do fan service, it showed the serie to the people who didn't know about it, making it different mostly in good ways. While the begining was rumbly, and some elements felt lazy, I had a good time watching this movie, and I don't think it should be hated by the fans like some of them do. It's different and that's good.

<TEXT> Reddit is mainly American and following this sub has been sort of difficult for a french like myself in all the content that has been shared but also redditor's flairs that completely lost me in the great diversity of existing style.

I'm a bit knowledgeable concerning Aikido's history and mainly its arrival in France which is full of political conflict between the Aikikai and former student of O' sensei and now some french Aikidokas.

So I'd need help to find out what style of Aikido I'm practicing, is there a sort of dictionnary about this? I'm also curious about how Aikido is organised in the US to see the difference with France.

To put it simply I'm in a dojo that thinks of itself as "traditional Aikido", the school is organised with the idea that the teacher has its students and dojo and nobody from a superior hierarchy (even the teacher's teacher) can say anything on how the dojo practices. In this greater school, dojos are independant association in which it isn't the logic of a club, it's obligatory non-profit and members can have access to any information he wants (on spendings and projects). But because my dojo calls itself "traditional Aikido" I fail to see and undesrstand how I'm positionned compared to other styles.

Thank you </TEXT>

<TITLE> CMV: I believe Rubber-tyred metros are more effective for a city than steel railed metros </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-19 16:56:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Rubber-tyred metros are symbolic of Paris and Montreal and I think they answer many of the challenges of growing cities and rising population densities, metros are one of the best mean of public transportation in my opinion and rubber-tyred metro is the best innovation since electric powered metros.

**Smoother rides**

These metros are said to be smoother for the passenger than steel wheels ones, and some argue that it is also more silent. This is a small argument but if comfort matters well you should choose rubber.

**Faster acceleration and higher speed, along with the ability to climb or descend steeper slopes**

This is the main reason to have rubber: faster acceleration is especially useful for metros as they have many stations and they need to get the best average speed for maximum efficiency. A metro must often start and break and sometimes they have long distances to make so higher speed + fast acceleration is an A for me.

And with that those metros have an easier time climbing so it's really useful for some cities with their own topography. Huge cities have a very messy number of lines and the ability to climb underground or to go deeper with ease can be useful to organize lines and stations.

Now those metros are generally heavier, they need more power to work and the tyres are more expensive and are also more fragile than steel wheels but on the other hand tyres don't wear rails as fast as steel wheels.

CMV!

<TITLE> CMV: Porn in general is bad quality </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-05-07 23:03:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was about to write a CMV about porn in general, but I prefer to start an idea at a time! Hope you like this debate

Let's put aside any moral consideration, exploitation of workers and greedy capitalism ideas for now and let's focus on the quality of pornography as a video genre, as art, as a cultural good.

The aim of pornography is to show sexual interactions, there's a lot of diversity about it; porn has known some huge mutation with internet and social networks, you can consume porn everywhere: on reddit, on tumblr, on 4chan and on every specialised website.

I consider the average porn as what you can find on r/nsfw and r/nsfw_gif, you can see that these subereddit have a significant number of subscribers.

Porn have terrible scenarios:

Because the industry want to show fantasm becoming true, the scenarios are terrible and doesn't follow any kind of logic. People fuck because of nothing, social interaction is totally unrealistic between characters; if you want to immerse the spectator, you need to be credible, and because they have no credibility, porn is a dumb "let's have a wank" type of film.

Porn as it stands today is vulgar, not erotic:

Because porn doesn't bring any interesting and worthwhile scenario, it gives out the sexual content very fast, too fast. This is where it's not at all representative or very exciting, there's no sexy. You wanted sex, you got it. Real life sex is exciting because it's not always expected, because there's intense and low tension moments. Porn is monotone, it starts the same way, ends the same way (with the traditional facial that gives me pity for the actress, but that's a question of taste), for short, Porn might be rich in the number of categories but poor in realisation.

Porn isn't representative of the reality... But it isn't artistic either

Artistic porn exist, realistic also (maybe). But for the majority of what I've seen, porn isn't beautiful to watch: Sex is beautiful (between consenting partners) , love is beautiful, Sex in movies is somewhat beautiful but porn industry just seems to give up one view of what sex is and doesn't care much about the rest. You can see it trhough how they categorise their products: movies use drama, action, romantic, thriller; porn use black, latino, asian, russian, rape, teen, amateur... What categorise porns are solely based on the actress: how she looks and what she does.

Porn could be better quality by being more diversified in truly different categories, educational porn would be a great improvement, adding more sexy and less vulgar, good scenarios or no scenarios. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You know what happens when you type a movie on Google, you get IMDB, maybe a paid streaming website, a free one, a YouTube video that says "download" on it. They're no clean, simple and legal way to buy and download movies , I don't want to use services like Amazon instant video, Google play or iTunes because it's still streaming even if there's an offline mode. 

Gog.com is a place for independent games and movies to grow, in my opinion it respects what movies and games are: cultural goods that are owned and not that I bought a right to watch. It also take in consideration exchange rate for currencies, it's a nice website that you can trust.
But GOG only have a handful of independent movies, and most of them are about games. 

I know this may seem to lead to easier piracy, but movie protection aren't currently protecting movies from piracy, there needs to be a legal challenger to piracy, the one that will satisfy the thirst of owning what you bought by downloading it, watching it with the software you want or even putting it on a dvd. 

I'm conscious that this kind of site would demand from any production corporation to change their mind on everything they thought about selling movies.  </TEXT>
