<TEXT> Sorry for grammar and spelling on phone
And I can't put shit into words for the life of me

I will get a pic of the bike when I get home

I ride my bikecyle to school every day I was 14 at the time on my shitty bike it only had one working break and I was riding to school one day and I have to pass a elementary school that had a place to pull in and drop off your kids and I was in the bike lane going at a good speed but not too fast for the school zone and this ep pulls out of the drop off area doing a u turn to go the other way (there's sign every where saying you can't do that) and she pulls out and STOPS I only had about 2 seconds to slow down then I slammed into the car at not fast pace i hit the handle bars with my gut then I flew back and hit the tip of seat with my back and then I fall over I get up because of adrenaline and just book it after the car and because start to drive so she pulls over this is how it goes

Me: WHAT THE FUCK WHY WOULD YOU STOP

EP: IT YOUR FAULT FOR NOT STOPPING

I don't remember much about it because it was about 1 year ago

My mom was dropping off my sister and my mom pulls up after seeing my bike on the ground and she go up to me

Mom: What  happend 

Me: she pulled out and stop blocking the bike lane and I crashed into her I did not have time to stop
(My mom is a bit of a dumb ass when I comes to this kindive stuff)

Mom: well it's your fault for not stopping

Me: TF SHE PULED OUT AND STOPED I ONLY HAD 2 SECOUNDS TO STOP 

Mom:  JUST GO TO SCHOOL I WILL DEAL WITH IT

Me: fine I will go 

I go to the school office told them what happend they call the nurse and gave me a ice pack then that when the pain hits it was not too painful then I was told to goto class right after getting a ice pack I went into class sit down I am visibly in a bit of pain with a ice pack and my teacher asked what happend I told her she sent me back to the office told me to call my mom and to go home so I do that a ride home on that even more broken bike

So I go home and theres my mom I ask her did she be the info so we can make a claim she said no because it was my "fault" ( mom just did not care about me being in the right)

So I beg her to take my to the ER to get my back checked out she gives in and we go and I was told I was fine no x-ray or anything went back home and just sat in bed all day and my mom would not let me claim the crash and now I have back problems

Tl:DR so thinks it my fault for her pulling out and doing a u turn causes me to crash my bike and causes my to have back problems. </TEXT>

Something like a 1050 or a 1080ti ik it's expensive but it will last you a a long time before you need to upgrade
