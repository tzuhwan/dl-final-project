<TEXT> I'm also 17. Also I am Dutch so I get what you mean by hausartz, the correct english name would be GP (general practitioner), PCP (primary care physician) or family doctor. I have found GP is more an UK term while GP is american. Family doctor seems to be in both. 

It is very possible the surgery will not work, I know just hypermobility in more than one shoulder disqualified me from having that same surgery, at least according to my orthopedic doctor (I tore my capsule and damaged my nerves one after the other).

For fitness, physio is excellent. EDS joints work different than normal joints though. A regular physical therapist gave me exercises that made my dislocations worse unfortunately. You need one who can work with you.

In terms of other sports, I do swimming. I love it and (depending on the stroke) it is very light on the joints. I also have POTS though so other sports are not really possible for me.

Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> We are just going to start at the first term, x^(5). If we want to divide this by x+8, we want to factor out x+8 from x^5. As you can see that is not possible, so we are going to do it a bit different. We want to write it in the form of a(x+8)-b, with b=8a. Can you see why we would want that?

B in this case will be something like cx^(4), which you can then add or subtract to the next term.

Dont forget that (a+b)/c is the same as a/c + b/c

To be totally clear from my side too (I feel like I didnt express this enough in my previous post, sorry for that), I totally agree with your perspective and I believe my dad his abuse contributed to me growing up faster, just more indirectly than in your case since the abuse was not focused to me. I was taking care of my mom on my own most days, with help from my grandparents when possible (they lived an hour away so they would only come when it was really bad). My dad just refused to do it (both taking care of my mom ans taking care of the house) and he just really resented her (and since this year me too) for being chronically ill and needing care. In his words: if you two would just be productive members of society, it would be different. You are at home anyways, why should I do anything? </TEXT>

I was always called the mature kid. I definitely had an Ndad, but he never abused me as bad when I was young, mostly my mom. I only got abused when I wasn't dependent on him anymore (around age 11).

My mom has a handicap, and I think that made me grow up fastest. She already had it before I was born. I knew from the start that life wasn't fair.

Please don't assume that every mature kid was abused. Although it might be true for a lot, it is not for all.

<TEXT> We can't exactly tell you that, just know that if this is the flu or a cold, it is normal for us to react more severe. If it is a cold or a flu, the hospital can't do anything. They're virusses, not bacteria.

I would go if it lasts for more than 10 days but I tend to be on the conservative side. Some hospitals have a non-emergency line, maybe ask them when you should come in. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Lunate subluxation, how to provide stability while writing. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2019-11-03 16:50:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So yesterday I stood up from a chair and felt (and heard) a loud knack in my wrist. Just feeling my wrist/hand, it was quite clear my lunate bone subluxed. I was able to get it back in place, and most of the tingling was gone very fast.

I've been resting it since then, and it has slipped out a few times since but not as bad as the first time. Usually I would rest a few more days, but I have a test tomorrow. That means writing (on paper) for 2 hours straight. Of course the injured wrist is my right, aka my dominant wrist. I can write a little with my left, but not nearly good enough to have it be readable after 2 hours of writing. 

It is too late to ask for accomodations, so that won't help. I can't reschedule the test either sadly. 

I am really scared it will slip out again during the test, and really want to prevent that. What would be the best course of action to stabilize it while still maintaining function in my hand? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Totally agree!

I want to add one thing that helped me a lot too: keep a routine. Do the same things every day. For example, my days are always structured like get up - take meds - rest - schoolwork (swimming on wensday) - rest - lunch - rest - activity (schoolwork on wensday) - rest - dinner - rest - activity - bed. Just keeping my days roughly the same really helps my body to calm down, since I always know what I will be going at a certain time </TEXT>

Fresh fruits are not a hit either, but he only gets one piece of fruit a day at the most (usually more like 2 or 3 a week) and theyre small, not bigger than a post stamp.

He is a real chewer by the way, won't the stuffing in the animal be dangerous for him? He has several chewing toys and they all break really fast. </TEXT>

Unfortunately we haven't found any veggies he likes, but my mom often feeds him some other snacks he likes (dried bananas and coconut, he is a picky eater) 

He is around 5 months now and we have been planning on getting him fixed too, guess we have to speed up that process a little. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> POTS is a syndrome in which the blood vessels of the legs do not constrict enough to counteract gravity when standing or sitting. This causes the blood to get stuck in the lower extremities, leaving less for the head and heart (and in some cases, other internal organs). All impacted organs get less oxygen, and they do not like that. This can cause all sorts of problems, which is why POTS is such a broad diagnosis.

Family can help by just being there for her. Make sure she has enough access to salt and water at all times. We have been led to believe salt is bad for us, and in general it is not the best. However for POTS patients it is key. 

Also help her find a good doctor. Not all doctors know about POTS, and some that do are still misinformed and say it is caused by anxiety/stress/depression. It is not (although it is sometimes comorbid) and treating it like a mental illness will not do this any good. It is incredibly frustrating to not be taken seriously. 

Also, SHE IS NOT TOO YOUNG TO HAVE IT! I have been told this by multiple doctors on multiple occasions. She is not too young for medications, or compression garments, or whatever. 

I would also recommend finding a physical therapist who can help her increase her exercise (cardio and leg muslces are often recommended)

Her future can look like a lot. First off, we do not know where on the spectrum your sister is. She could live a relatively normal life, she might even grow over it (doesnt happen a lot, but it does sometimes when it started during or right before puberty). On the other hand, she might also get worse and end up bed-bound. You can speculate, but you simply do not know.

They are making a lot of progress with medicine too, so maybe in the future there will be a cure. For now all they can do is attacking the symptoms. Often-used medications are beta-blockers like propanolol, vasoconstrictors like midodrine or other, non classified drugs such as mestinon or florinef. However first-line treatment is more salt, more water, more exercise and getting to know your boundaries.

Good luck to your family. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So this morning my mom went and fed our rabbit. I usually do this, but couldnt this morning. When she wanted to grab his bowl to put food in his bowl, he bit her. It left a little wound, no blood. My mom is now very afraid that it will happen again.

The rabbit is more drawn to me in general. He has not sat on my moms lap even once, while he uses me as his personal play castle. He growls towards my mom when she comes to talk to him, while he has never done that to me.

Could it be that the rabbit just doesnt like my mom? If so, how do we fix it? He was originally her birthday present so I feel really bad sometimes that he is almost my rabbit now, but i dont know how to change that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 15,0 grams contains 0,357 moles

Now you need the molar mass. The molar mass is calculated by mass in grams/amount of moles. 

Then you need the molar weight of C an H, 12,01 and 1,008 respectively.

You also know the ratio between C and H, for each molecule of C there are 2 molecules of H

You bascially need to solve 12,01x+2 * 1,008x=15/0,357. Solve for x

Final answer:

!x=3, your answer is C! </TEXT>

There was no blood taken during the test, so I am not sure what type I have. I have low BP though so i think its hypovolemic? But not entirely sure on that. I did get prescribed mestinon which I later read was is hyperadregenic POTS. </TEXT>

!*try finding 6(av+b) for the top. Leave the bottom as it is.!

!6(4v-2)=24v-12!

!you can now divide both the numerator and the denominator by 6!

!((6(4v-2))/6)/(6/6)!

!(a/a)=1, a*1=a!

!(4v-2)/1!

!(a/1)=a!

<TEXT> Yes he will, I agree with all of that too. I just believe that medicine isnt cut and dry and that stuff happens to people. My combination of complaints is not something you encounter a lot (diseases with a rarity of 0,3%, 2%, 0,4% and an unknown percentage) and fluid retention is a real thing in what I suffer from. If you dont want to believe that, that is fine. Like I said before, fluid retention on its own wont make you obese either. If you are already overweight it might just tip you over the obese line though. 

I have no idea what venmo is and I do not need money, I just want to show you that weight gain is not always as cut and dry as you make it seem. More factors come into play. Each factor on their own might not make you obese, but if you put a lot of those factors together it can.

I guess we will just have to agree to disagree. Adios, amigo. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know it from my own experience. One day I was 62kg, the next day I was 67kg. Then the next I was 64kg again. It fluctuates like crazy. 

5kg of water is 5L of water, which is totally not impossible. I drink that daily, more most of the days (on doctors orders, again I am hypotensive most likely due to hypovolemia. I need that water to somewhat function). I ate normally, and food has fluids in it too

If you dont want to believe me thats OK. I just wanted to say that there might be reasons someone is struggling with weight (which I am not, 62 and 67 are both very healthy weights for my height) that are beyond what you can see. I might be an execption to the rule, but I surely am not the other one </TEXT>

<TEXT> That is one way of factoring. In this problem, since the top and bottom both have -1+1 you dont need to factor that out. The first step you are doing is totally legal in the laws of math.

In this problem, you can factor out m out of m^(2)+m and m-m^(2), getting yourself m(m+1) and m(1-m) respectievely. Now you have a multiplication on top and on the bottom, giving you a legal reason to cross out m. </TEXT>

<TEXT> First off I am not looking for medical advice, just experiences. I have an appointment with my PT Monday so I will bring this up to her too and follow her advice. 

I heavily subluxed my shoulder this past tuesday, with heavy I mean it took some force to get it back. It didn't feel like a full dislocation though.

It felt like it was back in, so I didn't do anything about it (no RICE, which is what I usually do after a heavy sublux or a full dislocation, since it usually hurts and RICE relieves that a bit)

This evening I hugged my mom, and my shoulder made a loud clicking/popping noise. My hand feels very light and tingles a bit, my outer upper arm and shoulder are all swollen. This leads me to believe my shoulder has been out of place since Tuesday (from tuesday until the click it all felt the exact same).

The strange thing is, my mom (who is a nurse) checked my shoulder on Tuesday and it felt like it was in place. Appearantly it wasn't but it is still a strange thing. 

Has anyone else ever had this happen? </TEXT>

For now, just try to relax. It is all going to be fine. This is not the only doctor in the world. You just gotta find the right one. That does not mean you need to find a doctor that will give you an EDS diagnosis because you ask for it, that indicates a bad doctor to me. You have to find a doctor where you feel comfortable and who is willing to look beyond your current diagnosis and look further than the common options.

Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Im going to do it in hints, just click the next one if you are ready. Try to use as few hints as possible.

!The vertex form is f(x)=n(x-h)^(2)+k with the vertex at (h,k)!

!filling this in gives us f(x)=n(x-2)^(2)+5!

!Working it out gives nx^(2)-4xn+4n+5!

!Since we know that the term with the x is - 4x, we know - 4xn=-4x, thus making n=1!

!FINAL ANSWER IN NEXT HINT!

!Your formula is f(x)=x^(2)-4x+9. The value of a is 1 and the value of c is 9.! </TEXT>

<TEXT> First off, set all the rules doing with this problem in a row. (step 1)

set tan(x)tan(y) in terms of cos(x)cos(y) and sin(x)sin(y). You have a fraction. Set it equal to 2 (since we know tan(x)tan(y) =2. Now cross multiply. You have an expression with cosine and sine. (step 2)

Now expand cos (x-y) using the difference formula. Again, you have an expression with cosine and sine. (step 3)

Now you can start your substitution. Use what you found with the tangens to sub into the difference formula. This gets you the vaule of sin(x)sin(y) and the value of cos(x)cos(y). (step 4a and 4b)

Finally, use the sum formula to expand cos(x+y) and substitute in the values you found in step 4a and 4b (step 5). Now you have your answer.

Here is my answer if you want to check yourself: https://imgur.com/gallery/gcbYzTA

<TEXT> You know the vertex (30, -30). The vertex form is f(x)=n(x-h)^(2)+k where (h, k) is the vertex. This means that f(x)=n(x-30)^(2)-30. Working this out (since you need standard form) gives f(x) =nx^(2)-60nx+900n-30.

Now we get to our second point (60,0) filling this in for x and y, we get 0=n* 60^(2)-60n *60+900n-30. Solving for n gives us n=1/30.

Now in our worked out vertex form, you can see there is only one term with x^(2) so for this problem we can say n=a </TEXT>

Total revenue= selling price*quantity 

Total cost=fixed costs+variable costs

Marginal revenue is the derivative of the total revenue

Marginal cost is the derivative of the total cost

Break-even: total cost=total revenue

Maximum revenue: marginal revenue=0

Maximum profit: marginal revenue=marginal costs

<TITLE> Increased instability after ruptured capsula? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2019-10-22 19:47:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> EDIT: i use the term capsula but I just realized that's probably not the real English name (maybe it is, English is not my native language). The capsula refers to the thing around the joint that is filled with fluid to assist in moving

So my shoulders have been subluxing as long as I can remember. It never was really a problem, until this past December. I did gymnastics at the time and right as I went into an element, my shoulder subluxed and I put weight on the subluxed joint. Result: a ruptured capsula. You don't see anything anymore except 2 small scars with fluid, presumably where the rupture was. All pain is gone, swelling is down and mobility is back. 

Ever since, my shoulders have been a lot less stable though. I never really related those 2, but after nearly fully dislocating tonight it just came to me that that was the moment my shoulders got very unstable. 

Has anyone else experienced this? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sure. I will do problem number 3.

522 is what is remaining of your non-rotten, non-donated oranges. 

The first clue we have been given if we see the problem backwards is that remaining oranges minus those donated equals 522. In percentages, 100%-75%=522. This means that 522 is 25% of your oranges that were donated to charity. Your total donated to charity was 522*(100/25)=2088.

Now we know that 13% of all oranges were rotten. Those that were not rotten, account for the 2088. Applying the same logic as in our previous step, we can say that 2088 equates to 87%. We now know the total number of oranges in the beginning is 2088*(100/87)=2400

Is this clear? </TEXT>

For number 3. 75% of non rotten goes to charity, how many were non-rotten in total then? How many was the actual total?

For number 4. First find how much money she had for clothing and the remain, then try to find the actual total.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am revising for an exam and I cannot wrap my head around the following problem. Also I am dutch, so I wrote it out

**For a certain buisness, the following is given:**

**Price=110**

**Total variable cost=10q**

**Total constant cost=1000**

**The capacity equals a quantity of 100. If this buisness wants maximum profit, which of the following is true?**

**A. Cost price of 10, revenue of 11.000 and profit of 10.000**

**B. Cost price of 20, revenue of 11.000 and profit of 9.000**

**C. Cost price of 20, revenue of 10.000 and profit of 10.000**

**D. Cost price of 20, revenue of 11.000 and profit of 10.000**

We were taught that for maximum profit, you should set the derivative of total cost and the derivative of total revenue as the same, but it doesn't work with this problem. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am going to explain 8 for now, try and figure out the rest on your own first.

From the top description, you can see DG=DE and GH=EF.

Since they are similar triangles, the ratios are the same. We can now say that DE/DG=EF/GH

These values are all known. You can fill them in. (91/52)=((2x-1)/(x+3))

You can solve this with cross multiplication. 91(x+3)=52(2x-1). This means that 104x-52=91x+273. Simplifying gives 13x=325 so x=25.

Try if you can solve the rest. I am going to bed soon so I am going to give the answers below so you can check yourself. If you don't get a question, I will respond in the morning.

9. !x=12!

10. !x=15!

<TEXT> The trick with these questions is to always look what info you can easily gather from all the info that is given. Try writing down all the info you can think of. If you still don't figure it out, use these hints. 

!D is the midpoint of CE, so CD=DE=3!

!BE=BC+CD+DE!

!that means 13=BC+3+3, so BC=7!

!AC=AB+BC!

!that means 18=AB+7, so AB=11!

If you are still struggling after these hints, reply so we can work it out further </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh thats a little misunderstanding. I am starting with 20 mg a day (10 in the morning, 10 in the evening) for 2 weeks, them in week 3 upping to 30mg, week 4 40mg, week 5 50 mg, week 6 60mg and if it is necessary we should continue that way. This is to minimize side effects. I have an appointment to discuss progress after week 3 though, so until that time (and I know how long it works) I will stick with 2 times a day. 

I really hope it works, but I know that if it does not that there is more for me to try. Still very nervous though! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lets say our equation is f(x)=square root ((5x+5)/(4x+8)). 

A square root cannot be negative, so (5x+5)/(4x+8) should be greater than 0. That means that either 5x+50 and 4x+80 or 5x+50 and 4x+80 (since negatives cancel each other out). This gives x-1 and x-2 or x-1 and x-2. Since -2 is smaller than -1, your solutions are [negative infinty, -2] and [-1, infinity]

You also cannot divide by 0, so 4x+8/=0. This means that 4x/=-8 and x/=-2. You can see that -2 is still in our solution set, so we need to use different brackets to indicate that. The bracket you use when something is not in the set is , but larger (so the opening is as big as that of a regular bracket). For simplicity, I used a )

Final solution: Df=[-infinty,-2) and [-1, infinty]

EDIT: i am stupid. You are working with a cubic root, so your root can be negative. Just work with the 'no dividing by 0' part of this explanation </TEXT>

She did 50 puzzles total, so E+H=50

She got 1950 points, so 30E+60H=1950

Now you have a system of equations. Solve for H to get your answer

!equation 1:E=50-H. Substitute into equation 2 to get 30(50-H)+60H=1950. Working away the parentheses gives 1500-30H+60H=1950. This gives 1500+30H=1950 so 30H=450. Divide both sides by 30 to get H=15! </TEXT>

<TEXT> For your square root problem, I agree with the previous commenter.

To get all confusion out of the way, I will use p for your first problem instead of k. They have 2 different values, so it is easier to use 2 different variables.

First you foil

2x^(2)-5x-52=2x^(2)+8x-px-4p

Then you get all equal terms together, you simplify

Px+4p=13x+52

Factor out p

P(x+4)=13x+52

Now, factor out (x+4) out of your right side

P(x+4)=13(x+4)

Divide both sides by (x+4)

P=13 </TEXT>

<TEXT> Totally true, dr. Visser as well. I knew it was normal, just not how much was normal. I did not faint, but then I got the mild version (first to 20 degrees for 10 minutes then to 70 degrees for 10 minutes) because I am only 16.

I still have the follow up appointment on phone this coming wednesday, we just recieved the letter he sent to the GP and it said this. I will ask on the phone if the reduced sitting and standing he recommended is actually necessary, my PT already advised against it.

Did he give you the advice to have short periods of standing/sitting with longer recovery periods of laying?

Also, do you speak dutch? If so, maybe we could just talk in dutch (I am fine with English too but for the medical terms dutch might be easier) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I do that sometimes too.

Literal translation (I am dutch, so the rapport was in dutch) of part of the rapport says a tilt to 20 degrees gave significant symptoms and an important decrease in cerebral bloodflow (-30%). With the tilt-through to 70 degrees symptoms increased. Since it was a relatively good day for the patient there was no syncope. Like even the doctor was suprised I did not faint.

His advice was laying down a lot with only limited time spent sitting and standing, thus I thought the numbers might be concerning high. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was 1 year old, my cat had to get neutured so we brought him to the vet. Being the little kid that I was, I obviously had to go with my mom to the vet. I asked my mom where the cat was going. My mom had no idea how to explain to a 1 year old what neuturing is, so she told me he was going to cat school.

I proceeded to have a long conversation with my cat about how he had to be a nice cat to the teacher and the other cats. My mom heard me have this conversation.

A few months ago my other cat had to go to the vet to get an abcess removed (I am almost 17 now). I walked in, and I realized that this was the room that I once called 'cat school'. 

Cat school was the vet office. My mom confirmed that she indeed told me that cat number one went to 'school' but he went to get neutured.

<TEXT> I wish. I am not in an English speaking country, homeschooling is illegal here. My options are to finish regular high school with accomodations or to drop out (my plan is to go to college after high school, which can be done through online schooling if I need it, so dropping out is not an option) 

My high school is super accomodating though. I have unlimited absences, emailing adresses of all teachers (and a phone number for 2 of them) and I get to spread out 12th grade over 2 years (I will take a year longer to graduate but I skipped a grade in elementary school, so it all balances out). Testing is in the morning (least brain fog) in a room where I am alone and can do what I want (sit, walk, lay down). No complaints about school at all.

Thank you for thinking with me though! Again, I wish it was a possibility but it is not. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We just got the results back from my tilt table test. During the test, they used an echo machine to measure cerebral bloodflow. I had a reduction of 30% at a 20 degree angle and 37% at 70 degrees.

This seems like, well, a lot of reduction. Is this actually a lot of reduction or is this in line with what other POTS patients have? Is it dangerous?

I will talk to my doctor on Wednesday and ask the same questions (we just got back the letter they also sent to the GP), but I really do not want to wait so I hope yall can help me ease the mind a little </TEXT>

<TEXT> My dad is the narcissistic asshole in the family who denies I am as sick as I am. It is one of the reasons my mom is divorcing him (he always was somewhat emotionally abusive, but since I got sick it took a turn for the worst).

She is such a great mom which is why I hate to see her like this, she has so much struggles on her own too. 

I do have a psychologist who says I deal with it very appropriately, my mom is going to ask for a referral to a therapist or someone else who can help her this week.

I think I am going to write her a letter telling her how amazing she is. That way every time she gets herself for it, she has something to go back to.

My dad doesn't actually believe I am sick, plus my parents are going through a nasty divorce right now ( my dad basically refuses to speak to my mom and vice versa).

I am sorry it had so much impact on you. I never saw it in the light of 'its OK I am suffering' but you are right, that is basically what is happening.

We are not in an English speaking country so we need a referral to a therapist, I did convince my mom to go ask for one at our GP and she will do that this week (she is also going through divorce and was emotionally abused by my dad for years, so this is not the only reason for her to seek therapy.

My mother her maternal grandmother did exhibit MS and hEDS signs already according to my mom and grandmom (like being unable to feel a cup when she picked it up for the MS and being very flexible for hEDS), so it seems those 2 just run in the family (they both skipped my grandmom, and I luckily do not have MS yet to our knowledge, my last MRI was clean.

She has also called herself a bad mom for it (the hEDS comes from her side of the family, and she has MS so most days are a struggle for both if us).

I do not resent her at all, I just did not quite win the genetic lottery. Thats OK, it happens. I can live with this, even if going to school is nearly impossible (I am 16). I will get there some day.

<TEXT> Your derivative seems good.

(edit to add this part, I didn't read the question right) The tangent can be found with y=ax+b. Filling in x=-3 in y gives you the point of tangent and the y and x value in the formula. Filling in x=-3 into the derivative will give you a. 

The line crosses the x-axis when y=0. This gives point A

The line crosses the y-axis when x=0. This gives point B.

Now you know the base and height of the triangle OAB, you can use S=(1/2)* b * h

If you still can't figure it out, send me another message and we will figure it out </TEXT>

For this time, I am going to be calling the 2 slopes a and b (just so it's easier to write) 

A*b=-1

B=(-1)/a

Since A=-(1/2),we get

B=(-1)/(-(1/2))=-1*-2=2

Checking back, 2*(-(1/2)) is indeed - 1. In you calculation, you said that a number divided by itself is the number, while it is actually 1. If one of the numbers is negative, it will therefor be - 1 </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you for the suggestion! My shoulder doesn't seem to be too swollen, but maybe that's just because I've seen it in worse shape (ruptured my capsula about 6 months ago, and it was huge) 

The naproxen I was on was for severe period pains and I don't have any left (and I would need to get them prescribed again which I doubt my doctor is willing to do. I added an edit to my original post to clear up any confusedness) </TEXT>

<TEXT> He doesn't believe that reactions to the over the counter stuff can be so severe. He did prescribe the naproxen for my periods but well, those need a prescription and I won't get any because I haven't tried paracetamol yet (since I get bad side effects).

Just kind of hoped there would be some miracle, over the counter pain med out there. Guess too bad for me </TEXT>

<TEXT> X+2y=16 

2y=-x+16

Y=-(1/2)x+8

For perpendicular lines you get a1*a2=-1. 

A1=-(1/2)

-(1/2)*a2=-1

A2=2

There is only one answer with a slope of 2, that is the 3rd answer

I am curious how you got your answer though? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay, I am not a native English speaker and I clearly didn't get my point across, I am sorry for that.

What I am trying to say that if modern medicine has no more solutions or only has very invasively solutions, alternative medicine may as well be explored if this is not at the cost of the patient and with adequate monitoring.

There is certainly a place for alternative medicine, just not as an actual alternative.

I have a chronic illness and so does my mom (both autoimmune) and I know that alternative medicine has helped us both when regular medicine had no more solutions for us. Whether it was placebo or not, it probably was. But it helped
The patient felt better and (in my moms case) the blood values stabilized.

We did not replace modern medicine with alternatives (we would both be in a wheelchair by now if we did), but if it is in the benefit of a patient, does it really matter?

Also worth noting I am not in the US so homeopathy (and certain other alternative medicines) are free here. No waste of funds. </TEXT>

I was myself. I use small towels and make some water+soap in the sink. Then I dip the small towels in the sink and wash myself really good. After I have done a body part, I use 1 bigger towel to dry off myself.

It takes way longer than showering but because it causes so much less pain, it is less exhausting to me </TEXT>

<TEXT> Luckily fall for me, but this is what I did in the summer:

Some foods and scents make me more nauseated than others, I stay far away from all else (and yes, that means dinner is either home made pizza, pasta or bread with meat). 

Keep up on my salt and water intake. 

Keep up on my sleep. 

I use domperidone. Doesn't take away all nausea but certainly helps to take away a large amount of it.

I also used a cool pack in my neck after eating, I would get huge sweat attacks which I started using it for but it helped with the nausea.

Laying down after eating and keeping my feet elevated while eating.

Eating 6 to 8 smaller portions instead of 3 big ones.

Theres probably more but that is all I can think of for now. </TEXT>

See if you can watch some German series with English subtitles for now. If you are a bit more familiar, start watching the news in German (no subtitles). That will get you quite some way in listening.

Maybe find a fun German blog you can read too.

<TEXT> So I got the POTS diagnosis with a poor mans tilt table test (78 to 131). My diagnosing doctor will not treat me though, so I am going to a POTS specialist in 3 weeks and I am super nervous. I know I will get an actual tilt table test there, and I hate not knowing what to expect.

What are some must-knows about a tilt table test? </TEXT>

The volume was 0,31L = 310 cm^(3). 

The mass is 6,46 kg-5,625kg=0,835kg= 835 g

Density is calculated as mass/volume, which is 835g/310 cm^(3) which is approximately 2,694 g/cm^(3)

<TEXT> As far as I know (as my PCP told me. I was not diagnosed at that time, I just had low blood pressure) salt raises blood pressure. If your blood pressure is normal, extra salt can get you high blood pressure which can in turn be bad for your heart. Eating extra salt is OK as long as your blood pressure is normal.

I do not know how salt and POTS relate, just salt and blood pressure </TEXT>

The one person that does not get it is my dad. He thinks I am making it worse than it is, that it is all in my head and that my pshycholist can fix it (I am seeing a psychologist to learn how to deal with it). 

The rest of my family is very supportive though, at least those that know. The ones that don't would probably suggest yoga (that is what they did with my mom, who has MS). 

That being said, I have stabilized quite a lot since started exercising. I only go swimming once a week, but for me it is the difference between not attending school at all to attending 2 or 3 classes per week (still modified sitting arrangements etc, but I am there at least) 

I also lost 30 pounds because of POTS. Now that I am on domperidone I can eat more, but I have to eat all day just to keep the weight on. Like my physical therapist said it, you are constantly running a marathon with your heart fluctuating so much. I am still in the healthy weight though luckily (5'8 and 130 pounds) </TEXT>

She has a pill organizer. Every day has a seperate little box, and each box has 4 compartments. She uses them morning, noon, dinner, night since that are the 4 moments she takes her pills. Then the little day boxes stack up so you only have 1 little box out each day. 

She refills her boxes on either Sunday evening or Monday morning (depending on how she feels). Occasionally my dad and/or I do it for her. 

I think she got hers through the pharmacy, might be worth inquiring about. Otherwise maybe Amazon or something similar. A pill organizer and a set time to fill them might help you though! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, that sounds much better! Just make sure you also have variation in what veggies you eat. Maybe have some snack veggies or fruits (some fruits contain more sugar than others) in between meals. This helps keep your blood sugar steady and therefore you have less appetite for unhealthy snacks. 

The only thing I see missing is fish. It is not necessary, but fish is a good addition for healthy fats (I think 2 times per week is recommended? Might differ from country to country too). Gives you a little variation. Could eat it for lunch or dinner. 

Also maybe some different nuts than peanuts? Again, variation is key for both nutrition and for actually enjoying what you eat (which is obviously very important) 

From your original post I thought you had nuts and only green veggies 3 meals a day, with some meat or an egg a few times a week. That, of course, would not have been healthy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am in 12th grade, I got sick midway through 11th grade.

Today was actually my first day (well I went one 45 minute period, but you gotta start somewhere) back to school since last March (when I got sick). The plan is to go 1 period on Thursday and 2 periods on Tuesday. 

Now that I have the equivalent of a 504 plan, going to school is a lot easier. I am allowed to eat and drink during class, have my feet up on another chair, I have a place where I can lay down if all goes really wrong (and I am allowed to go there without asking the teacher) and my teachers know the situation and they are aware in how to handle. I am also exempt from PE. 

I am also splitting 12th grade. It will take me a year longer to graduate, but only having half the coursework is really good for me (especially since I am diagnosed but untreated, although that will hopefully change in October).

It is very frustrating for sure and I did lose aquintances over it (those people you sit next to in class but never meet up with), I totally get it.

Do you have any accommodations in place already? If not, look into it. They are required to accommodate you. </TEXT>

My grandfather almost died in a hospital (twice), seeing him on a breathing tube was really hard for me. However when my mom, dad or grandmother were in the hospital after all that happened (all 3 at different times, for unrelated issues), they nver forced me to go. Like it should be.

Your situation sounds even tougher, and you are not the adult in this situation. That said, maybe it is good to talk about this with another adult. Maybe a teacher at school that you trust, or your grandmother?

<TEXT> He is outdoors in the summer and indoor in the winter (a bit controversial, I know. If we see Ramses does not tolerate going out next summer indoor he will come inside full time. My mom is slightly allergic though, so it is not what we prefer.)

This cage is mostly meant for outside. Inside we can barricade the doors etc so he cannot escape and he can just roam the living room (as long as we keep cat out); outside we have had to take out some parts of the fence because our cat cannot jump over the fence anymore (getting old, so he will just fall off sometimes). Our previous rabbit just roamed through the backyard too (because the fence was intact at the time), so this is all a bit new to us. 

We have hard (60 by 60 cm, so large) tiles in the backyard, we also have a cover (forgot the English name but it is fully bunny proof) in the bottom of the current cage. This outside part is also meant as a way for his nails to get smaller in a fairly natural way (as suggested by the vet)

<TITLE> How to DIY build-out cage? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2019-09-06 13:22:30 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So we have a Netherland dwarf. He is now totally used to his cage and loves walking his leash. Because he loves the outsides so much, we want to make a buildout of his cage, [something like this](https://imgur.com/gallery/NnKHdAe). That way he can run around even more than he already does (he loves running around then chilling on your lap afterwards)!

We currently have [this cage](https://imgur.com/gallery/XBfcf8n) and we would like to build it to connect to the bottom door so he can come out easily.

We also have a cat so something that would be covered on top would be preferred (cat seems scared of the rabbit for now, but you never know what fear does). Also it would be best if it would be removable so we can easily get him out of his cage if he needs to come out. All tips would be appreciated though!

Anyone who has ever made such a project? Any dos/ donts? </TEXT>

<TEXT> The area under the graph gives us (m/s) *s=m, so that gives us distance. With a negative velocity, it will travel backwards (you will get a negative area) so for f you will use normal values. In g, the negative state does not matter, so you will add all absolute values together.

Try dividing the graph into triangles and rectangles, that way you can find the area.

Does that makes it clear? </TEXT>

<DATE> 2019-09-05 18:17:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So my resting HR has been high all day (around 80 when it usually is 60 to 65).

Right after dinner (well I had 1 sandwich, but still) I went to lay down. I got very bad palpitations. My fitbit said my HR was 49 (and my own pulse taking was not that far off, about 2 beats every 3 seconds). Shortly after, I fainted while laying down. It was only for a few seconds luckily.

This is the first time I have fainted from a low HR (I fainted once before while playing just dance before I was diagnosed). The internet says to go to the ER after fainting when you had palpitations before fainting or fainted while laying down (amongst others), but I do not want to waste their time. I am pretty sure they would not know what POTS is, and I am unsure if this is POTS either.

I am just lost and so unsure what to do. I am 16, my parents told me we could go to the ER if I felt that was the right thing but I just have no idea if it is the right thing at the moment </TEXT>

<TEXT> Unsure what you are doing.

A derivative is the change on a small part of the graph, often called delta x and given by h. 

If you need limit notation, use the limit as h approaches 0 of (f(x+h) - f(x)) / h

For x, that would be (limit as h approaches 0) ((x+h) - x) /h

That would be 0

There is a way without the limit, but you will encounter that one soon enough. 

Can you figure out the rest from there? </TEXT>

As far as I know, an ECG will be clear in POTS patients. Remember POTS is not a heart condition, it is neurological (although since the results of this neurological syndrome lie in blood vessels cariologists can be of a lot of help).

Edit: those 2 things that are incompetent are both valves in the heart between the upper and lower chambers (if you hadnt used google already to figure that out) </TEXT>

<TEXT> It might look that way, but it is not. 

Lets take equation (a+b)(c+d)

FOIL would give us ac+ad+bc+bd

Factorization would give us a(c+d)+b(c+d), which also leads to ac+ad+bc+bd

Facorization might not be easiest now, but once you get to equations in the form of (q+r+s)(f+g+h), foiling is no longer possible. Just be aware the option exists </TEXT>

<TEXT> (X+3)^2 is the same as (x+3)*(x+3), not the same as x+3*x*3.

For (x+3)*(x+3), you can use foil (first, outer, inner, last) or you can use factorization (x*(x+3)+3*(x+3))

Does that answer your question? </TEXT>

<TEXT> 3x-2x=-2, not positive 2

You are right for the first part. However with the variable, you forget to treat it like a normal number. Let me work out the last part. 

2x=3x-2

2x-3x=3x-3x-2

-x=-2

X=2 </TEXT>

<TEXT> The rules say you should always give your answer as x= or y= (or whatever other variable), not -x=. Your answer does not have to be positive though, as long as your x is.

6-4=3x-2x gives 2=x

2x-3x=4-6 gives -x=-2 gives x=2.

Now lets take a new equation, 3(2x+2)=5x+4

So 6x+6=5x+4 gives 6x-5x=4-6 gives x=-2. This is a correct sum, yet your answer is negative. Your x however is positive (since it says x= and not -x=)

It does not matter what sides you do what or what you subtract or add. It just depends on your personal preference </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly it doesn't matter on which side it is, but usually the x-terms are on the left side.

6-4= 3x-2x is the same as 3x-2x=6-4.

Same if you would switch how you do it.

2x-3x=4-6 is the same as 3x-2x=6-4 (as in, it will give you the same result). If you multiply both sides of the first equation by - 1, you get your answer.

You can play with numbers, as long as you make the same operation of both sides of the equal sign </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am going into 12th grade and got sick midway through 11th. I am not US, and repeating a grade is not uncommon here. I needed to do all tests last year well to not repeat.

I made summaries (or got some of the internet, or did practice exams) when I was not brainfogged. Then I recorded me speaking the summary (or practice exercise). Then once brain fog set in, I would just listen to the summary. Sure it might not have been most effective, but it sure did help.

For recalling, that was a bit harder. Mostly doing the tests in the mornings (when I had the least amount of brain fog) in a private room with the lights off, unlimited water during the test and feet elevated. I don't know what the options for you are.

Good luck, never stop chasing your dreams! </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I am from the northern part of the Netherlands. Frisian is a language we speak over here. I was raised primarily dutch, but I do know frisian. In this one instance, I thought this frisian word was Dutch and it ended up with a laugh.

So me and 2 of my exclusively Dutch friends were at an amusement park (in the town where my friends lived) a few summers ago. There were a lot of stinging bugs around. A stinging bug is called a 'neefje' in frisian. A 'neefje' is a nephew in Dutch. 

So one of those little bastards stung me. I told my friends a 'neefje' stung me and they started laughing. I had no idea why, in my head I had said a very normal sentence.

Yeah, 'neefje' doesn't seem to be the Dutch word for a stinging bug. In fact, there is no word for a stinging bug in Dutch (aside from the literal translation of stinging bug)

My friends still use the word from time to time, guess frisian is quite an handy language! </TEXT>

 It's a kind I seem to be allergic to too (very huge, very hard, egg like stings that make the skin burst open and will be swollen for a week or 2. I have been meaning to go to a doctor with it, but I haven't gotten to that yet), so I was kind of freaking out. Still alive without any shortness of breath though, so all good already.

For the first one, your solutions are right but you wrote it down wrong. However you factored out 2x. That will make your 18 become a 9 (18/2=9). On a test, a simple mistake like that makes you lose points, be aware.

Edit: you are also missing x=0 as a solution in this first one.

The second one is completely correct.

For the third one, I will work it out. Just click one first and use it as a hint though.

!x^3 -3x^2 +2x=0!

!x(x^2 -3x+2x)=0!

!x=0 or x^2 -3x+2x=0!

<TEXT> I have very frequent subluxating shoulders too. I wear a sling with me at all times. When the pain gets bad or it is really unstable, I put it on. I have it set in such a height that when my shoulder relaxes, it is still high thus can't slip out (my shoulder subluxes straight down basically. Might not work if you sublux another way).

After a full dislocation, a sling 24/7 for 7 days works to keep it stable for a bit.

Edit: not to discourage you, but I did physical therapy (not sure if it is the same as physiotherapy) after my first full luxation last year, and it made my shoulder super unstable. According to my physical therapist, that is normal in some cases. My exercises did not strengthen my muscles (they were already strong), they just worn them out </TEXT>

To be honest I do not think he eats much more than what you suggested, although I never really measured it. I usually give a little less than half a handfull in the mornings and just enough to keep it at that level at night.

I will start the simple veggies though! Are there places where you can buy these (other than the supermarket)? We do not eat most of us ourselves so it would be a waste to throw out the excess after the rabbit eats from it </TEXT>

He does like dried banana and coconut, but those contain a lot of sugar (and potassium for the banana) so we do not want to give that more than twice a week.

He eats hay and feed (those brown little sticks), but internet recommends 100g of veggies a day.

What are some other veggies we can try and is it bad if he does not get his veggies? </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was in 6th grade, we went to cut down small trees with saws. We were supposed to do it in couples. However my couple decided they would rather work alone than work with me, so I was stuck without gloves. All went well, until I went to hang up the saw (something we were supposed to do without gloves) and I cut my hand.

I then got yelled on for getting hurt because I should have been wearing gloves (although we only got 1 pair per partner and my partner took them, and they had no more. When I did nothing, I got yelled at too)

Since then, I have refused to cut down any trees ever </TEXT>

<TEXT> First off, this is all from my own experience.

I know this is not what you want to hear, but time is all that helps. 

I grew up with a chronically ill parent (my mom has MS). It took me until age 9 or 10 to accept that I was not going to be the one who could cure MS, that I could not help my mom. Once I realized that, I cried for days straight. I still worry about her and I do have a different relationship to my mom than I see other kids have relationships with their mothers (I am usually her primary caregiver and I worry about her a lot). I am fine with that, my mom feels like she ruined my childhood (not true obviously)

But they are gonna be OK. For them, being ill all your life is just not something they can grasp yet. It will get better. 

I would encourage you to let them in on the process. Let them go to doctors appointments with you (once they are old enough). When they are a bit older, encourage them to find other kids with moms who have POTS. Encourage them to find information on your own, and make it clear that you are always there for them to talk about it. I know my school always had us do presentations, and my presentation about MS made everything just so much clearer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am 16, my next appointment is in october, but it is with a new doctor. 

I do not like taking my dad to doctors appointments however. He is a typical helicopter parent and last time I took him (last year, so I was 15), I did not actually talk until the doctor told him to shut up. I like doing my own story, I think it helps the doctor understand it and it helps with him trying to see my level, so they do not talk to me like I am a child (i have quite a lot of medical knowledge).

Maybe it is best to take him sometime, but that will take a bit unfortunately. I could ask my mom but I do not want to cause a fight between them </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay, lets go back to that first equation I gave you earlier

Sin(a)= cos((pi/2)-a)

Now lets take our previous knowledge about complimentary angles

A+b=pi/2 means that a=(pi/2)-b

Lets substitute it all into the question

So for sin (a)= cos (b) that means 

cos ((pi/2)-(pi/2)-b) =cos (b)

Cos (-b)= cos (b)

We know cos (-a)= cos (a), so then cos (b) must equal cos (b)

Making it true.

Is that clearer? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sin(a)= cos((pi/2)-a)

So for sin (a) to equal cos (a), cos ((pi/2)-a) should equal cos (a). This leads to (pi/2)-a=a+2kpi or (pi/2)-a=2pi-a +2kpi. That second one has the -a=-a cancel out, so we are going forward with the first one.

(Pi/2)-a=a +2kpi

(Pi/2)-2kpi=2a

A=((pi/2)-2kpi)/2

Work that out and you get your solution </TEXT>

<TEXT> Very true. However anatomy in ancient humans is barely comparable to us, so it would be a hard comparison. For example, our length has increased a lot recently because the back has straightened out.

I do think that in the early days there was more of a 'suck it up' culture; I do not think that people who had it back in the days would complain about it. Of course pain remedy was basically nonexistent either. It would not suprise me if early EDS sufferers would be the biggest alcoholics of all.

Of course that is all pure speculation </TEXT>

<TEXT> Me neither, grade 11 biology is the furthest my formal education goes. 

Of course chances are small but mutations still happen. Maybe the more rare types do have 1 ancestor, but for hEDS and the other common types yes, you can be the first in your family to get the mutation.

Things like downs syndrome work the same way. It can be heridatory, but it does not have to be. It could very well be just a 'mistake' in the DNA of a person </TEXT>

<TITLE> Grown in toenails? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2019-08-21 20:11:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I hope this is not seen as medical advice. It is honestly just life advice, but people in r/advice probably do not have problems with this (maybe you all do not either, but asking never hurt anyone).

Also, HSD/ hEDS here. 

Are grown in toenails a part of all of this? I have had this problem since I was a baby. It just seems like my nails cannot grow long, just wide. 2 or 3 days after cutting my nails they are growing in again. By cutting them then I can kind of keep it under control, but not always (if they grow faster than usual)

Once they are fully grown in and I cut them out (like my PCP told me to do. If I do not do it, the pain is absolutely terrible) my nail will probably either partially fall off (staying attatched to the other grown in side. Just the top cm or 2 fall off) or it will rupture to the side, which makes the entire nail unstable too. Usually happens on my big toe, but sometimes the smaller ones as well.

I tried everything. Letting them grow, cutting daily, cutting round, cutting square, cutting very short, keeping quite a bit of white visible, cutting with a nailcutter, a nail scissor, a normal scissor and it just keeps on happening. I do not know how to fix this anymore </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's great! As my PCP explained it (in kid terms, I am 16 but they often act like we are small kids still, it's Ok) that our body uses so much energy because the heartrate is so high, that anything extra is too much for all systems to handle so they start to 'crash'. When a normal body has to twice as hard, ours have to work maybe 6 or 8 times as hard just to keep everything going. 

Makes sense to me now, but I would never have thought of that on my own. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was diagnosed with a poor man TTT (lay 10 minutes, stand 10 minutes). If you can diagnose that way everything is good. However some patients already have coping mechanisms, like standing with tightening leg muscles (or so I have been told)

My doctor was like that as well. Physical therapy should fix it, according to them. They got very angry and dismissive as soon as we asked at other treatment, like eating more salt and drinking more water. They would only prescribe anti depressants because obviously I have anxiety as well (/s). My PCP has told me he does not believe that at all, and neither do I.

Good luck in your appointment in a few months! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I went to my PCP. He referred me. Referral was denied, so he diagnosed me with on the hypermobility spectrum (bascially the same as hEDS but without the need of a specialist, as he explained it to me) right then and there. A PCP is exactly trained for these kind of things. Explain why you think you have it, then hear him/her out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh okay. My english is not the best, and it did mention something about higher rates of depression. Not that the entire study is about that, but part of it was.

There are multiple studies out there that show depression amongst chronically ill patients is higher, related to lower quality of life. I think because POTS is such a massive disease with such a wide variety in severness, it is safe to say POTS patients (at least some) can fall under those studies as well.

One of the more recent ones for chronic ill and depression: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4768533/ </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have not done the real tilt table yet, but was diagnosed with a poor mams tilt table test. They were not even looking for POTS, the doctors just happened to have an american intern who knew about it.

Getting a real tilt table test to find out how severe it actually is soon though. With the poor mans, i had an increase of 51BPM </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, not common here. In fact I have never gone to the doctor with the flu. Usual rule of thumb is after a week or as soon as you cannot trust youself anymore for adults. A bit shorter for kids. IV treatment here also means getting admitted to the hospital, so it is fairly uncommon </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ah, more difference in culture. No way you would get fluids for something like a stomach flu, unless you are almost dying.

It is very easy because most doctors read your file beforehand. No explaining conditions, no double testing (all test results are in there too), no forgetting allergies. It is all available right there on their computer </TEXT>

<TEXT> I do notice that trend on here. Luckily in real life, not so much.

I kind of have a double feeling about it. On the one side, more awareness could be a good thing. However if it goes as far as celiac has, that is not a good thing at all.

I personally had not heard of POTS before getting diagnosed. Guess I am on exactly the other extreme end </TEXT>

<TEXT> POTS in itself does not impact it. However if you faint when you should not, that is obviously not a good idea. Comorbid conditions could impact it. Also, depression (and therefor suicide) is higher in POTS patients than in our healthy counterparts. </TEXT>

Ice cream on pancake was quite great actually but the hot and cold combo made me feel like I was commiting a crime.

Peanut butter jelly sandwich was just no combination. The different structures almost made my mouth explode, and not in a good way </TEXT>

<TEXT> My personal belief is that you should see a doctor when you get a new symptom. I get however why you want to try it this way. Just gently reminding you we are no experts, nor do we pretend to be.

My gramdmother does get the sleepy head thing as an aura before a migraine, maybe that is it? Does it get better when she lays down?

Please see a physical therapist about movement. Cardio and strenght are very important but it does not sound safe to exercise without direct supervision (especially the fainting worries me, in combination with EDS that could lead to some nasty injuries) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I want to hear about a small thing that made you happy today!


For me it happened this morning in an animal store. There was this girl of about 3 years old. She was there with her dad, and she looked a bit bored while playing with some tractor toys that the store had out. I was standing in the lane right next to the play table, minding my own buisness. This little girl gives me a tap on my back and tells me she just got new shoes. They had lights in it. I loved seeing her be so enthousiastic about it! I think she told me about them for 5 minutes. Afterwards the dad apologized, but I told him that was not necessary. I just really enjoyed this conversation with this small, enthousiastic girl. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [High school reading] What books to read? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2019-07-24 14:26:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> First off: I am not an native English speaker.

Next year I have to read 4 books for english. I thought I was smart to start over summer, but I have no idea what to read! Last year I read macbeth and a christmas carol. I enjoyed both of those, but especially macbeth was quite hard to read.

Our school does not have mandatory books, just a mandatory writers list : https://drive.google.com/open?id=1agDSuqTUKrAV7dsWF8N_XjCPJW7VbuDf . At least 3 out of my 4 books have to be of writers on that list.

I like crime and sensation books (think CSI, james bond etc.). Any good book recommendations? No required length but as short as possible is my own preference since I use audiobooks (and they tend to be very lengthy anyways).

Edit: forgot to add the books are not allowed to be in a series (so no harry potter or game of thrones etc.) </TEXT>

<TITLE> My cat got drunk </TITLE>
<DATE> 2019-06-22 21:41:50 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> First time posting here! This happened over 20 years ago. I am only 16, I totally got this story from my parents.

We had a lot of snails in our garden at the time. They were eating at our plants and my parents looked online at what to do. One thing they found was to put beer in the backyard, so they did. They were very desperate to get the snails out.

Anyway they kept this up for 2 or 3 days until our cat Famke (fun substory: Famke means girl in my language. The cat was a male, my parents didn't know at the time they named her) comes in. He is meauwing, he is falling over, he is throwing up, he is just clearly not well. 

My parents panicked. They almost went to the vet. Before going, my mom was going to get their outside pillows cleaned up, it was supposed to rain later that day and they had no idea how long they would be gone. While she did that, she happened to look over to one of the cups of beer. It was not very full anymore. So she looked at the next cup. Half empty too. All cups were only half full. My mom connected a sick cat and a lot of missing beer and she told my dad. 

They called the vet. My parents asked if cats could get drunk. Doctor said he really did not know but if they thought he was drunk, to monitor and if it got worse to call again. In one or two weeks the cat was back to normal. My parents obviously cleaned out the beer very very fast.

And the cat? He lived happily ever after. He died when I was about 6 months old. It was a tough guy. </TEXT>
