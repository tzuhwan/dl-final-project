<TEXT> oh sorry, i misread your post. Hojo is almost guaranteed. i think Bay State is pretty easy to get as well if you don't have a terrible number, because i was originally placed there my sophomore year. i was able to summer swap into Myles, but i think that's pretty uncommon and you usually can't get in unless you're getting pulled in. i think South is pretty much a toss up. it could be possible. </TEXT>

<TEXT> it's pretty unlikely you'll get into Myles, South, and a tiny more likely you'll get into Bay State. Hojo is definitely the easiest to get into as a freshman because not many freshman want to live there, but it's not popular enough with upperclassmen to fill up very fast.

i lived in Hojo my freshman year. cons are that it's pretty dead and can be kinda hard to make friends through your dorm compared to the large freshman dorms (Warren and West), some of the rooms have tiny ass windows, and they're mostly all triples. pros are that you get your own bathroom, you get arguably the best ac/heating system control possible for BU housing, and the top floor study hall is creepy and weird, but also has a nice view of Boston. </TEXT>

<TEXT> you sign up for summer swap sometime after you do regular housing selection. it's through the housing portal and basically the number rank goes backwards (so if you had a really shitty number before, you'd have a really good one for summer swap).

honestly, i think stuvi 2 is almost impossible even if you're a rising senior. i've heard that most years, it fills completely up during same room and internal (same building) selection. it doesn't even make it to regular selection. take this with a grain of salt though because it's just what i've heard and i've never known anyone who actually lived there anyway.

edit: only juniors and seniors can live in stuvi 2 apparently </TEXT>

<TEXT> i lived in Hojo my freshman year. it's nice to have your own bathroom, but the dorm is hella quiet. most people do not use the common areas and there's very little going on. i would say your chances of getting in as a sophomore are pretty high.

i've lived in Myles for two years and it's infinitely nicer in terms of the facilities and all. it's a bit rowdier than Hojo, but still relatively quiet compared to the bigger freshman dorms. there are often people hanging out in the common spaces though. getting in as a sophomore is pretty rare. i got in through summer swap my sophomore year, so i'd recommend that if you can't get it during regular housing selection. </TEXT>

<TEXT> no dude. this is an unbelievably thoughtless response. have you ever seen Shapiro speak? he is very very good at making himself sound right regardless of his inability to cite his arguments. people who are into Shapiro who haven't looked into him enough are the fencesitters i'm talking about. those are the people most at risk for agreeing with him because of his assertion that he is right. what makes you think people who don't care enough to do research on him would care enough to fact check his arguments? they wouldn't. they would be swayed by his rhetoric. having Shapiro speak on campus is dangerous because of those individuals precisely. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just ordered a pair of black Jadons after trying them on in store and falling in love, but I'm terrified of the breaking in process. It seems it would be much harder because they're heavier and the soles don't bend as much. Am I correct in thinking this? Also, due to these being platforms, are they considerably less comfortable than other Docs even after breaking in?

Would love some insights from Jadon/other platform Docs owners! </TEXT>

He has said, and is right, about the fact that raising minimum wage will incentivize automation (as most min wage jobs are already being lost to automation) and that it won't end up helping those people in the long run anyway. In reality, very few people in the US are working minimum wage jobs. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Dining Plan Switching has Changed </TITLE>
<DATE> 2019-10-16 16:27:57 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So as many of you know, it's a common hack to switch from the 330 to the 250 dining plan around late October (or the beginning of next semester for even more points), but apparently they've changed the deadline to switch. You can now only switch plans in the first 4 weeks of school which means that the 330/250 hack is effectively gone if you choose to switch in the middle of first semester.

You can still switch at the beginning of next semester for more points, but most people I know couldn't make it that long. Just thought I'd let everyone know that if you were planning on switching soon, it's not a thing anymore :( </TEXT>

<DATE> 2019-09-27 22:38:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> this is just a full fledged dysphoric rant, but i am AFAB and hella fucking short (like under 5 feet) with a relatively noticeable hourglass figure. this just makes it impossible to be anything other than femme-presenting because all pants are so restrictive. 

i recently found a pair of vintage striped pants that weren't skinny jeans (which are literally the only pants i can ever find that will fit to my body) and had the "right" measurements. it was a miracle and i spent a good deal of money to buy them on a site that doesn't offer returns. i got them today and they look terrible on me. they are so baggy to the point it's almost comical, when in reality, they were supposed to be wider legged with some tailoring. 

i've just been feeling so dysphoric lately because all i can seem to find that consistently fits are skirts, dresses, or tight pants (like legging type fits) and i'm not against looking more femme, but i'm just so hyperfeminine because of my limited clothing options and body type. it's so discouraging and upsetting.

do any other enbies have similar experiences with their body type just being so restrictive? </TEXT>

<TEXT> just chiming in as a sociology major.

i picked this major because i truthfully had no desire to go to college and it was the only subject i could even fathom myself having any large enough interest in to be able to sit through 4 years of classes. BU was very generous with my financial aid so i don't feel i'm wasting any money doing this major. i often think that i should have just gone straight into the work force instead of going to college, but i am learning a lot that feels very important to me even though i will probably never do anything related to sociology. i truly think this major is making me a more aware, thoughtful, and understanding human.

i just want to work a 9-5 boring ass desk job (preferably in administration or as an assistant) which i could probably snag without a degree, but i also recognize the high likelihood of me making even slightly more money with a degree vs. not having one. i have no desire for my career to be at all related to my passion, i just want an easy job that i can forget about when i go home that will fund my outside passion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> sure, hes right that often children are used to push talking points, but who the hell else is talking about this in the way she is?? did you even hear/see the speech she gave today? she cites real numbers because shes coming from a country where climate change is not a debate, its a fact. 

also the hundreds of climate strikes that happened this week? those would not have happened if not for her. 

sure shes a child, but thats no reason to discredit the very real awareness she has brought. </TEXT>

<TEXT> im a nonbinary individual who uses they/them and i also wholeheartedly agree that parents raising their children this way is wrong. no child has a concept of gender that young and they should be given freedom to explore it, but these parents are essentially forcing a nonbinary identity on their child who is likely going to be cisgender (based on statistic likelihood). 

i think its one thing if your child doesnt want to adhere to gender roles or appearances, but parents who allow their child to medically transition...i just can not justify that. im all for them allowing their child to appear as whatever gender they want or using the pronouns they want, but bringing medicalization into it that young is just wrong in every situation i can imagine. </TEXT>

<TEXT> might have just been a bad time of day or something. sometimes i make normal games with meta and i still get no one to join after half an hour. kind of shitty that observers were being dicks. you probably would have a hard time filling up a no-meta game as fast as regular games fill up, but i would suggest just trying again or looking for a no-meta game. they aren't like super super common, but i've also seen quite a few while searching for games. </TEXT>

<TEXT> for context, i switch between lucio and moira (though i'm definitely more of a lucio main). 

i totally recognize it could be me, but i guess i was confused because i normally get gold medals. of course there are games where i die a ton, but i would say usually, i don't die more than 2 or 3 times in a given round, even if we're doing poorly because i always retreat if a lot of my team dies. i rarely ever get gold elims unless i'm moira, but i do often get gold obj kills as lucio just because i'm staying on point most of the time and when i'm waiting for my abilities to recharge, i'm taking shots at low health enemies. 

thanks for the tips though! i will definitely start looking at replays and see what i can fix. </TEXT>

how early on did you realize you had multiple personalities inside of you? has it been something youve had for as long as you can remember? im curious how you dealt with it and understood it while you were young (if you had it then). 

do you take any medication for it? is there even any medication for it? 

if you could just have one personality tomorrow, would you take it? or do you feel like youd lose pieces of yourself? </TEXT>

what was the process of getting diagnosed like? how early was it obvious to you/family/friends that you may have something like this?

you mentioned in another comment that its like youre not in the drivers seat anymore when you switch, do you mean that youre still aware of whats happening as you? 

how does DID affect your ability to form relationships with people? do your other identities remember the relationships youve formed or is there a process of sort of introducing them to people individually?

can you control when you switch ever? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey Tom! I'm driving into Orlando from Atlanta tomorrow morning and will be there until early Sunday for a short Disney trip. As of right now, it seems like my time in Disney shouldn't be too affected, but I'm very worried about the closures and traffic that may happen Sunday morning. I am catching a flight out of Atlanta back to college Sunday night and I'm worried I'll be stuck on the roads getting back to Atlanta. By Sunday morning, is it likely many people will be evacuating or that the storm will already be bad enough that I won't make it back? </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's no chance that the storm could speed up, is there? I'm going to be in Disney for a very short time (Friday afternoon to Sunday morning) and right now, it's looking like I shouldn't be too affected by the storm, but I am wondering the likelihood of it somehow speeding up and hitting much earlier than expected. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lived in a triple my freshman year and it was great for freshman year, but I wouldn't prefer it after that. It's not awful, but it's not ideal. Some rooms are small and cramped and some rooms are extremely dark and have tiny windows (like i'm talking a slit in the top corner of a room, but that being said, it varies extremely. Almost no room has the same layout. It is very nice to have your own bathroom and to be able to control the temp in the room though.

I met literally one human being who lived in Hojo my freshman year. It is not like the bigger dorms where people are constantly keeping their doors open for friends and stuff. It's quiet there. The common spaces are pretty nice though imo, but no one ever utilizes them. 

Location wise, it's literally perfect depending on where your classes are. It's super close to most of the class buildings and it's right next door to the okay-est dining hall imo. It's also super quick to get to the Charles from there which is a plus. </TEXT>

still had a great time in Japan, but it sucked that the museum was so inaccessible that i couldnt even go. </TEXT>

<TEXT> no question, just wanted to say i am assigned female at birth and am very femme-presenting, but i identify as nonbinary and am okay with any pronouns. to most strangers, i appear female so they use she/her and thats okay but close friends use they/them. 

i was really confused for a while because even though i appear female in many ways (wearing makeup, having long hair, etc), i feel very masculine sometimes and it never feels right to identify as female (or male for that fact). 

you do you. theres so many people who say shit like oh you cant change your gender, but fuck em. gender is such a deeply personal thing and tbh, i think you can and should be able to give it any label you wish and change as you learn and grow. good luck!!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> okay boyo, i wasnt doubting your own experiences and im sorry youve experienced racism in the south, but i was just saying that you were incorrect when saying the south wasnt diverse. you cant just make up facts to support your own experiences, nor can you assume my own experiences. 

boston may have more immigrant communities, i wouldnt know, but to say atlanta has none is, again, just incorrect. there are many places in atlanta where immigrants dont even need to learn english perfectly and/or have forgotten it because of how tight knit the communities of immigrants are. for example, korean is spoken more in georgia than in any other state in the US. thats just one example. its honestly really gross that youre just coming up with shit. 

and no culture??? new orleans has no culture when jazz music was literally born there?? pfft, okay. shoot me some real facts and we will talk. </TEXT>

When I went to my intake appointment, they told me they could only connect me to a psychiatrist (which is not what I needed), but I went anyway. The psychiatrist also said they wouldn't be helpful to me and put me on a 7 month waitlist before I finally got a decent-ish therapist.

tl;dr BU does not prioritize their students' mental health nor do they refer to decent providers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would highly recommend most lower level Sociology courses (like either 100 or a 200 level). I may be biased as a Sociology major, but so many of the classes are taught by people doing incredible amounts of field work in the subject. The best part is hearing the professors back up class material with their own studies. 

I cant remember any course numbers, but Sex and Sociology was pretty light and interesting with a small class size. SOC 100 with Mears is a great intro class, but its usually pretty big so not much discussion happens. Sociology of Race and Ethnicity is super interesting if you care about race relations and my discussion TA for that class was probably one of my favorite faculty members at BU </TEXT>

<TEXT> My partner of 2.5 years broke up with me at the beginning of this school year and it destroyed me. We were long distance the whole time and I was halfway through school so we were halfway to finally living in the same place. It was a devastating blow to me and I felt like I lost all sense of direction since my whole time here had been filled with thoughts of how wed soon live together. Every bad day I had, I thought, Well at least its a day closer to being together so it was something that sort of became my purpose in life. 

I say this to tell you that the other responses of Just love your new freedom are absolutely great responses, but you may just need time before you can really begin to accept those truths and actively work towards them and thats okay. Its been almost a year since my partner left me and I still am working at moving on. Its taken a lot for me to realize thats okay and that its not weird if I still have weekly cries about it. Tiny steps become easier and suddenly bigger and bigger ones seem easier. 

I recommend just giving yourself time. Take care of yourself. A lot of the active steps will come with time. </TEXT>

first of all, orgasm control is not for all women and i would really suggest you not pull out all of the stops when you both first sleep together. and secondly, she can and should be able to change her mind even if you are already in her. what if it does hurt her? what if she has second thoughts. just because youre already in her doesnt mean you dont need consent throughout.

also feels very obvious that you are only responding to comments that praise you or that you can respond to with your insane sexual prowess. </TEXT>

minorities arent proud to be minorities because of the color of their skin, but because of the fact that they have survived and existed and done great things regardless of the systematic racism in the US. when white people have white pride, its specifically because of the color of their skin...which yes, is racist. excluding having pride for being like italian, german, etc. white people, as a group of people with the same skin tone, have nothing to be proud of when it comes to their race. nationality, yes. color of skin, lack of melanin, no. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Seconding what u/Gravemonera said. Forever 21 is also pretty good for thigh highs, as well as thinner ones that aren't sheer, but are breathable enough for the upcoming warmer months. 

I'm pretty short so I'm not sure how well this could work for you, but I have some thigh highs that go insanely high on my legs and so you can't even see where the sock ends because the skirt covers it. In theory, they look like tights, but they're still open on the top so you can get to your straps. So maybe you could specifically look for very tall socks. </TEXT>

that being said, im sure you could find a community here in boston, but it might not be through BU. just my experience tho </TEXT>

Cons:
its hard to make friends easily if you live in hojo. its mostly sophomores so no one really leaves their doors open to make friends like they do in warren or west. there are no real common areas that are regularly used so its just a very quiet dorm in general. 

some of the rooms have very small windows so theyre often quite dark and dont let in a lot of natural light. not all the rooms are like this though and some have pretty big windows. 

almost all of the rooms are triples so the space is quite tight in the rooms. again not all of the rooms are the same so there are some that arent bad and if you rearrange furniture, its possible to make it feel more open. the doubles also arent so bad 

Pros:
you get your own bathroom for the room. this also means you have to clean it and provide supplies for it like toilet paper and stuff. not gonna lie though, its so nice to not have to share a bathroom with the floor. 

you have AC and can control the temperature of your room. most dorms dont have AC and though its only hot enough to need it in the first and last couple weeks of school, its nice as hell to have it. its also nice to be able to control the heat in the winter. 

Overall, i liked hojo for a freshman dorm. the cons didnt bother me too much and the pros made it worth it to me.

<TEXT> I was at the Charles River in Boston once and someone had their dog off of its leash and it attacked one of the geese close to the water. I think it was okay (it didnt have any visible injuries at least), but it just sat there still and kept making the same awful honking noise. Eventually a huge flock of about 6-7 geese cane swooping in all making the same noise and chased me away from it. They were really aggressive and it felt very much like they thought I had hurt it. They were so caring to the injured one and were literally lifting its wings and looked to be checking for injuries. It was really an amazing thing to see.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> hey i went through a very similar situation last year and i cant say this will for sure work since mine was a bit different as i was just trying to guarantee a single for the coming school year for mental health reasons. 

you have to do most of the work and its fucking awful. try to get back into see a therapist at SHS, explain your situation and how serious it is that you get out asap. it might be rough trying to get in an appointment within the next month, but if you say its serious, they will usually take you seriously. 

make sure to get a letter from your therapist stating exactly why you need to get switched out immediately. i think theres a specific form on the ods website for mental health accommodations but your therapist should be able to tell you about this. 

then you gotta basically pester the shit out of the office of disability. they are awful at taking mental health into consideration in my experience and you have to just bother them enough until they believe you. i was able to secure a single for this year because of that and it was so shitty but it worked.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> yep. i get pretty serious side effects if im not very on time with my birth control and it seems literally every time i get the text saying my prescription is ready, they fill the generic version of my birth control (which ive tried to take and it destroyed me). this requires me to wait however it long it takes for them to get the right one which is anywhere from 15 minutes to a whole 24 hours or they send me on a hunt to find a CVS with it in stock. 

just last week, i had to go to the CVS in fenway but not in the target to get the right one and i commented to the pharmacist there that im always all over the city trying to get this medication and he goes why didnt they just put a note in your file that you cant take this generic version? and i was dumbfounded. ive been dealing with this for almost two years and all it took was for them to make a note of it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> yeah it's a rough line for me to draw too. often times, researching does help me calm down (though like you mentioned in your post, reinforces my behavior), but also a lot of the time, it sends me into an even worse spiral. it's just an unfortunate conundrum to be a person with HA and no/not good insurance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> i think this is super helpful for someone with health insurance and access to a doctor. i'm inclined to believe that self diagnosis (or at least attempting to do actual research on your symptoms) is sometimes necessary for someone who can't go to the doctor every time they experience a symptom. otherwise, this is a great write up. </TEXT>

im hella white passing, but i can tell you that minus asian americans or asian international students, theres not a ton of POC here. depends on where youre coming from, but for me, it was pretty strange going to such a white majority place. never heard of any serious racial issues on campus, but boston itself is super fucking segregated.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> dude, you obviously know nothing about the war on drugs. no, the literal policy is not to only arrest black people, but rather that there is high policing and surveillance in neighborhoods with a large population of people of color as a result of the policies enacted through the war on drugs. also i mean, look at any statistic about the unequal representation of people of color in prisons.

edit: lol just looked through your profile and you're a piece of work. it's pretty obvious you won't listen to anything I say since you're a literal racist. 
"Leave it to black people to make literally everything about race. Whos the one creating racial tension in USA again?"
nice one considering oh i don't know, the systematic oppression of black people and other people of color is so prevalent in their daily lives and ignored by people like you who have such an incredible privilege that they don't need to think about how they may be killed for the color of their skin everyday and therefore, refuse to accept that any other person may feel that way. btw you should do a better job studying law if you don't know about the policies enacted by the beginning of the war on drugs and the subsequent and continuing voter suppression of people of color to keep said policies in place. </TEXT>

<TEXT> people love to shit on people who dont really enjoy it here, but let me be honest. BU does not cater to poor students regardless of the financial aid they give you. this is probably not an issue for you if you can afford (or your parents can afford) to help you survive here. its hard to do things that are cheap in the city so if you dont have the funds to spend money every weekend, you wont do much after it gets too cold to just explore. 

obviously this is super dependent on your financial situation, but im transferring out next year because BU has not been supportive about my mental health or socioeconomic status.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My SO told me I could call him in the morning last weekend and talk for a couple hours (long distance) and he didnt answer at first and I managed to convince myself that he must have gotten up and gone somewhere and died in a car accident. I called him over 20 times, left voicemails, almost called everyone he knows and it turns out he forgot to turn his ringer on and slept for longer than expected. I had a panic attack for almost two hours trying to imagine life without him and it was nothing. 

So yeah youre definitely not alone.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A girl loosely involved in my social circle also began posting all of these things on Instagram about how she had discovered what love was and all this stuff about how different numbers meant different things and she would write long strings of them and tell everyone that they just needed to open their eyes and they would understand. She felt like she had discovered true math and felt like prime numbers were speaking to her. This lasted for a couple months, then she disappeared for a while, came back to tell everyone shed be diagnosed with schizophrenia.  </TEXT>

she growled and hissed the whole ride until she somehow managed to claw one of the air holes big enough to stick her head through. here i am, driving down the interstate, and she finally gets out. as soon as shes out of the box, she calms down and just falls asleep on the passenger seat. it was so adorable and made me think i should have forgone all the stress and just sat her in my car to begin with.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> its really not that bad. its a bit more expensive than storing off campus, but if you factor in renting a uhaul, then its about the same price either way. 

its much more cost efficient to just get a bunch of their small boxes rather than try to pack everything into bigger ones.  </TEXT>

just call shs and explain it to them. they will be able to work with you and give you better answers than anyone here can. and your parents have no way of knowing that you called them. 

good luck by the way. i know how much of a bitch it is to get help with less than ideal parents.  </TEXT>

i forgot to mention some things in this post as i'm sure i would. i am currently in therapy through my university, however, they have not been much help because they aren't trained to deal with my kind of mental illnesses. they have referred me to several outside psychologists, but i can't afford the copay even with my insurance.

i also have reached out to other students just in an attempt to make friends, but it hasn't helped. i have two people who i see occasionally, but i still feel like i don't connect with them because of our drastically different upbringings. </TEXT>

<TEXT> i answered this earlier, but basically i am in therapy at my university, but they have told me that they can't really do much besides be there to listen because they don't have training in severe mental illnesses. they have referred me repeatedly to an outside psychologist, but the copay even with my insurance is still too expensive for me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> thanks for the response. 

i actually am doing some therapy through my college at the moment, but it hasn't really helped because none of them have experience dealing with severe psychosis. they have been referring me to an outside psychologist, but the copay is too expensive for me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> not that great. im in one currently. the beds half to stay lofted unless you want one down. 

my roommate and i have ours down since our other roommate never sleeps in the room and its a weird setup we have. she has to use her bed as her desk chair to be able to fit everything and our dressers literally face each other so we can only use them one at a time. 

if you keep all the beds lofted, its not awful space wise, but the room feels cramped because you cant see any of the walls.  </TEXT>

I commented in the other thread posted about this recently with a much more detailed answer, but damn, I feel like I'm reminded everyday how fucking poor I am. It's not that I don't get along with wealthy people, but it just sucks literally not having anyone understand the extent to which money was scarce growing up and still is. It's hard not to feel alone when a lot of my personality and interests come from having to experience struggles that no one here seems to have any idea about. </TEXT>

<TEXT> just wanted to chime in and say it gets so much easier after the first week or so. 

the first time i met my SO, leaving him was the absolute hardest thing ive ever done. i felt like wed had an experience so magical and perfect that i couldnt even talk about it. it felt pointless. life started to feel pointless because i had just experienced happiness i didnt know existed...and then it was gone, indefinitely. 

but things got better over time! skyping became more normal and even though our second visit was almost a year after our first, counting down the days made it easier. it will get easier as time goes on. you will remember how you lived before he came to visit you.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> hey, i had this problem for my whole life until last year because i got on birth control and just couldnt spend time every morning trying to get them down without gagging. 

i cant promise this will work for you, but i just started carrying a box of tic tacs with me wherever i went and kept trying to swallow them. something about them not being pills eased my mind and allowed me to do it after a couple of days. 

also try putting the pill (or tic tac) on your tongue and taking a full water bottle, put your whole mouth around the opening and tip your head back. just keep aggressively swallowing the water and it usually gets down. since ive gotten over my fear, i can take pills without any water usually now.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Its so crazy to read your experience and the other comments here because I feel like Im the only one who hates it here. I only came here because it ended up being my cheapest option with the financial aid given to me, but I am seriously considering going back to my home state to go to college even though it will be more expensive and less quality. 

I cant meet fucking anyone here. I have two people who I occasionally talk to, but they have their own main groups. I will sometimes get invited to hang out with them, but its always a bit obvious that Im an outsider and that they all hang out without me much more. I have a work study job, but they cant really give me more hours and Im struggling so hard with money that I literally have next to no way to pay for food outside of the dining hall or even the T to get to anywhere off campus. I cant find a single off campus job who will take the hours I can offer and everything just sucks here. 

Im trying to stick it out since its so cheap for me to attend this school, but Im so depressed here. SHS cant help me without referring me to an outside therapist which would cost $10 a week (money I dont have) and Im so ready to just give up and drop out all together. 

Anyway, I guess this is just me also ranting and letting you know that you arent alone. The fact that Im not after reading this gave me some solace considering I feel like everywhere I go is one big circle jerk about how amazing this place is.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I did not have quite the same experience, but something sort of familiar. I came out as 100% total gay when I was 11 years old. I was so sure Id never like men and I stayed that way pretty much throughout the entirety of my high school years. Its a bit different for me though because I did have sexual interactions with men still, but it was just experimental and I didnt enjoy any of them much. I never could have felt real attraction and real emotion towards a man. 

And then I met my current SO/dom/whatever you wanna call him, and everything changed. Even though Id slept with men in the past, it was always boring and I still identified as entirely gay. Hell, I still do kind of because hes literally the only man I think Ill ever really want. I was so confused at first because the attraction to him was the same Id felt towards women my whole life. Our kinks meshed perfectly and we had a connection that really came the minute we first met. 

Anyway, that was unnecessarily long, but I just wanted to say that Id definitely had this experience. Dont worry about labeling yourself if its confusing for you. Just do what you want. Why not go for this? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Im always in these threads recommending Hojo, so let me give it another go!

Its right in front of Towers on Com Ave and its air conditioned with private bathrooms. Its about an equal mix of freshman and sophomores and though most of the rooms are triples, its not too hard to snag a double if youre lucky. Its super close to most classes too!

Its a quiet dorm though, I wont lie. People on your floor dont form cliques and theres no real common areas that people hang out in. That being said, its just a five minute walk from Warren so I found myself just walking over to there to hang out with friends which was so worth it for the temp control and my own bathroom. Its really a hidden gem and though the building is old and ugly, its not bad at all. There arent many issues with it in my experience and Ive enjoyed living here more than I ever would in a place where the whole floor shared the bathroom. Its nice to be able to shower in a place that doesnt regularly have puke in the sink.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just dropping in to confirm what many others have said with my relationship story!

My partner and I have been together for almost 2 years and were long distance so we see each other maybe once every three months or so for a few days. Were hella kinky and hes just usually so excited to be rough with me and fuck me as hard as he can. Its great, I love it. 

But literally just in the last month, did I finally feel comfortable to ask him to make love to me (not his fault I didnt feel comfortable, just me) and even though it was new to us and took me explaining to him exactly what I wanted, it was incredible. Honestly rough kinky sex has become our norm that it almost feels more exciting to just have vanilla sex now. 

Id say definitely just bring it up!! If your partner cares for you, Im sure hed try it at least. Theres always a compromise especially if you just want variety occasionally.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> One of my roommates is a sophomore this year and did random selection so I don't think it's too uncommon!

That being said, I've heard it's quite difficult to snag a single during sophomore year, so it's likely that your friends will end up having to room with someone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it super depends. I didnt have great grades (maybe like a little higher than the average high school student), but my family makes less than $10k a year so I only paid about $1,000 to go here this year. So technically, BU was cheaper than a community college for me.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My boyfriend and I are in an open relationship and have been since the beginning. We both had never been in closed relationships so it was just sort of assumed that we would be open. 

Our rules are different together than they are apart. No romantic attraction, just sex with other people. Were also pretty relax about details. We like talking about our sex lives so it just sort of naturally comes up in conversation.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes I absolutely have that. Or random, very normal things will remind me of him. Sometimes Im brushing my teeth and I remember standing next to him in the morning and doing that same thing and it just forces me to tears. Or anything really. Driving in my car after hes been in it, taking a bath and remember when we took them together. 

And yes, I always found it so soothing to know Im not alone. For some reason, the it gets better thing never makes me feel better unless its from this sub because I just know people get it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I understand this. I'm literally sitting in the airport after my 6th visit with him and it never seems to get easier. I've cried for 3 hours straight now and anytime I think about him, it just gets worse. I want to press my sweater to my nose that still smells like him, but damn, it just breaks me.

It gets better. That's such a shitty answer, but you just have to make it through this week and it'll get better eventually. It always does. That's what I've learned. I can cry for literally 24 hours straight after leaving him, but I have to hold on to the fact that it'll get easier again. We will begin planning our next visit and my skype calls to him won't ever feel like enough, but they will feel normal. </TEXT>

Give each other time. I think its great that youre doing what you can for him and figuring out ways to still enjoy your sex life to an extent. I know this isnt for everyone, but maybe in the future, you guys could try an open relationship? Dont push that if it doesnt feel right, but I think it could be helpful for you two if it does work out. 

Good luck to you both.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes!! 

To be fair though, I was a total idiot about it. I made a post on this subreddit and some girl messaged saying she was interested in hanging out with me and maybe more. Everything was perfect about her. She was the same year as me, a single in Warren, etc. she sent me photos of herself and we made plans to meet up before I reverse searched her photos and found out that it was just some random cam model from New Orleans. 

The whole thing was really weird though because we actually made plans to meet up so I dont really know why this person would have done that. I kind of regret not just going because Im really curious now.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly the biggest problem I used to have with it was I felt that I was being the clingy girlfriend. When youre sending 10 paragraph long texts a day without a response until that night, I guess its easy to feel that way. 

The thing that helped me most was my SO telling me that he doesnt mind all the texts and that he does see every one of them not long after theyre sent. He tells me that it makes him happy to feel like hes partially there with me throughout the day and it gives us things to talk about at night when we skype because he will often want to know more about what I messaged him earlier. So that helps a lot. Knowing that he genuinely loves hearing from me and that it keeps me in his mind all day throughout his very busy schedule. 

I hope this was some consolation. Its been this way for us since the beginning and its gotten much easier over time because of his reassurance.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a big fear of being not enough for my boyfriend. In the past, I was in a long term open relationship, but she cheated on me emotionally and was having another serious relationship behind my back with a guy I had asked her not to sleep with. So I think about that a lot. 

Honestly its just a lot of reassurance that my boyfriend gives me. Hes understanding and knows why Id be scared so he knows exactly what to tell me and do to make me feel better. He tells me often how Im still the best hes ever had and tells me all the things I give him that no one else can. So yes, its gotten easier over time because Ive learned that its okay. We talk a lot about his sexual encounters and even joke about them. Its a casual conversation so it normalizes it. 

I think Id have a hard time with the dont ask, dont tell rule because I want it to be normal. I want us to laugh about things that went wrong and take away things he liked that other girls did. 

I hope this helps. Good luck in this! I promise that being an easily jealous person and being nonmonogamous can work together!!! </TEXT>

I think hearing about her experience (even if its not like full details) will help a lot. I know thats what my boyfriend and I do. I suffer from jealousy a lot when he sleeps with other people, but hearing him tell me how great of a time he had, and then realizing its still me hes consistently coming back to, makes things much easier! Because I know its making him happy, but since Im the one hes fully committing to, well then I must make him much happier than even the other person did! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, this whole situation was so bound to happen. It sounds like you actually dont like having an open relationship and have come to accept it by pretending that only you are the one taking advantage of it. Ive never done the dont ask, dont tell rule, but couples I know who have never do that because they want to act like its not happening. They just do it because even though they know their partner is sleeping with others, they dont want to necessarily hear about it. 

Sorry to be blunt like this, but the posts on here about guys loving their open relationship until they realize that they arent the only ones getting anything are so ridiculous. Non-monogamy isnt about fooling yourself into being okay with it. 

Sounds like you need to rethink the terms of your relationship entirely. It seems like you just really want a closed relationship where you can be sure she isnt sleeping with someone else.  </TEXT>

If youre looking for just a trim though or something not as drastic as mine, honestly Id suggest just going to Great Clips to save money.  </TEXT>

However, I was on tinder before 18 because the age of consent in my state is 16 and I can assure you I was perfectly fine. I think its weird to assume that if youre under 18, you always, no matter what, have absolutely no idea what you want. Im still young now, but Ive stayed pretty steady in my opinions.  </TEXT>

I just didn't think straight and instead of spending money on food in the beginning, I just used all my meals.

Even among some of my acquaintances here, I talk about having no money to buy food and they automatically assume it's because I spent it on something stupid and they think it's a joke. It's a joke even among poor college students themselves.

I actually cannot find any info about a student union at my university (Boston University). </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey all, I just found this subreddit while on a search to make money. Im currently a freshman in university on a full ride. I have a work study job here, but I only make $11 an hour and I only have time to work 8 hours a week. 

Im completely freaking out because I had an emergency recently that left me with $4 and I need to buy food. I can get by for the next couple days to a week on what I already have, but is there anything I can do about this?

I cut contact with my family when I moved here because I was supporting myself anyway working 30-40 hours a week and my parents are both drug addicts with no money. I paid for everything to get here and its left me with literally nothing. I just dont know what to do and I need to know what can help me in a relatively short time. I am thinking about maybe getting a loan but I dont know how that works since it wouldnt even be a student loan. My tuition is already covered. I just need money for food and transportation to work. 

Any advice would be lovely. Thank you </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey there! Thanks for such a long and in-depth reply!

Ive noticed this mostly in musical theatre songs as that is usually what I have to audition with. However, I just notice this whenever Im singing along with music I like (Esperanza Spalding, Hiatus Kaiyote, Ella Fitzgerald). Im also 19 and Ive been singing since I could talk, but I was in choirs or theatres doing it with training since I was about 12.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's such a strange problem to have because I consider myself a very emotional person who conveys her emotions well and often. It just disappears when I sing. Maybe I just think too much and don't let go?

I've had so many casting directors for musicals and choral directors just tell me that I don't have the emotion to sing solos. I get decent ensemble parts and am one of the strongest in my section in choirs, but it's just because I can hit the notes with precision and blend with others well. I can't stand alone at all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh yeah definitely. I mean, not always things this emotional, but I would say most of the stuff I sing for fun or audition with are songs with intense emotions because Im a decent actor so I can portray it with my physical body. Its just the voice that always is so disconnected. Thats a good way to describe it. I just sound so disconnected. 

Perhaps this is a problem that cant really be fixed. Ive spent literally years trying to fix it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey OP! Im not the original responder, but the late Wednesday class is probably just an exam period so youll only go if you have an exam. Your professor should let you know for sure when you first attend class. However, the mom, early wed, and fri are all classes you have to attend every week. 

The sections arent something you need to worry about. Each professor usually will teach the same class but at different times to accommodate many students schedules, but youve already picked a section that works best for you so the other sections dont matter. 

Basically every time and day thats listed by that class, you should go to, except the late Wednesday lecture since its probably an exam period.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> No way you need to stop this immediately. I would almost argue that this is a deal breaker. It crosses into scary, almost assault territory. 

My boyfriend and I love choking, but there was one time he got a little too excited and pressed too hard and immediately started crying. He stopped without a word and we quit everything we were doing even though he told me later he was super fucking into it, more than usual up until that point. He held me and apologized and almost cried himself because he was so worried he lost that much control. This is how your husband should have responded. It is terrifying that he didnt and equally terrifying that the top comments dont seem to be taking this seriously.  </TEXT>

I would say I'm way more into girls than I am into men, but I have slept with a disproportionate amount of guys because they're easier to come across. If I had my way, it would be more women, but it's hard to find girls who like girls when you're a super feminine bisexual because no one assumes you like women.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My ex girlfriend and I (also a girl) used to do this. It was our main thing and during sex, I'd go so far as to refer to her vagina as a dick in every sense, even saying I was giving her a blowjob and everything. I also called her Daddy and we took it to some crazy levels. We got a strap on and we'd literally treat it like it was real in every sense. 

Honestly I also thought I was alone.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> We have been sort of officially together for a little over a year. I've only seen him three times, once in May 2016, again this past January, and I just got back from coming to visit him for the first time a week ago. I'm seeing him again though for two straight weeks in August!!

He actually doesn't speak French that well, haha! He's originally from Calgary and is only there finishing his phd. 

We hope to close the gap one day, but we are both in very transitional periods of our lives. I'm going to Boston for school in the fall and am going to be there for at least a few years, but after he finishes his degree, he has no idea where he's going for his post doctorate. Fingers crossed he can get into a good place in Boston! </TEXT>

We met because I made a post on raisedbynarcissists that resonated with him so much that he made an account just to message me (he was just sort of browsing before) and we talked really irregularly through Reddit for a year before we skyped for the first time and became best friends. He visited me another year later and I unexpectedly fell in love!

<TEXT> I am going through the same thing, OP. I don't know if it helps you to hear that, but this post made me feel less alone. 

My girlfriend and I just celebrated our three year anniversary. She's dealt with me wonderfully for so long. A week ago, I found out she was carrying on a secret relationship behind my back because she didn't want to be with me anymore and was unhappy, but felt like she couldn't leave because I'd kill my self. 

We are still sort of together, but it's complicated and she's going to leave me at any minute. When she told me that she didn't want me to forgive her for what she did and that she wanted me to hate her and leave her so she could move on, I'd realized I'd lost her and there was nothing I could say to make her stay. I had a two hour long panic attack in which I completely lost myself and ended up passing out. I think that's the only reason she stayed because she still loves me and is worried I won't make it without her. 

The most painful part is that I just now am able to get help. I'm getting medication next week. If she could have just waited, she would have seen me get better and our relationship could have been healthy. 

I don't have any advice for you. I have been broken for the past week, self medicating in ways I shouldn't be. I feel for you. Feel free to message me if you think it would help to talk. I believe we are feeling very similar things right now.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am not a transfer student (accepted to go right out of high school), but I also had an issue with the admissions deposit. 

When I talked to financial aid, they made it sound like you couldn't get a loan that would be available to you in time to pay it. They said my loans wouldn't be available until I began school. I'm not sure how loans work in full so I just trusted that. 

However, I did call admissions and asked to get it waived and it was kind of a hassle. My situation was a little different though because I got a full ride so they knew I couldn't pay it. I would suggest you just call and ask. All they had me do was send the envelope back to them with admission fee waived on the front and it was fine.  </TEXT>

Like, if I get too high, I just can't focus on anything and I get too in my head. I would suggest just smoking lightly and checking how you feel every few minutes. My highs tend to be drastically sexual to the point where I cannot be around people I'm not supposed to sleep with, so maybe it just depends on the person.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you so much. My girlfriend and I are working our hardest to keep things positive and healthy until I go to college in the fall and get therapy for free. I am hoping that will make things easier for us both as it seems like that's what has worked so well for you. 

I definitely need to work on being okay apart from her. I have hobbies that I can do alone, but I'm unhappy doing them alone and would rather be doing them beside her. It makes it hard to be independent when even my alone time activities are only enjoyable when I'm near her.  </TEXT>

Sometimes I worry that I'll never be in a healthy relationship. I've been with my current girlfriend for 3 years and my mental illness has wrecked her. I try my best everyday and sometimes it seems like it's getting better only to fall apart again. 

So I guess my question is how has your illness affected your relationship and how do you deal with that in a productive and healthy way? How does your husband deal with it? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I also had the issue of being incredibly small and it wasn't until I was with a partner for the first time that I had even had the want for penetration. 

So I think the thing is that you have to really want it and not think too much about the actual act of it. When I masturbate, I usually never have the urge to have something in me. It feels like an unwelcome distraction, but when I'm with a partner, it's all I want. 

I also am incredibly physically small in every way so it's often still an issue, however, fingers never are so I'm sure that unless you have a medical problem, it'll work out fine the more you try and get comfortable with it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I didn't know other people experienced this. I've always thought it is just because I'm small in stature (barely 5'), but I feel like I hold my own very well and I typically lead conversations...except I still managed to get ignored and walked in front of. 

This definitely happens to me way often than it should and even my girlfriend will notice it when we are in public, but people have no problem literally shoving me aside. It's really strange and I would think people would almost be more considerate of me because I'm so small.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a long distance friend/lover/boyfriend-ish person who hypnotizes me over skype but also in person when he comes to visit and we do hypnosis induced orgasms occasionally. 

In my experience (I am also female so I'm not sure if this is the demographic you're after), they feel closer to ruined orgasms than an actual orgasm. They're not quite as frustrating as a ruined one, but they are much less intense and the contractions and all are much shallower and slower. I usually am not 100% satisfied after them.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is 100% possible. I feel the exact same about everything you've written and I've gotten so lucky to have a guy in my life who is absolutely perfect and takes care of me and trains me and does everything you've described. 

It takes time though. And it's hard. It sucks to wait and it sucks to have a desire that no one seems to be able to fill. I slept with a decent number of guys hoping every time that it was just sexual frustration and it'd go away if I slept with someone, but it never did. I get that it's a super specific urge. 

But you will find someone. I promise. Get out there in the bdsm community and meet people! It still will take time, but it will be loads easier if you take initiative. Good luck 3 </TEXT>

I don't have any advice, but I guess I wanted to let you know that you aren't alone and that I hope you find a solution to this. Sometimes I feel like I actually will get depressed because I'm not getting enough sex even though I'm getting it twice a day usually.  </TEXT>

Anyway, I was always really attracted to him and halfway through the night, we began making out and, with the permission of the hostess, went into the other room where some other things happened, but nothing too crazy.

He kept saying how he'd been dreaming of doing this for so long and he had never really done much before me. I was into it without a doubt, but not as much as he was. He was in shock and awe basically at everything. It made me feel good to be the thing that made this guy's dreams come true. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been a subject to a long-term tist for almost a year now and have had a few one-off encounters. I'll try to answer your questions as best as I can, but I also only do audio hypnosis so some of it may not apply to you if you're strictly text, which I have little to no experience with.

I figured out what I wanted from hypnosis by just thinking about other things I was interested in. Hypnosis meshes with a lot of other kinks very well so that helped me. I read people's real life experiences with hypnosis and gravitated towards things that sounded fun to me. My long term tist (who for the sake of ease, we'll call N) also had some very set things he was already interested in and that I was willing to try. Most of my experience with him has been things he thought I'd like and then I did!

Ensuring your safety can be super easy when you have a tist you've known for a while. Generally, I refuse to have a session with someone until I've felt them out well. Just had normal conversations with them for quite a bit and see how I like them as people, if we connect on a level other than that we're both interested in hypnosis, etc. Hypnosis is also not some magical thing that the subject cannot control. No hypnotist is going to be able to wipe your memories if you don't want them too. That's not how it works. The subject has to be as willing as the tist is. You have to actively open your mind to this suggestion. As for limits, go slow. Try things you are 100% comfortable with first and then slowly go further the more you get used to it. 

Again, I stress having a hypnotist who will talk to you in a non-sexual setting before they will hypnotize you. I talked to N for nearly a month before he ever hypnotized me and my girlfriend had known him for 2 years under completely platonic circumstances so I already trusted him well. With other one off encounters, I talk to them for about a month too, sometimes about hypnosis, but never in a sexual context.

I refuse to talk to tists who want me to be hypnotized the first or second time we talk. I need someone who is patient and understands my concerns. I've had tists say talking to me for a month without ever putting me under is too long, but I think that they don't have my trust then and I won't put any effort into that if they won't. I also have a girlfriend outside of this and any of them that try to encroach on that is a red flag to me. I don't like tists who try to control my other relationships or different parts of my life. I think it's rather easy to weed those out, though there are a lot of them in my experience. As far as actual hypnosis goes, I will immediately block them and leave if they pass any boundaries of mine or try to get me to consent to something while under.

I can't answer this because I don't do text for mostly that reason. I find it incredibly boring...and also, it doesn't work for me because I find reading and typing to be very counter productive to going under.

I frequent SleepyChat occasionally, but I've never found anyone special there. I use the anonymous matchmaking because the chat seems to rarely be related to hypnosis. I set up second sessions through Skype.

I have connected with people online. N and I have been in a long-distance relationship for a while now. A few others I've talked to want to talk to me more after the first few times, specifically because they usually haven't hypnotized me by then. I'm not sure how it usually goes if you get hypnotized the first time.

Hopefully this helped! Feel free to ask more if you want more clarification. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am a female who is much more experienced at oral sex with women than I am with men. I think oral sex with women is world's easier. I don't know if that's just because I have more experience with it or because I'm a woman myself, but even the first time I did, it was easier than the first time I was with a guy.

I feel like I can just relax and go down on girls. I can just lie on the bed and not move very much. It's almost meditative for me. I know my girlfriend so well that I honestly don't even have to think that much about it, I just close my eyes and enjoy it all.

With guys, I feel like there's so much more movement, I'm constantly trying to get it down far enough without gagging, and my jaw hurts after a short period of time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a Mistress who I've been with for over a year. She introduced me to her friend who, at the time, she didn't have a sexual relationship with. I met him and was instantly attracted to him and she started to fall for him as well. Slowly, he became Master to both of us. 

My Mistress never stopped being my mistress though. She is dominated by him, but she still holds power over me...he just also has ultimate veto power. He is a long distance connection though, so she can physically dominate me while he fucks with my head. 

It's intense, but the amount of love I can feel for two people instead of one is mind blowing...not to mention have those two people fawn over me all of the time. It's wonderful.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It was a lot of different things. He's had a ton of experience with it all and I think that's what worked so well for me. He's confident and he knows what he's doing (or at least he sure acts like he does)! I think it also came down to be that I just am really good at being hypnotized. I'm incredibly open to suggestion without being in trance so the amount he's been able to do to me has surpassed even his expectations.

I hate to say this because of course not all women who identify as gay have this problem, but I think I completely shut off all ideas of being with men because of my fear of my father which carried over to most men, especially loud men, but I'm recovering and the person who I had sexual relations with is helping me a lot. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My parents have both been on and off hard drugs since I was a child. My mother had problems with prescription medications and heroin and my father sold and did meth. We lived with my grandmother for a while, but almost two years ago, my parents got us a cheap apartment. Somehow they managed to keep it regardless of multiple calls to the police because of reports of domestic abuse and ambulance visits because of overdoses. My father works a minimum wage job and sells on the side so rent-wise, it was easy to afford.

They were abusive mostly emotionally, but occasionally physically as well. I always had my door locked and barricaded with my dresser to ensure I wouldn't be hurt. My mother stole everything I owned to sell for drug money and my father condoned it all. 

Basically, my grandmother on my other side (so not the one I was with originally) realized just how bad it was because for some reason, I'd been hiding it and got me out of there as quickly as I could pack. </TEXT>

I'm really into edging, but not a fan of anything other than self-imposed denial. If I'm with my girlfriend or Master, I want to be able to have an orgasm and not doing so makes me grumpy. By myself, I've gone about a month, but no longer and it was just because I didn't see either one of them for that long and I much prefer cumming with them. So with that, I ask, do your subs ever experience crankiness or just general bad feelings from going so long without orgasm and how do you/they manage it? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Even with a friendship though, I think that hypnosis would be far more rewarding for both parties if a deeper relationship was involved apart from hypnosis. So regardless whether it's a committed relationship or a close friendship, I feel that it's going to be more enjoyable than just meeting someone once and parting. Obviously, that's going to be what's easier to find and I can't even understand sometimes how my tist got so (what he calls) lucky because he often tells me how hard it is to even find females with the intent of hypnotizing them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am always the subject and have been hypnotized maybe hundreds of times and almost all of them have been from my long-term hypnotist who got me into this. After reading /u/never_very_serious 's comment, I sort of understand things I didn't before. I've talked to hypnotists through text before, but I am used to be hypnotized through audio so I've only ever done that and every time was lackluster in comparison to my long-term tist.

I believe that those without long-term subjects are definitely not receiving as much, but my tist and I are getting equal amount of enjoyment out of it. I get to be hypnotized by someone who knows every corner of my mind and can give me fantasy-like experiences and he gets a submissive who wants to be on video with him and basically worships the ground he walks on. It is a nice exchange.

So I'm going to say that it simply takes getting lucky and finding that long-term subject to hypnotize. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes. My parents are both addicts and I'm rather young and hence, still living with the two of them. I'm finally moving out this summer because I showed my grandmother how bad they were with proof because for so many years of my life, she downplayed all of it. I think she just didn't want to accept that her son had turned out so badly.

But it's ruined so many things for me. They are both violent and aggressive and this has shot my nerves. Loud noises make me almost have a panic attack and I have many weird associations with different things that set me off. Most men who are larger than me (which is nearly all) really need to be extremely calm with me and gentle because I will freak out around them and assume any sort of rough behaviour is going to turn to them hurting me.

I think I've handled it sort of well though. I do well in school and I have a decent support system outside of family. I lack respect for authority and find myself unfairly lashing out at my friends' parents because I'm just so used to having to be the adult with my parents who are children. That's something I need to reel back and I know I do it, but it's so difficult not to think every parent is a piece of shit.

Yeah, this all is terrible. </TEXT>

The chorus of [Leeds United](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlJ9z_LowBI)

Another song with a bit of a darker sound, but still makes me feel breathless is [Guitar Hero](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a804vFcd_I0)

And she has some more stuff from when she was in Dresden Dolls that's less upbeat, but still personally gives me the same sort of angry, energized, almost crazed feeling, but I'm not quite sure if that's exactly what you're looking for. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can't promise anything of course, but the first few times I ever had sex and then a few times in recent history when I do new things like hypnosis or something, I hyperventilated. I think it comes for me, with being extremely nervous and extremely turned on at the same time.

I just taught myself to calm down and relax by forcing myself to breathe normally. In the beginning too, we would often take really tiny breaks for me to get some water or something because of a dry mouth, but that definitely will get you out of trance if you aren't used to trancing. I fall back into it easily so that was never an issue for me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Make sure you breathe through your nose. Sometimes I also find myself nearly panting especially if I'm already rather aroused and it has even caused me to almost hyperventilate before so just make that a point to do. It will start to become easier and something that doesn't require active thought to do after a while.

I expect going under most of the time because I've had the same tist for a while and I can't remember a time when it didn't work, but I think it's best not to have expectations. I mean, when it comes down to it though, hypnosis is not some magical thing, it is definitely your brain doing most of the work whereas the tist is the one working through that medium. You sort of have to expect it to happen for it to happen.

Hope I helped! If you need more specifics, you should ask. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Today, my father gave me some money for gas to get to school in the morning instead of giving it to my Nmom. She always takes the money he gives her and spends it on drugs. She doesn't have a job because she's been on painkillers since I was born. 

She was aware that he gave me this money for gas. She came into my room a little while ago and asked me for it. I asked her where she was going and she said "That's none of your business." I told her that it was because he told me specifically not to give it to her unless it was to get to school.

She basically starts screaming that I'm worthless and a piece of shit daughter and that she'll get stranded because her tank is barely filled.


Me: So then, why are you going to leave if you know it'll break down?

Her: That's none of your business, but it's your fault if I get stuck.

Me: You're being juvenile.

Her: You're the one being juvenile!

Me: How am I being juvenile?

Her: I never said you were.

Me: You do realize that you're contradicting yourself, right?


She went off in a tangent after this talking about how in the morning she won't take me to school since that's my "thing now". I'm not quite sure how going to school is "my thing". I just told her I'd call the cops because it's illegal not to take me to school.

I then told her she was being narcissistic and that she needed to get a job so that she'd stop complaining about money and she just goes on and on about how I need to get a job. I'm 16, but I can't drive yet and it's not like she'd take me anyway.

I told her that I was done arguing with her because she is a child who blames her short comings on everyone else. I told her she was ridiculous and that I had better things to do, like study and do homework so I could end up a smarter person than her. She was made furious by this and continued to tell me I am worthless.

I went up to my room while she threw shit around downstairs and screamed at me. I've got adrenaline pumping through me after a confrontation and I'm shaking a lot, but it's okay. I normally cry after stuff like this, but I remained calm and I'm really proud. It kills her not to see me be sucked into her mind games.

I'm getting there. 16 years of this and I'm finally learning how to soldier through it.

Edit: Holy shit, someone gave me gold for this. I never thought I'd be one of those people who would make an edit just to say that, but it feels important for some reason. Thanks for the support, you all! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't even know where to begin. I'm 16 years old and I have a 13 year old brother. My mother is definitely a N, but I just never found a word to attribute to her. I've been living with her my entire life, constantly under her emotional and verbal abuse.

My mother got PTSD after giving birth to me and as a result, began abusing pain medication and heroin. She has been on and off my whole life. When I was 8 years old, I found her trying to overdose. She went to rehab a few years ago, but came back and started again less than 2 days after. 

She doesn't have a job and my father who works minimum wage tries his hardest to support us. You'd think he would have left already, but he loves her furiously. 

She blames everyone for her problem, mostly me. She tells me almost everyday that it's my fault she's like this, that I'm ruining my father's and brother's lives. She tells me I'm worthless. She will say anything to upset me and then will tell me when I begin to cry that I am disgusting and have no reason to be upset. She has told me my father is on drugs (he was before, but has been clean for a while) just to further stoop my mood. 

She'll turn one sentence into a whole slew of things aimed at her. When I finally stop letting her get to me, she'll start to cry and guilt trip me, talking about how she doesn't want to lose her daughter. She steals large amounts of money from me. My father only gives me money for gas and food and such because he'll give it to her and she'll spend it on drugs and act like he never gave her anything. She's even managed to break open a safe and get out hundreds.

She gets mad at me for having to pick me up from school. She acts like it's my fault she has to, as if I can control going to school or not.

It's been getting worse lately. I've resorted to running away to my girlfriend's house when things get bad. I feel terrible for leaving my brother though, but I can't be there. She never notices except once. I expected her to care, but she was too drugged the morning I got back to even notice.

Apologies for this being all over the place. It's still more complex than I've written and too much happens for me to describe it all. I'm just so upset over all of this. I feel so trapped. </TEXT>
