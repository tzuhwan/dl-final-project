Sounds like Maslow's hierarchy applied to utilitarian ethics. 

Yup, that's about the conclusion I reached with other commenters


Nobody will ever reach self-actualization because the demand for sacrifice is too great. Always another starving person to feed or another dog to rescue.

That's why helping satisfy others needs is not a requirement but a virtue, while advancing your own needs provided you don't actively dissatisfy others lower level needs in the process is ethically neutral </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes I do too, from what little reading I've done so far, it seems that a lot of ethical theories are very exclusive, but it seems to me that most of them have wisdom in their own way, and maybe some combination of them would be best. I'll keep that in mind, although I personally don't mind bending the rules of those classical theories to get the best out of them.

From a practical/applied perspective, do you see any issues with the ethical theory I proposed in the OP? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'll go ahead and add an edit to specify then. 

Would there be anything wrong with arguing for both? That it's wrong to dissatisfy needs when it could be avoided (consequentialist), as well as having a duty to promote the satisfaction of needs with stronger duty for more basic needs (deontological)? Do you think combining theories like that strengthens the case for a given theory, or weakens it? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I confess, I don't see why their concern (which I take it is just what your concern is) exists! I can know if there's a table inside my room without knowing whether tables are just table-shaped mereological simples or full-fledged objects themselves, without knowing whether they're constituted of field excitations guided by Bohmian trajectories or instantiated particle positions in this branch in the Hilbert space or any of that esoteric stuff. There's a table in my room! Whatever the nature or ontology or fundamental structure of that table is is irrelevant to that! The theory behind that, and the theory behind *that* don't change that fact. 

Wow, that's a great point and I've never thought about it like that before! I think that the concern is because there's a great deal of disagreement on which normative ethics should be followed. If there were 3 people in a room, which supposedly has a table in it, and 1 person said "There's a table with 4 legs in this room", and the 2nd person said "There's a table with 3 legs in this room", and a 3rd person said "There's a table with a hole in the middle in this room", then it seems to me that the most constructive thing to do would be to begin studying at least one level of theory down behind the table, in order to discover why they came up with different answer, but the theory behind it would be tied to how they understand the table in the room. In addition, it seems that the way you look at it assumes moral realism (I think, again I don't understand that concept in much depth), however I don't think that really matters, just like the people discussing the table wouldn't have a productive conversation if they just went straight into solipsism.

 As I understand it, this is your position. 

Yes, so far it is.

And yeah, I think you're right that it is entirely normative, especially based on my discussion with u/trickpsyclist. How would I even go about answering those questions? Should I even attempt to give a more metaethical argument for why this theory is valid, or just keep it within normative ethics?

Thanks for your response, I really appreciate it! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh ok, I think what you're saying makes sense. In that case, I think this would be classified as a normative ethical framework refining the consequentialist framework/basing it on something that we can easily determine in day to day life. Is that what you meant/do you think that's accurate? Should I make that more clear in my OP? When presenting a moral framework like this, should I also attempt to support some kind of metaethics? Am I using the terms normative ethics and metaethics properly?

<TEXT>  this is actually an incredibly common proposal or suggestion by undergrads and autodidacts 

That makes sense, that's me.

 Your other comment seems to conflate metaethical and normative ethical concerns a bit 

After briefly looking into those, I'm not sure exactly what you mean. It seems like this idea accounts for both as opposed to conflating them. It seems to me that the two are intertwined, how could I have normative ethics without a metaethical theory to justify them? How could I have a metaethical theory without then generating a normative ethical theory? Maybe I'm basing my ideas on ethical naturalism within metaethics and a teleological theory of normative ethics, I'm very new to thinking about ethics like this but I appreciate you taking the time to respond.

 The bit about how "nobody has anything 'real' to base their views on realism on" seems to be confused about what moral realism is about 

That's correct, I am pretty confused about it.

 what you're suggesting wouldn't have anything to say about the ontology of moral states of affairs 

It doesn't? When sentient beings arise with needs, then this would argue that ethics around those needs arise as well. It very well could be that I'm misunderstanding what you mean by the ontology of moral states of affairs. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  This feels pretty much like utilitarianism 

Makes sense, I'm a big fan of negative utilitarianism. Specifically, negative average preference utilitarianism.

 How can we ever justify moving up the hierarchy when there are people around us who don't even reach number 1. 

I think that would fall under ethically neutral. Helping those other people reach number 1 would be ethically virtuous, but not required.

 Also, as animals have the same basic needs, the above applies again to animals 

Exactly! As sentient beings with needs, why wouldn't they have moral value? See my comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ethics/comments/do4eiv/is_there_an_ethical_framework_like_this/f5jvgpi?utm_source=share utm_medium=web2x) for more info, basically their needs pyramid would be more like a trapezoid than a triangle.

I think we can agree that kicking a dog for fun is wrong, and this framework still accounts for that (violating the dogs need for safety/security to fulfill your own need for esteem/fun, or even no need at all. Either way, it's wrong)

 I mean there are people who believe in the above, but it is rare that people fully practice what they preach. You would pretty much have to leave modern society to avoid exploiting people's basic needs for your higher needs 

Just because we can't/won't/don't fully live up to an ethical standard, does that mean it's wrong? I would argue our ability to perfectly follow an ethical framework has no bearing on whether it's valid, and if it's too easy to follow I'd even say that may be an indication that it is wrong.

 As another thought, I would also consider the notion that, in an Arisotelian view, if you achieve true self actualisation - I.e. Eudaimonia - this is when you are acting ethically. So from that viewpoint, unless you achieve the top of the hierarchy you haven't reached ethical action. 

This doesn't make much sense to me. Maybe I'm missing something or just don't understand the concept well enough, but why would my state of being impact whether I'm acting ethically or not? For example, why wouldn't it be ethically good for someone feeding starving people because they want others to think they're a good person?

 I think therefore that Maslow's hierarchy seems like a good tool for someone to use to try and act ethically if your presupposition is that utilitarianism is correct. But the hierarchy in and of itself says nothing about what is right and wrong. 

Fair enough </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you! I'm really looking forward to what other people think about it. If you're interested in some more context on my thinking around it, I was looking into moral realism vs antirealism, and it seemed to me, after my admittedly very very brief reading on it, that nobody actually has anything "real" to base their views on realism on. But with the hierarchy, we can actually study/analyze what our needs are and adjust as we learn more (for example, the expanded hierarchy), as well as include animals and adjust their needs compared with ours and so on. I would argue animals needs would be more like a trapezoid then a pyramid, cutting off where they no longer have certain needs that we have. In fact, if extremely advanced aliens showed up, this would still work, it would just turn out our hierarchy is actually a trapezoid as well, compared to the aliens </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been thinking about ethics and morals recently, and then I thought about maslows hierarchy of needs, and I'm curious if anybody's talked about an ethical framework based on needs. (Take a look at the hierarchy to get a refresher, the following will make a lot more sense if you do)

Here's how I've been thinking about it:

Something that either keeps your need satisfaction the same or satisfies even higher level needs of yours, without dissatisfying someone else's lower level needs, would be ethically neutral. Another ethically neutral action would be dissatisfying someone else's higher level need in order to satisfy your lower level need, provided that's truly the only option.

Something that dissatisfies the higher level needs of another more than necessary to satisfy your own, lower level needs, or something that dissatisfies anothers lower level needs to satisfy your higher level needs, would be ethically wrong.

Finally, something that satisfies the needs of others, regardless of whether it satisfies, dissatisfies, or has no effect on your needs, is ethically good.

Here are some examples of the three:

If you're about to starve to death, it would be ethically neutral to steal food from someone who has extra, because that's violating their second tier need for security, but it's fulfilling your first tier need for food. If you had an option besides stealing, choosing to steal would no longer be neutral, but in this hypothetical that's truly your only option for food, so it's ethically neutral.

If you have stable access to food and shelter, have a good support system of friends and a partner, and are looking to fulfill your self esteem needs, and decide to break into someone's house and take some of their cool clothes, that would be wrong because you're dissatisfying their second tier safety/security needs to satisfy your fourth tier self esteem needs. Another example would be two homeless people, if one of them has more food, but takes the little food the other has to secure more food for longer, that would be wrong, because the first person would be violating the second person's first tier food need to satisfy their second tier need for security.

Last example, spending less time with your friends to feed the starving would be ethically good/virtuous, because you'd be satisfying the needs of others. Whether that volunteering hurts your relationships with your friends because you do it so often (dissatisfies social belonging need), whether it has no affect on your relationship with your friends (no effect on social belonging need), or it helps your relationship with your friends and satisfies your esteem needs, it's still virtuous because it's helping someone else satisfy their needs as well.

 #x200B;

Hopefully all that makes sense, is there any ethical framework like it? Can you think of any issues with it that I might be missing? Anywhere else I should post this to get more feedback? Any other thoughts

One issue I can think of is if the hierarchy of needs you base it on isn't accurate to what we truly need or is out of order, this framework falls apart. For example, several hierarchies I've seen list "sex" as a first tier - physiological - need. I'm guessing they mean either an understanding of the genitalia you have or sexual release (which can be achieved without a partner), but if they mean sex with another person then I would argue that those hierarchies are wrong and it should not be first tier, but should be much higher up, at the very least higher than safety/security needs. If it meant sex with another person, and it was in the first tier of needs, then someone could use this framework to argue that rape was moral, saying that sex is a lower level need than safety/security so satisfying that takes priority over someone else's safety/security, however **that's clearly wrong**, and if we correctly move sex with another person higher on the hierarchy than safety/security, then it becomes obvious that rape is always wrong because violating someones lower level needs to satisfy higher level ones is wrong in this framework. For example, [this article](https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html) talks about an expanded hierarchy of needs, with sexual experiences at the very top of the hierarchy, so the lowest priority, which I think is where it should be. **TL:dr**, it's vital that you have an accurate hierarchy of needs for this framework to work correctly.

Edit: Based on some discussion in the comments, I should clarify that this is a normative ethical theory, although I'm still quite interested in any analyses of it, metaethical or normative. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What of them? I don't blame them for it, or think they're terrible people, we're all subject to the human condition. My thinking is that based on what we do know we should still try our best to improve, if we're doing something with good or neutral intentions and discover that there are negative consequences to what we're doing/supporting, then we should accept that we were wrong and change based on the new data (if we can). I don't hold contempt for those who truly have a good reason not to prioritize important issues, and I don't think having good intentions necessarily leads to bad outcomes, it's just that having good intentions without actually looking at the results is very dangerous, and just saying that you have good intentions doesn't mean you have an excuse not to change/improve. It could be that there are other good reasons not to, for example not knowing where your next meal is coming from, but then those should be used instead of good intentions. 

Essentially, good intentions don't hold much weight if you don't look at the consequences of your actions based on those good intentions, and determine if what you're doing is actually in line with those intentions. Even if they're not you may still have other reasons to continue to act out of line with your intentions, but then you shouldn't say "but I still had good intentions," you should say "this is why I continued to act out of line with my good intentions."

Hopefully I'm making sense, I agree with you we shouldn't treat people badly just because they may not have perfect information, and we're all human, but I disagree that we should say that things are ok because of that. We should at least recognize the mistakes we're making, even if we don't change anything about them </TEXT>

With the method I used in the post, even if the task gets run when the state hasn't changed, I only run into an issue if I also happen to unlock my phone within the 2 seconds of that happening, and if I already had my screen on then it won't do anything either, drastically cutting down on false positives </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've always hated when my phone screen turns on when I plug or unplug my phone, and I've searched around many times for how to disable it but haven't found any good solutions. Ideally, Tasker would have an event that handles phone plugged/phone unplugged, so I could just run a task that locks the screen (simulating the power button if rooted, actually locking or maybe just covering the screen with an all black scene if not) whenever either of those events occur. Tasker doesn't have events like that though, but I think I've finally discovered a reasonable way to do this with a minimal amount of quirks, which may be common knowledge but I haven't been able to find it anywhere online, so here goes:

The basic idea is that when the phone has power or loses it set a variable to 1 for 2 seconds (or however long works for you), then set it back to 0. Then, have an event for screen on that checks if that variable is 1, and if it is, lock the screen again. If you're not rooted, change the lock button task as needed

All the other solutions I was able to find had some odd quirk or another, turning off the screen when it shouldn't or something, or only working if the phone had charged all the way up, but this seems pretty reliable. Let me know if you have any tips or find any issues or ways I could improve this even more! 

Other ways to phrase the question for other people trying to search this issue: disable screen turning on when plugging in, keep screen off when plugging in phone, disable wake on charge

Edit: looks like on my phone, about 500 milliseconds is long enough to consistently catch all plug/unplug events when checking if the phone should lock again. I'll leave it at 2 seconds here to ensure it can catch all cases though, but play around with it yourself to find what works for you </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh ok, thanks for clarifying!

Yeah I'm not particularly interested in living and thinking exactly the same as the ancient stoics, because as humans it's possible and even likely that they were wrong on some things. I'm more interested in finding the best way to live a life that leaves a positive impact on the world while staying sane in light of all the problems, and I'm fine with taking inspiration from many sources and ideas. So far stoicism seems pretty good, at least from the basics as I understand them, but it seems to me that there are still some issues with it in its pure form. 

Thanks again for explaining things! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I suppose I was asking all three, which I think you've done a good job of answering since I don't expect you to write entire essays just to answer my questions, and anyways that leads me to a more general question about what stoicism itself is. Is stoicism a framework for applying a given ethical/moral code? From what I understand, stoicism is primarily about applying the 4 cardinal virtues, wisdom, justice, temperance, and courage, and 2 of those, wisdom and courage, are based on justice, while temperance and justice are somewhat independent. From there, as I understand it temperance is about doing/acquiring what's needed, not more moving into excess, and not less moving into deficiency. Justice on the other hand seems more general, almost like justice is talking about ethics, and stoicism is a way to apply those ethics while remaining sane and happy in light of all the injustice (unethical behavior) in the world. Does that make sense? Am I missing anything?

To tie that thought back to the question I asked beforehand, it seems to me that stoicism could be lived out using a definition of justice that includes animals as deserving justice, and a definition of justice that excludes animals. Either way, I don't think it would greatly impact the effectiveness of stoicism as a guide for how to live. What do you think? </TEXT>

Wouldn't animals have a similar value due to the fact that they can experience suffering and injustice like us? Why wouldn't kicking a person be just as unjust as kicking a pig, for example? Killing a human for food may be more unjust than killing a cow, but that doesn't mean killing the cow isn't also extremely unjust. If it's not unjust under stoic philosophy, why not? </TEXT>

Can we measure the suffering that would be caused by doing nothing to intervene in the environment vs the suffering of culling/other environmental practices? Should we even bother comparing them or do you think that each individuals rights to bodily autonomy and/or right to life outweigh the suffering that might be caused one way or another?

I've been kind of stuck thinking about this recently, does reducing overall suffering matter more than individual rights? Or is it the other way around? Or, does violating rights inherently cause (or open the door to) a large amount of suffering, which should be avoided even if it causes more suffering in the long run? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I suppose if you're informed about the damage to the environment and the cruelty that goes on in slaughterhouses, and you're ok with supporting that, then I don't think I can really say anything to change your mind. I appreciate your perspective on it though, and I'm glad you've at least thought about it. I suppose I see it like this: the suffering caused by going on a hike (or whatever else) is not a necessary byproduct of my actions, whereas eating meat guarantees that an animal must suffer and be killed. If I was going on a hike and swerving to hit squirrels running across the road, speeding up to hit birds flying across the road, and so on, actively causing and choosing to cause more suffering, then that would be wrong. Now, that doesn't mean I shouldn't be conscious of my actions when they don't guarantee suffering. For example, buying a phone doesn't guarantee suffering, it's entirely possible that the phone manufacturer sourced the materials and labor ethically, paying all it's employees a livable wage and so on, but the chances are that most phone manufactures don't do that, so I should educate myself on that when buying a phone and choose to support companies that do follow ethical guidelines when manufacturing their phones. 

But like you said, where that cutoff of enjoyment vs suffering is may not be the same for you, and it is hard to quantify. The best I can do is give examples of things that don't go too far and things that do


How would you feel about a bear who killed and ate a deer while there was a nearby berry patch? I'm sure that things like this have happened before. I guess it just seems strange to me to expect creatures to choose their food based around the needs of other creatures, rather than for themselves. The act of eating is inherently a selfish one - we all ultimately do it for ourselves. It then makes sense to prioritize your own wants and needs for that particular activity.

If the bear was able to confirm that the berry patch would fulfill his nutritional and caloric needs the same as eating the deer would, then I would think that the bear did something wrong. But, I don't expect it to do the right thing because bears don't have the same cognitive abilities as us. We 1) have the ability to avoid causing unnecessary suffering when we choose our foods, and 2) have the ability to feel empathy towards other creatures and act in the way we'd like to be treated if the roles were reversed, so we should do that whenever we can. 

And I don't disagree it makes sense to prioritize our needs when eating, I don't condemn anyone for eating meat if they'd die without it, but in our day and age where choosing meat vs something else is the difference between a few aisles at the grocery store, that doesn't really apply imo. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm in the us on tmobile, and I'm still debating on getting it, but I think right now I'm leaning towards yes. From what I understand about the bands, the fairphone is only missing 5g bands (a very new technology that's still got some issues, not a big deal to be missing it, it also doesn't work well at long range anyways), and 4g/lte **Band 12** (700 MHz), **Band 66** (Extension of band 4 on 1700/2100 MHz), **Band 71** (600 MHz). Basically, as they state on the fairphone support doc below, 4g won't work in as many places (anywhere band 12, 66, or 71 are the only bands providing 4g/lte), but everything else will work perfectly fine, so 3g and 2g are going to work fine, and 4g/lte on any bands besides those three will also work perfectly fine (so it'll work on **Band 2** (1900 MHz), **Band 4** (1700/2100 MHz), **Band 5** (850 MHz)). 

TL;DR 4G lte won't work in quite as many places, but you'll always be able to call and get data on 3g and 2g like normal.

Here are the sources I based that conclusion on:

 [https://support.fairphone.com/hc/en-us/articles/360032577632-Connectivity-of-the-FP3-outside-of-Europe](https://support.fairphone.com/hc/en-us/articles/360032577632-Connectivity-of-the-FP3-outside-of-Europe)

Take the entire industry, divide it across millions of meat eaters and I am responsible for exactly one portion after it's been divided. 

Good point. But it is possible to prevent causing that portion of the suffering


I could just as easily say "how much suffering needs to occur before your desire to go on a hike is no longer more important"

What do you mean?


Are you asking if I'd like to be eaten? Of course not. But I wouldn't blame a hungry animal for doing so. If I were being eaten by a bear, I wouldn't think that the bear was an evil, horrible, immoral animal who should go eat some berries instead. I would simply fight back as best I could to save my life. And I don't blame animals who fight back either, by the way.

There's a big difference between the choice of a hungry bear eating you and you choosing to eat animals. The bear likely doesn't know where it's next meal is coming from, you come along, and it does what it needs to to survive. On the other hand (I'm going to make some assumptions here, correct me if I'm wrong), you have a reasonable idea of where you next meal is coming from, and it's probably a grocery store or restaurant. Choosing to pick a vegan/vegetarian options instead of meat is likely the difference of simply going to a different aisle and grabbing something else, or ordering an impossible burger over a beef burger (depends on the restaurant, but vegan options are getting easier and easier to find). Like I said in my original comment, there are legitimate reasons not to switch, but odds are they don't apply to you. If you're really in a life or death situation like the bear is, I wouldn't blame you for eating meat either. If you were eaten by a bear for no other reason than the bear liked the taste, I would say the bear did something immoral, but since bears don't really have the same cognitive abilities as us, I won't try to have a conversation with it about the ethics of it's actions </TEXT>

Yes there are edge cases where it's not possible to stop for one reason or another, but chances are that if you're reading this those legitimate excuses don't apply to you, and your taste buds/fashion sense/whatever can't justify what's done to the animals on your behalf </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yup that's fair. It's tricky since they are obligated carnivores, but from what I understand the nutrients that they require from animal products can be synthesized and put into cat food and they can be just as healthy with that, but again I'm no expert, just check out the sources listed here https://www.reddit.com/r/veganpets/wiki/faq </TEXT>

What do you mean by that question? Personally I don't think animals are here for any purpose, and neither are humans (although that's kinda redundant). That doesn't give us a right to cause them (or other humans) to suffer though </TEXT>

<TEXT> Doesn't having kids just increase your carbon footprint because you're just adding on another person's carbon footprint onto your own? Would it be as big of a difference if the carbon footprint of the child wasn't tacked on to the parent?

I agree that people should be having less kids to help the environment, but not having kids doesn't seem like a "change" in the way going vegan or reducing driving is. by going vegan, you were previously actively supporting damage to the environment, and then you stop supporting the damage you previously were doing. With kids though, you're simply not doing anything to harm the environment beyond what you'd already be doing, and then when you have the kid, you begin doing more damage to the environment. It's not like someone with kids can be expected to make the same kind of change someone who's not vegan can make, if that makes sense

Hopefully I'm communicating what I mean clearly.

Tl:dr Going vegan is directly reducing your impact, not having kids is just not increasing your impact </TEXT>

<TEXT> Depends on your insurance, I got mine at around $170 iirc after insurance. Most of that was the procedure,with two small charges to test sperm count after. Depending on how old you are, check out the r/childfree subreddit which has a list of doctors who will do it even if you're young. If nothing else that'll give somewhere to start calling different places to see how much it is. 

After a while, it'll pay for itself since you don't have to pay for as many condoms. Absolutely still should use them to protect against STDs, but if you're with someone you trust and you're both clean then it's a good time. Also make sure to keep using condoms until you've been confirmed to be sterile, after the procedure there are still a few "rounds in the chamber" </TEXT>

If you don't understand how it makes me feel, imagine following a subreddit like this one except it's based in another country and there are pictures of cats and dogs being cooked instead of pigs, cows, chickens, etc. If you wouldn't care if it was cats and dogs then I guess I don't know how to explain how it makes me feel. Whether you understand or don't, I'd appreciate the help finding a subreddit similar to this one without animal products

<TEXT> Exactly. How does that support the idea that they should be followed to find morality?

You're right. I said "I'm against any position that's been arrived at through faith" which like you said is incorrect and I have been moving the goal posts by arguing that faith is a bad way to achieve morality. What I should have said in my original comment (and I'll add an edit to that comment to clarify) is I'm against using faith to arrive at any position. And by faith I don't mean trust (especially trust based on the demonstrated usefulness of any given moral framework), I mean belief despite lack of evidence. Thank you for pointing that issue out.

I agree with the most of what you're saying, and I especially agree that people tend to use texts to excuse their behavior, not influence it. My main point is that if you're going to look for something to excuse your behavior, why not just define how and why you're going to behave for yourself, and cut out the mental gymnastics of making a book fit into that? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I appreciate the response, sorry for taking a while to get back to you.

I'll leave the topic of why the "glorified man" won't sin because I don't think we'll really get anywhere on it. I see no reason god couldn't create man "glorified" from the start, I'm sure you do or believe that god has a reason not yet revealed, so I think it's fair to leave that.

I think you misinterpreted my questions on believing in true or false things for good or bad reasons, which is primarily my fault for not communicating them better. For the first question, I didn't mean is it possible to believe a false thing despite strong evidence against that belief (I agree with your answer to that interpretation), what I meant was is it possible to have strong evidence in support of a false belief, without much evidence against it? The main example that comes to mind for me is an early human, without access to precise measurements or modern mathematics, who likely believes the Earth is flat. There's strong evidence for that belief, from his perspective on the side of a massive sphere it absolutely looks and feels flat, and for him there's not much evidence against it. Maybe he climbs a mountain and sees the curvature of the earth, but without math or precise measurements to test it, the earth being a flat disk still makes more sense for him to believe. 

That relates to the next question as well, say the early human has a friend who had a dream that he was on the moon and saw the earth as a sphere, and he believes his dream to be true. In that case, he believes something that happens to be true, but he believes it for bad reasons. That's what I meant by the second question, is it possible to believe something that's true, but believe it for bad or misguided reasons?

For the second question, I think the examples you used don't quite make sense as beliefs in true things without good evidence. In the case of loving your child, simply feeling that feeling is the test. You feel love for your child, which confirms that you love your child. In the case of getting a new car, you also had good reason to believe the car would work. You've met many people who have bought cars that work, you haven't heard any kind of uproar of people upset that the car they bought doesn't work, you may even have given the car a test drive before buying it or had it checked out by a mechanic. You also understand basic economics, if the car company is selling cars that don't work they'll quickly go out of business, and know that there are laws that can protect you if the car seller doesn't hold up their end of the agreement by providing you with a working car. All of these things culminate as a sort of test, confirming that the car you buy is almost certain to work. Your general sense of trust in humanity is also a test, one you've tested before and has proved to be reliable, and will be tested again when you buy the car. So I think those are both believed with good, reliable reasoning, not just faith.

I don't think we'll get anywhere on the pharaoh topic, I find it abhorrent that the bible would suggest that god hardened someones heart because it removes bodily autonomy and breaks the whole idea of free will down, and without free will many issues with christianity begin to show up. Who else has had their heart hardened by god? There's really no way to know, and the precedent has been set to allow it.

Just because Jonah gave consent to doing god's will before does not mean he must do so again. The idea that god was merciful because instead of killing Jonah he "only" trapped him in a fishes belly for three days until Jonah complied is manipulative and sounds like something an abuser in an abusive relationship would say/do. Jesus chose to suffer, Jonah was forced into it, so I think that's a false equivalency. To be fair, Jesus may have also been forced into it like Jonah was, and it just wasn't talked about in the bible.

That's how I came to faith when I was a part of the church though, so I suppose I was delusional then. After praying and praying for god to reveal himself as you talk about, nothing happened, so I figured I'd stop pursuing a relationship with someone that I can't even be sure exists. After learning more about the issues in the bible as well as the parallels between Christianity and abusive relationships, I'm thankful that nothing happened. But, if it's working well for you then I wish you all the best and appreciate your willingness to discuss it. I didn't really ask any questions this time besides clarifying the two about true/false beliefs with good/bad reasons, so feel free to end the conversation now, or only respond to what you want to. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it's entirely possible to arrive at true conclusions through bad methods. A caveman who had a dream that he was on the moon and saw that the earth was a sphere would be correct to believe it, but his method of determining it is flawed and could easily allow for beliefs in things that are false or true. 

Jesus supported the old testament, so while other religions and sects may invalidate it, mainstream christianity does not. And the point is, the bible is not a properly calibrated moral compass for the examples I used in my last comment. A broken clock is right twice a day, but that doesn't mean I should use it to tell the time. Likewise, the bible may be correct on the golden rule (though the biblical versions has a few nitpicky issues), love thy neighbor, and so on, but it's wrong on slavery, treatment of homosexuals, and treatment of women (an issue still present in the new testament), so it shouldn't be used as a moral compass because it's not properly calibrated. Again, to determine whether specific topics in it are moral or not requires an external guide to morality, so why not just use that directly? </TEXT>

<TEXT> In most situations, no. But, say I'm being attacked and truly the only way to defend myself is to retaliate with deadly force. "Thou shalt not kill" leaves me helpless, so if I was religious I'd likely just ignore that and defend myself even though it resulted in me killing. To arrive at that decision, to ignore the Bible and retaliate with the deadly force required to defend myself, I must've used some other method besides trusting the Bible, so I say we cut out the middleman and use something like secular humanism or utilitarianism or even just plain empathy to guide our morality, since it's likely that that's already being done to some extent anyways. 

On top of that the Bible has laws on how to hold slaves and pass them on to your children (among other things like killing gays or mistreating women), so I don't think using it as a moral compass is a very wise decision in the first place, middleman or not. </TEXT>

I'll give you an example: after leaving Christianity and seeing how it can poison people's thoughts, I feel like Christianity should be outlawed. On the other hand, I don't think it actually should be outlawed, because the downsides of outlawing a religion are worse than the downsides of the religion. My gut/emotional reaction to Christianity is of disgust and sadness, but rationally I know it does help some people and freedom of thought and speech is an important part of society. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [I responded to the same point from someone else here.](https://reddit.com/r/dankchristianmemes/comments/d6cf3q/_/f0um2cn/?context=1) I spent some time on it so I dont want to repeat it here.

Well written response in the other thread, thank you. Let me ask, do you think god has the ability to sin? To do what's wrong in his own eyes? 

But if God is real, then believing in Him would be believing in a true thing and not believing in Him would be believing in false things.  
  
...  
  
This assumes there is evidence now.

Is it possible to believe a false thing and have strong, testable, and repeatable evidence? 

Is it possible to believe a true thing without strong, testable, and repeatable evidence?

Agreed, but your underlying assumption is back to that super position of believing that God is not real. Again, if he is real, then believing in him is dealing with reality directly.

True, I should have worded it better. I think I should add that by reality I mean only accepting that which can be repeatably and independently be tested with consistent results. 

Im going to assume that you are not trying to condescend toward me. The language here is a little vague and could be taken multiple ways.

I'm not trying to be condescending, sorry for the vague wording. I was mostly describing my experience leaving the church in the first sentence and what some christians (myself included, when I believed) had to say about morality and the need for god in the second sentence. To be specific, the line "Without god telling us what's right and what's wrong, there's nothing stopping us from going around killing and stealing." Those who genuinely believe that or something along those lines should 100% believe in God, for everyone's safety. Now though, I prefer using effective altruism and utilitarianism as tools to guide my actions, I find those combined have been very useful in improving myself and from there making the world a better place.

The situation with Pharaoh has a decent explanation here

To address the articles points rapid-fire:

* Just because the pharoah wasn't a good man doesn't mean that when he tried to change or at least do good God should prevent him from doing good.
* Just because the pharaoh hardened his own heart a few times doesn't mean God should harden it for him when he tries to change. Should the DEA give meth to an addict when they try to stop doing meth? 

Do you think god causes people today to do wrong, like he did with the pharaoh?

[Jonahs hand wasnt forced, he was allowed to rebel.](https://www.gotquestions.org/life-Jonah.html) God spoke directly to him, so this isnt a good argument about Gods non-existence either, rather its a great example of Gods patience and mercy.

My point in that scenario wasn't about god's existence either. The point was that even accepting that god exists for the sake of argument, he still forced someone into his presence when they truly didn't want to be there. He trapped Jonah in a fish's belly until Jonah complied. That's not patience and mercy, that's cruel and unusual. 

I want to give you the last response so were not chasing each other. I cant argue you into the kingdom and you cant argue me out. It does come down to faith. So if theres nothing else I can give you, I wish you well and hope the best for you!

Sounds good, I would hope that I could be argued in in light of good evidence, although to be honest I don't think I could ever hold god of the bible in high regard even if I believed he exists. I'll end with this question, is faith a reliable method of determining what is true? Check out street epistemology if you're interested in learning more about that questions or ones like it. I hope the same for you! 

Have a good one as well! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Isnt the answer to this infinity?

Yup, my bad. I should've specified that there's no measurable distance to infinity.

When He made us, we were perfect, with the ability to choose good or evil 

Aren't those mutually exclusive? The way I see it, being perfect is the pinnacle of goodness, it's impossible to be more good than perfect. So saying we were perfect but chose evil sounds to me like making a perfect tallying machine that sometimes displays an incorrect count. It's not perfect. If we were created perfect we wouldn't have chosen evil, but there was some flaw that led us to choosing it.

The conclusion is correct but its based on a false premise: He didnt create something less than infinitely good as I noted above. This is where you split the argument on a false premise. I get that you dont believe, but your positioning of the argument is disingenuous to a Christians position, thereby making it easy to argue against, but at the cost of actually being a good argument.

I'm not sure I understand what you're saying here. As per my above statement, if he created something perfect it would never have chosen evil. If god and his creations (Adam and Eve) were both perfect, but Adam and Eve were able to and did choose evil then all of a sudden there's no guarantee that God isn't choosing evil at least some of the time as well. Although I suppose that's not an entirely surprising conclusion after reading the old testament.

Im fine with that, but ultimately the position produces zero hope for true justice. Never will there be a reckoning for pedophiles, murderers, or the like if God doesnt exist. That doesnt prove Gods existence, but it is a fair point about underlying assumptions and their usefulness.

That's a valid reason to want to believe in god, and I suppose it depends how much you truly care about believing true things and not false things, but until better evidence for god's existence comes to light, I think it's an unhealthy coping mechanism for the realities of the world. It's healthier to accept reality and learn how to deal with it directly, but I understand why many don't. It's tough and scary and can threaten other aspects of their life, upturning deeply held thoughts and feelings. I'll also add the caveat that there are some people who are genuinely better off believing for a variety of reasons.

Is the God described by Jesus the kind that would force out of His presence someone that truly wanted to be there?

To be honest I don't remember much about exactly how Jesus described god besides as his father and lord. What I do know is that Jesus endorsed the old testament, and I wouldn't be surprised if the god described there would do that. Just look at the pharoah who was going to let the Jews leave Egypt until god hardened his heart and delayed their freedom.

Is the God described by Jesus the kind that would force into His presence someone that truly didnt want to be there?

Again, I think so. This time, Jonah is my example. Jonah didn't want to help the Ninevites, and went to great lengths to avoid doing so. His hand was finally forced after being given the choice of death in the belly of a fish or helping them, but even after that he wasn't happy about it and would've preferred god smite them anyways. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is no distance from any number to infinity, because infinity isn't a number, it's a mathematical concept. What it seems to me like you're doing is comparing finite and infinite scales and applying the same thought processes to them, which is not how infinity works. It's fundamentally different. If God's goodness is separate from ours like the sun is to the earth, then our goodness (or lack there of) that deserves hell is still finite, even if the deservingness of hell is almost identical to a serial killers deservingness of hell. 

On the other hand, if God is infinitely good, and we are not, then you would be correct that it would be impossible to compare ours to his. However, I have two issues with that. For one, I don't even think "infinite goodness" is a coherent concept, and two, if God (first of all was demonstrated to exist, but I'll hold off on that for the sake of argument) truly was infinitely good then it would be impossible for him to create anything less than infinitely good. By creating something less than infinitely good, he would become the root source of non-goodness, meaning non-goodness had come from him, which would be impossible if he was infinitely good. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We're naturally able to eat meat, because having that as an option is better for survival, but comparing our digestive systems with other carnivores and omnivores I think it's safe to say meat is not supposed to be a staple in our diets. 

How is paying for or supporting the killing of animals ever ok when there are other options? Do you think it's ok for people to eat dog or cat meat if the animal wasn't killed in cruel conditions?

For the majority of people in the us and Europe I really don't think it is out of there hands. When they go to the grocery store they could just as easily choose to grab a pack of veggie burgers instead of meat burgers or whichever other meat substitute they want, when eating out many restaurants have some vegan option, especially with the beyond and impossible burgers being released in more and more places.

<TEXT> I went ahead and repotted them and I'm really glad I did. The soil was super hard and dense, and the roots were super tangled up and tight. I also moved them under the tree in my yard so hopefully the shad helps them out as well. Thanks for your help! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you for the tip! I repotted them today. These two cacti were completely separate cuttings, but it's a good thing I repotted them because they were so tangled up and root bound, it was awful! The soil was also very hard and packed in, it took me a few hours to get their roots cleaned and separate the two plants, but I'm hoping they'll be a lot happier now! I also moved them to a shadier spot, because I think they were getting a little sunburnt. I'm gonna just leave the knobby tops on for now, I think they should grow fine now that they aren't so jammed up in such stiff, tight soil </TEXT>

<TEXT> r/sanpedrocactus no matter where you are, or r/peyote if it's legal where you live. Those should help you get started. 

Just a note, there's some big drama in the San Pedro community about whether or not PC (predominant cultivar, basically the most common variation) San pedros are strong enough to trip properly. From what I understand, no matter what kind of San Pedro you have, PC or not, as long as you stress it for about a month (such as putting it in a dark drawer in your fridge or closet) before any hypothetical consumption, it'll be just fine. The stress causes the cactus to generate more of the desired alkaloids since they evolved as a defense mechanism </TEXT>

<TEXT> Probably sunburn then if that can do it, I am in arizona so it can get pretty hot and bright and I just assumed since they're cacti they'd be able to take it (I'm fairly new to growing them). Do you think it would be a good idea to move it into another pot, or even just switch out the soil to 50/50 perlite and cactus mix?

My guess about the variable width is the nursery maybe took a top cut, it started to etiolate, and then started growing to normal size again. I wonder when the cut on the side was made though, and if there was any reason for it or not </TEXT>

<TEXT> In terms of scarring, check out these pictures I posted a few weeks ago, the relevant cactus is the one on the left in the first picture: [https://imgur.com/a/gZBrJUS](https://imgur.com/a/gZBrJUS) 

As you can see, it has an odd cut about halfway up it that goes about to the core of the cactus, maybe a little further in. It's had that since I got it though and it seems pretty well calloused. It has looked like it's been getting a little sunburned lately, so I put it in a bit of a shadier spot yesterday, and it was about to rain at night a couple days ago so I brought it in for the night. Otherwise I don't think any of those would apply. Do you think one night inside or getting sunburnt would trigger it? Do you think it would help at all if I took a cutting from just below the scar in the middle and repotted that top cut? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've heard a lot of people say that PC is active enough that if that's all you have access to, it'll still be good enough. The main recommendation I've heard is to put it in a dark drawer in the fridge for a month before any hypothetical consumption in order to stress the plant and cause it to create more alkoloids. I have no personal experience with any of that advice yet though, so I'm just relaying what I've heard

<TEXT> Do you know if grafting affects mescaline content? Or rather, does the fast growth from grafting affect it? I saw someone saying that the main thing that affects it is age, but it seems more intuitive to me that stress would be the primary factor (which could easily correlate with age, especially in the wild), although I have no experience with it and won't for a long time. For example, I've heard for San Pedro putting it in a dark cupboard in the fridge for a month before consumption is supposed to increase the content, wouldn't something similar work for the peyote? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Awesome, thank you! I just ordered some, I won't need them for a while since I'm still waiting on my seeds, but I might as well start growing them now. Do you think store bought cactus potting soil would work for them? 

Also, when I am ready to graft, should I just use the top 3/4 of the seedling? Is there a way to cut it so the root keeps growing independently or does that require the plant to be more mature? And if I let the seedling grow big on the pereskiopsis will a cutting of just the peyote be able to take root in soil again like other cacti can?

Thanks for the tips! </TEXT>

<TEXT> * Need to find a new source of vitamin B12, as well as other vitamins that cannot be derived (at least by humans) in the plants that we eat

Supplements are pretty cheap, and almost every plant based milk is fortified with B12. Or if you don't want to do either of those, add some nooch (nutritional yeast) to your meals and you'll be good then


* Need to avoid crushed up insects some how, that's about impossible with most plants that are grown on the surface.  Gonna need to like potatoes!

Nobody can be perfect. It's impossible to eliminate all death in your food, but if you're really worried about saving as many bugs or plants as possible you should still go vegan so less above ground crops (like grains in animal feed) go towards feeding animals. 


* Need to avoid a large amount of makeup products that use animal parts like fats, crushed up bugs, or animal shit. 

If that's really so difficult then be vegan in every aspect besides that. Still way better than doing nothing


* You are likely to gain weight, especially at the start, unless you are knowledgeable in health science, because the easiest vegan foods to eat are carbs, and it is hard to find all the protein and other nutrition you need through plants alone as a layman. 

What? It's pretty tough to over eat fruits and vegetables, and other vegan staples like beans, rice, lentils, potatoes, etc. As long as you stick to those staples, which are super cheap and staples for a reason, you'll be doing pretty good on nutrition. Also both vegans and non vegans should make sure to follow a healthy diet, not being vegan doesn't just magically guarantee proper nutrition. 


* Need to find money to spend on vegan options, which if you are going true vegan, are more expensive due to A: branding, B: how hard it is to get the material for vegan substitutes, and C: many vegetables tend to not last as long as we'd like, so you better eat them ASAP  

Some of the cheapest foods available are vegan, i.e., potatoes, beans, rice, lentils. It's only really expensive if you're going for imitation meat


* That leads us into the last one, vegan options spoil quickly compared to non vegan options.  Long term vegetable prep on the scale necessary for veganism takes time many people do not have.  You'll need to boil vegetables before you freeze them, and even then it might not work 100% of the time.   Meat in general has months of shelf life if stored in a freezer. 

I'm not sure I've heard of freezing veggies like that, but what's wrong with just using fresh produce? They should still last at least a week or two, and it's not like you need to worry about cross contamination like with meat. In addition, a lot of the other staples I've mentioned have long shelf lives on their own


Sure there are plenty of reasons to want to go vegan, but it isn't a change you can realistically make overnight, or over a week, or a fortnight, or a month or a year... and so on.

Even if you can't switch 100% right away, that's no reason not to do your best </TEXT>

If the person being compared to hitler openly hates a certain race, then it's a fair comparison to make, even if it isn't very effective at changing their mind. With the example of shouting "murderer" outside an abortion clinic, the person shouting that is ignoring the science behind fetal development as well as the ethics behind bodily autonomy, but it's still a valid comparison given ignorance of those things. Being ok with owning a less intelligent (than humans) sentient being as property allows for the valid comparison to owning more intelligent (such as humans) sentient beings as property, even if it's not effective

<TEXT> It definitely is possible to be healthy/strong/muscular and vegan, check out r/veganfitness for some inspiration as well as the [game changers documentary](https://gamechangersmovie.com/) coming out soon on that very topic

In terms of health and fitness I've felt fine, I ate a fairly healthy diet before and after the switch so I didn't notice a huge difference there. With mental health I've actually gotten a bit sadder about the world after learning more about what goes on in the animal industry (check out the Dominion documentary if you're interested in the ethical side of veganism) although I've still been able to work through it just like I was able to deal with other stresses before I switched, so I know I'm still just as capable of coping with stress, I'm just in the middle of working through it right now. I haven't had many issues with bloating, it will take your gut microbiome a little while to adapt to the new diet but it wasn't bad at all.

Vegan restaurants are tricky to find but all the ones I've found so far have some of the best food I've ever had, they always really know their way around food, I'm guessing partly because they want to make a good impression on non vegans who visit. Try googling around for some vegan restaurants near you, I bet you'll be able to find at least one or two. One nice thing about them is I always end up pigging out when I go because they have such amazing food, but I've never gotten that "food baby" feeling like I did when I was a meat eater and ate way too much </TEXT>

<TEXT> The other person who responded said most of what needed to be said, but yeah I eat completely vegan. Tempeh is one of my favorite sources of protein, but the others I mentioned are great as well. I'd highly recommend the cronometer app for tracking things because not only does it track macros, but micronutrients as well, which is useful at least when you're starting out to get an idea of the different types of foods you should eat throughout the day </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well yeah, if you compare mass produced anything to the same thing (or alternative) produced by you, it'll be way more ethical and likely better for the environment. But not everyone can own a farm with a cow, so a more sustainable way to get "milk" to as many people as possible is plant based milks. You could also grow your own soy and make soy milk and that would probably be better than mass produced soy milk too

Even just looking at the system, there's not really any ethical consumption under capitalism, not until every worker is compensated according to the value their work produces. 

unless some major changes happen to our system, it just won't be realistic for people to produce their own food or boycott capitalism, because we live in a society. Just because we can't be perfect doesn't mean we shouldn't do our best </TEXT>

Much cheaper and better for the environment to just use plant based alternatives

<TEXT> I think it's hard for people to have empathy for issues if they weren't raised to. A lot of those people were probably raised in a home where their parents didn't teach them to be empathetic towards the poor. They'll probably think a rich friends falling on hard times is a terrible misfortune that something needs to be done about, but when someone they don't know is stuck in poverty they're fine with it. 

We have the same problem with animals, most people weren't raised to be empathetic towards animals beyond pets, so they'll probably think slitting a dog's throat and eating it's flesh is disgusting and wrong, but they're just fine with doing it to a cow or a pig.

In both cases they weren't raised to even consider thinking about the victims perspective, so why would they? </TEXT>

23 Studies on Low-Carb and Low-Fat Diets  Time to Retire The Fad

How is that relevant? 

Effects of Low-Carbohydrate and Low-Fat Diets: A Randomized Trial

How is that relevant?

I'm not sure how those are relevant because a vegan diet is not necessarily a purely high carb diet or a low fat diet, and weight loss isn't a great measure of success if someone is already at a healthy weight. A properly planned vegan diet would balance fat, protein, and carbs to healthy amounts of each, and contain all essential nutrients supplementing any that are very difficult to get from plants (b12 for example). 


Influence of dietary carbohydrate and fat on LDL and HDL particle distributions

Is this talking about an omnivorous diet? Plants don't make cholesterol, so an even better way to get rid of cholesterol is to not eat it 


Statins Given for 5 Years for Heart Disease Prevention - Do Not Work

If you just take a drug to lower cholesterol but still eat junk food, is it any surprise that just lowering cholesterol wouldn't help? If someone is extremely obese, their heart has to work **hard** 24/7 to get blood to the rest of their body, so is it really any surprise that they still have heart problems? I could be misinterpreting those links though, if the people studied were all at healthy weights then please correct me </TEXT>

If it was shown to your satisfaction that a vegan diet could be healthy and complete, and that the issues you've listed here are not "deal breakers"  (for example, if it was shown that the conversion rate still allows for enough absorbtion to be healthy, high carb/starch diets aren't unhealthy, antinutrients could be worked around, and there were ways to avoid plant oils while being healthy), would you switch? </TEXT>

Trust me, I've started meal prepping and made that mistake by dividing 2 onions into an entire weeks worth of food this week and it's waaaay to onion-y. The core parts of the meal should be things like rice, beans, lentils, quinoa, and potatoes which are all dirt cheap and full of nutrients and protein. Then if you have a little extra cash add a little onion or pepper to spice up the meals. Also get some seasonings which can boost the flavor like crazy for a very low cost per meal </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yup, that was the point I was going for. I think your argument would make sense under two scenarios, if we were obligate carnivores or if we didn't have empathy and moral agency. But the reality is, we can easily thrive on a plant based diet, and we can have empathy and see that causing unnecessary harm is wrong because it's unnecessary. I try not to judge people for eating animals, and I agree the environmental aspect is another powerful argument. I agree with you about being eaten, but if I was eaten by a being that didn't need to and could empathise with me and understand why I wouldn't want to be eaten then I would be outraged until the moment I died

<TEXT> Who said anything about protein powders and supplements for mixing though? Rice, beans, and lentils provide a dirt cheap complete protein source and all 3 are super easy to prepare in bulk and have later. If time and money are your concern, you should be eating a lot of those three foods no matter what kind of diet you're following. Keep in mind beans (and rice to some extent) are a pretty wide category, and they're all pretty cheap, so you can still change things up. 

I agree that perfection may not be possible, but as long as everyone does their best I'm happy. If the true best for you is swapping one meal with something like beans, rice and lentils by meal prepping and being open to learn more about the topic then that's great! Certainly a lot more than many people will ever do for the cause. 


If you don't want a rundown of how I've been meal prepping deal free to skip this next paragraph.

For me, I got some reusable meal prep containers and on the weekend I take about an hour and cook those three staples up and divide them into those containers for the following week. Super easy, and it's a pretty small time commitment considering then I don't have to worry about my lunches later in the week (or dinner if I doubled how much I make which wouldn't impact the time too much). I will admit it really helps that I can borrow some pans from a friend to make all 3 at once, and this is only the second weekend I've done it, but so far it's been awesome! Super convenient and I've been hitting nearly every single one of my nutrient goals or at least gotten close. This week I'm learning from my mistakes last week and actually seasoning my food </TEXT>

<TEXT> What's wrong with mixing? It's good to have a varied diet anyways. I understand not liking the flavor of pea protein, but in my opinion it's worth it to prevent what goes on in the dairy industry. I also understand wanting to avoid soy, I think in moderation it's fine, but not wanting to take the risk makes sense to me. Have you tried seitan? It's not a complete protein, but it's still very protein-rich, and I don't see what's wrong with a diverse diet when it helps save lives. Even if a lb of beans, lentils, and rice isn't directly comparable in terms of protein to meat, that doesn't mean it's bad. I've actually found going vegan has helped me hit my macros and micros because I feel fuller after each meal since plants aren't as calorie dense as meat, so I get to eat a lot more while still hitting my goals (I'm on a cut right now). I'd highly recommend cronometer to track food, since it shows macro and micro nutrient intake, and while micro nutrients aren't quite as important for direct muscle gain/fat loss, they're still very important for a generally healthy diet.

But for the vast majority of people, especially in most of North America and Europe, it's no more than an inconvenience.

Do you have a source about vegan protein being less efficient? Because pea protein isolate is a complete protein source, soy protein (tofu, tempeh, soy milk, soy protein isolate, etc) is as well, and beans, lentils, and rice combine to make a complete protein source. All those are at least comparable to animal products price wise, if not much more affordable. Check out r/veganfitness for some examples of muscle building on a vegan diet, as well as the [game changers documentary](https://gamechangersmovie.com) coming out soon. Tldr, you absolutely can be fit/strong/muscular on a vegan diet. 

How do you determine what is and isn't ethical? </TEXT>

A comment like "56 billion animals killed a year for poor excuses like taste and convenience" would at least directly call people out and make them think about whether taste or convenience are actually good reasons.

Beans, lentils, rice, and potatoes get you almost everything you need, and they can be prepared in some really delicious ways pretty easily!

But everything helps, keep cutting out meat and adding more plant based items to your diet and you'll get there! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Thoughts on this study about the carrying capacity in the US comparing different diets? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2019-07-18 16:42:00 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm not sure if this kind of post is allowed, since I'm already a vegan but I'm just curious what some of you have to think about this study. My first thought after briefly reading through it is that since the study looks at the US as a closed system it misses that some other countries might be able to produce things we need much easier, and vice versa, but I'm interested to hear what you think. 

Edit: another thought of mine is that the vegetarian options it says are more sustainable are only very slightly better than the vegan diet, so as soon as you add in even a little bit of animal ethics it's worth the minor decrease in carrying capacity to reduce the atrocities of the dairy and egg industry

Here's a relevant part of the abstract:

We considered the U.S. agricultural land base and accounted for losses, processing conversions, livestock feed needs, suitability of land for crops or grazing, and land productivity. Annual per capita land requirements ranged from 0.13 to 1.08 ha person-1 year-1 across the ten diet scenarios. Carrying capacity varied from 402 to 807 million persons; 1.3 to 2.6 times the 2010 U.S. population. Carrying capacity was generally higher for scenarios with less meat and highest for the lacto-vegetarian diet. However, the carrying capacity of the vegan diet was lower than two of the healthy omnivore diet scenarios.

<TEXT> That is interesting, I didn't realize that about cars, thanks for sharing! But here's the thing, if cows keep releasing methane then those effects won't just drop like the study suggests since the methane would be replaced as it leaves the atmosphere since there are still cows being bred. But I agree that co2 from cars is still a huge problem, I ride the bus to work to help although I realize that's not even close to the amount of change that needs to happen. But even if I wasn't vegan, I'd still be driving or busing to and from work, so going vegan plus driving is still a net improvement over not going vegan plus driving. Going vegan is far easier than stopping driving so it has a better bang to buck ratio (at least to me), but again both are very important issues. What do you do to help reduce co2 emissions?

I didn't say it was impossible to regulate heme iron, but it is more difficult for the body because heme iron is so much easier to absorb. Why add that extra stress to the body when it's simple to get other sources of iron? I've recently started tracking my diet with cronometer to see how my nutrient intake is and it's trivially easy for me to get plenty of iron. One meal with some lentils and beans got me to 10.5 mg of iron, eating some mixed nuts boosted that by another 5.6 mg (to be fair I ate way more nuts than I should've, so it had a lot of iron), and the recommended daily amount for me is 8 mg. I didn't even have that many lentils or beans. 

I'm ok with not eating a natural diet in order to help the environment and stay in line with my morals. Citation needed on the effects of supplements and the environment, but from what I understand many farmed animals get supplements in their food anyways, so I'd rather cut out the middle man and just take the supplement myself. 

Most of the nutrients listed there can be obtained with a vegan diet or just aren't necessary/are formed by the body. 


My moral code is irrelevant.

It is very much relevant. How can I argue that it's immoral for you to kill animals for food if I don't know your moral code? I can't even argue that it's immoral for you to punch someone in the face for no reason without knowing your moral code. 


As we have covered , your claim of a moral high ground is self fulfilling. This link of self fulfilling proofs are a good example of a guy so absorbed by his philosophy he believes any path to his pre determined end is a good path. Just like the religious.

What? I'm open to changing my morals when they need to be changed. I even did in this conversation (granted it was a small change), so what are you talking about? If I was so absorbed in my own philosophy I'd be trying to convince you to follow my moral code, but instead I want to know yours to see if it's better than mine so I can use it if it is, and to see how you morally justify not going vegan. I don't care about moral high ground (at least I hope I don't), I know I do many immoral things like driving, being rude when I shouldn't, and so on, I have no moral high ground to stand on because I'm on the side of the hill like everyone else, trying to climb as best as I can.

What's self fulfilling about my morals? I have a moral goal that seems best to me based on what I know now, and I use that to determine if something is moral or immoral. If a better goal or even a better way of thinking about morals exists I want to know it so I can improve mine. 

What's wrong with not being completely natural? If I was living completely naturally I'd be in the middle of the woods with a large garden, probably a chicken or two like you've talked about, and a dirt hut, probably with a few other people living the same way nearby. Why should I value living naturally more than I do? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Or you could just make an agreement: In exchange for a guaranteed trash service, you guarantee a plumbing (or doctor, food, education, etc) service for me. 

Again you seem to be stuck looking at it through a capitalist lense, and I understand it's difficult to think about after being raised in a capitalist society but this is fundamentally different. Think about it like a romantic relationship: one couple might always be keeping track of what they've done for their parent and what their partner has done for them, and make sure everything comes out evenly, while another couple might not worry about keeping track of things and just try to make their partners life as good as possible trusting that their partner will do the same for them. Capitalism is like keeping track of what others have done for you and you've done for them with money, communism is like not worrying about the exact breakdown because by improving everyone else's life the best way you can, everyone else improves your life the best way they can.

Note: I don't actually know that much about how these things work so I'm not necessarily arguing that one is better or more realistic, I'm just explaining how I think about it. Please correct my mistakes! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not necessarily arguing for or against it, I was just explaining it as I understand it. 

But I think you're still viewing this through a capitalistic lense, the whole idea is that by everyone trading services, we wouldn't need money for things. By consistently taking out the plumbers trash, the trashman knows that if/when he needs a plumbers help, the plumber will help him. The trashman may not always directly benefit from the plumber, but the plumber would be "trading services" with others as well, so for example a doctor wouldn't be able to hygienically practice without a plumber to make sure the water pipes are clean and a trashman to get rid of the trash as needed, so now the trashman has access to a doctor and a plumber if he needs them, and the doctor has access to a trashman and a plumber if he needs them, and the plumber has access to a trashman and a doctor if he needs them. As you keep adding more and more people, they're all able to support each other. 

So try to think about it outside of the capitalist mindset, and think about other reasons people might be motivated, such as having a thriving community where everyone helps each other instead of only looking out for themselves </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not sure either, but none of the work being discussed would be done "for free" exactly, since doing those shitty jobs would also give you access to other things that you can't do. For example, a garbage collector could "trade services" with a plumber, so the plumber gets their trash taken out and in exchange the garbage collector gets their plumbing taken care of. But then it would become a massive web of other jobs like teachers, electricians, farmers, doctors, engineers, chefs, mechanics, etc, all "trading services" with each other. At least that's how I think about it </TEXT>

<TEXT> cars create much more greenhouse gas warming problem than cows yet vegans drive all the time.

Most vegans would probably drive whether they were vegan or not, so not eating animal products is way better than nothing. "Animal agriculture emits[14.5%](http://www.fao.org/3/a-i3437e.pdf)to[51%](http://www.worldwatch.org/files/pdf/Livestock%20and%20Climate%20Change.pdf)of all human greenhouse gas emissions". I try to cut down on driving but I'm nowhere near perfect, but by advocating for veganism I'm not saying "veganism is the only issue that matters and everything else is irrelevant", I'm saying "veganism is one of many issues that matter a great deal, and also seems to have a large bang for your buck"


Chickens, limited amounts of meat are more than healthy, they are necessary for vitamin b12 and certain fatty acids, it provides a much better form of iron. We can eat a lot less meat than we do but it is healthy to keep some meat in a diet. 

B12 can easily come from supplements, and since many livestock animals get b12 supplemented in their food anyways we can just cut the middleman. Fatty acids can come from nuts and other plant based sources (https://veganhealth.org/fatty-acids/), and heme iron is actually worse because it's harder for the body to regulate. Iron is not that hard to get with leafy greens, beans, and other plant based sources anyways.  (https://veganhealth.org/iron-part-1/)

Studies. Those studies on vegan diets compare average diets to vegans and is a massively biased comparison. It like comparing average fitness of the population to people who practice archery and concluding archery is the healthiest sport.

How do you propose a study goes about comparing them then? Are there any studies that account for the difference in fitness? 

I agree that the first three are not good arguments. You just completely dismissed his claim about eggs and smoking, but he linked a source in the description of the video, do you care to respond to it? I'll copy their interpretation from the abstract for you: "Interpretation: Our findings suggest that regular consumption of egg yolk should be avoided by persons
at risk of cardiovascular disease. This hypothesis should be tested in a prospective study with more
detailed information about diet, and other possible confounders such as exercise and waist
circumference.". I agree it's not an end all be all and he exaggerated the comparison to smoking, but why increase the risk of heart issues when there are perfectly good alternatives? 

https://nutritionfacts.org/topics/eggs/

I'm interested in arguing the moral aspect more as well but as we've discussed I can't do that without knowing about your morals, so I'll ask again: what are your morals or where do you get them? It seems to me that you're avoiding answering this, but I could be mistaken </TEXT>

What do you propose they do instead of euthanizing some animals they logistically can't take in? Also, there's a big difference between euthanizing an animal that has no chance for any sort of quality of life and breeding and raising animals specifically to steal their secretions and kill them. If you truly care about animals, and you really think Peta killing them is wrong, then you should go vegan

<TEXT> Yes, we agree that morals are subjective. I would argue that within any given moral framework, what's moral or immoral can be objectively determined, but that's not really relevant.

I'm still curious, where do you get your morals, or in other words, how do you decide what's moral or immoral and how moral or immoral a given action is? I can't argue that you'd think it's immoral to eat meat if I don't know what your morals are

Dairy I think is still dubious because of the large amounts of methane produced by cows ([http://www-naweb.iaea.org/nafa/aph/stories/story\_methane.pdf](http://www-naweb.iaea.org/nafa/aph/stories/story_methane.pdf) [https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/download/4072/PDF](https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/download/4072/PDF)), but chickens I think can be ethical and environmentally friendly when raised properly though. The issue there, and with meat, is health.

There are quite a few studies on the health benefits of a vegan diet (I don't want to link them all here, but check out the What the Health documentary and the health section here: [https://plantspace.org/facts/](https://plantspace.org/facts/)), but specific to eggs take a look at [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvxcoDapqlM) and the sources in it's description. That channel actually has a lot of great videos on the health of animal products, and I really like it because he always links his sources in the description. I haven't linked him before because I just found out about his channel </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry for taking a while to respond, I've been busy over the long weekend with the 4th.

I'm not really understanding what you mean by saying my morals are shifting, different situations mean that different things become moral or immoral. It would be ridiculous for me to say "all killing is wrong" when that's not the case, there are times when it's justified. Are you looking for some sort of concrete answer like that for my morals? Because I can't give you one then, sometimes things that are normally bad can be good, and sometimes things that are normally good can be bad. In addition, I agree that my moral baseline (or philosophy) is subjective, that's the entire point of it. It can be used in a wide range of situations. 

How do you propose I get my morals if I can't base them on any sort of philosophy?

What does my morals "shifting situationally and subjectively" have to do with you being able to describe your own morals? The reason I want to know about your morals is so I can look at this from your perspective and consider things from that point of view, otherwise my only options are to assume what your views on morality are or use mine. I'd rather not assume your views (and I apologize if I have at any point in our discussion), but using my views is problematic for reasons you've already mentioned. Without knowing where you get your morals leaves me with no choice but to claim moral high ground, because with only my own morals to base this on, that's how it appears to me. It very well could be that my moral view is wrong (and it was earlier, that's why I took out the part about sentience in order to include all life for moral consideration), so I'd like to learn about other ones so I can change mine when I'm wrong. 

I will concede that raising cows and chickens like the examples you used are moral, they bring a net increase in well-being. But realistically, raising animals respectfully like that for entire cities would increase the price of dairy and eggs to prohibitively high costs. Also, I don't think pigs would fall under that, since they're not really milked (maybe I'm missing something?) so only raising them for meat would not be a net increase in well-being. </TEXT>

B12, and that supplementation is very cheap, easy, and effective. The B12 sourced from meat frequently comes from B12 supplements given to the animals, so if you're worried about supplementation not being "natural", you're getting supplemented B12 either way

Do you have a source for this info? I was having a discussion with someone and they wanted me to show that supplementation is actually better (specifically environmentally, so even just a source that shows animals get b12 supplements would work), and I couldn't find any actual sources for it </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ah, I think I see where the confusion about my morals is coming from, I should've explained my moral goal better. My moral goal (after adjusting it to life in general like I mentioned) is to maximize well-being for life. It's intentionally open ended and ambiguous, but that's what allows it to be used in a wide range of situations to gauge the morality of a given action as a function of the net change in well-being of life. For example, if I punch someone in the face for no reason, that would be immoral because it reduces their well-being by quite a bit, and doesn't increase my or anyone elses well-being. But if the person is attacking me, then it becomes a necessity to punch back, because the decrease in well-being from letting the other person attack would be greater than the decrease from defending myself.

In the case of animals, killing an animal greatly reduces their well-being unless, for example, their quality of life is so low that killing them would be the greatest net increase in well-being. Different types of life have different types well-being as well, for example a human has physical and psychological well-being to consider, while most animals have those but they don't have quite as wide a range of psychological well-being and a plant or other brain-less organism only has physical. Using pigs as an example, iirc pigs are about as intelligent as a 3 year old so their limit for psychological well-being would be about the same as the range of psychological well-being a 3 year old could experience. If a fully grown human had the same mental capacity of an exceptionally smart pig, we could say that that human's psychological well-being is very low, even though at that same level the pig's psychological well-being would be high. 

So given that, while I think it's not good to eat plants since it reduces their well-being, the net well-being change of eating plants is a large increase, because while the plant only has a small range of physical well-being to consider, getting nutrients from them greatly increases at the very least our physical well-being, but psychological as well if the food tastes really good, or the nutrients revitalise us putting us into a better mood or something like that. 

This is also why I think necessity is a factor in the morality of eating animals. If there are two options, one being to slowly starve to death and/or live life malnourished, and the other is killing an animal as quickly and painlessly as possible and getting the nutrients you need from that, the net change in well-being is an increase if you eat the animal, because the animal has a smaller range of well-being to consider and slowly starving to death or being malnourished causes a greater decrease in well-being in the long run than the death of the animal. 

I'm not saying I follow this perfectly, in many ways I don't and that's not good (driving a car being a good example you brought up) and in those areas I'm performing immoral actions, but I'd rather have a solid moral view and acknowledge when I do immoral things than have a moral view that justifes all I do. One of the easiest ways I see to greatly increase net well-being is going vegan. I'm not sure about the impact of supplements, but until then I'd still rather not support the dairy and egg industry and the harm they cause to the animals.

For a backyard chicken, I think you're right, again I don't know the exact impact of supplements but it's a fair argument to say that the decrease in well-being for a chicken to have it's egg taken (slightly psychological since it might wonder where it went, and also physical since I believe they eat their unfertilized eggs to regain those nutrients. not certain about that though) is less than the decrease in well-being caused by producing supplements. The problem is I can't have a backyard chicken since I don't have a yard for it, so my choices are buying eggs or supplements, and from what I've seen of the egg industry, the supplement seems like it causes far less harm. citation needed though, which I don't have

You're right about the silkworms, I hadn't thought about it like that before. It seems to me that their range for well-being is pretty low, and raising them for their silk is likely a very small decrease to it anyways, while the increase in well-being we get from silk is not huge but certainly larger than any decrease to their well-being. 

You're also correct about dogs.

I think I know where you're going with cows and pigs, but I'll let you explain it so I don't get something wrong, unless you'd rather me take a stab at it first. </TEXT>

Care to explain what you mean?

Causing unnecessary harm is immoral (it doesn't maximize the well-being of life, in fact it reduces overall well-being), consuming animal products is unnecessary for humans (except for a few exceptions who have allergies, economic, or other legitimate reasons they need animal products), the production of animal products is harmful to the animals, therefore consuming animal products is immoral (again, there are exceptions, but this doesn't apply to the exceptions). 

The environmental argument doesn't necessarily get you to complete veganism, but it does get to greatly reduced animal product consumption. My issue with any animal product consumption is that the way animals are treated in the animal agriculture industry is terrible, so it's immoral to support those industries if there are other options that don't involve harming animals

Supplements are just as good for our health if they account for any nutrients we're missing by eating a plant based diet. I don't think that really needs a source, take any given nutrient and if you get enough of that nutrient from a plant based source + a supplement, how is it different from getting enough of that nutrient from a plant based source + animal products? Either way, you're getting enough of that nutrient, so it's just as healthy. If you think I'm wrong I'm open to being disproven. 

For the environmental impact of supplements, I don't know if there's any research on it so I'm not going to try to argue that it absolutely is better for the environment. What I will say is based on my (limited) knowledge of animal agriculture, I'm pretty sure animals are given supplements too, either in their feed or injections. I'm not certain, so I'm ready to be proven wrong. If they are given supplements, I'd rather avoid the middleman, and even if they're not I'd still rather avoid exploiting them since other options are available to me.

I don't think I ever said the environmental impact of animal products gets you to going 100% vegan, but if I did I'm sorry, I was mistaken. The moral argument does though, and adding on the environmental and health benefits are just icing on the cake if you will </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not sure if there's any research done on that, but that's where the moral argument comes into play. To ethically produce dairy would cost a lot of money, and there is research on the environmental impact of cow milk vs other milks like almond, soy, pea, oat, and hemp milks, and dairy is the worst of them.

Also, supplements are already being given to livestock in their feed. So let's just cut out the middleman (middleanimal?) and get them directly

In addition, this idea that we need animal products is not correct. It makes getting nutrients more convenient, but it's not necessary

Morals

I answered that already, so I'll copy it from my earlier comment: "From what I've seen so far, one of the best moral goals is to maximize well-being for sentient life, so I try to live by that". 

You've pointed out the issue with using sentience as the baseline, so I'll adjust that to be just life in general

**What moral code do you have that allows you justify causing unnecessary harm?**


Im drawing on the biology of our body and the evolution of our species to draw conclusions

I am too, our biology can thrive on a plant based diet, and the evolution of our species of course would favor being able to eat animal products when needed to survive, but it's no longer needed for most people so then it becomes a question of morality. We **can** eat animal products, but **should** we? We **can** destroy our environment, but **should** we? **Where are your morals from that they say it's ok to cause unnecessary harm?**


Sentience

It's sentience + something else, or only something else if sentience doesn't apply. I think the something else is just respect for life in general.

Do you think those single cell organisms can feel pain? 

But later you say whats necessary  . But thats a very arbitrary statement which could take us anywhere from totally omnivorous based on dietary necessity to living on bread water and supplements alone.

Exactly!!! There's no cookie cutter answer! That's what I've been trying to say, it's completely dependent on the situation, if you have the ability to prevent causing unnecessary harm, then you should! But it's justifiable not to prevent it if you wouldn't survive without it. 

But saying that can take you to "bread, water, and supplements alone"  is completely disingenuous, there's a wide range of plant based foods that are available, like rice, beans, lentils, quinoa, vegetables, spices, soy, and so on (and those staples can make some delicious recipes too!), that are all just about on par with bread in terms of preventing harm. In fact they're even better at it since you seem so worried about harming yeast. 


Humans above animals

What are you talking about? **We can analyze whether our actions are moral in a way that dogs and pigs can't. I'll repeat, if you disagree then I'm open to changing my mind if you can back it up with evidence.** Because we can determine if our actions are moral, and we can choose to make more moral decisions, why wouldn't we? 

I feel like I'm repeating myself a lot here, and at the start of our conversation you rightly pointed out my use of sources that weren't ideal, so now it's my turn to call you out: be careful that you read my responses to your points and try to understand why I think about this the way I do. Don't forget that only a few of my questions have been rhetorical and there have been several times I've asked for sources or reasons why you think what you're claiming, such as why you think the vegan diet will cause more damage or info on the environmental impact of supplements, and you haven't responded to them. I know I've gotten a bit more snippy and sarcastic in this and my last comment because from my perspective it seems like you haven't responded to several of my questions, and I apologise for that. 


Animal populations

**Why isn't the default for consent no when it involves animals?** I'm gonna use the dairy industry as an example, but this applies to others as well. A cow can't really give a direct answer to questions like "do you want to be kept on a cycle of pregnancy and have your baby taken from you hours after birth so we can take the milk that was meant for your baby and sell it?" so why wouldn't we assume no? We assume someone doesn't consent to sex when, for example, they're too drunk to make an informed decision, but we assume they do give consent to medical assistance when they're passed out. This is because sex is not in their best interest by default, but medical attention is. In the same way, the actions of the dairy industry are not in an individual cows best interest, so we should assume they don't want things not in their best interest done to them. 


No, reproduction is a good thing because it passes on genes.

It's a good thing *for evolution*. That says nothing about if it's good for the individual doing the reproducing. **Why do you care more about evolution than an individual?**

A lion is an obligate carnivore (there's that necessity idea again!) and can't analyze the morality of their actions in the way we can. </TEXT>

Animal populations

Hold on just one minute. Evolutionarily speaking, reproduction is a good thing and not passing on genes is bad. If you're looking through that perspective, then the animal agriculture industry is great for passing on cow/chicken/pig/etc genes! That does not mean it's great for the individuals within the population though, and I care about the members of any given population far more than whether or not they get to pass on their genes. For example, if you're using that lens then raping women who don't want children would be good because otherwise they wouldn't pass down their genes, so really you're doing them a favor! That's an extreme example, but the point is passing on genes/keeping a population around doesn't make something moral. Especially when the process exploits the members of the population. 


Sentience

Did I ever say the sentience argument was gone? It's still very much here for the animals it applies to. For the ones it doesn't, such as bugs, I suppose it comes down to whether they can feel pain. I'd also just prefer not to harm (relatively) large autonomous multicellular organisms since they tend to seem to have at least some awareness of the world around them. 

So yeast is less deserving because it doesn't have a nervous system of any kind (as far as I know). 

Are you seriously asking why not plants? Even if we do assume plants can feel pain (even though they don't have a nervous system), being vegan still minimizes the harm done because then animals aren't also eating plants. Remember what I've been saying about necessity? Plants are the minimum necessity for humans, so it's morally justifiable to eat them because it's a necessity, while eating animal products is not necessary, harms animals, and harms more plants than a vegan diet. That's why a plant is "less deserving".

I suppose a better metric than sentience is ability to feel pain, another metric is that given the option of causing harm or not causing harm, I'd rather not cause harm if I don't need to. Just like I'd rather not chop down a tree if I don't need to


World hunger

Have you not been listening to what I've been saying? **If it's not possible for someone to go vegan, it's morally justifiable for them to consume animal products because then it's actually a necessity.** We have not established a need for animal products for vitamins and minerals, they can be produced in factories without harming animals. Again, that's not possible for everyone yet, but **if it's not possible for someone then it's morally justifiable for them to consume animal products**.

Do you have any sources on how much those different supplements actually impact the environment? I'm genuinely curious if they're as big an impact as you're trying to make them out to be. 


We are not pigs or dogs

How am I placing humans above animals? We can analyze morality and the harm our actions cause to other animals (human or otherwise) in a way that animals can't. If you disagree I'd love to be proven wrong. Because we can see the incredible harm our actions cause, and we can do things to greatly reduce it, why wouldn't we want to reduce it? 

How does a vegan diet cause more problems?


it does no good for feeding a hungry world and it is environmentally questionable. 

Citation needed. So far all the research I've seen points to a vegan diet being able to feed more people by cutting out the middleman (animals) of our food chain, and it's well established that a lot of energy is lost at each stage of a food chain. 

"Replacing all animal-based items with plant-based replacement diets can add enough food to feed 350 million additional people, more than the expected benefits of eliminating all supply chain food loss."

These animals must be farmed and cared for ethically and with respect, usually , if they are not , they are less productive and so the symbiosis is somewhat compromised.

This is just incorrect looking at what goes on in the dairy and egg industry though. Male chicks are useless to the egg industry so most of them are killed shortly after hatching. Dairy cows are kept on a cycle of pregnancy to ensure they keep producing milk. That's worse for the animals but better for "productivity" 

I don't particularly care about keeping those animal populations large, I care about the treatment of the individuals within those populations. And companies have an abysmal track record of being ethical when the wrong thing is easy and makes more money


needs to be balanced against the respect for humans as sentient beings and the very hungry and malnourished world we live in.

You mentioned starving humans in other places as well, but this fits for most of them: If you're worried about world hunger, then you should go vegan. Then instead of growing tons of crops to feed animals, we could cut the middleman and feed humans directly

Silkworms making silk, insects making protein meal, insects may not be considered so sentient too. Molluscs such as squid , snails and octopus, we know octopus are the highest form of mollusc but is it sentient to the same extent as a horse?

Right, that's why I try to avoid silk, only get my protein from plant sources, and I don't consume molluscs or their products (at least I don't think I do. If you know some common things they produce that I might be missing let me know)

To guarantee that we're not causing any stress to chickens, we could just not eat them or steal products of their reproductive system and let them live their life in forests like they evolved

And what about our evolution as omnivores, we dont criticise the dog , a carnivore for eating meat. Or the omnivorous wild pig , why should we be guilty of behaving as our nature intends.

Because we're not dogs or pigs. We can also digest human meat, why shouldn't we "be allowed to fulfil our potential as omnivores" and eat humans after they die? Because we don't need to, so it's disrespectful to the deceased. Now, if we're in a situation where the only way to survive would be cannibalism, then it becomes morally justifiable, but the fact is most people are not in that situation with human meat or animal meat, so more justification than "it's a convenient way to get nutrients" is necessary. If we have the option to get those things outside of animal sources then we should do that to benefit the animals and the environment </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for the links! I really need to compile or find a list of references from reputable sources, because I feel like every time I get into these conversations I regoogle everything and get sloppier and sloppier each time. I agree confirmation bias is dangerous, it can be easy to slip into. 

The reasons to go completely vegan are more about ethics and the environment. Personally, I don't see a problem with having chickens as pets and eating any eggs they happen to lay, but that's not realistic for every single person. So then we get factories to keep all the chickens in, and that's where the problem comes in, either the eggs from a farm that raises all it's chickens like pets would be super expensive, or costs would be optimized which would lead to poor treatment of the animals. 

I'm aware that not everyone can go vegan, but if everyone went vegetarian like that, it would be a great improvement on the current state of things. There's a fair argument for only going vegetarian, but eating meat is flat out wrong for most people at this point (yes, there are exceptions, but they're in the minority)

The reason to use alternatives is because having alternatives removes the necessity of using animals for nutrients. If it's truly necessary to take resources from animals, then it's morally justifiable, just like cannibalism is morally justifiable if it's truly necessary. So for people in India who can't afford supplements then it's completely justifiable to take milk and eggs from animals, because they truly do need it to get proper nutrition.

Consider this, if aliens came to Earth and they needed to eat humans or human byproducts like our milk, would you be ok with them farming those things from us? What if they had the technology to create alternatives but it was closer to their nature to get them from animals like us?

I've been trying to decide what rye to get next, but it seems to me that a lot of people don't really like those flavors so when they say X is a great rye, they're actually saying it's lacking those flavors, as if it's as close to a non-rye as a rye can get. At least that's what it seems like after watching reviews on some of them and looking up tasting notes, I could be wrong though since I haven't actually tried any of them

Anyways, do you have any recommendations on some really rye ryes? Something that truly showcases the genre as opposed to being a good start for someone looking to ease into the different taste? I haven't tried any peaty whiskeys, but I've heard that there are some pretty mildly peaty ones and then there are some that slap you upside the head with peat, I'm looking for rye that slaps you upside the head with the fact that it's rye, if that makes sense

<TEXT> You can get those from plant based sources, but I will admit it is harder. Personally, I prefer to just take a supplement than have to kill or exploit an animal, or track my daily food intake to make sure I get all the necessary nutrients. 

The reasons I'm fully vegan vs vegetarian +dairy or +eggs are multifaceted. I originally went vegetarian because the meat industry is terrible for the environment, but still ate dairy and eggs because they aren't as bad for it. But then after an argument with my family about how I get morality without God I looked into the ethical side of things and realized I couldn't stay morally consistent and not go vegan. From what I've seen so far, one of the best moral goals is to maximize well-being for sentient life, so I try to live by that. By supporting the terrible things that go on in the [dairy](https://freefromharm.org/dairyfacts/) and [egg](https://freefromharm.org/eggfacts/) industries, I was greatly reducing the well being of those animals while only getting a slight increase in well being from consuming their products. So while they may not be that bad for the environment, I couldn't stay morally consistent and continue buying those products. Finally, the downsides in health are only about concerns of getting all the necessary nutrients so I take a daily vitamin to cover my bases, and there are several health benefits like reduced risk of cancer or heart disease. 

Hopefully that shed some light on the topic and didn't seem too pushy. nobody's perfect, I don't even come close to doing everything I could do to help the environment or "improve the well-being of sentient life" , but I found going vegan has the biggest bang for it's buck, so I decided to focus on that as a first step </TEXT>

I agree that when it's a matter of life and death, it's morally justifiable to eat meat, in the same way that cannibalism is when there's literally no other way to survive. But the science shows that it's possible to get all necessary nutrients without animal products

I do appreciate the effort you've put in already! And it may not seem like much, but every bit helps! If you switch, your friends and family might see the benefits and switch as well, but if you don't then they may never really think about it, and companies will keep up their awful practices as long as people will pay for them and it makes money. it really is up to all of us to put down our foot, vote with our wallets, and say "no, I don't support what's happening to these animals" </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just because animals do something (especially those that literally can't survive without eating meat), does that make it ok for us to do even when we don't need to? Other easy ways to get iron are to eat more [iron rich](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/iron-rich-plant-foods) foods or even just take supplements. That way you get all the iron you need without having to kill an animal. It can definitely be hard to stop, but do you think an animal deserves to die just because we can't break a deeply ingrained habit?

I really appreciate that you're already trying to cut down on meat though! Every step helps </TEXT>

<TEXT> Several times now I've texted my girlfriend and she hasn't gotten any notifications on her phone or laptop. Usually they work, but sometimes they just don't or the messages will be marked as read even if she hasn't seen them. I was kinda skeptical and figured maybe she just had notifications disabled or something, but she said she usually does get them and then the other day we were Skyping and I had to send her something, and she didn't get any notifications for it in her phone or laptop

Any tips on how to fix it? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I will say that after thinking about it a bit longer, I don't think taxation consent the way I talked about it would actually be enforceable in a realistic way, so I'm not sure about that one. But that also isn't a violation of bodily autonomy the way a draft or vaccination is. 

That's also a good point on the gift analogy, I hadn't thought about it like that. I will say that if the person having the child knows they have a high chance of passing on a major condition, then it no longer falls under a gift or wanting the best for their child.

Yup, that sub has a lot of questionable views on it, but I do think the underlying question is one worth giving a lot of thought, especially before having kids. It should also bring up other questions for the potential parent, such as "why do I actually want a kid?" and they should really consider the implications - for them, the child, and the world - of their answer </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm against a draft that forces people to fight without their consent. That's violating pretty basic bodily autonomy which is wrong in my view. Vaccines should also need consent, but we do need better education on the topic for the uninformed. If someone doesn't consent to taxation then they shouldn't get the benefits of what those tax dollars fund, but it should still be an option for them.

The gift argument is decent, but I don't think it applies in the same way. If you hate a gift, it's still legal and possible to get rid of it right away, whereas with life if the new person hates life they won't really be able to express it for a few years, or do anything about it for a few years after that. 

But yeah that last argument is rock solid and there isn't much to be done about it unfortunately </TEXT>

I would imagine given the commonly understood definition of the term that it varies greatly by species, and that for some the answer would be "yes" and for others "no," though none have sentience that is comparable to what humans possess. 

That sounds about right to me. 

I'm not a Jainist, and therefore do not believe that preventing the harm of all living things is morally necessary

Do you think preventing harm is morally good?


I don't want to live in a world where man-made technology has the same rights and legal status as the population who created it

I think that should be another reason people are very careful about making any sort of ai, but this is where necessity comes into play. If the ai is a threat, then it would become morally justified to kill it or deactivate it or whatever needs to be done, in the same way that punching someone in the face becomes morally justified once they're attacking you. 


What commonality do I have with a bear that would like to eat me and cannot be reasoned out of doing so?

A desire to live and not be harmed, but killing or harming the bear becomes a necessity once it starts trying to eat you, and would therefore be morally justified


Communities have common interests and understandings, and develop a shared framework for coexistence. How is that supposed to be possible with pigs or ducks?

There may not always be a common understanding between all animals, but they do have the common interest of wanting to live without being harmed and a shared framework evolves in ecosystems, which is why invasive species have such a big impact on ecosystems. I think a framework we could develop with pigs and ducks wouldn't be as intricate as a framework between humans, but something as simple as "We won't kill or harm you unless necessary if you don't kill or harm us unless necessary" would work. 


Animals are property, and I should not care how an animal's owner uses it any more than I care what they do with their homes or their antique silver.

If you were walking down the street and you saw someone kicking and beating their dog, would you just shrug and say something like "oh well, it's not my property being damaged"? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really appreciate that you've thought about this and aren't just giving generic excuses, it's very refreshing and I haven't thought about it like that before. 

I would argue that we give rights to the severely mentally handicapped and small children because we recognize that even though they're not as capable or intelligent as most other humans, they're still sentient. Which is to say, they can experience pain and joy, they can interpret information from their senses and respond accordingly, they can develop relationships, and they can have desires. All of those are present in the human groups we've talked about to a lower degree than average, but they're still present and we still respect that. Most animals (especially mammals) also demonstrate those aspects of sentience, which has been tested but can also be seen on subreddits like r/likeus, even though they don't demonstrate them to the same level the average human does.

As for the braindead or those with a condition that has no cure and leaves the patient with something like chronic pain or even just a terrible quality of life (advanced Alzheimer's for example), I would argue that euthanasia should be an option for the patient if they're able to make that decision or for the family of the patient to make in the patients best interest, provided there are rules and regulations in place preventing abuse. 

Do you agree that animals are also sentient? If not, why not? If so, why do you place moral weight on being human/respecting someone's membership of the human race as opposed to something more abstract like sentience?

Why don't you count other species, especially the ones we eat, as among the most vulnerable in the community of life on Earth and not deserving antagonism from us? </TEXT>

Animal suffering is not something I regard as being of moral consequence, and therefore it doesn't inform my purchasing decisions.

at least as a global truth

I don't think anyone's arguing it as a global truth. The primary animals that we eat are mammals and birds which we know can feel pain, and the main reasons not to eat animals that can't are the environmental impacts of eating them, it takes a lot of resources to get them and can also lead to some major issues like overfishing. 

Even without government action, why don't you think it's better to reduce suffering of animals that we agree can suffer by just not buying them? It's supply and demand, if you demand ethical food, companies will make more of it which will lead to it costing less as it gets more popular. For example, imitation chicken is already pretty damn close to the real thing, so by limiting real chicken and supporting imitation, it'll get cheaper and easier for the poor to access as well. Many vegan foods already are more cost effective than animal products anyways, like beans, lentils, rice, etc., And also frozen vegetables, so why not save money while reducing suffering?

I understand that your compassion is finite, but it really doesn't take much to switch to vegan options. All it takes is moving over a couple of feet at the grocery store before picking up some food, or ordering a slightly different option at a restaurant (most have some really delicious vegan options now, to the point where I'm starting to have to actually think about what I want again, which is actually kinda annoying cause all the options look so good).

Also keep in mind that slaughter house workers are often poor and have no other option but to work in them, and getting issues like PTSD is not uncommon. So going vegan is an easy way to reduce demand for human suffering in that regard as well (https://www.texasobserver.org/ptsd-in-the-slaughterhouse/ https://mercyforanimals.org/slaughterhouse-workers-have-ptsd-from-killing)

Not to mention that the meat industry is terrible for the environment, so by contributing to that you're contributing to the suffering of humans, especially the poor who will be most impacted by climate change

There's no reason not to do something about all animal suffering (including humans), so I'm curious, what do you do to help reduce human suffering? I'd love to do more about it as well, so what are some tips on how to be truly compassionate (in the way you use that word) to others? </TEXT>

<TEXT> The problem is, affirming incorrect thinking sells big (also see megachurches), so under our current system there's very little incentive for those who can make the biggest impact to actually do anything. There's not much we can do besides raise awareness and vote with our wallets, but that can be really hard especially for those without the resources to do so </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly the whole straw thing makes me pretty mad. The impact it has compared to things like going vegan is so small. Yes, every bit helps, but it's the law of diminishing returns, and if we're gonna be making laws and raising awareness for things like that we should be cutting subsidies for animal agriculture or banning  non-recyclable plastic in general instead </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm looking to get some sunscreen to wear going to and from work (I walk outside in Arizona for about 45 minutes total each day) but I can't stand the way sunscreen, or at least the sunscreens I've used, rubs off after a bit. What usually happens is a little while after applying I'll scratch an itch which collects a bunch of sunscreen under my fingernail. After that I can't resist rubbing off the rest of the sunscreen, it just feels so satisfying and my skin feels a lot cleaner afterwards without a layer of sunscreen on it

Are there any sunscreens that don't do this? I usually buy the 30 spf no-ad brand </TEXT>

<TEXT> How do you justify eating meat if you care about animals and don't want them to get hurt? Especially from fast food places where it's guaranteed that the last thing on their mind is "ethically" sourcing their meat? (I think any unnecessary killing is wrong, but oftentimes people use "killing humanely" as an excuse to keep eating meat, which doesn't really apply if the animal doesn't want or need to die, but anyways it definitely doesn't apply for fast food chains)

<TEXT> I would argue that heart disease and, depending on the type of cance like lung cancer from smoking, cancer are both self inflicted death causes. You can choose to eat a healthier diet to prevent heart disease and avoid known cancer causing substances like tobacco, but if someone decides to shoot up a mall that you happened to be at, you have zero control over that. So I think it's more about preventing deaths that aren't at some level the fault of the person doing the dying, if that makes sense.

If feeding the majority of the population is your goal, you should be encouraging people to be vegan

you've probably thrown these same tired old arguments around a million times already

r/selfawarewolves the fact is, environmental science, health science, and ethics all support veganism. The only "tired arguments" are the ones being used by people trying to justify eating meat. Yes, there are people with different legitimate reasons not to go vegan, but they're in the very small minority and actually have good reasons.

I can't just let people eat whatever they want when there's a victim involved, which there is no matter how you look at it when you consume animal products. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Plants are also incredibly nutritious, and livestock farmers are making money from the unnecessary cruelty and death of animals, so I would rather them make a living without exploiting animals or harming the environment. 

being against eating meat is pro health, have you researched the health problems introduced by meat vs the lack of problems, and many benefits, from a plant based diet? It would be worth your while if you're looking to learn more


You clearly care more about your beliefs than about actual sustainability.

<TEXT> That's great, and I'm glad you're doing your best! If you're thinking where I'm going is that going vegan is the best way to reduce deforestation, and that a large amount of plastic pollution comes from the fishing industry, then you'd be right

Every step helps though, and while going mostly vegan does quite a lot to help, at least for me the ethical side of not wanting to kill animals who don't want to die and who don't need to die is what really drives home going 100% vegan for me </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wouldn't animal waste have similar pathogens? I really don't know much about fertilizers and how they work, but couldn't compost be another good alternative? 

Here are some links I found after a brief search

https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2013/05/07/182010827/is-it-safe-to-use-compost-made-from-treated-human-waste

Both seem about 50/50, with more research needed to get a better idea of if it's good or not

Here are some other articles about it:

https://milkandeggs.com/blogs/food-health-and-eating/the-10-most-eco-friendly-foods (obviously I would argue against the cheese and fish on this list)

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004896971732538X

<TEXT> Can you elaborate a bit on that? I understand that a lot of times vegans (myself included) can get very confrontational and outright mean to non vegans, but the reason is because it's really frustrating seeing people ignore facts and studies like these. Health science and environmental science all favor veganism, and reasonable ethics that take animals into consideration (like thinking animal abuse is wrong) favor veganism as well. So when all these things are shouting "go vegan if you care about your health or the environment or animals!" and people ignore that with things like " but bacon though" or "lol that's my cue to unsubscribe" it can be really tempting to just dismiss those people as ignorant idiots who hate the planet. That's not what nonvegans are in reality of course, but that's how it can come across unfortunately

Even if you don't change your mind or anything, I hope that at least sheds some light on why some vegans act the way they do. If you want a great example of a vegan activist, check out earthling Ed on YouTube. He's really kind, patient, and gentle with the people he's taking to, and is absolutely worth watching </TEXT>

I think having no animal products will make things much better for the poor, since crops are a lot easier to grow cheaply, and at this point a lot of poor people, especially outside the us, can't eat meat anyways since it's more expensive. rice, beans, quinoa, lentils, and other staple foods like that are some of the cheapest foods you can find, and are all really healthy and plant based </TEXT>

What part is expensive? Because while meat substitutes are often expensive, things that are already vegan like rice and veggie stir fry, quinoa, beans, etc. are usually pretty cheap. Plus, by asking for those options you're creating market pressure for them. So while it'll probably suck for you being an early adopter in your area, it'll pave the way for others to switch more easily </TEXT>

Yes I agree the ecosystems that have been cleared out are awful for the environment, but the only way to get them back to their natural state is not too keep eating meat and keep the demand for destroying habitats high, but to stop so the fields are allowed to go back to their natural state because they're not needed anymore

How do you humanely kill an animal that doesn't want to die?

Even if not everyone on the planet can or will go vegan, that's no excuse for you not to.

<TEXT> Eating meat is not necessary for humans to thrive, in fact many people are much healthier with plant based diet. Especially in our society, where we have plenty of plant based options to choose from, eating meat is not a need. From what I've seen, the main reason besides nutrition (which can just as easily come from plants) that people continue to eat meat is taste and convenience. 

In my opinion, taste and convenience aren't much more worthy of killing a living thing that wants to live than likes on social media. Adding on the fact that the dolphin likely died more from people's ignorance and selfishness, whereas the meat industry is a massive industrialized system made specifically to kill as many animals as it can, destroying the environment in the process, and I don't know how you could be upset at this and still eat meat </TEXT>

<TEXT> Methane isn't the only reason the meat industry is bad for the environment, simply the fact that it takes several times more resources to get meat is a huge part of it.

But we're not bears. We can study and research and find out that a vegan diet is just as, if not more, healthy for humans than an omnivorous diet, and therefore it's not a necessity for us to eat meat. From there we can use our moral agency, which a bear doesn't really have (at least not nearly to the level we do), and see that an unnecessary death is immoral

Putting down a dog because it's too sick is different, because then it's done in the dogs best interests. Killing a cow because it tastes good and makes it slightly more convenient to get nutrients is not done in the cows best interest, and killing without need is immoral in general

Even if you don't change your mind on eating meat, would you at least avoid eating meat from factory farms, and research where you're buying your meat from before eating it? If it truly disgusts you, you should do everything you can to vote with your wallet against it </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not referring to the end results though, I'm referring to the motivation and justification of the actions, and highlighting parallels of two different immoral actions, one of which is worse than another, because both can be wrongly justified with the same faulty reasoning of saying "I enjoy it". There are other reasons used to justify eating meat or rape, but this specific one is flawed because it doesn't take into account the victim in the situation

Rape and eating meat have completely different consequences as well. Rape causes lasting emotional, psychological, and possibly physical damage (and I'm sure other harms that I don't know about), while eating meat causes huge environmental issues and unnecessary death. So it's like comparing apples and oranges, but the similarity is that a possible justification for both is that the person doing the action enjoys it and values that enjoyment more than the consequences. 

To be clear, I'm not saying this is the only justification used for either or trying to equate them, I'm just trying to point out the flaws in the specific justification of enjoying it too much to stop. </TEXT>

Withiut that as a driving force, the life would not exist to be extinguished.

Is that a bad thing? With the environmental impacts of the meat industry and farm animals in general, we should be minimizing that population 

I'm glad you're at least making sure your meat was raised well, even though it's still unnecessary death it's better than nothing. 

I have eaten meat that I kissed in life.

How would you feel if you were in that animals position? It reminds me of the [twilight zone episode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Serve_Man_(The_Twilight_Zone\)) where aliens visit, give humans advanced technology and improve life for humanity in general, but in the end are still going to eat them </TEXT>

<TEXT> Do you think there's a humane way to kill when the death is unnecessary?

Obligate carnivores (who literally cannot survive without eating meat) are different. This is where necessity comes into play, since we don't need meat then eating meat is unnecessary for us. I think killing unnecessarily is wrong, so I think humans eating meat is wrong when they have other options. We also have alternatives to those animal products you mentioned, our survival doesn't depend on them anymore

If you use the word slave like that then sure, we're all slaves in some sense, but to spell out the point I was trying to make a bit more clearly I could go out, kidnap someone, and whip them until they do what I want, but that doesn't mean it's moral. In the same way, I could go out and have an animal killed unnecessarily for me to eat, and I'd be able to digest it just fine, but that doesn't mean it's moral either. 

You could also thrive on a plant based diet, why does it need to have animal protein in it for you to order it? 

As a human, I'm allowed to make that choice,

But when there's a victim, some of the possible choices become immoral. As the saying goes, "your right to swing your fist ends at my face". It's morally acceptable to swing my fist around, but as soon as it unnecessarily connects with a person or animal, it becomes immoral

Right, which is why we should stop breeding these animals so much in order to reduce unnecessary death and suffering.

One last thing to add, I do appreciate that you at least want to give the animals a good life before killing them, but when you buy meat (either at a store or restaurant) do you actually make sure they were raised the way you're talking about? Even if you continue eating meat, I'd encourage you to vote with your wallet on the way you want the animals you eat to be raised </TEXT>

<TEXT> What do you mean when you say "humane"? 

We're omnivores in the sense that we can digest meat, but does being able to do something morally justify it? It's also possible for us to own slaves, but that doesn't mean it's morally acceptable. 

It's not "necessary" to keep animals for eating because we can survive on a vegan diet, which means eating animals is by definition unnecessary, especially since in most of Europe and North America choosing to eat vegan is as simple as moving over a few feet at the grocery store before grabbing food, or ordering something one or two spots down the menu at a restaurant. 

You do your thing, I'll do mine.:)

I submit that because a victim is involved, the enjoyment is not justifiable unless the victim gives consent, or there is an actual necessity (life or death) to do it

<TEXT> Ah I see what you're saying. So instead of using the resources to run sanctuaries, use it to buy land being used as pasture and restore the natural habitat? 

I think the reason for these kinds of posts is to get people to stop eating meat, in an "animals are friends, not food" kind of way. If people see cows as a cute animal they'll be more likely to stop eating them, which imo is more important than restoring natural habitats at this point in time. Obviously restoring them is important, but it's very difficult if economic pressure is favoring the continued use of that land as a way to get burgers. So the idea is first stop people from eating meat, and then once that land goes unused more and more it should be easier to start restoring it's natural state </TEXT>

<TEXT> I understand why you think we should do that, but in the reality we live in getting the planet to go vegan will take a long time, with plenty of time for the cow population to shrink as demand goes down. The reason people aren't trying to make a plan for what to do if the whole world suddenly goes vegan is because that's so unlikely to happen. Instead we're planning for what will likely happen which is that slowly more and more people will go vegan, and as demand for animal products goes down, farmers will be forced to not raise so much livestock. 

I think that if the entire world just went vegan in a day, the best thing to do may very well be to kill a lot of the cattle, since taking them all to a sanctuary would be way to costly and the side effects of just leaving them could be big (although I don't know enough about it to say for sure). But let's be realistic here, in the world we live in where veganism will be a slow process, taking the small handful of animals that escape from farms, neutering them, and letting them live till they die naturally is the most ethical thing to do </TEXT>

<TEXT> But by eating fish, you're paying for fish to be killed. While I understand that torture can be worse than death, that doesn't mean they're not both wrong. Do you think the fishing process is a walk in the park for the fish (not to mention the environmental impact of overfishing)? Also keep in mind, necessity makes a difference. The reason I think it's wrong to eat fish in places like North America and Europe is that we have so many plant based options that fish is unnecessary, so eating fish is killing unnecessarily which I think is wrong </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes that's a big problem, but a majority of the crops we grow go towards feeding animals. So by not eating meat you're helping make a dent in that problem as well, and as easily as move a few feet over and grabbing vegan/vegetarian foods at the grocery store

Edit: Also, it depends on how you think about morality. To me, my moral goal is to maximize well being, and since death lowers well being, it needs to be balanced so the death is outweighed by it's purpose. Since in our society it's possible to live on a plant based diet, eating meat doesn't offer any benefits that outweigh the death (or suffering in life) of the animal that the meat was taken from. So the way I see it, it is immoral to eat meat </TEXT>

<TITLE> Set a default bang? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2019-05-18 17:30:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've looked around on this sub a bit and found people asking similar questions but not ones quite the same as this one, so please hear me out.

I'm looking for a way to set a default bang if you will, because of the way Action Launchers new action search feature works. If you pay for the upgraded version of action search, you can choose to use other search engines besides action Launchers default, but my preferred search engine (https://www.ecosia.org/) isn't an option. I have it set to duckduckgo, because that's my second choice of search engine.

Now here's where the issue is, when I search something from Android's search bar it opens my browser searching for whatever with the selected engine, in this case duckduckgo. I'd like to change duckduckgo to use !ec as it's default bang, so it uses ecosia when I search from the search bar, since I already have ecosia set as the default engine in my browser

Is there any way to do that? I'd really appreciate the help! </TEXT>

<TEXT> To add to that, prioritize things that will have the greatest impact for the lowest cost. For example, going vegan has the cost of doing a little bit of research to make sure you get all the necessary vitamins and minerals and then choosing to buy a different food at restaurants and the store, and it's one of the biggest things you can do to reduce your environmental impact. It's often cheaper to do that too, for example beans, lentils, rice, and quinoa are all full of nutrients and super cheap </TEXT>

Why would a truly loving God want him to sacrifice his daughter, knowing that's what would happen when he made that vow? Couldn't god have made a goat (for example) wander into his house that day, and have it go out to meet him?

http://www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/03/29/children.slain/index.html what do you think about this? Is this a response of adoring fear and trust? Do you think that woman will hear from god in heaven "**Well done good and faithful servant, for though I didn't tell you to kill your child, I know that you would do anything for me because you trusted and feared me so much that you would sacrifice your children for me, in a glorious parallel to the way I sacrificed my own son Jesus.**"? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just switched from Google play music because it looks like it's about to die at the hands of YouTube music which looks pretty sketchy, and Spotify has a garbage 10,000 song library and playlist limit. One of my favorite features of Google play music was I could easily thumbs up songs from the notification bar, and I'm Android auto, and then all my thumbs up songs would show up in a single playlist which I could download, and then I'd always have music I'll like ready to play. Apple music doesn't seem to have an easy way to like songs (aside from opening the app, tapping the 3 dot menu in the lower right, and hitting love), and can't make auto playlists like that, so is there any other good workflow to get around this? Any advice is appreciated, thanks! </TEXT>

Disgusted is a very strong way to put it, and I'm not sure I would use that word to describe my feelings on either of those topics (I feel more sad and unsure how to help), but when it comes down to it I think both of those issues are disgusting in their own ways, especially the extremes of them.

<TEXT> Your argument hasn't demonstrated that a best possible thing actually exists, and I'm not sure how you reached the conclusion that all things have something better than it, unless it is the best possible thing. Just because something can be improved, doesn't mean it has been improved. 

The argument about the sphere was meant to point out that some combination of the premises and conclusions were either not true or not valid. Just because we can imagine the attributes a maximally great sphere would have, and define the limits to it's greatness, doesn't mean it actually exists. Do you believe that throughout the universe, there are maximally great spheres and other maximally great objects like cubes and pyramids? Because until we find these objects and test them to verify they truly are maximally great, I see no reason to believe they actually exist. 

The main objection I have to your argument is 
C3: All things have something better than it, unless it is the best possible thing.

I'm not sure how you confirmed that to be the case. I agree that it's *possible* that all things *could* have something better than it, unless it's the best possible thing, but we don't know that there actually *is* something better until we find the better thing and confirm that it is better. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Can you demonstrate that everything has something better than it? I don't think that's the case, and correct me if I'm wrong, but that seems to be what your argument depends on

Let's apply this to spheres, I'll assume you haven't changed your original logical argument and edit it to for spheres. Let me know if I got any of it wrong

P1. There are smooth spheres, some smoother than others.

C1. There is a maximally smooth sphere, that any attempt to improve would remove smoothness.

P2. A sphere that exists is smoother than one that doesn't.

C2. From C1 and P2, there is a maximally smooth sphere that exists.

Below I've updated this to more accurately reflect reality, but I hope you see where this is going. The argument I made doesn't mean a perfect sphere exists in reality, or even a maximally smooth sphere. The nice thing about spheres is that as far as we know a perfect sphere can't exist because of the limits of reality and the maximally great one possible would be one made of circles that are actually polygons with many sides, all of the sides being the Planck length. But this argument doesn't actually prove that a maximally great sphere as described exists *in reality*. 

P1. There are smooth spheres, some smoother than others.

C1. There is a sphere that is as smooth or smoother than any other given sphere.

P2. A sphere that exists in reality is smoother than one that doesn't.

C2. From C1 and P2, there exists in reality a sphere as smooth or smoother than any other given sphere that exists in reality.

And finally, here is that, converted back to referring to a good being. 

P1. There are good things, some better than others.

C1. There is something that is as good or better than any other given thing.

P2. existing is good.

C2. From C1 and P2, there exists in reality something as good or better than any other thing that exists in reality.

Let me know if I made any mistakes or should change anything. I think my final updated argument is more logically sound and has more accurate premises than your original, but let me know what you think about it

<TEXT> Maybe, there are so many different ways to define best that it's hard to say. Even assuming yes though, that still doesn't tell us anything about it. It existing imposes other limits on it that we don't really know. For all we know, the limits of reality could mean that the best human that exists is the greatest possible being at that moment. Just because we can think of ways to improve ourselves (or any other best being), doesn't necessarily mean those improvements could or would manifest in reality. 

In addition, that seems like trying to define something into existence.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oooh ok, I just looked at your argument again, and I see the issue. I'll copy it here to point out the issue and so I can see it while typing on my phone

P1. There are good things, some better than others.

C1. There is a maximally good thing, that any attempt to improve would remove goodness.

P2. Existing is good.

C2. From C1 and P2, there is a maximally good thing that exists.

I reject the second part of c1, which I forgot about. Until it's demonstrated to be true, I don't think there's any reason to believe that there actually is a maximally good thing that any attempt to improve would remove goodness. I think that by definition there's something greater than or equal to everything else by any given standard, but it may still be possible to improve and I see no reason why we should think that there is something that can't be improved.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> 
So we only have circumstantial evidence of the existence of this being, youre right. I dont think that that prevents us from saying things like a maximally good being should be maximally powerful, like creating something from nothing which as most people on this forum know, quickly allows for the formulation of a classical diety.

We don't know anything about the maximally great being yet though. You think it should be able to create something from nothing, but we haven't demonstrated that it's possible for any being to do that, and even if no being possibly could (or can) do that there would still be a maximally great being somewhere, it'd just be less great than a hypothetical one.

With the charity example, say there's someone working at 1 charity. We both agree that working at 2 is even better, but the person working at 1 is, as far as we know, the "maximally great being" (in this scenario, with charity work and existence being the measure of goodness) until we actually manage to find someone who works at 2 charities. And if we do, they're maximally great until we find someone who works at 3, and so on.

So to answer your question more directly, the limiting factor is what we've found and demonstrated in reality. Once we find and demonstrate a god or transcendental being, then it can become the maximally great being, but until then we can't assume it exists and give it the title of maximally great. 

As I think about it, I think there might be a difference in the way we're using our terms. I'm using maximally great to mean what's the most great in reality, and correct me if I'm wrong, you're using it to mean the theoretical limit of greatness. So thinking of a person working at 2 charities, and we've never found anyone working at more than 2, is it accurate to say that I'd label them as maximally great, but you'd reserve the term maximal until they work at infinite charities? </TEXT>

<TEXT> No that was totally coherent! Sorry for taking so long to get back to you, just sat down after a while.

No worries! I'm pretty busy too so this may end up being a bit of a stretched out conversation

Ok, I would definitely agree with that, and a pantheon of Gods isn't impossible from an atheist view, so sure.

It also hasn't been shown to be possible, so it's stuck in a sort of limbo. It's possible in the sense that we can't disprove it (depending on the god in question), but we also have no solid examples to be able to use it to answer questions or explain things we don't understand or know.

So lets just maintain that there is some perfectly good thing, because we know things exist.

almost, but not quite. We don't know that there is a perfectly good thing, but we do know that there's something that's greater than everything else, or at least on par with a few other exceptional things which are all equally greater than everything else. but we don't know anything beyond that, like how much better, or what it actually is.

But if it would be possible for that being to do a lot of work in TWO charities, wouldn't that be better?

Yes, but that doesn't mean that that being exists. I do agree with your idea of a graph, where they'd need to work at infinite charities to be perfectly good, that's an interesting way of looking at it.

 #x200B;

For the most part, I think I agree with everything else you said, do you think it's fair to use the term god to mean generic deity, at least until we move past this topic? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ah I see. By your definition, I would agree a god exists, but I think it's a useless term in practice because it would be nearly impossible to determine since there are so many different ways to measure "goodness" even within the subset of the ones that include existence as being good. Even if we picked the "best" way to measure goodness, we wouldn't yet know who or what actually is maximally good.

What I mean by we don't know if a god could exist is probably easier to show with an example. If we were going to try to find the maximally good human (I'm going to assume we have a good way to measure and define that, including existence), we know it would be theoretically possible to determine. We have solid evidence that humans exist, and we have a good way to determine who's more good, so if we could somehow compare all humans then we'd find out who the best human is. But the key point here is before we could start looking for the maximally good human, we had to determine that humans exist. If we wanted to find the most good alien from another planet, and it's more good for the alien to exist than not, we still don't know that aliens exist. First we verify existence, then we determine goodness. 

So if the question is just does a maximally good thing exist, the answer is yes, and if you want to call that thing god without actually knowing anything else about it, I suppose that's fine too. I was using the definition of god as the abrahamic god, although I think any deity wouldn't work.

Tldr

For all we know, the maximally great being could be a person nobody's ever heard of who's doing a lot of work in a charity or something. So to call them god may not be warranted. Until we do know what the maximally great being is, I'm not sure what difference it makes that we know that something is maximally great

<TEXT> I don't think we can get to a deist point of view from that though. All we have is that something, somewhere, is the best thing possible, and that works for all standards of "best" that pertain to all things we know exist and are possible. The problem is we don't even know if it's actually possible for a god to exist, so until it's demonstrated to be possible, we can't just assume it is because something somewhere is maximally good </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just because we can conceive of something doesn't mean it actually exists. Just because I can think of a perfect circle, understand what that means, and so on, doesn't mean it's even possible for an actually perfect circle to exist. Just because you can think of a better farming tool, that doesn't mean it exists in reality. I saw a cool veritasium video a while ago about the most perfect sphere. It was incredibly smooth, and yet, it wasn't a *perfect* sphere. Because no matter how hard we try, once you get to the molecular level, it's still not perfectly smooth, and there's no reason to believe it's even possible for a truly *perfect* sphere to even exist until it's demonstrated to be possible. It may very well be possible, but we have no way to know yet, and so to say "I can think of a better sphere, therefore one exists" doesn't make it true

Your argument leads to the conclusion that something is maximally good/great, and I agree with you, but it does nothing to actually demonstrate what that maximal thing is. What would demonstrate it is showing it in reality in a testable way to prove it's maximal status. 

Look at it like this. You're claiming Jesus Christ is the maximally great being, and I'm guessing that you would also claim he exists in some form. An even better Jesus would be one who [fulfills all his promises](http://whywontgodhealamputees.com), or at the very least speaks more clearly to avoid confusion. Assuming that Jesus existed in some form or another, as I think we agree, just because I can define an even better Jesus doesn't mean the one I defined actually exists. It takes a demonstration to prove, not just an argument.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd like to jump in in regards to the last 2 arguments you made, especially about a maximally good thing. A similar argument is used for a maximally great being in other arguments. 

The problem I have with those is that, without demonstration, we have no way to know what a maximally good thing even is. It could be that the maximally best thing is a specific farming tool in the middle of Kansas, and we'd have no way to know. Similarly, the maximally great being could be a god, or it could be an alien millions of light years away, or it could be some human on Earth. Again, there's no way to know, so until a maximally good/great thing or being is actually demonstrated to exist, the only answer we can give is, "yes, there is something somewhere that's the most great, but nobody has a clue what it is, or even how to determine if it is maximally great". Until it's demonstrated, it's a fairly useless term, especially since maximally great/good can mean so many different things to so many different people </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree, religion most likely isn't really a factor in the antivaxx movement (or at least, I have no data either way), my point is more about belief vs evidence. I also agree on liberty being more important, I think anyone should be free to have whichever religion they'd like, but I'm not taking about law, I'm talking about as a society what will be more beneficial, even if it's not mandated. For example, it would be really beneficial if everyone did community service most weekends, but that doesn't mean it should be mandated. In the same way, I think it would be beneficial if people proportioned their belief in things (religion or otherwise) to the evidence but that shouldn't be mandated either. 

I'm not sure what ethnicity has to do with this? You can't change your ethnicity, you can change your religion

I agree people should be able to choose, but I think there needs to be better education on the topic. 

You bring up a good point, that god (in the generic sense) can't be proven or disproven, but I think when you get to specific gods, you can usually tell if there are any inconsistencies either within the claims about the god or with the claims about the god and reality. For example, a claim about the Christian god is that it's all loving, yet the Bible endorses slavery and the mistreatment of women. Another claim made by Jesus is that anything that's asked for in prayer and with faith will be granted, yet when studies are done on prayer they find that it works about as well as chance. So for that specific god, there is evidence that at least some of the claims about it aren't accurate. When we don't even have a way to prove conclusively that any god exists, most of the specific ones proposed have some issues, and as we learn more about the universe the number of things that were explained by god gets smaller, I think that's reasonable evidence that if there is a god it doesn't seem to be what people think it is. 

On top of all that, the time to accept vaccines is after the veritable evidence is shown and vaccines effectiveness is proven, and the time to accept god exists is also after veritable evidence is shown and gods existence is proven </TEXT>

If anyone deserves to be excused of narcisism it's God. 

If anyone should be held to a higher standard and expected not to be narcissistic, it's god. 

If I make an evil robot, I may not control it anymore but I'm still responsible for it. In the same way, if god exists he's responsible for how we fail and the evil things humans have done, if he made us. As a creator of a robot, there are ways to prevent it from doing evil, and as a creator of life there are ways to prevent it from doing evil as well </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's a bit narcissistic eh?

And anyways, since god can't be surprised by this, he's also responsible for it. If I make a robot that I *know* will go on a rampage and kill hundreds of people, then I'm responsible for it, because I could've done things to prevent that (from not making the robot to adding in fail-safes and such). So in the same way, if god is real then he's responsible for all bad things, from natural disasters to murderers and people like Hitler </TEXT>

<TEXT> Consider a pumpkin pie with way too much cinnamon and nutmeg. It would still be sweet, but it would also be very 'spicy' even if it's not a hot spicy. If that pie was fresh out of the oven, it would be hot and spicy, but the spice wouldn't be the source of the heat. You just found a weird quirk in language where context matters and makes a bigger difference than usual. For example, in reference to the bowl of chili example, if someone says careful, it's hot! While handing it to you or with a more urgent time, you can infer that they're talking about temperature so you don't burn your hands or mouth, but if they just say it's pretty hot and you don't see any steam, maybe you can smell the spice or other people are easily eating it, then you can infer it's a spicy heat, not temperature </TEXT>

<TEXT> Exactly! That's what this debate is missing. Nobody wants to kill babies, the two sides just have different views on when the fetus becomes human and by extension has the right to life. "Pro life" people usually define it much much closer to (and often even at) conception whereas "pro choice" people tend to put it a little later, but (I think) around when the fetus is viable outside the womb. What we need to start doing instead of arguing past each other about killing babies vs women's choice is start making rational arguments about why the fetus should get the right to life at a specific in the pregnancy. 

Personally, I don't know where the right to life should be. It's a tough question, but I think a better way to legislate it is to allow the fetus/child to be removed at any point, and if it can survive then we should do as much as we can to help it, but if it's simply too early for it to survive then that's the unfortunate nature of it. I see it as an organ donor situation. If someone needs an organ donated to survive, we can't force anyone to give up their organs to help, and in the same way the baby needs the womb to survive, but we can't force the mother to "donate" it. The problem with that argument in discussions with religious people is then they say something along the lines of "that's why people need to stop having sex outside marriage, they should know the consequences, if you choose to have sex then you should take responsibility for your actions"

Tl;Dr it's a tricky situation </TEXT>

Edit: after a quick search, I found [this article](https://esrc.ukri.org/news-events-and-publications/evidence-briefings/the-wellbeing-effect-of-education/) which finds a link between education and wellbeing, although [this article](https://newsroom.unl.edu/announce/todayatunl/452/2932) finds an increase in religious participation with increased education. [This one](https://www.nber.org/papers/w16973) finds the opposite though, so probably more research is needed.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> After talking with my family about religion more, my uncle started talking about all the incredible things that have happened to him, and for each one I've pointed out that it being a coincidence, or just something highly unlikely but still possible is probably the case, but he said you have to look at all of them and see where that foundation of evidence leads. They were all long stories and he looked like he could've gone on for hours so I just said I'll think about that, and I don't want to get into specifics because all the stories so far could've been coincidence, or just psychological phenomenon. So far he's had the only convincing argument I've heard for thinking that a god is real, because all the stories are things he's seen, and they are fairly incredible.

I'll definitely have to bring up all the flaws in biology, although I'm guessing they'll attribute that to the fall. But yeah they got kinda stuck when they went to something from nothing, because I pointed out that it makes less sense for a god to have come from nothing than just matter, and even if god is timeless there's no reason to assume the universe isn't timeless, and even if there is a god, that has no bearing on which god it is </TEXT>

<TITLE> How do I respond to the idea that countries that have followed Christian values have succeeded? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2018-12-19 07:15:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I recently told my parents that I no longer believe, and told them the path I took to get there, and I've tried to go right to the heart of the matter like in street epistemology, but I'm not great at it (yet, hopefully someday I will be). Something I keep getting back to when discussing with my dad is that he says that the fact that countries that have followed judeo-christian values have thrived, like the US, is an important thing to consider, and that it's not reasonable to throw out something that has such a positive impact. When I point out highly religious places like South America that have high levels of poverty, or terrible things religious people have done, he says that they weren't actually following what's taught in the bible. How do I counted that?

He also says that for me to say that there is no god is almost a slap in the face to people who've spent many years studying and researching this stuff that arrived at the conclusion that Christianity is true. He also says that the fact that all humanity seems to have some sort of religion means there must be some sort of god, and that plus Christian countries doing well means that Christianity makes the most sense. These arguments just leave me a little flabbergasted because I don't even know where to start on why those things aren't enough proof that god is real

He listens to a lot of Ravi zacharius, tim Keller, Jordan Peterson, and people like that

Another question, I don't know how to respond to my mom (and Dad) who get hung up on saying that the world must have a creator because all the patterns and beauty can't just come from nothing

I'd appreciate the help, i have no idea how to respond to those because the way I see it, those things have little bearing on the truth of it when the evidence that would be needed to prove god exists is nearly impossible for us to even get to, since we can't rule out hallucinations or advanced technology possibly from aliens. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Question about critical requirements, necessary requirements, and other classes in the major map </TITLE>
<DATE> 2018-10-29 17:09:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm a junior in software engineering, and as I looked at my major map to decide which classes I need to take next semester I noticed that a lot of my SER (Software Engineering) classes are labeled as either critical or necessary requirements, and then a lot of other elective classes and lab classes on the major map have no label, they're just there. I'm already in BIO 181, but I really don't want to take 182 since it has nothing to do with anything I want to study and it takes up my time so I can't focus as much on my actual major classes. Will it affect my graduation if I just don't take it?  </TEXT>

<TITLE> System emoji on desktop app? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2018-09-09 07:20:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Is there any way to use system emoji in the desktop instead of the built in ones? I'm not a huge fan of the ones in the app, they seem to try to copy apple's style and I don't really like those emojis either. It's an option in the android app, seems like it would be really good for the desktop app as well, especially in linux where you can easily install any emoji font

Edit: Looks like u/oindividuo may have found a solution: "After poking around for a while, I got it to work. Basically, you have to unpack /usr/lib/app.asar and replace the contents of /node_modules/emoji-datasource-apple/img/apple/64 with your emoji of choice. Repack and replace the original app.asar. For emoji alternatives, look in node modules, I'm using emoji-datasource-google." </TEXT>

I'm 19 and moved out but still covered by the insurance my dad gets from work

Also, is it possible to do the same for the status bar? Action launcher lets you change the icon to either dark or light, but as far as I can tell it can't change dynamically

I have my status bar set to dark since I've found most of the images I have in the rotation are lighter near the top

<TITLE> Otterbox vs flip case? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-06-26 22:22:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm trying to decide between getting the otterbox case or the flip cover bundle. I heard the oneplus 5 is really slippery, how does it compare to a nexus 5x? I usually go caseless unless I'm traveling or doing anything out of the norm, so I don't care how bulky the phone is with a case, but I was wondering if the flip cover even comes close to the otterbox in terms of protection. I want to get the bundle so I can also try one of the regular cases, and maybe use one all the time if the phone is too slippery 

Edit: so I got the phone, and it really is super slippery. I'm gonna keep using it for a few days to see how it is, but right now I'm leaning towards the flip cover bundle, using the protective case for daily use so it's not slippery, and the flip cover for traveling. 

Does anybody have the flip cover to review? How much protection does it offer?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm trying to get i3 to start automatically, without using a dm, so I've been using nodm to just log in automatically. Then I have my i3 settings run i3lock so that it's not entirely unsecure.

Anyways, when I start i3 with a dm (specifically lightdm), I can minimize apps like google play music desktop player, but when I log in automatically with nodm or even just logging in and running startx, the app can't minimize. Normally I would just isolate it to a different workspace, or put it in the scratchpad, but gpmdp uses a lot of processing power when the window is visible, so I prefer to keep it running in the background

One thing I've noticed is that lightdm doesn't run my .xinitrc

edit: After some experimenting, the only thing I can think of is that gpmdp is looking for a dm to minimize. I changed the lightdm session wrapper to my xinitrc, so no matter what it runs i3 and all my stuff, and then gpmdp could minimized. when I run startx after just logging into the virtual terminal, it can't

unless lightdm is running it with root, not my user, which is allowing something to start properly and let it work somehow

decided to try with lxdm since I think it might be a bit lighter than lightdm. It also lets gpmdp minimize. I think the issue is something to do with polkit, but I have no idea. I'll probably just use the lxdm autologin :/ </TEXT>

<TITLE> How to prevent i3lock activating twice </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-05 23:17:45 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> ~~I have xautolock set up to lock after 5 minutes, and to lock whenever I suspend. My laptop also suspends when I close the screen. The problem is that if it locks after 5 minutes and then I close the screen, when I open it back up to unlock, I have to enter my password twice. Is there any way to set up i3lock to only lock if there are no i3lock processes running? I'm technically using i3exit lock, not i3lock directly~~

As I typed this, I thought of the solution, so I figured I'd just post it here still. It's just a script that checks if i3lock is running, and if not, runs i3lock. I'm sure you can transfer it to bash if you really want to

basically if pidof i3lock doesn't return anything, then i3lock isn't running, so it's safe to run. if it does return something, then that means i3lock is running, so the scrip does nothing

    #!/bin/zsh
    
    [[ !(-n "pidof i3lock") ]]    i3exit lock

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For the past week or so I've been waking up after my alarm, with no memory of it going off. For example, I have it set to 6:30, and this morning I woke up a bit, looked at my watch, saw 6:21, thought "Sweet!" and went back to sleep. Then I woke up at 6:50. So I set a sample alarm for like 55, and it seemed to go off fine, if a little weak feeling, so while in was in the shower I was thinking about it, and I've got two questions: 

Could stand-by-mode somehow cause this? 

And could somebody make an app that works just like the regular alarm, but you have to walk like 10 or 20 steps to disable it? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Getting cables for USB c </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-12-28 01:12:02 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> When I got my Nexus, I realized that the cable it came with was really short, and I couldn't use it 1) with my computer, 2) in the car, and 3) with my otg adapter. So, I started looking around for a good cable. I decided I want an OTG cable for flash drives, fast charging in the car (using the included cable), and a long usb c to c cable, so I could use the included wall thing, and wouldn't need to worry about connecting to my computer (also, my computer's usb ports can't even output enough power for fast charging, so that's out too). 

Here's what I found:

 - For OTG, [this](http://amzn.com/B017MP658G) seemed the best, because although it wasn't approved, the reviews seemed good, and since it's not using much energy, it shouldn't be too big of a deal if it's not completely up to spec

 - For car charging, I think [this](http://amzn.com/B014F2NQ36) is the best because it allows for fast charging, is approved by that Benson Leung guy who's reviewing USB c stuff on Amazon, and it also has a regular USB outlet

 - For a long cable, I decided on the [apple 2 m cable from best buy](http://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-usb-c-charge-cable-2m-white/6601004.p?id=1219663250149 skuId=6601004 productCategoryId=pcmcat183800050007) because they have an open box version for $25 + free shipping, I have a $20 best buy gift card from using android pay, and I know that apple makes good cables, and I trust them way more than the ones on amazon. 
 - I also have the [TechMatte micro usb to usb c thingy](http://amzn.com/B0173MGFK6) in case I ever need to charge my phone with my laptop or power stick thing

~~I haven't ordered anything yet, but~~ I'll try and update this as I get them. Does anyone know for certain whether or not the Apple cable supports fast charging? I haven't found anything online :/ </TEXT>

It works fine for charging, charging from my computer and transferring files to/from my computer, but not this :/ </TEXT>

<DATE> 2015-11-25 01:09:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have a full metal, real wood AK-47 that I got on craigslist (don't know who made it, etc), as well as two batteries, one 800 mah, the other 1600, both 9.6v, as well as three mags, one midcap (brown), one standard hi-cap (black), and the other a flash mag (gray, with the string to wind it). I also have a small angled flash hider. 

It works great, shoots around 375 fps, and the batteries last a long time, but I decided I prefer the m4 style for more rail space, as well as looks. The mode selector is a bit loose, but it works fine overall.

I'll sell the gun for $90, the midcap mag for $5, the 800 mah battery for $5, the other battery for $10, the hicaps for $10 each, and the flash hider for $10, plus whatever shipping is.
Hit me up with an offer!

<TEXT> 1. If you're not on it already, restore to iOS 9.1

2. restore backup, so all your stuff is on your phone

3. do the alt-check for update, not restore, and go to 9.0.2. Should have everything still there

4. now backup again so the backup is for 9.0.2 and not 9.1

5. restore again to 9.0.2, and follow one of the guides to not get a blod. 

6. Restore backup when done if it's not in the instructions (I think it is though)

So I figured I'd just use iTunes, which also has apple music turned off, and tried to sync songs I bought over to my phone. according to iTunes, everything is on the phone, but I can't actually access any of it, and usage settings says there's no music. 


Edit: Updated to the 9.1 beta because why not and it might fix it, and it did. Didn't try downloading anything because it got copied over by iTunes, but I think it would work.
so to fix update phone to beta/restore phone/do something similar

I definitely won't do a restore iTunes backup, because that leaves many things over from the jailbreak, etc. I am wondering if iCloud backups do the same, since they don't store everything like iTunes does. When I update, can I just restore from iCloud backup? Or would my best option be to just do a fresh install (I only have a 16 gb version, so It won't be hard to manually install all my apps again)? Can I still copy game data back to apps with tools like ifunbox, or will I lose that as well (from games that don't store data in the cloud)?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I recently purchased controllers for all (cfa), to play games using my wii/classic pro controller (the classic pro plugs into the wii controller like a nunchuk). Unfortunately, I have a bit of a weird problem. I can connect to it using MFiwrapper, and use the controller in GBA4iOS, but I want to use it in other games (specifically Asphalt 8). Supposedly cfa can do this, but it can't connect to the wiimote. I tried installing both at the same time, but still cfa wouldn't connect to the controller. Any advice? The only gaming controller I have is the classic pro, and it's not worth it to me to go out and buy a full new controller just to see how well it works to use my phone as a console

So I set an activator action up to swipe in from the top of the screen and open the notification center, and I actually like it better than the default nc animation. Looking at it in the lockscreen where I don't have the action set up, I realized how much the bounce is annoying. Also, it gets rid of that little tab when you swipe down once.

*edit* It was a thing I had enabled in mikoto, which made the lock screen status bar the same size as regular, and showed the time in the status bar on lock screen </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just got a used iPhone 5s, and I'm upgrading from a 5th ten iPod touch, and I'm wondering why the screen smudges so much. On my iPod, I can use the phone for a few minutes and then do the same on my iPod, and the phone screen will be covered in smudges, and the iPod will be fine. The phone screen also isn't nearly as smooth as my iPod screen </TEXT>

<TITLE> Best way to optimize wifi on iOS 8? </TITLE>

<TEXT> I'm wondering if there is any way to optimize wifi speeds on my iPod touch, iOS 8.1.2. I found TCP Optimizer, but the repo appears to be empty when I add it to Cydia. Not sure if it or similar tweaks are even necessary I just thought it would be neat to make wifi faster, or, when moving through a large building, my iPod will continuously disconnect and reconnect, fix that. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Really slow reboot and respring time on iPod touch </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-22 23:29:18 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have a 5th gen iPod touch on iOs 81.2, and it is really slow at rebooting or respringing. When I respring, at about 4 minutes in, it shows the lock screen (but doesn't recognize any interaction), and then shows the  logo again, even though it had gone away a few minutes before then. Finally, at about 5 and a half minutes, it'll show the lock screen, again not allowing interaction, and finally,  once the screen turns off, I can click the home button and unlock my iPod. The whole process takes about 5 minutes and 47 seconds.

 I have had this problem since before I jailbroke (with rebooting), but I think the jailbreak will make it easier to fix. I jailbroke mainly to speed up my iPod, so I only have 2-3 non-optimization tweaks/apps installed. I also have 594 apps (non jailbreak) at this time.

Another similar problem is when I install anything via Cydia, the final "Loading" spinner right before the exit button (Reboot, respring, return to Cydia) takes a ridiculous amount of time (5 minutes and 15 seconds), and my friend was saying his resprings only take about 30 seconds, which happens to be the difference of those two amounts.

Is there anything I should do, other than having such a ridiculous amount of apps? Based on this, I'm starting to think they both load something involving all my apps, and respring takes about 30 seconds on a clean device.

*EDIT* After deleting a bunch of apps, load time and boot time is much faster, so if you have a similar problem, try deleting some apps. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am wondering what the best way to mine on the raspberry pi is. I think Arch Linux is the best bet, especially on raspberry pi, since it's just command line, so it doesn't need to use processing power for displaying a GUI, but I don't know how to actually start mining. I'm can ssh into the pi, but don't know what to install, or how. I  think cpu miner is the best bet </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm wondering what the best way to mine from a flash drive is. I'm using cpuminer, and I get maybe 5-10 dogecoins for a couple of hours, and was wondering if there is a more efficient way to mine off a flash drive. I also don't want it to hog all my ram, just to run in the background and use any unused ram. I would also like to run this on both Mac and PC.
Thanks!

edit: I'm not mining solo </TEXT>

<TITLE> iCaughtU and iOS 7 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-12-28 17:34:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I recently (and stupidly) installed iCaughtU onto my jailbroken iPod touch 5 (iOS 7.0.4), and my iPod has entered a constant respring/reboot loop. After a lot of holding down the volume up, home, and power buttons, in many different combinations, I managed to get it to start up. Then I went to Cydia ASAP, and as soon as it started loading, Cydia's loading circle turned into the respring circle. This happened twice, but I can't seem to get it to start up again. Please help anyone. I can use iTunes, but I don't want to restore yet, as I think if I had access to a better computer I could get into the files with SSH or something, and want to try and uninstall iCaughtU by deleting it manually. If anyone could give me any tips or the path to everything involving iCaughtU, that would be great.
Thanks </TEXT>

<TITLE> what do you think of no swearing for a month? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was thinking, what would Reddit be like if nobody put a post that had swear words in it, not in the title, not in a picture or post that you link, absolutely, 100% clean? No-Swear November anyone? I think that it would be cool, tell me what you think about it.


*UPDATE* So apparently nobody likes this idea, so I thought I should clarify: I only meant what you post on reddit. So if you make a rage comic, just edit out the swear words before you post. Also, it wouldn't have to be in November. That was just the best sounding month in my opinion. So if you hate this idea, just downvote. I apologize in advance if I have broken your innocent swearing hearts, and thanks to everyone who at the very least looks at both the good and the bad of this idea, instead of saying that it's stupid, only with slightly worse words than "stupid" </TEXT>

I copied that as accurately as possible, and have no idea who wrote this as our teacher wouldn't tell us who wrote it. Our whole class asked for a copy, except for about 2 people. I hope you like it!
