<TEXT> toxitricity's forms are actually based off guitars- specifically a bass guitar for lowkey form and a standard electric guitar for amped (idk if it's called amped) form. see the four stripes on lowkey's chest and how amped has two more? a bass guitar has four strings, as opposed to the standard six. also, lowkey form's dex entry says it's an electrical organ that makes sounds "like the strumming of a bass guitar." i don't believe amped form's dex entry has been revealed yet if there is a seperate entry (there was for morpeko), but it will likely say something to the same extent. </TEXT>

<TEXT> there's a phenomenon where people can be visually blind but they can still "see." like you put them in a hallway and they'll avoid objects on the floor but they see nothing. i believe it can happen if the part of the brain that deals with vision is damaged but the eyes and optical nerves are fine. something similar might've happened with your friend, like the color part of his brain wasn't working for some reason or another and the lsd started it back up. he might've been subconsciously seeing colors his whole life (e.g. he's taught the sky is blue, his brain goes "ok that's blue" and stores it for later) so when he got his color vision he recognized the colors.

i believe it personally. if someone wanted to make up a story they'd make up something less far-fetched and there are plausible explanations </TEXT>

<TEXT> i've had 2 hp laptops and they just seem... low quality? i don't know. but my old decent hp laptop had the fan blow out, had to get that repaired, within like 2 or 3 years? then it stopped working for a while and i got a new laptop (a netbook, also by hp. don't get a netbook unless literally all you do is web browsing and not watching videos. it is so slow). *that* laptop then stopped working so i discovered the older one was working again. and then later on the hard drive blew out. the netbook still wasn't working (i later installed linux mint on it and it was fine. still functions but the lcd broke right in the middle from my cat laying on some blankets on top of it so if i want to do anything i have to do it in the corner of the already tiny screen) so i got a new computer. a refurbished thinkpad t430s for less than $200. this computer came out in 2012 and it still works great. i had to do some repairs when some of the wires on the inside got exposed but it still runs great. recently i had to reinstall windows, accidentally got rid of my linux mint install in the process. i haven't even bothered to go back to dualbooting cause my thinkpad from 2012 runs windows just fine. and i don't even like windows 10! i only use it cause so many developers (especially game devs) don't support linux. i didn't know laptops could be good especially for cheap before i got a thinkpad cause hp was all i'd used. </TEXT>

<TEXT> like the other commenter said, there are differences on average but you can't really tell from looking at the brain. men have more gray matter while women have more white matter (both different types of tissues in the brain). this doesn't affect intelligence in either sex.

anyway, i believe she is spreading her demonic influence to her target (me). she even SLEEPS on me. it is a SIN to share beds before marriage!

there is a dog in my household as well, but i believe she does not have a target. she shows "affection" to my whole family and gets equally angry if anyone refuses to rub her belly. touching others before marriage is a SIN! </TEXT>

man. i haven't talked about this to anyone. feels kinda nice to just let it out. it's been dragging me down for the past few weeks. legit last night i had a dream where we became friends again and that's all i remember. fuckin hurts to have people you genuinely care about essentially tell you they don't like you anymore and haven't for months and then when you put in effort to be better it just gets worse. these were my first actual friends and i miss them. i stopped talking to them entirely and the fact that nobody's reached out to me hurts like hell. guess i got a lot to tell my therapist

i know your so probably isn't diagnosed with arfid, but it definitely sounds like something's up. get him to talk to a psychologist or nutritionist or even his general doctor. there's treatment. it isn't his fault he's picky. </TEXT>

i don't think ashley was being an asshole. she needed a car and was freaking out about her sister. while there were better options she could've taken and she was kind of a dick to you, it's hard to think straight in stressful situations. while i do think she's at fault, i don't feel right saying she's The Asshole in this situation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> disclaimer: take this all with a grain of salt. a lot of this was googled and i don't know if it's all right. tldr at end cause this got kinda long.

radiation (specifically ionizing radiation) is dangerous, but only in high amounts. we're exposed to small amounts of radiation in our daily lives: see https://xkcd.com/radiation/ for some specifics. ionizing radiation tears apart atoms, including dna. in smaller amounts the body is either unaffected entirely or can recover just fine, but with higher doses eventually this can cause mutations like cancer or just generally fuck up the body.

some nuclear fuels, while radioactive, are actually relatively safe on their own. it's the actual process of fission that releases high amounts of radiation. radioactive decay releases radiation, and nuclear plants sort of get radioactive decay to happen really fast.

radioactive material should be stored safely, though. the small amounts of radiation can build up in a closed space.

either way, transportation of materials at any level of danger is very highly regulated. it's unlikely that this almost definitely reinforced truck would be punctured or opened by accident on the road (and even if it were, it would likely not be enough to do any harm unless it's been sealed in the truck for a LONG time). the warnings about radioactivity are likely a worst case scenario kind of thing and are probably just there to appease the law.

tl;dr: while radiation can be harmful in large doses, nuclear fuels on their own often don't release much in the time it takes to transport them. even if this isn't the case, the truck is probably reinforced and very safe. </TEXT>

<TEXT> i think gender is built into us and not just something we could throw out. i can't imagine being a girl, and i can't imagine being anything in between (including no gender). i'm a trans guy with gender dysphoria and a lot of it is over my body. is that due to societal norms? maybe, but i don't think we should throw those out.

i'm against forcing gender roles on people. it's ok to be a feminine guy, a feminine girl, a masculine guy or a masculine girl. what i'm not against is gender. men and women have biologically different brains and bodies (sometimes there's a mixup between the two. i got the male brain and the female body. there's a reason that isn't working out for me). since racism is a problem, should we just dye everyone's skin grey at birth?

also, it's impossible to get rid of gender even if it wasn't so built into us. you can't possibly get seven billion people to start going by they/them and calling everyone else the same. what we need to focus on is getting rid of the issues, not the cause. </TEXT>

either way, you don't lose anything for even your own wrong answers. and who said it had to be a specific episode? there are logs of pretty much every episode of jeopardy out there. go loop james holzhauer's highest winning final jeopardy or something. </TEXT>

<TEXT> i think it's ok to call it a decision. i'm not op and i haven't detransitioned but while it isn't a choice to be trans, it is a choice to (de)transition. even though the alternative is likely suicidal depression i made the choice to transition. it's still a choice even if there's an obvious right choice (and in some cases there isn't).

really you probably won't say anything offensive if you're not outright being a dick. ask if you're not sure and if you say something wrong just apologize and move on with it. it's a vocal minority that's more sensitive about stuff like that and you probably won't meet anyone like that unless you're looking. just remember everyone's cool with different things. </TEXT>

<TEXT> this is true. even before i started testosterone (which was thankfully the right choice for me) my natural voice was deeper than most girls my age. voice training does genuinely change your natural pitch even if it's not professionally done.

i'm glad you realized before you went on hormones. they say the changes are slow but a lot of them are actually kind of quick (not like overnight but faster than you'd think. i've been on t for ~5 months and i'm pretty much indistinguishable from a short kinda fat cis dude as long as my clothes are on).

do you think you would've transitioned or identified as trans without the internet? personally the internet really influenced my "decision" to call myself trans. i likely would've figured it out later but i didn't realize i had dysphoria when i first started calling myself trans. </TEXT>

if you have trouble getting up after your wake up alarm? set 2 alarms 5-15 minutes apart. i used to have trouble getting up after my alarm and would just go back to sleep but recently i set a second. haven't not gotten up once.

that tip might help with other stuff too. set an alarm 5-15 minutes before you have something to do so you have time to mentally prepare yourself? idk might help </TEXT>

<TEXT> i don't remember much about the side effects at the beginning, but it doesn't really matter what time you take the pill. as long as you take it around the same time every day (~2 hours off is the most i'd do) you should be good. if it's not extended release you might want to take it when you wake up in the morning. i'm on xr so i'm not really sure how it works.

i'm on 150mg currently and experiencing none of these side effects. good luck, effexor doesn't work for everyone but when it works it works. meds can really help if you find the right one, i was lucky effexor was the first one my doctor tried (my mom takes it so that's the first thing i got). if it does work for you you might not make a full recovery but it'll definitely be better. don't switch meds if it's not perfect, only switch if it's genuinely not working enough for you to function or you get bad side effects. takes a while too.

also don't forget to take your meds every day. i've only missed one dose and the withdrawal sucks. it's no exaggeration when people on this sub talk about it

again, good luck with effexor. if it doesn't work, hope you find something that does </TEXT>

a good teacher can change a kid's life. my middle school band teacher inspired me to go into music (which won't be happening for a few years cause i'm still in high school but i'm working on it).

there's also a cat that hangs out outside of my house often. just saw him on my back deck today. might just be because i have an indoor cat though.

i'm my cat's favorite person too. i'm the only one she sleeps with or purrs for. she thinks i'm not allowed to use the bathroom without letting her in. my mom didn't know she purred and she'll purr for me daily. she's the best cat. the only "bad" thing she ever does is intentionally taunt my dog into chasing her but that's more funny than bad. the dog would never hurt mabel and mabel knows daisy's just playing- she'll bat at her but she always keeps her claws sheathed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> for all those that agree with this: most people aren't actually forcing any of this on their kids. this is classic strawmanning (and it doesn't help that there's a very small vocal minority actually doing this). i don't agree with forcing lgbt on your kids. i think it's ok to assume they're straight unless they say otherwise as long as you're not actively discouraging them to be this or that because most people are straight and cis. still weird to act like 5 year olds are dating because they're playing with someone of the opposite gender though lmao </TEXT>

<TEXT> absolutely true. the first time i saw my now 5 year old cat purr was when i was playing with her for the first time. she's mellowed out now (still plays a lot but more with the dog's toys) but i think my playing with her as a kitten shaped her opinions of all the people in the house- my bed is still the only bed she'll sleep in. my mom never sees her purr but she'll purr for me daily. bit of a tangent but my point is playtime is super important for a little cat and i believe it can absolutely shape their personality. </TEXT>

and yeah college isn't necessary or a guaranteed good job but i really don't want to have to have a job i don't enjoy. i want to go into music (not like being in a band, more a professional orchestra. they pay a lot better) and that's pretty hard to do if you don't have a degree. still hard with a degree but more doable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> i'm actually still a "smart kid." i'm in all honors classes, i have a really good memory for facts (but not events), i'm really good at writing according to my teachers, etc. my problem is i can't do homework to save my life- i can finish it easily. it's starting it that's the problem. this includes studying, which usually isn't a problem because of my abnormally high memory for facts (not trying to brag. i've had teachers say things like "[my name] studies, he always gets high grades" when i haven't studied for a minute) but it has been a problem before- i would've failed chinese and had to take another language class for the required credit if my teacher wasn't super nice and bumped my grade up. i also have trouble staying awake in class sometimes and i'll miss important things. the only classes i actually like are all the music classes i take (which are half my classes this year it's epic)

anyway my point is everyone always puts high expectations on me because i'm actually pretty smart, but my problem is i have zero motivation or executive function and it sucks. i have no real world skills and i'm terrified to go to college but i'd end up in poverty otherwise. i've genuinely thought about killing myself (i'm better about it now don't worry) because i was just too scared of the real world. overall it's just a shitty situation </TEXT>

<TEXT> breaking news: "young" (i.e. 23-38 year olds) people can't read clocks anymore i guess. or is it winding the watch that's the problem cause if you're in a room with only those things it's not like you can wind a watch to the right time anyway and watches are easy as hell to wind even if you somehow can't read the directions in cursive (legit it's just normal letters slightly changed and connected). especially if it's just an hour/minute(/second) one and not one of those fancy ones with the days of the week.

and even if i were a millennial and somehow ended up in that room what would i do with that stuff?

rotary phones aren't supported by most service providers at this point. who would i call anyway the only number i have memorized is my own

what am i gonna do with a watch? stare at it for a couple minutes and then fall asleep from boredom?

analog tvs no longer work without a converter. television remotes were first available to the public in the 1950s and digital television was first available in the 1990s.

what am i supposed to type exactly?

i can't even use the directions. i could read them but all of these things are super easy to figure out and half of them don't even work anymore. i'd probably end up falling asleep on the floor using the directions as a blanket. </TEXT>

<TEXT> yes. if a cancerous cell from another human were to get into another's system somehow, the body would recognize it as coming from another human and kill it.

however, since tasmanian devils are all so closely related, this doesn't happen in their case. one devil bites another, one of them has cancer. the one without's body now has cancer cells in its system. it pretty much tells them to go do their job, and then they replicate like normal cancer.

at least i think that's how it works. take that with a grain of salt i might be wrong </TEXT>

<TEXT> people might play a fangame as a substitute for the actual games i'd say. which is kinda dumb since they're different games- not many people are gonna have the choice to play both, say, emerald and platinum and only play one of them. kinda bad example since both cost money while fangames don't but that's the general point.

also, fangames are probably fair use? as long as they aren't for profit there's not much they're doing (as long as it's not like. a straight rip of one of the actual games) so taking them down is just dumb. the creators could always countersue but that's expensive and takes a lot of time </TEXT>

<TEXT> i'm ok with their name being changed (especially if they make it just zombie piglins). but i really hope they don't change the texture or their neutrality. zombie pigmen are a classic mob and really do not need to be changed past the name change (which is already not that necessary but i get it, gender neutrality etc etc). it would feel like if they entirely changed the concept of creepers (maybe blowing up on death like when they were first added instead of just blowing up). </TEXT>

<TEXT> i let my dog on the couch but i absolutely get not doing that. a lot of dogs shed like hell and even if they don't they don't exactly care about hygiene. my dog loves to eat cat poop (we don't let her near the litter box but sometimes the baby gate gets left down) and she also likes to lick the couch and my parents' bed. kinda gross but we don't really care.

i think it's also fine to have your dog sleep on the floor. they evolved to be more adaptable than us in regards to sleeping. hell my dog is falling asleep on the floor right now and she absolutely has other places to sleep. she also likes to sleep in the wagon outside and rest her head on the edge which looks uncomfortable but she still likes it. my old dog only slept on the floor and she probably could've gotten up on the bed or couch if she wanted to (she was big). they absolutely do not care where they sleep and if you don't want to let them on the bed or get them their own bed they will not care.

i've also had people tell me i'm a bad dog owner for leaving my dog outside unsupervised. i'd actually never heard that dogs can't be outside on their own before that- if stray dogs can survive on the streets why can't i leave my dog in my fenced yard while she takes a piss? i think people are way too judgemental and as long as you're not like. hitting or screaming at or neglecting your dog you're not a bad owner.

i crate my dog when we have company too by the way. my dog doesn't like visitors and some people don't like dogs or are allergic. if it's just my friends over i leave her out cause they know each other but i have a handicapped brother so a lot of case managers   nurses   such come over and we always crate her.

dogs are more like feral toddlers than human kids. as long as they're happy and healthy i think it's cool </TEXT>

<TEXT> it is for breathing, but his nose likely didn't function 100% of the time. he might've been in some sort of physical therapy at first so he could relearn breathing out of his nose. either way, he would have to go through another surgery (not too long or invasive but still surgery) to get it removed and it's always nice to have a backup.

it's called a tracheostomy tube (trachea- windpipe, ostomy- opening) but is often just shortened to trach (at least i've heard it that way. my profoundly handicapped (technically half-)brother briefly had one due to respiration of saliva but ended up getting it removed. still has a gastrostomy tube due to food respiration though). </TEXT>

<TEXT> not a dumb question, i had to look up what we use them for.

**short answer:** nautiluses are like octopuses with shells instead of skin. we use their shells for decoration. we don't use their body but they can't survive without their shells.

**long answer:** a nautilus is a shelled cephalopod- think a small octopus in a snail's shell. not coming out the bottom like a snail though, the nautilus is more part of the spiral of its shell. if my description isn't perfect just google nautilus, plenty of pictures. there are multiple species under the name nautilus but they're pretty similar. a lot of this answer is based off of the chambered nautilus, though.

we don't actually have enough data to know their conservation status, but we do know their population is dropping. worst part is we don't even eat them or use; we just fish them up for their shells. i couldn't find what their shells are made of (not on wikipedia at least. closest thing was "bony"), but they do hatch with them unlike animals like hermit crabs, and they keep the same shell their whole life. they need them to control their depth in the water; without them they'd likely either fall too deep and be crushed by the pressure or float to the surface and drown. they might just stay at a decent depth in the water but i'm not sure and it wouldn't be good for finding food and escaping predators. their shells are also for protection of course- there isn't any skin in there and they have no bones. their organs just kinda float around in there because their shell usually protects them, but since we use them for their shells we just have to kill them and i guess just throw away the rest. 

we don't even use them for any practical purposes. like ivory (the trade driving elephants to endangerment. not quite extinction yet but it's definitely not good for their population), all we use nautilus shells is sitting around and looking nice, maybe using them as an impractical bowl. </TEXT>

i will answer your rhetorical question though: probably not. it might be uncomfortable or scary for a few minutes but it's good for them in the long run (if you don't cut an animal's nails they can end up growing into their paw pads. in the wild they'd usually break or grind down before this happens but with all the luxuries for today's pets they often just grow). it's like bathing a dog who doesn't like baths or taking him to the vet to get a shot; even if the dog doesn't understand it's still a necessary evil. </TEXT>

it's actually illegal to wear the flag (including as a design on hats/shirts/etc) according to the flag code, but the flag code isn't enforced so nobody cares. less common examples: i believe the stars and stripes are supposed to be above all other flags even on different poles (state, city, allied country, etc). sometimes this is followed sometimes not. it's also illegal to fly the flag upside down in times of peace (in war upside down flags are often used as a distress call, or just a sign of disrespect from an enemy). </TEXT>

<TEXT> this turned out long but i don't care that much if anyone reads it. tldr at the end

i know i'm super late but i can relate to this. we're a single income family but my dad's in construction and has been with his company for 10 years now. money's tight but if my dad saves up and works saturdays we can afford nice vacations. we live in maryland like 20 minutes south of baltimore so usually we just drive places. last year during the summer we went on a weekend trip to philly. stayed in the sheraton (more on the luxury side for those uninformed), ate cheap but good (a lot of cheesesteaks. went to a cheap pizza place the first night it was super good), went to a lot of museums/historical monuments cause like you said they're cheap. walked a lot to avoid having to deal with multiple parking payments or ubers. my mom didn't get to go due to an emergency but she's not the best parent and i don't like going on trips with her (not as bad as some but there's a reason i'm subbed here) so it probably made the trip better.

it was maybe the best vacation i've ever had and i've been to disney world three times (only twice with family- most recent was my school band's spring trip). we're eagles fans (my dad grew up in baltimore but when the colts left he just switched to the eagles and stuck with them) and the eagles just happen to play the patriots on my 16th birthday this year so we're gonna go up there again (he hasn't directly admitted it yet but i know. been a lot of "hypothetical" questions and recently we were talking about something related to philly at lunch with my grandma. my mom went "have you told him about-" and my dad cut her off with a no) and i'm super excited. they play the bears on my dad's birthday two weeks earlier but we both wanted to (*hypothetically*) see the patriots anyway so it'll be a birthday trip for us both. i don't know how long we're going for yet, if it'll be a weekend trip or we're just driving up there for the game and back. hoping it's a weekend trip cause i love the city but i'm happy to see the game either way.

the point: vacations can be great even when money is tight. even if we hadn't stayed in a nice hotel (we didn't spend that much time in it anyway. we woke up, went out for the whole day, came back and i pretty much passed out both nights. we did a ton for a 3 day trip) it still would've been a great vacation. if you have to make a 12 year old pay for part of the vacation you should be going on a different vacation. also shoutout to my dad for working super hard so i can enjoy being a kid, haven't really thought that much about it before but now that i am i'm crying a little lmao

sidenote: our neighbor crashed into our old car recently (older than me. 2002) and his insurance ended up totalling it. the old car was starting to go down the gutter anyway- a couple years ago we tried to sell it for $2000, didn't end up selling, but the insurance check was over $4000. not a ton of money but we did use some of it for the down payment on a new (used but newer than any car i've ever been in. 2014 jeep cherokee) car. my dad has a friend who works as a used car salesman too so he got a decent chunk off the price. my dad's really happy about it (i am too. it's the first car i'll ever drive) and it's great to see him so happy about something. my mom's been critical about him being too happy about it somehow? but whatever it's just cool that he's happy

tl;dr: my favorite vacation was a reasonably cheap one to philly, we're going back in november. you don't need to spend a ton of money to have a good vacation. also my dad is great and is really happy about his new car and i'm really happy to see him happy </TEXT>

<TEXT> plus it's easier to pass as male when you're genetically female than it is to pass as female when you're genetically male. testosterone masculinizes really well but trans women have to do voice training just to get a decent voice. i passed 50% of the time with just a binder and short hair before i even went on t. it's been 4 months and as long as i wear a binder i pass fine

they see pictures of people presenting female (or see them in real life) that don't pass entirely but they see a trans dude on the street and don't think twice cause 80% of the time we either aren't out yet and can't try to pass or we just look like shorter than average dudes so they just don't think about us </TEXT>

<TEXT> it was 9/11, possibly the worst terrorist attack in the united states' history, to be fair. what more important missions could the dog have been on that day? rescue dogs can only work with one handler due to their bond, it's not like symington was just stealing him (even if he wasn't on medical leave). many rescue dog handlers are volunteers as well (i don't know if symington was, but he likely wouldn't have gotten paid for this anyway)

i do get your point though. not trying to argue or anything, just discussing </TEXT>

<TEXT> i wish i *could* eat fruits and vegetables... i (likely, not diagnosed) have arfid (avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder). i physically cannot eat any fruits or vegetables without gagging due to the texture. except grapes because of the size and bananas because the texture is different but that's only sometimes. the only exception to the rule is potatoes and that's only because they change texture when cooked; can't eat them raw (but who eats potatoes raw anyway), can't eat mashed potatoes either. a lot of people with arfid end up losing weight because the only foods they can eat are super low calorie but i can't eat healthy and i'm trying to lose weight but everything has so many calories except for, of course, food i can't eat without gagging and getting nauseous and it sucks.

do i try new foods? yes if it's not a fruit/vegetable or anything near the consistency of ketchup (sauces are bad too it's weird. honey's fine but anything harder than that but softer than jelly is a no from me). i've tried eating small amounts in other foods- no i don't taste it but the taste isn't the problem. i actually really like the taste of a lot of fruits.

i feel bad reading this thread. i understand being annoyed by people who brag about not eating shit that's healthy but just saying don't look down on everyone just because of a few assholes. some picky eaters have actual reasons that aren't "i'm quirky and don't eat healthy by choice i'm so random ." sorry for writing so much just needed to vent </TEXT>

<TEXT> i don't believe so. the worst part about bestiality is that animals can't consent. if they could, it would likely be seen as similar to homosexuality (maybe a bit more taboo). catgirls, while having a few feline traits, are still (mostly) humans, with a human brain. they can consent. maybe it would be taboo but it probably wouldn't be illegal. </TEXT>

<TEXT> that story feels like big old strawmanning to me... never once have i seen anyone say "if you like traditionally feminine things you are NOT trans!!!" any discussion i'd ever get into with a cis friend who isn't already educated on the topic is just that you need dysphoria to be trans. i don't care if you have pink hair or painted nails or whatever the fuck i just care if you have dysphoria that is affecting your life

basically? press x to doubt. and if the story is true, the blame falls on the mom for being dumb lmao. if the transmed friend gave her "resources" how the fuck would that instantly start her raving about how you CAN'T like ANY girly things if you're a trans guy </TEXT>

<TEXT> i feel that... except i have a little hound mix.

she currently has the first ever stuffed toy she hasn't ripped up. it's modeled after the rear end of a small animal of some sort. we call it her squirrel butt. we have no idea why it's a butt but daisy loves it. she'll walk around (or just lay on the couch) squeaking it and crying. best part is we got it at the shelter for $2 when we went up for her and the cat's shots. we also got another toy there that she's opened and pulled the squeaker out of but not all the stuffing (which is also a marvel achievement).

we haven't even been training her not to rip up her toys or anything. she loves squeaky toys but we only get them for her occasionally and she'll usually rip them up within a day... maybe she's learning they stay squeaky if she doesn't rip them up? if so, i'm glad because even the "durable" squeaky toys have never been spared.

sorry i went on a bit of a tangent there i'm just proud of my doggy. [dog tax](https://imgur.com/LxDRudh)! she loves to lay in the wagon (our old dog was much bigger and chewed the handle up, not her. she doesn't care for furniture, at least not anymore) </TEXT>

<TEXT> don't feel bad that you didn't do anything; there wasn't anything you really could've done but wait for the trained medical professionals to help him. it is kinda weird that they left the blood on the floor for so long though, that seems like a health hazard (especially if the man had something contagious). here (united states) that absolutely wouldn't fly, idk if wherever you are is that strict but maybe you should report that to the government or something?

just keep in mind that there wasn't anything you could've done to help and you're not at fault. i know it doesn't make it any less traumatic but survivor's guilt might be a thing in this situation. i'd definitely say talk to a therapist about it even if you don't feel guilty. </TEXT>

<TEXT> american dad's still a great show. family guy was also pretty great at first but now? yikes 

as for the cleveland show i've only seen like 3 episodes but it doesn't really interest me. cleveland was made to be a side character and if anyone got a spinoff i think it should've been one of the griffins (maybe instead of killing brian off (briefly) they could've given him a show?)

i am a fan of the one american dad episode where steve and roger get a "spinoff" and slowly realize it. i don't know the name of the episode unfortunately but it lampshades spinoff tropes pretty well </TEXT>

<TEXT> bro i am freakin it. i've always been a picky eater and VERY resistant to trying new foods. i literally cannot eat any fruits or vegetables without gagging (grapes and bananas are sometimes okay). the problem isn't the taste. i absolutely love apple juice and grape juice and orange juice is good too (as long as it has no pulp. i've never tried it with pulp but i'm scared. liquid isn't supposed to have texture!!!), it's just the texture.

sauces are bad too. anything near the consistency of ketchup or mustard i have never tried and never will try because i just know i'll hate it (honey and jelly are like. the ends of consistency i'll eat. anything between that is awful). everyone always says "how do you eat x plain?" but i have no idea how they eat things not plain lmao.

just today my dad got a hot dog with mustard when he asked for no mustard (place was busy, not their fault) and he just... wiped it off? and ate the hot dog? imagine being able to eat food that's been anywhere near mustard lmao i can barely even eat a fry that's touched a pickle (wish they didn't give those by default i hate the smell)

my whole life everyone's been like "just try it!" but me trying new foods is a monumental occasion. recently i was talking to my best friend about how i can't eat fruits or vegetables and they make me gag. she told me to just put them in my food and add more gradually... wish that would work lmao (not her fault she doesn't know. i had no idea this was an actual disorder and i might *have it*). tiny chunk of onion in a burger? awful. my dad makes great burgers but he likes to put onion in them and it's the only downside

i have other sensory issues too. sight is like the one sense out of the main five that doesn't have things i can't STAND. i didn't even realize this was a sensory issue until like. now! i've been reading through this sub and almost crying. i had no idea there were people with the same problem. found this sub and just kinda went "damn i don't have that but it doesn't seem fun... wait... oh god oh f"

and i've always been super consistent with my food choices at restaurants! when i was a kid it was either chicken tenders or peanut butter and jelly. now it's burgers, or maybe a cheesesteak if i'm feeling adventurous. or chicken nuggets if i'm at mcdonalds lmao

i'm not really that keen on self-diagnosis but like... bro. i'm pretty sure i have arfid :(

edit like 1min after posting: the only thing that doesn't line up is that i'm overweight but like... i legit cannot eat healthy foods. i like food! i like food a lot but only certain types of food that are not good for me! i know it's all about moderation but everything i can eat has so many calories :(

also i'll eat combinations of foods (or just foods) that other people think are weird or gross. mainly peanut butter and cheese sandwiches (it's good be nice to me). also parmesan cheese on french fries (not even the good parmesan to get at restaurants. the bottle/can/cylinder you get at the store that is just tiny particles that clump up in the container a ton). and you know peanut shells? i lick those cause they're salty. and this isn't necessarily a weird food but i also bite ice cream without any problems. imagine having sensitive teeth lmao

tldr meat and cheese are the ONLY foods (and nuts i guess. don't like them that much but i can eat them. i mostly eat peanuts just so i can crack open the shells) </TEXT>

<TEXT> bit late and i'm not *too* experienced with dogs, so unfortunately i can't answer most of your questions. do know that puppies are absolutely insane though and she'll calm down as she gets older. daisy was the worst puppy and is now the sweetest three year old. also once they're older you can leave them alone more (not all the time of course, but as long as separation anxiety isn't a problem your dog will probably be fine for like. a day trip.)

with the fast eating concern: get her a slow feeder! it's a dog bowl but with some shapes inside so the dog can't just stick its face in and eat the whole thing in two seconds. my friend has one for her gsd/collie mix (border collie is what the breeder said but might be rough collie, we're not sure) and it works great. the dog might get frustrated and tip it over but she'll still have to take smaller bites with her kibble spread out. if your mom won't get one, i'd say ask your boyfriend, but don't tell your mom it came from him of course.

good luck with mona! having a puppy may be hell now but once you get used to it it isn't as bad. i can't speak for everyone but there's a 90% chance you'll grow to love mona if you don't already. </TEXT>

<TEXT> this is a bit long, so tl;dr at bottom.

just yesterday i was at the park taking daisy for a walk. she decided that i'd stayed in the same spot for too long and pulled out of her harness (which she can do at any time, she just chooses not to. no harness we've had has kept her. she has a fat body and a skinny head and legs and just using her collar is even worse). she's done this before, she's escaped from the yard plenty of times before, no big deal, i think.

she makes me and my friends chase her all around the park. the whole time she kept stopping to sniff things, because she's a stinky little hound mix. whenever i got close to her she would smile at me and stare until i got too close to her. then she'd take right off.

at one point she went into this old couple's backyard (their fence is broken). they used to put out bread for the birds, daisy's been there before, the owners of the house know her so i'm not too worried.

the guy that lives in the house happened to be out there. we cornered daisy and as i was going to grab her she BOLTED, swear to god faster than i've ever seen even my cat run, right back into the park.

so we chase her around the park a bit more and then she just leaves the park. now the entrance we use (and daisy ran through) is a small path that opens into a street going perpendicular, with another street almost straight across from the path. since it's a path through a bunch of foliage we have no idea which way she went, so we (four of us) split up.

i went down the street across from the path. the park is one block away from our house and that street leads there. so i decide to head home real quick and ask my dad to drive around and look for her.

my house has a little brick path leading to the gate, huge bushes on either side. you can't see much until you're pretty much right in front. i approach my house, and as i get closer, i hear a suspicious jingling. daisy has two tags on her collar (her rabies tag and one with our number and her name), so she jingles a little whenever she moves.

so i stop and start moving slower so daisy wouldn't run (if it was her. i wasn't sure at this point). i walk in front of the walkway.

there's my idiot dog. just standing there in front of the gate smiling her little asshole doggy smile. she trots right up to me. i grab her collar (gently, even when i'm mad at her i wouldn't want to hurt her) and she tries to fucking run towards the gate as i lead her that way. she just goes right in the gate and acts like her normal self.

tl;dr: idiot doggy got off her leash, led me on a wild goose chase around the park. went right home when she decided she was done.

disclaimer: i call my dog an idiot and an asshole with love. she is actually very sweet and very smart (when she wants to be. she got trapped under a desk with a very easy route out, kept whining until i put a piece of popcorn down out of her reach and she went right out. twice. in the same night). also i was nervous she'd get hit by a car at the time, but logically? she's fast and smart and my neighborhood isn't exactly a high traffic area, especially in the evening. the only reason you'd really have to drive on my road is if you live on it lmao

anyway daisy was mostly safe the whole time. we don't just let her roam around the neighborhood of course but she has a tag with our number, a microchip, and a bigger brain than i give her credit for.

<TEXT> i've got a dog that might be a jack russell/beagle (most likely at least some sort of terrier/hound), but she's only 3 years old. i wonder if she'll get cysts like that when she gets old? hope she lives to that age, 16 is great for a dog.

at that age, if it's not harming her i think surgery isn't worth it. the primary goal at that age (in my opinion, i'm no expert) should be comfort over life extension (and a couple cysts likely wouldn't shorten her life anyway lmao).

cysts don't seem to bother dogs that much anyway. my best friend's 7yo chocolate lab has a big old lump on her stomach which i think they've went to the vet for? anyway i think it's just a cyst but it doesn't seem to bother her

hope your dog has a long(er) and happy senior life :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> my 3 year old mutt (terrier/hound mix?) daisy's smart as hell with learning routines. she:

gets off of my lap when i say "okay daisy, time to get up"

hears me getting ready for bed and goes in her crate because she knows she'll get a treat

goes in her crate when i pour her dinner (we used to put her outside if it was nice enough but now she seems to prefer the crate. she's a hungry little hound and my mom doesn't like being bugged while eating, i don't care that much but it's not my decision)

actually likes going to the vet. it's because she gets treats AND a (short) car ride

and here's the most annoying one: she learned to bark at the door to come in and then run away when it gets opened. when she started doing it we'd give her a treat to come in but she's a fat little doggy. she can't have too many treats so now i have to just go out and corral her inside

daisy really likes ice cubes too. when she hears the ice machine on the fridge she'll expect one (and she does get one often since she thinks of them as treats and they have no calories. especially with the heat wave in the us right now)

basically she's a very fast learner. i swear to god the second or third time we took her to the dog park she already knew what dog park meant </TEXT>

<TEXT> all my online friends are tucutes (which is like 3 people at this point) and i've been kicked out of 2 different discord servers just for being transmed. to protect the trans people in the server do you not realize i am fucking trans... what are you protecting them from. i'm not a fucking cyberbully i just live and let fucking live why would you kick anyone from a server with no fucking questions. literally didn't even know i was kicked from the second one until i asked one of the members of the server! i didn't even say anything about being transmed. i'm tired of being called transphobic and being kicked just because someone else SAID i have a fucking opinion

trendercore? bad. people who call themselves transtrenders make me really fucking uncomfortable! tucutes in general make me uncomfortable! legit felt nauseous reading some bs about how truscum are transphobic earlier lmao!!! how the fuck can trans people be transphobic

i'm just tired of arguing. why is the whole online trans community so us vs them and why are they all tucutes. now that it's summer i miss my irl friends who i actually enjoy talking to. if i get called transphobic one more time god will default dance over my fucking corpse </TEXT>

<TEXT> welcome to baltimore! (in advance, if you aren't here yet) where do you come from, if you don't mind me asking?

first off, here's a seating map (which you've probably already seen): https://content.mlb.com/assets/images/3/9/2/257474392/raw.jpg

everything in the first row is on the ground closest to the players. the farther out you go the cheaper the tickets are, last game i went to we sat in like section 66 or so? and the tickets were like 27 bucks each. since the game you're going to is against the red sox, it'll probably be a bit more expensive, but if you can afford it i think it's worth the extra money.

the second row is also on the first floor, but a bit higher. still a good view. overall if you're looking for the best compromise between view and value i'd say this is your best bet.

i've never actually sat above the second row, so this is all from what i've seen of the stadium. the third row of seats is the club level. these seats let you access some lounges and extra food options but it's more expensive.

above that is the second floor. again, never sat up there, so i can't really tell you about the view, but it's probably worth it if you want or need to save the money.

tickets are always cheaper last minute. if you want to buy them at the gate, camden yards opens 2 hours before every game. seating opens a half hour after that. i can't guarantee you'll be able to find four seats together in the exact section you want, especially for a red sox game, but your odds are pretty good.

if you have any more questions, you can call 888-848-BIRD (2473), the official camden yards phone number. enjoy the game, and happy early father's day :) </TEXT>

The slider of the zipper got so worn down that it doesn't even press the teeth together enough to zip it anymore. There are a few poorly sewn holes on the sleeves of the old one.

<TITLE> [Crushes] fellow gays i need advice </TITLE>
<DATE> 2019-04-13 05:10:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> so like. i'm a gay dude in 9th grade. and there's this 10th grader i'm friends with who i'm reaaaally into, like fuckin head over heels for (who i found out was bi after i started crushing on him. thank god). we went to disney world for the band trip last week and i thought shit was getting kinda gay between us. he fell asleep on my shoulder on a bus and it was really nice

but as of this wednesday he has a girlfriend. i cried for a whole day it was cool

idk if it's just jealousy but i don't trust her. i get weird vibes from her and i just... don't like her. might be the jealousy thing but i feel like she won't treat him right. also she seems like... rly clingy? like i didn't see him without her in the hallways or at lunch today and i just don't see this being a healthy relationship. i'd say something to him over the weekend about it but i'm a little coward

this part is definitely the jealousy and i feel like a huge asshole for it but like... i can't fucking stand seeing them together! i just hate it and it feels unfair and i can't say anything to him about it because that just feels like a dick move to me. anyway i can't fucking stand seeing them together and i hate myself for it LMAO!!!

i just want him to be happy but like... i can't be happy with this. maybe i was stupid for thinking i had a chance but this just kinda sucks. i don't get it and i just want it to stop and i want to be able to accept the fact that they're dating but like... i just fuckin can't. every time i see them i either get pissed or feel like crying and i hate it

anyway if y'all got any advice feel free to give it to me this kinda turned into a rant </TEXT>

basically being trans itself kinda sucks but i'd be a different person if i was cis and i don't want that </TEXT>
