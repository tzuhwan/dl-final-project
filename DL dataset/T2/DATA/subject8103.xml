<TEXT> If at all possible, find someone you can talk to. Maybe you could try online therapy (as its reasonably anonymous)? Or maybe you could share your emotions with a friend you trust, even if it's something you've never done before (your mother dying is a huge thing, people will understand if you behave differently due to that). 

If you can't find therapy or a friend, you can still express it all by writing it down (or making an artwork, or a song, or even just exercising to push out all the emotions). Don't be afraid to baby yourself a bit. If you want to curl up in a fluffy blanket and cry, let it happen, even if it feels a bit dumb. You're allowed to be sad and you're allowed to be hurting. 

In time you should be able to pull yourself back together and do things, but grief is hard, so be ready for it to hit you several times as you rebuild. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the past, reddit didn't provide image uploading. Imgur was used to fill that gap. Most reddit users are familiar with using imgur because it was the default one that everyone used for so long. 

Now that imgur has its own community separate to reddit, and reddit provides its own image uploading, people are starting to upload to reddit directly more often, but it still takes time for things to change. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I understand how you feel, I have a chronic mental health condition and I've seen doctors who accuse me of ridiculous things too (one told me I was doctor-shopping and implied I was a burden on society, and one told me I'm not even trying to get better). 

Thing is, those doctors are idiots. If your doctor is an idiot, ask to see someone else. If no one else is available, your mother had the right approach. Tell them to shut the fuck up with their opinions and do their fucking jobs. Remind them of their responsibilities as doctors to TREAT YOU. 

You don't have to listen to a doctor who doesn't believe you. If the doctor doesn't believe you, the doctor is the one who should be ashamed, not you. You deserve to be treated with respect. You deserve to be believed. You deserve treatment when you are sick. If a doctor isn't meeting your standards, reject them and find a new one. (And file a formal complaint, if you can.) 

Don't go into new meetings thinking "what if he doesn't believe me?", go into it thinking "He better fucking believe me or I will rain hellfire until he does!" (If you know you can't do the hellfire yourself, call your mother or a friend who is good at that sort of thing, or even an advocacy service.) 

You are worthy. Don't let your fear stop you getting the treatment you deserve for your diabetes. I know you can do it. You survived **14 months** with a sinus infection! You got through that. You can get through this too. 

Finally ... If you can't find a way around it, try seeing a psychologist. They could help you to find ways to manage the fear so that it won't affect you so much. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Stop having sex you don't enjoy. Safeword out if you have to. 

You've explained the issue, but to him there are no consequences apart from your unhappiness.

Honestly, if me being unhappy was not enough to change someone's behaviour, I'd be reconsidering the relationship. 

However, maybe he's just not understanding how serious of an issue this is, which is why I think more consequences might help. If he suddenly can't have sex anymore, then **he** will be unhappy too, and so hopefully he'll recognise it's a problem and will be more open to discussing solutions. 

The only solution I've found to a situation where I was sexually dissatisfied in a relationship was to open the relationship, and that only worked because he recognised it was a serious issue to me and wanted me to be happy. I hope you find a solution that involves you both being happy, but the way he's treating you sounds like your relationship might be on its last legs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The only site I know that makes ovipositors is Primal Hardwere, and so I checked there. Looks like they don't sell ones with eggs that small, but here is the ovipositor that they sell with the smallest eggs: [https://www.primalhardwere.com/product/OBLIP](https://www.primalhardwere.com/product/OBLIP) and here is the egg mould for those eggs: [https://www.primalhardwere.com/product/OEGS](https://www.primalhardwere.com/product/OEGS) 

So as you can see there could be a lot of eggs, and they're slightly smaller. Not exactly what you want but not like a couple of big eggs either. Maybe you could try modifying their egg recipe with your own mould to make smaller eggs. 

If that fails, you could try contacting a place that does custom dildos and talking about what you want to see if they're willing to create a suitable ovipositor for you. You'd still probably have to make your own eggs, though, because they'd have to be made of something your body can break down in case they get stuck. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You could try writing about sexual things you'd like to do to each other and see who needs to duck into the bathroom to cum first.

You could have a rule that must be followed, and count every time it's broken (consequences administered later). For example, every time sub stands up they need to ask permission first (maybe in a subtle way, to avoid others catching on). 

Order sub into the bathroom to strip completely naked, edge (or complete some other task), then return. Maybe require proof of some sort (like a selfie?), too. 

You could cuddle together under a blanket and add in some mildly sexual touches (enough to arouse, not enough to draw attention). 

You could watch an in-flight movie and count something (e.g. count how many times the female lead's ass is on screen) and then use that number later in play. 

You could order sub to pretend to be asleep (or to sit in a certain position) for a certain length of time, and see how close they get to estimating the right time. 

You could arrange signals beforehand, for example "Every time I squeeze your hand you need to do some kegels" or "Every time I touch your knee you need to find a way to touch my bare skin within the next minute without anyone noticing" and then make use of the signals during the flight. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You are missing out on a lot, yes. Relationships are complex and allow you to explore a lot of different emotions and experiences that you wouldn't get without a close intimate relationship. 

However, if you're happy with that, that's fine. There are a lot of experiences that people choose to miss out on. If you never go skydiving, you're missing out on the emotions and experiences that go along with that, but many people choose to miss those and they're still perfectly happy. If you never have children, you're missing out on emotions and experiences that go along with that, but many people choose not to have children (or they are unable to) and they still have happy lives. My point is, you can choose not to experience some things and still have a happy life, and that's up to you. (And if you're happy without a relationship, stop reading here, because the rest is about how to find relationships.) 

If you WANT a relationship, that's ok too. There are different types of relationships you can have: 

* Casual or short-term relationship. 
* Serious/committed relationship 

If you want a short-term relationship, it's a lot easier to get into, because long-term compatibility is not really a consideration. A lot of people do more short-term relationships when they're young (teenagers, early 20s), so you're still in time to get involved in that if you want to. Basically, the way you get into a short-term relationship is you think "Do I get on ok with this person? Great! Let's go on a date." Then, if the date goes well, you continue the relationship until you come across something you can't accept or until you want to end it for some other reason. If the date goes badly, you tell them it's not working out and don't see them again. Short-term relationships are easy to get into because the bar to start one is very low. You can probably find suitable partners for this on dating sites. 

If you're looking for a serious, committed relationship, it's a lot harder to find because 90% of the dating pool gets rejected automatically. They might be good people, and fun to spend time with, but you don't want to spend the rest of your life with them and so you don't date them if you're thinking long-term. It sounds like maybe you're wired to look for more serious relationships, so it makes sense you haven't found the right person yet. A lot of people settle down more once they reach their mid to late 20s, so before that point, it's harder to find someone for a serious long-term relationship (not impossible, just harder). It's also harder to know where to look, because dating sites have a LOT of people seeking casual relationships and very few looking for something more serious. I think the best way to find suitable partners for long-term relationships is just to meet a lot of people and make lots of friends, then allow relationships to escalate romantically/sexually if you feel the connection and it feels right. (You might notice that short-term dating would lead into this quite well because it involves meeting and dating a lot of people - for some people it's very effective, but for others the series of dates is exhausting. If you're in the "find it exhausting" category, it's better to find someone you connect with as friends before you start dating.) 

For me personally, when I'm looking for a partner, I start looking for new friends. Both of my long-term partners have been people who I initially described as a friend (then became a FWB, then FWB/best friend, and then decided to start dating). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Whether she has been sexually abused or not, it sounds like a therapist is a good idea. Suicidal ideation and pornographic imagery are huge warning signs. 

If she has been sexually abused in some way, therapy will be the right environment to allow her to talk about it. If she hasn't, therapy can help her to deal with her emotions and suicidal feelings in a more productive way. 

If your parents don't care, they are not caring for your sister adequately, and she deserves better. Hopefully they will be willing to let her attend therapy, but if they're not, consider contacting child protective services so she can get the help she needs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've heard that atypical antidepressants can help, if used in addition to or instead of current medication. 

I've also heard that if your condition is stable enough, you can skip your meds for one or two days and that gives some people enough of a window to be able to orgasm. 

I've heard that if your condition is stable, some people can potentially wean off medication totally (though for some this is not an option). 

Obviously run all of this past your psychiatrist before you try any of it, this is just what I've heard from other people when I've read discussions about this (in the end I just stopped taking medication altogether, but that might not be the right option for you). </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you think of therapy as this place where you go to and share all of your secrets right away, it can be hard to go (especially if you're naturally a private person). 

I think of it like a series of steps. The first step is just to go and see if you like the therapist. Say hello, find out what it's like, see if the therapist seems friendly or not. 

After you're comfortable, you can move on to the second step, where you try to share something more personal. (If you never feel comfortable with the therapist, the first therapist might not be right for you and you could try a new therapist.) 

Third step might be to share something more, or it might be to start working on a problem you've shared, or it might be something else. It's fine to discuss with the therapist what the next step is (and to suggest changes to it if their version doesn't match what you want). 

I think the most important part is just to go and give it a try. You don't have to immediately trust them with everything. Some people are ok with sharing everything right away, but I think most people take some time to get comfortable and that's ok too. </TEXT>

If it's something you'd *like* but not a need, then you can put it aside if she's not interested.

<TEXT> My partner and I have taken breaks before. Sometimes it takes him a while to get his head around something, and he thinks best while he's on his own. The first few times he's said he needs a break for a week or two, I was *extremely upset* but now I know it's just part of how he processes things. He doesn't mean a permanent break, he means he needs time to process and he can't do that while I'm talking to him. (And usually the "week or two" ends up being two or three days.) 

In another relationship, I've initiated a break-up where we ended up getting back together. 

I think taking a break, or initiating a break-up is a sign that there is something wrong and that it needs to be discussed and worked through. It's normal to be insecure in the relationship after something like that, so don't be angry at yourself. It takes time to rebuild that security. 

If you can talk openly about everything together and try to understand each other with compassion and compromise (as well as being clear about things you need) then your relationship still has a chance. 

If you can discuss and understand what happened and why and how you're going to handle it in future so it doesn't reach breaking point, then your relationship will be even stronger moving forwards. On the other hand, if you can't have that open communication, or you can't reach that understanding, or you can't find a way to compromise so you both get what you need, then its better the relationship ends. 

I hope whatever happens, you get the outcome that is better for you in the long-term. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I get triggered, the most important thing is to remove myself from the triggers. So, maybe you could stay off social media for a few days (or at least one day) until you're feeling more stable, and when you go back, be careful and have a plan for what you'll do if you come across something triggering again. 

I also try to focus on distraction. Usually the trigger is just momentary because it's based on how something external has made me feel, so once that external trigger is gone the feeling goes away. So, I usually read a book, or play video games, or go for a walk outside. Anything that I know, for sure, won't be triggering, and that will help me to take my mind somewhere safer. 

If it's the event itself that's triggering you, even without the social media reminding you, then that is probably a sign that you're having trouble coping with it (and I don't blame you, suicide is hard to cope with). When I'm having trouble coping with my emotions and it's making me want to self-harm, I try to do things that let me process and release emotions in healthy ways. There are a lot of options, but here are some you could try: 

* Write a letter (can be to anyone you want to address, or to no one in particular) 
* Look at an [emotion wheel](https://www.worldanvil.com/i/254918) and try to identify every emotion you are feeling 
* Talk about how you're feeling with a friend, family member, mentor, or therapist 
* Punch a pillow
* Exercise 
* Go for a walk and think everything over 
* Cry

There are probably more things, but you get the idea. Anything that releases your emotions in a healthy way is a good idea. Anything that emotionally feels like self harm is a bad idea. 

Stay safe :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think you're right - kicking her out is probably unfair. Instead I think you should give her some warning so that she has a chance to make some new plans. Give her a month or two to organise a new place to live. (Unless you think living with her for an extra month or two will significantly damage your mental health - if that is the case then you have to protect yourself first.) 

If she doesn't use those two months to organise a new place to live, that isn't your fault. You give her the chance, but you don't have to do it for her. If the end of the two months comes and she hasn't found somewhere else, kick her out. Give her information for homeless shelters. Let her handle it from there. (Most likely this won't be necessary because she'll find someone else to pay her rent for her, as you have been. And as her boss was doing before you.) 

Talk more about this with your therapist, once you see them. They might have some other ideas for you. </TEXT>

Grounding exercises or techniques can help ([here is a PDF with some examples](https://sydney.edu.au/content/dam/students/documents/counselling-and-mental-health-support/grounding-techniques.pdf)), but if it keeps bothering you then you should talk about it with a specialist. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think you need to give it longer than 20 minutes. Mental health services are always very busy. When I was a teenager calling kids help line, it would take an hour or more (though maybe it's improved since then, that was 10 years ago).

Try calling the mental health line or kids help line and be prepared to wait on hold up to two hours. I used to browse the internet while I waited.

If you're uncomfortable waiting that long on the phone line, you could also try web counselling. There will probably still be a wait time, but you can do other things while you wait.

Here are some web counselling options:

* [Kids help line](https://kidshelpline.com.au/get-help/webchat-counselling)
* [Counselling Online](https://www.counsellingonline.org.au/) (for people affected by alcohol or other drugs)
* [Lifeline](https://www.lifeline.org.au/get-help/online-services/crisis-chat) (if you're feeling suicidal)

You can also just talk about it with your GP and see what services they recommend. They usually know what services are available in your area better than anyone online could. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No. If your life goal is to get married, you'll be miserable if it doesn't happen. It puts the failure on **you**, even though the real failure is in all the people who failed to be good enough for you to marry, or the mutual mistakes made in previous relationships. 

And you'll pursue marriage even when you should give up on it (e.g. if a relationship should end, but maybe he'll propose soon and you don't want to ruin your life goal and have to start over...). 

I think if you want to make a life goal around marriage, you should be clear that the goal is more about building that level of relationship so that you'd want to marry your partner, and not about checking a box. And you shouldn't set a time limit on it, because if you feel like you're running out of time your standards will drop. 

The other option is to make it a life goal with a specific partner in mind. Like, "I want to marry my partner" could be considered a life goal (but even so, it should be more about how you want the fulfilling relationship you currently have to continue). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I deal with something similar. It's not really a kink, but sometimes I just want to sit on my partner's lap and snuggle into his chest. It doesn't work, because I'm both taller and heavier than he is, so sitting on his lap means my head is nowhere near his chest height (in fact he's more at MY chest height), and if I were to put my full weight on his thighs I'd probably hurt him. 

There are multiple ways to work around it - I sit beside him so I can lean over and have my face at about chest height, for example. It's not the **same** but it satisfies that need. I hope you can find something that satisfies your need too, even if it ends up being not quite the same as your original idea. 

Maybe you could see an open-minded style consultant for tips, because they could probably help you find women's clothes that suit your body? </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I read your post, the first thing I think is that you sound young, and your mother might be worried about your long-term future. For example, if you break up with your stepsister, it could make things very difficult in the future (especially if your sister has done bad things in the past, your mother might be worried she will go back to that if you break up). 

Even if you don't break up, a sibling relationship (even between step-siblings) could receive a lot of judgement from the society around you. Even if it's technically legal, you know people are going to judge you if you reveal to them about your relationship (why else would you keep it secret?). That means that long-term, you'll have to either break up, or deal with being judged for the rest of your life. Either of those outcomes could hurt you and your mother could be worried about that too. 

Even if your relationship goes as well as it possibly can, and you end up wanting to get married, that too might be difficult. I know in my country, marriage to a step-sibling is illegal, and it might be the same in yours too (even if dating your step-sister is legal, there might be different laws for marriage). 

Finally, what is the age gap between you and your step-sister? If there is a significant age gap, your mother might be worried about child grooming laws, sexual abuse, and criminal charges. 

My advice to you is to think about why your mother doesn't want you to be together. What are her reasons? Then think what you're going to do about each problem she has, so that you give yourself and your step-sister the best possible future. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I listen to them, pretend they are totally right, then ask questions to further understand their wisdom. For example, one man was telling me about how women should stay home and serve their man by taking care of the household and children. I asked him what if her man says he prefers to stay home with the children? Is the woman better off insisting she stay home, or should she listen to what the man says and go to work? If she goes to work, should she try to earn a lot of money and do well in her career to make her man happy, or should she stay silent at work and do badly on purpose so that the men working there feel better about themselves? If she stays home, should she try to force her man to get a job, or should she ignore that they have no income and let the family starve? 

Usually they give up talking to me because I "just don't understand" but it always amuses me watching them trying to answer these questions. And sometimes they'll ask them back to me (like "What would you do then if you're so smart?") which gives me a good opening to talk about how I believe in gender equality and flexibility that allows everyone to fulfill a role that they enjoy while still being treated with respect. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree that feeling depressed or anxious is not an illness by itself. 

However, feeling depressed or anxious *all the time* and in response to *everyday situations* is an illness. I make this comparison all the time when I'm explaining what it's like having severe social anxiety disorder: If you're meeting a celebrity, it's completely normal to get anxious about it, and maybe you have trouble sleeping the night before as a result of that anxiety. That's normal. If you're meeting your best friend for a catch-up over coffee, and you get anxious over it and can't sleep the night before, that's **not** normal. I get that anxious every single time. 

And if you expand that out into all of the multiple areas that I have abnormal levels of anxiety in, like speaking with family, going for walks in the park, shopping, employment... it becomes obvious that there is an overarching problem. The problem is not caused by stress. It gets worse when I'm stressed, but even if everything is great *I'm still not able to function like other people would*. 

At that point, it's an illness. 

This is the same for other mood-related mental illnesses (like anxiety and depression) too. It's not like **just** feeling depressed or anxious is an illness, it's when you feel that way *all the time* and *for no real reason* that it becomes an illness. </TEXT>

For example:

Also, your comparison is ridiculous, because "a light pop on the mouth" would be wrong if done to a child too. "A light smack on the bottom" would be a more accurate description of how people punish children without being abusive. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You can't make the wife like the relationship more. She doesn't seem to like being in a poly relationship much. You can't MAKE her like it. She doesn't. 

You can't cure the husband's depression. If he starts saying things like "How will I go on?" you say "You'll get some therapy and you'll find a way." You don't immediately do whatever he wants, because that just reinforces that he NEEDS you to do what he wants to be happy. 

The wife resents you. The husband is manipulative (not deliberately, but he's not trying to avoid it either - I have depression and I never say shit like that). They are both unstable, this relationship is unstable, and its likely to damage you even more if you continue with it. 

I suppose if you want to improve things, maybe each of you could get individual therapy to get better at owning your own emotions (particularly husband and wife, but I suspect if you're putting up with this you might need some too). That would be an absolute necessity. Then, on top of that, you could try poly-friendly relationship counselling to help you to improve the relationship. 

I also think you should read more about how healthy poly relationships work, so you can recognise warning signs and situations that will lead to unhealthy relationships. 

You deserve fulfilling and loving relationships that make you happy and I hope you can find them, whether with these people or with others. </TEXT>

It's good to boost how you feel about yourself, but it's bad to rely on sex as the only option you have (though, if it's all you have, keep doing it! Just keep working on finding other ways too). 

I like to use sex as affirmation of how great I am. Not that I am only great as a sexual person, but that my sexuality is an expression of how I can enjoy my body and allow other people to enjoy my body, as well as enjoying them in return.

<TEXT> I don't think you can change other people's nude-happy parties to have more restrictive rules just for your benefit. Especially because the nudity is probably something they specifically searched for and wanted when joining the group. 

I think there might be room to suggest a compromise, though. For example, maybe you could suggest that there be one area of the party that is a lingerie/clothed-people area (that way you could have somewhere to feel comfortable, and you'd know to be ready if you venture outside the room/rooms)? Or maybe you could suggest that the party only becomes clothing-optional after a certain time (e.g. first two hours, no nudity unless in private, afterwards nudity anywhere)? Or maybe you could find alternative solutions that would help you feel more comfortable, like people putting towels down before they sit, or rules about not directing sexual arousal towards people without their permission. If the host of the party is willing to work with you then these are all potential compromises that could work .

If the host of the party is not willing to work with you to make you feel comfortable, then they don't sound like the sort of group you want to be with anyway. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know you mean well but I'm not sure this message is suitable for everyone. It has a lot of underlying assumptions about people who self-harm. 

For example, I have problems with self-harm, but I don't have a lifetime of hiding scars and making up stories because I just wear normal clothes and tell the truth if someone asks about the scars (either "Nothing I want to talk about" or "self-harm"). 

Also ... there are lots of people willing to help, yes, but that doesn't mean they actually *can* help. Sometimes what you need is not something that is available to you (e.g. what I needed last time was to feel more in control of my own life, but external circumstances meant that it wasn't really possible and talking to someone else would not have helped). Knowing that there are people out there willing to give you things you *don't* need doesn't help very much and can even make it worse.

That usually helps because my biggest problem is that I get absorbed in what I'm doing so I think "I'll do it after I do this small thing" but then I forget. The trick is that reminders 2 and 3 should take about however long it takes you to finish off the small thing you want to do, but not long enough that you start doing something else.

<TEXT> When I first started having sex I had trouble with this because we'd both move on each thrust, but we'd move too much and then we'd be too far apart. We fixed it by picking one person to thrust, the other stays still. (And of course now I have more experience it's less of an issue because I'm more familiar with how things should feel.) 

It's also less of an issue in certain positions, so maybe you could try some other positions if you haven't done that already. (For ideas, you could google sex positions for deeper penetration.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I hope things work out for you. It sounds like everything is progressing pretty well and with good communication, so it looks good so far :) 

The biggest warning sign that I missed with my ex was just that he **never** brought up any problems. I thought that was because he didn't really have any, and he was just a laid-back kind of guy who preferred to take things as they come ... I was naive in that. I don't think I'd make that mistake again. Even if he's really laid-back, discussions about potential problems, and about what we want our relationship to be, are important (even if the outcome is just "I'm not sure", we still need to **have** that discussion). I thought our communication was good because we discussed things and made plans and understood each other, but ... in the end it wasn't as good as I'd thought, because he'd been hiding all this stuff from me and somehow I didn't even notice. I should have noticed, and I should have asked, but he also should have told me. So I guess I'd say just be careful to communicate everything (which it sounds like you are). 

In response to your other question, my husband is monogamous, so his side is closed. My boyfriend is married (which I guess makes us more of an N than a V, but I don't spend any time with his wife so it feels more like a V). I think my boyfriend is open in the same way I am - he's not opposed to new relationships, but not really looking for one and doesn't really have time for another relationship anyway. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you found a willing partner who is a citizen of another country and got married to him, most countries would allow you to immigrate there as his wife. Depending on what country, how long you wanted to stay, and your career, you could also stay temporarily on a tourist visa or even long-term/permanently as a worker (depending on what that country allows). Of course, as a slave, you would probably be trafficked illegally so immigration laws (and any other laws) would probably not apply. 

I would like to add that your idea is *extremely* unsafe (i.e. you could easily become a victim of human trafficking through multiple countries against your will, or even just straight up murdered) and I think it is probably better to find someone you trust in your own country and then roleplay this fantasy with them. If you find someone you trust enough and you have a long-term relationship with them, then you could travel to another country together as tourists and act out the fantasy with them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm curious, how did you meet your husband? Is he controlling in other ways? Not wanting you to have friends because he'd get "jealous" seems like a red flag, and him marrying a woman with severe trauma and cPTSD is also a warning sign (not saying you should never get married, just that because of your background you need to be slightly more careful than other people when choosing partners, because some predatory types will try to take advantage of women who are in that situation). 

I agree with you that you need friends. Everyone needs friends. If he's jealous of the one-on-one time with other men, can you make female friends? Or maybe you could join a hobby group or a class? Those are some healthy ways to meet people for friendship only. You could also try meeting new people with your husband, for example, going on group outings to meet other couple-friends together. 

In future, if you're still sure you want a polyamorous relationship, you'll have to leave your husband. This is why I suggested exploring friendships that he **does** approve of for now, so you can build up your strength and support network. If you're still in therapy, you should also talk about this with your therapist and see if you can come up with some strategies to help you explore while remaining within the boundaries of your relationship (even if you don't explore everything you want at once, exploring at least a little should help). </TEXT>

<TEXT> What I get from your post is that you don't like your body very much.

Is there a good reason for that? What are you basing it on?

For me, once I started appreciating my body, it changed how I saw everything. It wasn't because I was more physically attractive (in fact it is impossible for it to be related to that, I meet people online and usually without photos being exchanged until we already have a connection). It was because my confidence in myself changed. I realised that I do have value that I bring, and I started projecting that. I'm not the most physically attractive person ever, but I'm able to use my body to live and accomplish my goals and to bring pleasure to myself and others (both sexual and nonsexual pleasures).

It sounds like you don't value anything that you're offering, and it comes across to potential partners. If YOU don't think you're worth it, why would they? If YOU think you're deeply unattractive, who are they to argue with you?

Your current partner has obviously seen through your feelings of unworthiness to understand what does make you attractive, and I think you should speak to her about that. Take on board the positives she sees. They're real. They're you. Own them. Show them off!

Don't start with "my most important feature is my body, which by the way is extremely unattractive". No one is going to be attracted to that. Start with "I have an amazing sense of humour" or "I have really soft hair that's nice to touch" or "I am extremely generous and giving" ... any of the positive qualities that you possess. Your girlfriend probably has some weak points too, but they're not the first thing you notice about her and they're not what defines her. You need to make your own weak points less of a defining feature too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you're looking for labels/terminology to describe your relationship, it sounds like what you want is a V relationship with you as the hinge. I would describe that relationship as closed poly (closed because you're not looking for new relationships, poly because you're with more than one). 

If both of the men are ok with this, then I'm really happy for you all.

If they're not ok with that arrangement, that is valid too, and you'll have to consider carefully how to move forwards with compassion and integrity for all involved. 

The first time I tried being in a V-relationship, one of my partners was ... not really into it. By the time I found out he'd been resenting everything it was too late and that relationship was over (it would have had to end anyway, but I wish he'd said something sooner instead of just ignoring how he felt and letting it destroy things). 

I have since found a different partner and my V this time is very stable and fulfilling and I'm very happy. 

I hope you find happiness in your relationships too. </TEXT>

I think you should let yourself feel upset about it. Sit down and cry (or just allow yourself to wallow in misery for a bit, if crying feels like too much). Then do something nice for yourself to make yourself feel better (I usually eat some chocolate or get a hug with someone I love, but some people go for walks or take bubble baths or get a drink with friends, etc).

<TEXT> If you can find a therapist, that is probably the best option (you could get your mom to go with you so you are more comfortable). 

If a therapist is not an option, you could try doing some self-help or online therapies targeted at social anxiety disorder. If you're willing to put the work in, online programs can be effective (they probably won't cure you completely but they can help you get the anxiety under control enough that you can get more help in other ways). Here is one workbook that helped me (it's free): [https://www.cci.health.wa.gov.au/Resources/Looking-After-Yourself/Social-Anxiety](https://www.cci.health.wa.gov.au/Resources/Looking-After-Yourself/Social-Anxiety) 

You can also google Social Anxiety Workbook to look at the other options out there. If the first one you try doesn't help, try another one, because sometimes it's just that you need to hear it in a slightly different way or sometimes it just takes more than one try to understand everything. If you can't find a way to improve on your own, finding a therapist (with your mom's help) is definitely a good option. 

Life gets so much better once your anxiety is under control. Keep trying, because it will get better eventually (even if it takes a really long time). </TEXT>

After that if you're still not able to sleep then you should see a sleep specialist. They can diagnose and treat sleep disorders (like insomnia, if you have that). They can also advise on how to use melatonin correctly. The sleep specialist I saw said that most forms of melatonin are actually detrimental to healthy sleep patterns, but taking some of the right type at the right times, as a short-term measure, can help. </TEXT>

<TEXT> First, I would talk to your doctor to see if there's another option. For example, maybe you could try a lower dosage, or a medicine that works in a similar way but might have different side-effects? 

If it turns out there is no real alternative, you have to decide what is most important to you. For me, personally, I'd say an extra 10-20 pounds is not going to cause more physical health problems than being chronically depressed does, and your overall health is probably going to be better if your depression is well-managed. Physical health is about more than weight anyway. However, it's your decision and your body so you need to be comfortable with it. What's true for me is not necessarily true for you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel the same way about oral sex. It's just not that great for me. Maybe there is some great sex god of a man out there who could make it great, but that hasn't happened yet and I don't even care. 

I think sex is about finding the things you DO like and enjoying them. For me, that's clitoral stimulation, especially if I have a good vibrator. No matter what else is being done sexually, the clitoral stimulation is what will make me orgasm. Nothing else. (However, including other things *in addition to* the clitoral stimulation can make it more intense or enjoyable for me.) 

You're not the problem. You're still finding out how your body works and finding the things that you enjoy the most in sex. 

What worked for me was to make sure I'm incorporating the things that make me orgasm - if that means I have to masturbate in front of him in order to get there, I do it. When I'm trying sex with a new person, I start from what gives me pleasure or makes me orgasm, then explore adding other sexual things to that. I try not to start from "this is what sex should be" and then add pleasure to that, because I've found that starting from a position where it's not fun makes it difficult to add pleasure, but starting from "this is what I enjoy" and then adding sex means I'm still enjoying it. 

Also, if you can't achieve pleasurable orgasm **no matter what**, then it might be related to birth control (or, if you're taking them, anti-depressants). In that case it might be time to look at changing your birth control or even temporarily stopping it altogether to see if your orgasm becomes more possible (obviously, do not have sex while not on birth control). If you can achieve pleasure and orgasm in some ways, even if they don't involve your partner, then it's probably not because of the birth control. </TEXT>

Even if he's not interested in dating, you can still be friends.

<TEXT> I think it's normal to have some doubts. She's only known him a few months. You say in one of your comments that your ideal situation is that both you and your wife have another partner move in, so I don't think the actual *situation* is a problem, just the timeframe. 

Most of this I think will be resolved by just waiting and talking things over and understanding each other. There's no need to rush into anything. Get to know him better, let him get used to being in a poly relationship, let their relationship play out however it's going to, and then when it feels alright to all of you you can discuss him moving in. A few months is not long enough to move in a partner and I think some discussion about the timeframe and what you and your wife's expectations are for when partners are ready to move in might be a good idea. 

The issue with her having children with multiple partners is more complicated, because it changes one of the rules of your relationship. I don't think it's completely wrong to revisit rules as things change, but it will take time to understand everyone's position and work out what the best solution is. Again, don't rush into anything. It's ok to have doubts. Take your time to think about everything and to understand your perspective and her perspective (and his perspective too), and to make sure everyone involved is fully understanding. Once you're all able to understand each other it will be easier to decide together what should happen moving forward. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The way you're talking about this, it sounds like you love him a lot, but it also sounds like you're stifling your own need to be alone for longer periods of time because you think it will damage your relationship. 

Have you ever actually taken that long-term alone time? Like, maybe a week or two away from him where you travel or work or do whatever you want? 

I think you might find that when you're away from him, you're thinking things like "I wish Sam was here so I could share this with him." You might be looking back at your past time alone with bias, instead of thinking about how it would *actually* be if you were to be alone right now. 

On the other hand, if you find yourself thinking "this is way better", then you might need to renegotiate your relationship to have more long-term alone time. If you had one week a month where you lived separately, would that be enough? Really think about what you need and then talk it over with him. He might surprise you with how accommodating he is (and if he isn't able to accommodate what you need to be happy, then maybe he's not the right person for you, which is better to find out sooner rather than later). </TEXT>

<TEXT> This clinical psychiatrist sounds like an idiot. 

Sometimes you just get a bad doctor or a doctor who is not the right fit or a doctor who just doesn't understand what you're saying. (Replace "doctor" with any specialist you might see.) 

Ask whoever referred you to him to refer you to someone else. You deserve better than 15 minutes of "assessment" and then having your issues trivialised and dismissed. It's completely unacceptable, and you are not the one at fault. He is. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You did really well! You got rid of him after less than a month. 

Now you know you can trust your instincts, and you also know that you're a really kind and generous person because you kept giving him second chances. And you barely wasted any time on him at all. 

This is like the best possible outcome when you end up dating the wrong person. Minimal time wasted, you learn more about yourself, and you're better able to detect problems like this in future. 

Good job! </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you change it, you will have a stamp on your body that shows that you value what your husband wants over your own choice. I suggest not changing it.

There are a few red flags here.

* ~~You got married after only six months.~~ 
* He feels your tattoos diminish your femininity (and therefore your appeal to him)
* You both seem to agree that you need his permission on your tattoo, but he got his without requiring your permission
* He "hates" your tattoo even though it's the exact same design you already agreed on - how could he go from "this is fine" to "I hate this" so easily? Is it just because he wants the final sign-off on the design?
* Why do you need reddit to tell you that it's ok to want to keep your tattoo the way it is?
* Why would your relationship suffer just because you got a tattoo he doesn't like?

I don't think all of these are *necessarily* problems, but there are some warning signs. Is he controlling in other ways?

<TEXT>  I got up upset he wasn't helping but at didn't say anything else and  continued to tidy up. When he came out of the office I initiated the  conversation and it evolved to him saying that I must ask for help when I  need it 

You got upset he wasn't helping, but instead of asking him to help, you did everything yourself and then resented him for not noticing. Then, when you told him about it, he told you to ask next time. 

This part seems completely reasonable. 

I agree that having to ask every time is dumb too, but it also sounds like you're both in a position where the cleaning just kind of ... waits. So it's not really his fault that it's not being done, it's a mutual problem. 

You should discuss together and agree on what needs to be done, and how often, and then you need to split the work. 

If he continues to avoid helping out with housework *after* you've agreed on what's reasonable for each of you, then you need to rethink things, but for now I don't think he's done anything wrong. 

(Also, if both of you don't want to do housework, but you also want the house to be cleaner, hire a cleaning service.) </TEXT>

<TEXT>  He thinks that I'm not being sensitive to his feelings and ignoring them by choosing to dress the way that I want... 

You are. Because his feelings are *irrelevant*. 

When he tells you how to dress, and thinks that his opinion on what you're wearing matters more than your own, he's treating you like property. He even calls you property in his explanation. He doesn't want you to be "public property" because he wants you to be **his** property. At no point does he consider that you are an equal with your own agency and ability to make decisions. 

You're not property (not his property, not public property). You're a person. You dress however you want. 

There is no way to get this point across to him without hurting his feelings, because property doesn't get to have opinions. He will be looking to "correct" you, not to understand you. 

You are approaching this like it's an equal partnership, but if he treats you like property, he's not. 

Try explaining this to him (don't bother to spare his feelings, because there is no nice way to say "You are objectifying me and devaluing me and I deserve better than how you are treating me"). I suspect he won't listen, because why would he listen to what his property says if he disagrees with it? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Therapy is probably her best option, if she can find someone that can be helpful. 

In the meantime, I have a few ideas of things she can try. (Disclaimer: If any of these ideas make things worse for her, STOP. I'm not an expert, so she should definitely listen to her own body more than she listens to me. Also she should know that none of this stuff has to be done exactly how I say it. If I talk about something that seems dumb it's fine to just change it to something less dumb.) 

* Does she still enjoy non-sexual touch? For example, could her boyfriend give her a massage (fully-dressed, no sexual contact at all). If she is ok with that, she could use it as a starting point - when she's ready, she can ask him to touch her somewhere more sexual, or ask him to massage her without clothes. 
* Is she thinking something that causes her to lose interest in sex? Is there any way to change the sex to trigger those thoughts less? For example, maybe she looks around the room and sees the wallpaper and it reminds her of what happened, and that ruins the moment for her. If that's the case, she could try changing things around so that what they're doing reminds her less. Maybe they could try to have sex in a different room than usual, or repainting the room. Then as she gets more comfortable, she could gradually start to work her way back to being comfortable in all situations (one tiny step at a time, and only when she's ready). 
* Does she think about what happened and get aroused, and then feel bad for being aroused? This is a thing that happens to some people who have been sexually assaulted or raped. There isn't really a solution that I know of, but she should know that it is normal if it has happened to her. (If this doesn't happen, it's still normal. Either situation is completely normal.) 
* Would she feel better if she was more in control of the situation? For example, maybe if she orders her boyfriend around, or blindfolds him, then she tells him what she's going to do to him. 
* Would she feel better if she was **less** in control of the situation? For example, maybe her boyfriend could blindfold her, and then tell her what he's going to do before he does it. (Obviously in this scenario it needs to be clear that she can stop things at any time for any reason - make sure to keep open and constant communication going to prevent re-traumatising her.) 
* For a lot of people who have been sexually assaulted or raped, consent is very important. She and her boyfriend could try asking before they do anything at all. For example, "Can I touch your shoulder?" "Can I kiss you?" "Can I kiss you with tongue?" "Can I touch your breast?". Every single step should be checked, and she should say NO at least once. That way she can feel like her consent is respected and she will feel more safe. 
* Can she still enjoy masturbating? If she can, she could try starting with that and gradually increasing his presence until she is comfortable having sex again. (For example, start with masturbating completely alone. Then masturbate with him in the room next door. Then the same room. Then the same room while he sits beside her. Then with him touching her breasts. etc) 

All of those things have one thing in common - be careful to respect her consent, and move very slowly. Find things she is comfortable with and focus on those, then add things to them. Stop whenever something feels wrong. 

I'd also add there may be some things she can do to help process the trauma. One thing that works for me is I write everything down, then I decide what I'm going to do about it (usually the answer is "nothing" but I still have to decide that). Then, whenever I think about it later, I remind myself I have already dealt with it and decided what to do, and I continue following my plan of what to do. (Note, this approach might not work for everyone. If she thinks it sounds helpful, great! If she thinks it sounds like it would make things worse, do NOT do it. If she's not sure, she could give it a try and be careful and ready to stop if things start to get bad.) 

She could also make a stick figure drawing of the police guy and then draw all the bad things that are going to happen to him. For example, maybe he's going to walk in a puddle and get his socks wet and have to walk around with wet socks ALL DAY. Or maybe he's going to get stabbed by a drug dealer in an alleyway. Or maybe his dick will get caught in a meat grinder. Or maybe he'll drop his phone and have to buy a new one. (I know some of these are less serious than others, but I find it helpful to think up minor inconveniences as well as major bad things because then you can be more creative with all of the suffering he will have.) Or she could just burn the drawing, that can help too. 

I hope this gives you some ideas and I hope your friend makes a quick recovery. No one deserves to be treated like that :( </TEXT>

<TEXT> If your husband is actually improving, he should be able to lay out to the friend what his plan for the future is. It might not include meeting "friends" for a while yet, but he should at least be able to communicate that. It probably won't work if you convey the plans instead, because your friend won't believe your husband is actually getting better. 

Healing from traumatic circumstances and grief that causes you to feel depressed is not the same as *having depression*, and I think some people commenting seem to be confused. Part of healing is definitely leaning on the people you love, but that doesn't mean you're going to lean on EVERYONE. If husband doesn't want to lean on friend, that should be respected, as long as he's leaning on someone (and he is, you are clearly involved and supportive). 

It really annoys me when "friends" can't accept that recovery takes time. And that recovery might be different for other people than it was for them. Your friend means well, so hopefully once he understands that your husband **is** getting better and has a plan for improvement, he will back down and let it happen instead of insisting on doing things his way. So, my advice is just to meet with your friend (at a coffee shop or something, not in your apartment if you don't want guests), explain what the plan is, what the signs of improvement are, and what signs would lead you to get professional help. With luck he will listen and leave you both alone because he'll understand you're not just wallowing in misery needing to be rescued - you're actually thinking things through and planning a strategy to get better. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For me a lot of it is the headspace I'm in. Obviously it's not going to feel exactly the same no matter what, but emotionally it's similar if I can match the headspace and the thought process. 

Sometimes that's as simple as imagining something we're doing as erotic rather than functional (e.g. we're not "getting undressed", we're "watching each other strip off our layers of clothing one by one, unwrapping and baring our bodies..."). 

Sometimes it involves more buildup than I'd like. (e.g. I might be horny and want to start fucking right away, but if I let the foreplay happen instead of diving into sex right away, it gives my mind time to slow down and enjoy what's happening.) 

Sometimes, it means I need my partner to do something in a certain way. Before we do something new my partner always wants to understand how I imagine it, why I want to do it, what I'm looking forward to, etc. and that's because he wants to make sure that while we're doing the new thing, he's hitting all the right buttons for me to enjoy it. (e.g. If we're about to try spanking, there is a huge difference between a situation where I'm dragged across his lap and punished vs a situation where i'm lying on the bed while he caresses and slaps with gradually increasing intensity)

Sometimes, it's roleplaying. This is a great way to bring fantasies alive. Even if your fantasy is not something you're ready to enact yet, or something that isn't safe to enact for whatever reason, exploring it through roleplay can be fun. (For example, a lot of couples who have fantasies of threesomes might act them out using a toy in place of the 3rd person. ) 

Sometimes, it's dirty talk. Dirty talk is a great way to make sure you're both feeding into each other's headspace and sharing the emotional connection to what's happening physically. For example, if your partner starts talking about how much they own your body, you know that they're currently feeling physically possessive and you can respond in ways that feed into that and encourage their emotional arousal. You can also express the things that are currently turning you on, or that you want to do, so that your partner can respond to you and feed your emotional arousal as well. This way you build a shared idea of what you're both currently doing and enjoying, and it adds another layer to the physical sensation of what's happening. 

Sometimes .. it's just trying it more than once. The first time I had sex I didn't have the knowledge or experience to be able to enjoy it as much as I do now. So if there's an activity that you thought you'd be into, but it wasn't great the first time, it's ok to adjust what you're doing and try it again in a way that you think might be more enjoyable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's not really much you can do to help, comfort is difficult via text and there isn't really a cure for a breakup except time. 

You could try offering hugs (via text). Just saying "that sounds bad i am so sorry. hugs if you want them" can make a huge difference (however, be careful with the hugs because some people interpret that as flirtatious). I really like this approach (but I imagine things very well, so imagining hugs actually helps ... maybe not for everyone). 

You could also try distractions. If talking/listening doesn't seem to change anything, maybe a break where you talk about something else instead and just laugh about things could be good. 

Finally, you could try asking her what she wants. Like "I feel like I'm not really helping here and I want to help. Is there anything else I could say or do for you that might help?" </TEXT>

You could try talking about how his excessive gaming makes you feel. Not the fact that he plays games, but the fact that it eats up ALL of his free time means that you are upset, hurt, neglected (etc). Talk about how it impacts you and makes you unhappy. This is the only time that how much he loves you MIGHT impact the outcome of this conversation. 

You could also try pointing out that if he needs 50+ hours per week of relaxation, he probably needs therapy to handle all of the stress he must be under (because if you NEED 50+ hours per week of gaming to relax, then you are under some intense levels of stress). 

Both of those things are aimed at showing him there is a problem, but it won't work if he doesn't agree with you that those things are problems. 

Once he agrees there is a problem, you can start discussing potential ways to resolve it. 

After that there's only really ultimatum (something like "I can't stay in a relationship where I am ignored and hurt every day. I need one date night per week or I'm leaving") or, if that fails, breaking up. </TEXT>

He's not supportive. He makes all your achievements about him (you got a job with NO experience and you can't celebrate, because *it makes him feel insecure*). He is dismissive of your abilities (giving advice you don't ask for, describing the job you got as a "big girl job"). He criticises you for having friends. 

He thinks you being sexually assaulted in the back of a car is the same as him trying (and *failing*!) to have an affair with his ex. Those are completely different events - you are not responsible for *being assaulted*! He is fully responsible for everything he said to his ex. 

His judgement is off. He's insecure, and he's holding you back. He's not helping you to improve your life. He blames you for being assaulted, even though that was out of your control. 

You don't have to stay with him. You deserve someone who can be your equal. 

If you want to give him another chance, explain this position to him. Explain that he's holding you back with his insecurities. Explain that nothing he's done has helped to improve his own life. Explain that right now, you're the only person holding things together, and he needs to start sharing the load. 

Hopefully he listens and agrees to start pulling his weight.

You have a girlfriend. You like being with her. So continue with that. 

You like being ENM and having the chance to explore other options. So continue with that. 

Whether she explores others or not isn't really relevant. You should focus on continuing with what YOU want in your life, not with competing with the woman you love on how many hookups you can get. 

It's not selfish to want more options, or to be frustrated or sad that you don't have as many options as you'd like. Those are all valid emotions and completely understandable. However, none of those emotions are her fault. Erasing or changing your relationship with her is unlikely to resolve them, because they are internal to you and not caused by her.

<TEXT> Thanks, I'm glad I could help :) 

What I did might not work for you but basically ... I just stopped trying to share problems with the people I knew didn't care, and I started spending time with new people more often, and sharing with them when it felt right. I joined a few new groups so I could meet new people, and I started talking more to the people I already knew that seemed more understanding. 

Once I had more supportive people around, I just naturally wanted to spend less time with the people who didn't understand. It got easy to stop going places with them because I didn't feel as close to them anymore and so I didn't really want to spend as much time with them. 

I am much happier now. I have less friends, but I don't have to worry about being judged if I mention my mental health now and for me that's worth it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Demonstrate value" means you go in there with a list of things you've done that justify your pay being increased. For example, you could say "At \[previous pay level\] I did a, b, c. Now I do a, b, c AND x, y, z which results in \[amazing outcome for the company\]. This outcome would be impossible without my expertise and the extra responsibilities I have taken on and I feel my increased responsibilities and improved outcomes demonstrate that I deserve a raise." 

You should bring any documentation you can get that will support what you're saying. You're basically just explaining how you make lots of money for them by being amazing, so you deserve to be paid more. 

In terms of needing more people to talk about you ... that could mean a lot of things. I guess one thing you could do is to start updating people on your role and what you're doing for them more often, so that they know you exist and they can talk about how great you are. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly ... not everyone is capable of being supportive of someone with a mental health condition. 

For me, it's extremely important that my friends can handle it if I say something relating to my mental health. I just *don't want* a friend group who can't help. This limits who I'm friends with. 

I don't think you should just abandon your friends though. 

First, there are a lot of people who are uncomfortable with mental health, but you can still teach them how to help you. I'm guessing your friends might fall into that category because they probably care about you even if they don't know what to say. So, on a day when you're feeling more stable and able to handle questions that might feel invasive, you should sit down and discuss with a friend how they respond to you when you say something like that. You could open the discussion with something like "I've noticed that when I talk about my depression, you often don't really respond. Why is that?" From there, you can either reassure them that anything they say is fine ("Don't worry about the exact wording, I won't be offended. As long as what you're saying shows you care then it's fine") or you can gently correct them if they have some bad ideas ("It doesn't actually help when you ignore it. It makes me feel worse because I feel like I've shared some vulnerability with you and then when you ignore it, it feels like you don't care"). Once you're both aware of what the boundaries are, it is much easier to have the real conversations when they happen. 

You should also give positive feedback to people when they are supportive. Once your depressive episode has passed, it's really good to contact the people who supported you (even if it was just a kind word or checking in on you) and to thank them and let them know that it did help. I have found this encourages people to be much more supportive, because when I'm really depressed and someone shows they care about me, I don't really respond in a way they can see. I'm still depressed. So contacting them later and letting them know that it helped means they know they should continue. 

Also, if teaching them how to help you fails, they can still be good friends. Some people are good listeners, and some people are better at distracting you when you DON'T want to talk about your problems. If I want to talk everything over, my best friend is an amazing listener and can help me resolve anything. If I want to forget any problems exist, I can look in the group chat with my other friends and join in a conversation about movies we've watched recently. You can have both types of friends. 

Finally ... some people are incapable of caring. The reality is some people do judge you for having a mental health condition, no matter what the condition is. I think it's unlikely your friends are all like this, but if they are, there is nothing you can do to change them. You can either accept that you can never share that part of yourself with them, or you can do a slow fade and find new friends. 

No matter what, I don't think you should abandon all your friends. If it turns out they don't want to support you, it's time to start looking for new friends, but you can still keep the old ones around as backup until you've found some solid friendships to move forwards with. </TEXT>

2 - no, but I would make it clear i didn't agree with that choice. If they were cheating AND doing other disrespectful/unsafe things (e.g. insulting their partner, or having unprotected sex) then i might tell. I probably wouldn't be friends with someone like that to begin with, though. 

3 - I'd give the one cheating the chance to tell their partner first, but if they didn't, I'd tell

It's also possible that what you're attracted to is people with good communication skills, or people who are willing to discuss being open to a certain degree (but not necessarily poly). 

I think from what you're saying, poly is not for you, but there are probably some elements of those doms that are attracting you. You need to work out what those elements are so you can find the right person to meet your needs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I start getting shaky and can't breathe, I write myself lists. Then I do one thing on the list at a time. 

Here is a list I would write for you: 

* Google domestic violence hotline USA (replace 'USA' with whatever country you are in). Even if he is not as violent as some people are, the hotline is there to help people in abusive relationships so they will still be happy to help you too. 
* Choose a good time to call the hotline (when your husband is out, or when you are out somewhere without him) 
* Call them
* Talk to them about your situation and ask for their help making a plan. 
* Listen to their advice and let them help you make the plan. Either memorise the plan, write the plan down and put it somewhere safe that he can't find it, or get them to email it to you at a safe account he can't access. 
* If you forget the plan or lose the plan or get stuck on one step, it's ok to call back and ask for more help (as often as you need). 
* Follow the plan to safely get away from him 

Remember ... if it's too much, just focus on one step at a time. You can do this. You and your daughter deserve a life without abuse. 

Stay safe OP. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not your fault. She got broken up with because she cheated on you. It was the consequences of her own actions and if she was too mentally unwell to handle that, that's NOT YOUR FAULT. 

There are so many ways she could have been saved, but none of it was anyone's fault: 

* The guy she cheated with could have refused to be involved with her
* Your friend could have not told you about it
* You could have pretended it was fine and lived with a cheating partner forever
* She could have handled being broken up with in a better way
* She could have gotten help for how she was feeling
* She could have told her parents/friends/family about her plans
* She could have decided **not** to end her life
* Her parents/friends/family could have checked in on her more regularly
* Her parents/friends/family could have noticed some warning signs and gotten her help 
* The mental health system could have been better so that she could have known/used other options (like therapy) 

Just because you COULD have done one action that saved her doesn't make it your fault. Your action was totally reasonable. Your mother is crazy to blame you. Your ex's parents are crazy to blame you too (but it's more understandable, they are grieving and looking for someone to blame so they don't blame themselves). 

In reality, it is no one's fault. Tragic events happen. 

I'm sorry for your loss. Even if she was your ex, she was still someone who was close to you for a long time and it must be hard knowing she's died. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You already set a boundary - you don't want to hear about her fights with her husband so often. She ignored it, and you chose not to enforce it. 

Now you need to make your boundaries very clear, and you need to enforce them. Tell her "I will not hear about your husband more than once per month" (or however much is acceptable to you - not at all is fine too). Then, when she talks about her husband outside of your agreed-upon boundaries, you need to stop the conversation. 

Interrupt her. Tell her "I've said I don't want to hear about him. Have you watched the latest episode of that TV show yet?" Hopefully she will take the hint. 

If she keeps talking about him, interrupt her again. Say something like "I'm happy to spend time with you, but not if you're going to ignore our agreed limits. I'm going to leave now." Then LEAVE. She will probably be very upset. You will feel like a horrible person. But, if you keep doing it, she will respect your boundaries. 

It may also help her, because it will demonstrate to her what healthy boundaries look like in action. Maybe she will learn from it that you CAN walk away when someone doesn't respect you. 

I'd also make sure she has access to a counselor who can help her. Send her this website (assuming you're in the USA): [https://www.thehotline.org/](https://www.thehotline.org/) and give her the phone number on it. That way she can talk to a counselor when she needs to talk about her husband. It won't burden you, AND it gives her a chance to hear a professional's opinion. You can remind her about this hotline every time you need to interrupt her so that she knows you still care, but you're not able to help her. She needs a professional. 

If you can get her into therapy too, that would be great, but that might be a bit hard to arrange. 

I would also consider reporting the situation with her children. They sound traumatised. Maybe you could do it after they've had a situation in public, so that you could deny it and she'd think maybe it's someone who saw the situation unfold. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don't tell him to give up on his dreams because clearly he's not interested in that. However, he needs some serious conversations about SURVIVAL. He needs income. He needs a job. He needs to be doing something so he doesn't end up homeless and starving. 

Lots of extremely talented people worked for years in jobs they weren't passionate about so they could survive while they built up skills and experience in their passion areas. Actors, for example, typically have to pick up other jobs before they get their dream role, or while they're between roles (even famous actors). The same is true for musicians. Many, many musicians have jobs and careers outside of music before they get famous. 

If he doesn't have the audience and he doesn't have the income based on his music to survive, then he needs a job that will give him that. He can continue to work on his music on the side, and in fact it sounds like he should because he is so passionate about it, but he needs MONEY and if his music is not giving him that then he needs to find it somewhere else. 

When he starts talking about how cowardly it is to not follow his dreams, ask him what his plans are. Maybe he has a genuine plan to be homeless for a few months? Maybe he's expecting to move in with you? Once you find out what his plans are (if any) you can think about what your next moves should be. </TEXT>

<TEXT> And for the last several years I have told her as often as I could how  beautiful she was to me and how much I loved her. I try so hard to never  lose hope in her. I get told almost everyday that ik not enough. That  there is no way I could love her that one day ik just going to walk away  and leave her like everyone else has. Almost every single day.

Why are you having this conversation every single day? Stop doing that. It's not productive. If anything, it's feeding her fears, because when she argues with you about it it's validating that it's worth talking about.

Don't get dragged into these endless spiralling conversations. If she's having a bad day, tell her once that she's beautiful and you love her, and then don't argue with her. Remind her you've already had that discussion, and distract her with something else. E.g. "I already told you what I think about that. What would you like for dinner tonight?" If she absolutely won't let it go, put on a movie or start reading a book to her or something. It's really hard to spiral in anxiety when your mind is distracted by a story. 

Also ... consider taking breaks. You don't have to leave her, but you can let someone else in your life take care of her for a while. A friend, a family member... anyone else. If there's no one else she trusts, maybe it's time she start building that trust so you can get a break. You can start with short times, like an hour or so, and build up until you can take a weekend off every few months and know that she's still safe.

Finally ... some therapists are useless. I have met many useless ones. If she had one that wasn't helpful, it doesn't mean *therapy* won't help her. It means *that therapist* won't help her, and she should try someone else. If she's not making progress on her own, therapy is essential. (If she IS making progress then therapy is not essential, but could still be worth trying.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is how it worked for me: 

* See my GP, tell them what's going on 
* They refer me to a psychologist
* Psychologist asks me lots of questions, gets me to fill in some quiz things (on paper) 
* Psychologist comes back and tells me that based on the results, I have social anxiety disorder 

This process basically repeats over the years as I get re-diagnosed by every single new specialist I see. Multiple psychologists. A couple of psychiatrists. They all do the exact same things or some variation of those. Some of them add new things (like, one said "Have you considered that you might be autistic?") and some of them say stupid things (like "You seem fine to me, just get out and do more" ........ idiots). 

Sometimes it takes more than a couple of sessions but the process is basically the same in my experience. It's just interviewing, answering questions, and filling in quizzes or other documentation about how you've been feeling. </TEXT>

If yes, go ahead. Pick somewhere safe (like a hotel room, or at least a meeting at a public place beforehand). I would suggest NOT doing it in his car, because getting into a stranger's car means he could potentially kidnap you much more easily. Take precautions like telling a friend where you'll be, not going "somewhere else" with the guy unless you text your friend that location too, etc.

Anyway, I think the best thing is just to tell her you're getting overwhelmed with how quickly the friendship has been moving, and so you'd like to take several steps back for now. Then explain you'd like to stop texting for now. (Expect her to react very badly to this and not listen to you at all. Have a plan for what you'll do when she texts you despite you saying you don't want her to contact you. If you don't need the plan, that's great, but she sounds a bit intense so it's possible you will need one.)

<TEXT> I agree with you. If he can't be with you on your worst days, what's the point?

I think you should sit him down and explain to him what you need from him. Tell him you need to reconnect with him by going on more dates, and you need his support to find friends (for example, maybe he could come with you to a few meetup groups until you feel more comfortable to go there by yourself). You could also suggest relationship counseling.

Remember he is probably very stressed too, since he also had to move to a new place. Maybe he's struggling too (but you two should talk about it so you can support each other).

If he truly doesn't care about what you need and prefers to ignore your problems, then it might be time to think about leaving him. I hope he is willing to help you instead.

Finally, if you can afford it, it might be a good idea to find therapy for yourself to help with your anxiety and panic problems. </TEXT>

That means your only option is to get away from his parents (sounds like they abuse him too, so hopefully he likes that idea). You say you want to go to your home country - why not do that? Can you bring him with you? He might have less opportunities there but he has NO opportunities when he is trapped with his parents who are enslaving him. Alternatively, can he find a job or somewhere to live by himself? What about with his younger brother that they kicked out? 

If he's unwilling to get away from his parents, and you've talked to him about why/how that could happen, then you don't have many options left. 

You can stay with a boyfriend who is enslaved by parents who mistreat you and him, and cripple your opportunities for success by sabotaging your own studies and happiness, or you can break up with him. 

In the end, the only person you can control is you.

<TEXT> I'm really concerned. She sounds like a sexual predator. She's been flirting with you several times in the past, while you're underage. Some people would call that 'grooming'. She's also propositioned you for sex while your mother is out. You're a minor! (Sure, you'll be 18 soon, but you're not yet.) 

There will be many, many older women happy to have sex with you. Lots of older women enjoy taking the lead and being with younger/inexperienced men. You don't need to have sex with her, and I think you should probably say no just because of how weird the situation is. 

Even if she turns out to be totally normal and not-predatory (unlikely), it's still going to be really awkward if your mom finds out. Or when this friend comes to visit again in future and wants to try it again. Or if she gets pregnant. Or if your mom hears you having sex. 

If you want to hook up with an older woman, find someone who is not your mom's close friend, and who is not staying in your house. If things go bad you will have no way to get away from her. 

That said, I'm sure you're going to ignore me, so here are some other tips: 

If you do go ahead with this, make sure you use a condom (one that she couldn't possibly have sabotaged) if you have sex with her, and make sure that condom is properly disposed of afterwards. Even if she says she's on the pill or something, use a condom anyway. You do NOT want to have a kid with her, and it's possible she could lie to you. 

If she says she's in love with you, she's lying. Almost 100% certain. This is more of a hookup situation than a dating situation, and the age gap means your relationship is not going to be between equals. Do not let her lie to you. 

Also remember you don't owe her anything. Don't let her threaten to tell your mom or pressure you or blackmail you in any way. Only agree to do something if you want to, and if you DON'T want to, it's ok to say no. If she tries to change your mind, just ignore her. She's not going to tell anyone because if she DOES tell anyone, she'll make herself look like a sexual predator. You hold all the power even if it doesn't feel like it. 

If your relationship stops being fun, end it. 

Apart from that ... the sex will probably be different because she'll be more confident and dominating than women who are new to sex. You'll probably enjoy that (but if it gets scary or intimidating or even just a bit faster than you like, it's ok to ask her to slow down or stop at **any** point). 

You won't have to approach her. She will approach you. If that's what you want, then let it happen. 

Stay safe OP. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You need to talk to her and help her learn what you want so she can give it to you. 

For example, you say you want her to be more active. What sort of active do you mean? Do you want her to be enthusiastic about making you cum? Do you want her to move around more? Do you want her to initiate? Do you want her to think of more ideas to try? 

Of each of those there are different things you could try. For example, if you want her to be more enthusiastic about making you cum, you could suggest her asking for your cum as a "new thing" you want to try. Then, when she sees how much it turns you on and how you respond she'll want to continue (make sure you're very positive about it, even if it's not perfect yet, focus on the parts you like). 

It will take time but if she's happy to try new things to satisfy you then you'll be able to teach her what you love so you can enjoy sex more. When I met my partner I had no idea how to satisfy him but I've learned soooo many things now. Just make sure you don't complain about what she's already giving you - she's giving you all the pleasure she can, and so it's important to appreciate that even while exploring new things together that can give you even more. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You'll probably get poop on him at some point (maybe not every time, but if you keep doing it, it will happen sometime). 

Don't worry about it. He knows its your ass. He knows how asses work. If he gets poop on him, he can deal with that. 

If you're really worried, you could try getting him to put a condom over his finger before he puts it in your ass. That way if he DOES get messy, it's easier to clean up. And you can find out that it's not really a big deal. 

If you're not comfortable with it, don't do it, but don't let fear stop you exploring something you want to try either. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That sounds like she's unable to regulate her emotions. Next time she apologises, ask her what she's going to do about it to stop it happening again. She should be committed to seeking therapy, and learning healthier ways to communicate. 

You could also try disengaging when she behaves like that. Don't soothe her, don't engage with her ... just tell her you'll talk to her when she's willing to treat you with respect, and then walk out. 

If she's not willing to make changes, I think you need to seriously consider if your relationship is worth it. Having regular arguments like that is not normal (even having one per *year* would be more than normal). </TEXT>

No one deserves to be treated this way. 

Here are some signs of abusive relationships from different countries: 

Australia - [What are the signs of an abusive relationship?](https://www.whiteribbon.org.au/understand-domestic-violence/what-is-domestic-violence/signs-abusive-relationship/) 

Canada - [Are you in an abusive relationship?](http://maggiesresource.com/are-you-in-an-abusive-relationship-c110.php)

USA - [What is domestic violence?](https://www.thehotline.org/is-this-abuse/abuse-defined/) 

If you want to talk to a counsellor, each of those sites will also have information about how to contact someone who can help you think about your options. If you're in another country and want help finding resources, post your location and someone will help you find options.

<TEXT> For me it helped to think of it like this: 

Everyone has scars. People who had problems with their heart might have scars on their chest from heart surgery. People who had problems with their mental health might have self-harm scars. People who do extreme sports might have scars from injuries. Cancer survivors typically have scars or other lasting impacts from the cancer. We don't judge people with heart surgery scars. We don't judge extreme sports people. We don't judge cancer survivors. Why should we judge you? It's not like you wanted to be sick any more than anyone else. 

Scars are just part of your history. There is no shame in being sick or injured in the past. If anything, those scars show how strong you are because you got through all of that and you're here! Alive! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think you should pick one specific thing to focus on at a time, and then work towards that. So instead of trying to change all of your habits and routine at once, you're only changing one. For example, you could focus on making sure you eat one meal per day at around the same time each day. Other habits like teeth-brushing etc are all good things to do, but they are not the main goal so it doesn't matter if you don't get those. The only one you HAVE to get each day is the one you're working on - eating at around the right time. 

Once you've done that one for three months and it's become routine, do something nice for yourself to celebrate! Buy yourself a present, or take a nice bubblebath, or write yourself a congratulatory letter... something nice for yourself. 

Then add your next goal. You still continue doing your old one, but your old one is routine and easy. Now you have to do a second goal as well (such as brushing your teeth every night as part of your before-bed routine). </TEXT>

<TEXT> For me any replacement thoughts have to be personalised. So first I recognise one thought that is unhelpful, then I think of a suitable replacement for it. 

For your list I'd do something like: 

\- I'm working really hard to remember my university content 

\- I've been working really hard lately and I'm proud of myself and going to take a nap soon. 

\- I care about my dad, but it's not my responsibility to manage his health for him. 

\- My parents are adults and I am not responsible for their financial stability even though I still care for them. 

\- I am aware of my body and its needs, and working on meeting them. 

\- I am doing my best to be a good person. I am proud of myself for the kindness I have shown so far in my life, and I forgive myself for the days I couldn't. 

\- I accept that I have trouble managing my thoughts, but I'm doing my best. 

\- I am not at fault for the situation I was born into, nor for making the best out of my situation. Anyone else would do the same. 

\- The past is the past, and all I can do is to make the best decisions I can going forwards. 

It will probably work better for you if you can personalise the replacement thoughts to something that you can fully believe. So my ideas might not help, but I hope it's at least a starting point for you. </TEXT>

* Say please ("Please can I have it")
* Talk about how much you need/want it ("I need it so much") 
* Talk about how your body feels ("My cock is aching and sensitive") 
* Talk about the emotions you're feeling ("I'm so needy and desperate") 
* Talk about what you're thinking ("All I can think about is you and how much I want you") 
* Describe what you want her to do ("I just need your hand on my cock") 

Mix them all together. Don't worry if what you're saying doesn't make sense, or if you're unfocused, or if you end up saying you want lots of different things at once - you're desperate and needy, after all. You don't have to make sense. </TEXT>

The way I see it, if the relationship is stable and fulfilling, it's worth continuing with. If it ends up not working, that's ok, but it's not necessarily because of the open relationship. 

I agree with you that it's important to consider how this plays out long-term, but if OP and his fiancee both think it will work long-term, they're currently happy, and they're willing to deal with any issues that arise in future, then they're doing pretty well. </TEXT>

You desperately needed something and that woman offered it to you. Not having the self-awareness or self-knowledge to say no doesn't make you a bad person. Especially after going through something as traumatic as *cancer* and *loss of erectile function.* That would shake anyone's self-image! Anyone would need reassurance after that, and it's just sad all around that the only place you could find that is through cheating. 

I hope you have found other, healthier, ways to get what you need now. Don't blame yourself for needing something, just commit to making better decisions going forwards. </TEXT>

I have met men who tell me that toys make them feel inadequate. That's their problem, not mine. They can either get over it or I can find someone else to have sex with, because why would I accept less sexual pleasure just because they're scared of a vibrator making me feel good? 

That's not to say I won't try to explain to them. Like, I'll show them the vibrator, explain it's not the same thing as a partner, show them it's not a threat, etc. At the end of the day though, if he can't accept it then sex isn't going to happen. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I just want to go home. 

If it's at all possible, do this. Tell your company you had a family emergency and go home. (And if it's not possible, that's ok, just make a plan for when you get home.) 

Once you get home start gathering people around you who can help. I don't know what your relationship is like with your family, but if you know they'll support you, call them. Call friends who can let you stay with them for a few days while you work out how to break up with him. 

If you have no one who can help you, call a domestic violence hotline. They can at least talk you through the next steps. 

You don't have to hate him. It's normal to still love your abuser - that's why people stay. Part of loving someone is letting them feel consequences for their actions (like a parent disciplining a child - he's treating you like an angry child lashing out, so you need to give him some consequences for that behaviour by leaving). 

You don't even have to feel strong. You can feel as weak and scared as you like. You can cry for weeks. You can call a friend and get them to sit with you while you cry and you get someone else to pack up your belongings (you can even pay someone to do this if you don't have any friends who will do it). You still need to move out, because you staying alive and physically safe is more important than how much you love him. 

Stay safe OP. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I used to self-harm at 12 and I have no idea what would have helped me, but please don't ignore it like my parents did. Maybe you could try getting him into therapy (the pediatrician will probably refer him for psychological help anyway if they're any good). 

I also am not sure that having a sit-down discussion in front of his parents was the right idea. I understand the thinking behind it but if he trusts you and doesn't trust them, it might be better to talk to him alone if you can in future. (You can always discuss what was said with his parents later if you think it's appropriate, though I think you should definitely warn him that's what will happen if you plan to do that.) 

It sounds like he's having serious issues dealing with his emotions and managing everything - if he's resenting his parents for making him stop taking his medication, he might be acting out to get them to change their minds. I don't think there is any way of knowing this for sure though, it could be that he really IS forgetting most things... 

I think family counselling could be good. It can help to rebuild relationships and understanding between parents/carers and children. He should also either be taking his ADHD medication or have a reassessment done to see if he still needs it. Finally, I think individual therapy for him could be a good idea. It sounds like he doesn't feel listened to, so it could give him a safe space to express himself and help him learn skills to mange his life better. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think I'd be jealous of those things in your situation too, because it would highlight the things lacking in the relationship. 

It's not time to open your relationship. He probably *would* treat his new relationships better than he treated you, because you've spoken to him about how he treats you and he's started taking steps to improve. You would, understandably, notice this difference in treatment and feel hurt. 

Once you are secure in your relationship, and you know that no matter how well he treats anyone else, he wants to treat you that well too ... that's when I think the jealousy will become less of an issue. It sounds like it's far too soon for that (since it's only been a few months of effort out of a relationship that sounds like it's been at least a few years long). You need to be sure that if you started a new relationship with him tomorrow, he'd treat you with the same respect and kindness he's showing other women, and it doesn't sound like you're sure of that at all. 

Mundane things are important. They make up the majority of your relationship. Caring about them is normal, not petty. (And I don't think you should accept being mistreated whether monogamous or not.) If he's not able to give you the mundane things, your relationship is severely lacking. 

Maybe once your relationship is more stable you could continue along the non-monogamy path but for now it sounds like there are some serious issues that need to be addressed and non-monogamy is not a good idea until your relationship is healthier. </TEXT>

I don't usually feel the burning sensation you describe - maybe you could try using more lube? Sometimes I get some pain like that when I'm not wet enough (which is totally normal when you're new to sex, your body is not used to it. It happens to me too if it's been a while). 

Keep exploring and doing more of the things you like. It's good you're listening to your body and stopping if something hurts, that should make things more enjoyable. It sounds like you're going well so far.

<TEXT> Disclaimer: I am not an expert in any way. 

I think everyone has a level of mental health, so in that way it's more like a spectrum. You can be mentally healthy (which I think is where you're fulfilled, you're resilient, you're capable of working towards and achieving your goals, you understand your strengths and weaknesses and you use your strengths to help mitigate the weaknesses and work to improve them), or you can be really struggling (which can happen in many different ways, but generally if you can't do one or more aspects of the "mentally healthy" that's an indicator). I think most people have at least some aspects of their mental health that need improvement. (And therapy can help with that.) 

I think it's also a bit more black and white, in that to have a mental health disorder, your mental health has to be severely lacking in a specific way that "regular people" don't experience. For example, lots of people struggle to handle it when someone close to them dies... someone who is grieving is definitely not mentally healthy at that time, but it's not a **disorder**. A disorder would be if you struggle in that way when you have everyday experiences. Therapy can help you to deal with mental health disorders too, and sometimes it can even get you close enough to other people's "regular" that you no longer count as having that disorder. 

Still, it's never really a fully black and white situation. It's really hard to judge whether someone else's situation is "enough" that it's normal to feel how they do because there's a lot of variation of what's "normal". It's also really hard to judge when exactly something crosses the line into excessive. Some things are obvious - crying when someone dies is definitely normal, but crying all day every day when no major events have happened in months is definitely not normal. There is a lot of inbetween though where it's less clear, and where "normal" might change depending on the person. Is once a month normal? Once a week? Daily? If you're the sort of person who cries a lot, you might be completely mentally healthy and still cry every day. If you're the sort of person who never cries, and suddenly you're crying at least once per month, you might be very mentally **un**healthy and it's a sign you need help. The same is true for pretty much any symptom of mental illness. Unless it's an extreme symptom, it comes down to what's "normal" for each person and how much it interferes with their life. 

I don't think it's really a spectrum or black and white, it's more situational and complex and it varies person to person. There are some obvious signs which are black and white, some signs that can be on a spectrum, and some that are neither. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maybe you can sit him down and ask him *why* he's buying more groceries. Instead of telling him it's not necessary, approach it from the position of "There must be a valid reason for this and I want to understand what that reason is". I find this works really well when my partner is being defensive and not listening to me - it helps us both to get on the same page and understand what the real issues are. 

Once you understand his reasons, acknowledge them (even if they seem crazy or extreme, try to look for the elements or underlying issues that you can relate to and acknowledge those). 

Then, explain your needs too (e.g. "Our family can't afford to keep buying extra groceries that we don't eat"). 

Finally, suggest some solutions that might work to address both needs (make sure you listen to what his needs actually are, don't just suggest things you've already thought of unless they will actually work for him). Take his suggestions on board too. 

Keep in mind that initially he might not be ready to compromise, especially if he's feeling defensive or frightened, but if he gets a chance to think about things and understand your perspective he might change his mind. So even if the first conversation doesn't work, come back to it a few days or a week later and check if he's thought more about it (don't go through the whole conversation again, just ask if he's thought about it any further). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't let people beg. I answer everything pretty easily. If I'm at all reluctant to answer, my partner immediately knows they might not like what I have to say. If they still want to hear it after that then I'll tell them. 

My husband and my boyfriend (I'm poly) both like to know the truth and have never reacted badly (sometimes they've been upset or hurt, but they've never blamed me for it). 

Some of my exes have reacted badly and blamed me for answering like that, and usually that's a sign the relationship isn't working out. I believe in total honesty and in not asking things you're not ready to hear the answers to, so I don't usually have a lot of sympathy. </TEXT>

I respect all people's right to believe as they do, and I respect that certain locations are sacred to them. How much effort is it, really, to not disrespect something that is deeply important to someone else? 99% of the time it doesn't affect you at all, and the 1% of the time that it does, it's worth making that extra effort to show respect. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Using a "gift" to make your wife feel guilty is wrong. Using violence against your wife is wrong (slapping the phone out of your hand). Calling your wife fucking stupid is wrong. Using violence against your husband is wrong (slapping him). Screaming at someone is wrong. Invading someone's personal space (with his hand-waving and cheek-pushing) is wrong. Hitting someone in the face with a shirt is wrong. 

He's abusing you. The fact that you now have physically assaulted him in return just makes things worse. 

This relationship is a dumpster fire and you should immediately divorce him. There is no way to make it right. I'm not sure why you're even trying - do you *want* to be in a relationship where this is a regular occurrence? Even if he was right and this was entirely your fault (it's not), it's still better for both of you to divorce at this point because that sort of toxic and aggressive and violent argument is a sign that your relationship should end. 

You should also get some therapy. It sounds like you don't recognise toxic behaviours or warning signs in a relationship until it is far, far too late, and it also sounds like your current relationship is very traumatic and abusive. Even if you don't leave him (please do) at least get therapy to help you learn what a healthy relationship looks like and to build up your strength. Life can be so much better than this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you have to choose between yourself and someone else, choose yourself. There is no guarantee you can "save" Jane anyway. 

However, there are ways to make sure you still have some influence on her life even while you're away. You can call her regularly and encourage her to make good choices for herself. You can contact child protective services and get them to check in on her. You could even delay leaving for a couple of years to give her a better foundation and then go (if your plan will still work when delayed - you're 16, so it's likely it will be ok). I would probably try to do some of these things while also getting away from the toxic environment as much as possible. 

And, you are not the *only* chance she has. You managed to come out of that situation and recognise the toxicity for what it was. Maybe she can too (especially if she has your help). 

You escaping to save your own life is not the same as sacrificing her future, especially because you don't know for sure what the outcome will be. It's a risk to Jane if you leave, but staying indefinitely  is a *certainty* that your life will not be what you want. (Also, what sort of example would you be to Jane if you stick around in a toxic environment? Maybe showing her there is another option will help her!) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think we lean more towards direct, but there are definitely the indirect types too. 

If there was something that was objectively very good, there would be people saying things like "That's so good!" but there would also be people who would say things like "Yeah, it's alright" (more like joking than serious, though). 

I would consider an indefinite "maybe" to be rude, but I don't know if that's typical for all Australians or just me. It's more polite to say something like "I can't hang out, I have to \_\_\_\_" instead of just straight-up saying you don't want to go, but depending on who's asking I wouldn't necessarily care about responding politely.

<TEXT> If you want to entirely avoid copycats, don't give any method of suicide. Just let your character learn that this person has taken their own life, but no one will tell the character how. If you give a method, someone can copy it. (This is based on mental health education I've done in the past, I'm not just making this up. The safest way to talk about suicide is to not include methods or even specific locations at all.) 

If you need a dramatic scene where your character learns about it, they could learn it from the dead character's family, or they could hear the announcement at school, or their parents/friend could tell them about it. If they hear the news third-hand, it's understandable that they won't have the full information. 

Then make sure you show the outcome realistically - don't glorify the suicide, but do show the real-world consequences (for example the hurt and grief of the character's family, friends, acquaintances... etc. ). 

Your readers should read it and think "this is tragic and awful". There should be no possible way they could read it and think "Suicide was a good solution for that person", and *definitely* no way they could read it and think "That looks like a good method, maybe I'll try it". </TEXT>

<TEXT> Expecting your partner to be ok with you working as a Domme when you've only recently mentioned this idea to him is a bit much. He is allowed to have boundaries. 

It sounds like your vision of "ideal" in a relationship does not match his. I think it's worth talking to him about this a bit more to see if you can reach agreement, but if you're not going to respect his boundaries it's not going to work. Try to see things from his point of view. 

If you don't want to (or can't) see things from his perspective then your relationship is not going to work. You have a lot of problems and frustrations and opening your relationship (even if you're only opening it through sex work) is not going to fix them. It might be better to postpone that until after you've resolved your general relationship problems. Have you tried relationship counselling? 

Do you want things to work out, or do you want things to end? It sounds like you're at the point where your next actions will decide that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I somewhat agree and somewhat disagree. 

I somewhat agree because it's obvious that telling people with problems "you're depressed and a sociopath" is unhelpful and probably inaccurate. 

I somewhat disagree because I think having some idea of what might possibly be causing your symptoms makes a huge difference. Instead of being confused and worried that you're going crazy, you have an idea of possible causes and you can research it and see how to get help. 

On the whole I think it's ok to say "Hey that sounds like me when I was suffering depression, you should get that checked out" but not ok to say "It's definitely x diagnosis" because we're not experts and even if we were we don't have access to all relevant information. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It does get better. Sometimes it takes time to work out what exactly you need to *make* it better though. 

If you want to try antidepressants, try them. They help some people. If they help you, great. If they don't help you, try something else, or try different ones. There will be something that helps. I have met people whose depression lifted on the first antidepressant they tried ... and I have met people who had to try everything they could think of for more than 20 years ... but in the end, life gets better. And it's worth it to keep going (even the people it took more than 20 years for - they all say it is completely worth it). 

For me, it took a lot of thought about what would make my life meaningful and what feels like it matters to me. Then I focus my life around those things. There are other things I do too, but they are just because they're essential in order to get to what *actually* matters to me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the years since I got married, my sex drive greatly increased, and I realised I'm poly (and probably always have been, but never really thought about it until I got older). 

Now I have an open marriage and a long-distance boyfriend. Both of my partners understand I *might* engage in casual sex online (like sexting, video chatting, whatever) if I'm feeling particularly horny. Casual sex in person is something that has been agreed to in theory but so far I haven't wanted to do it, so it hasn't happened. 

Worked out pretty well I think. I am incredibly lucky my husband is so open-minded because our relationship would have been destroyed otherwise. </TEXT>

Maybe one of your protagonists is extremely superstitious and there was a sign that talking to the mother about this could cause bad things? Maybe one of your protagonists is just very afraid of confrontation so they avoid telling her she's wrong. 

If she desperately wants to believe, and the two characters are telling her it's true, she's not going to listen to anyone else.

As for why she might want to believe - she obviously likes the idea of your female character as a potential daughter-in-law. Maybe she's just afraid of losing a girl/woman that she has seen as a daughter figure and helped to raise for most of her life? Maybe she doesn't want to accept that either of your protagonists could make decisions that don't go along with what she wants? Maybe she has memory issues (think like dementia?) and literally can't remember that the two protagonists are not together? Maybe someone she trusts deeply (like a cult leader? or a fortune teller?) has told her your protagonists will be together?

<TEXT> It sounds like you date people in a similar way to the way I do (i.e. not at all unless you're already friends). 

I think the best thing you can do is to take your time to grieve the relationship, and then when you're ready, make new friends. Don't look for new partners, look for friends who you can be open about the kinky side of yourself with. If going by yourself is too much, you could ask your partner to come to a munch with you (just the first time, or first few times) so that you don't have to go alone to meet a bunch of new people. 

Once you have friends, you'll have a partial outlet for that side of you. If you happen to find a friend that you can trust to do a few things with, that's great! (Still be careful not to rush it, though.) And if you don't find anyone you want to do anything kinky or sexual with, more friends will still be a good thing. </TEXT>

At the moment it sounds like you're telling her she's wrong and you didn't break any limits - this is the wrong approach, because it's invalidating how she feels. Even if you didn't do anything outside the limits you knew about, she still *felt* that you stepped outside the limits she wanted, which suggests she has a limit there that you haven't talked about before. You need to talk to her and find out what actions broke her limits, and then add those new limits to your relationship going forwards. 

Hopefully once you start to listen to what she wants, she will be less defensive and more willing to listen to you in return so you can tell her it wasn't intentional. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For me it's just a matter of scheduling. Most of my day is spent with my husband. Several hours of my day are spent on things like errands/volunteering/appointments and things like that. About 3 hours every day is spent talking to my long-distance boyfriend. That way I spend a good amount of time with both of them and I'm also able to do all my real-life things that need doing. 

I think if I was working full-time, it would be a lot harder to schedule things, but I'd find ways to make it work. Everyone has different times in their day that they're free to communicate and you just line them up where you can (while also keeping enough time for yourself). 

It's the same way you keep in contact with close friends and family when you have a partner. One partner doesn't need ALL of your time no matter how close you are. That means, in some of the other time, you can fit in another partner (or a family visit, or an outing with friends, or even some time to yourself). </TEXT>

They will assess how likely you are to actually act on those thoughts - if you're likely to act, they might do something to protect your life, but otherwise they will just see it as a symptom of your mental health condition.

<TEXT> You can be closed poly. For example, if there are three men in a triad but they don't date or have sex outside of that triad, that's closed poly.

If someone were to define their relationship as open but not poly, I'd think that was more of a sexual openness than a relationship openness (i.e. they are only in love with their partner, but can have sex with others).

You can also be both open AND poly, which I think is how most poly people identify. However, the level of openness varies even among open/poly people (for example, my relationship is open in that casual hookups are *acceptable*, but neither I nor my partners are really into casual hookups, so someone asking one of us for a casual hookup is probably asking the wrong person).

In short - poly is more about who you form relationships with or love. Open relationships are more about who you have sex with. (And there is a lot of overlap in many cases.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Of course it matters. If the woman continues to work and her lifestyle is not significantly affected by getting divorced, then the courts don't order any alimony payments. 

Again, alimony can go both ways, it's not about "women take from men". Men can be awarded alimony too, it just happens less often because most relationships follow (to some extent) the traditional structure of men being the ones who earn the money while women are the ones who support the children and care for the home.

<TEXT> It sounds like he gets anxious when you're away, and then he overreacts to small situations and blows things out of proportion. 

The result of that is that he's behaving in ways that are detrimental to your relationship (he's being weird and demanding). 

I think you should talk to him seriously about how his behaviour is impacting you. Give him some concrete examples. Expect him to get defensive (because anxiety is often based in fear, and criticism of your behaviour during a scary situation is often a thing that makes people defensive). Let him get defensive, and be compassionate, but don't back down from your key message - his behaviour while you're away is not appropriate, it's damaging your relationship, and he needs to change it. 

Give it a day or so for him to think things over, then come back to him to discuss what changes he's going to make and new rules he's going to follow. (For example, he will NOT send you on an errand while you're away. Or, he WILL accept when you say no to doing something because you're busy.) Don't come up with these rules for him unless he asks for suggestions. Be willing to compromise, but don't accept something that will make you unhappy. 

Stop doing what he wants to avoid drama - that is training both him *and you* that it is ok for him to act like this, and it's not. 

If he's unwilling to discuss his behaviour, or unwilling to follow the rules you have agreed on together, then you should consider leaving him. Give him some time to adjust, and a bit of time to get used to things, and a few extra chances where you might have to remind him of the rules or rework them, but if he's not even trying then just leave. And if he can't do it even IF he's trying, he needs to be in therapy, and you would be justified in leaving in that case too. 

I trust that you know him well enough to know if he's really trying to improve or not. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you're a billionaire, a pre-nup will likely be drafted fairly and with appropriate legal advice and support, and be difficult to overturn. 

If you're a guy who crafts his own pre-nup that says something like "All money goes to man, none to woman" and pressures her into signing it, it will be overturned easily because it wasn't done properly. 

I **do** think it's true, lots of rich men are screwed over in divorces. Lots of rich women are, too. A billionaire woman who marries a less rich man *also* has a lot to lose. There are just less billionaire women (for multiple reasons) so we hear less about it happening. 

Either way, you're not a billionaire. You will have a career, your potential wife will likely have her own career. Then she will likely put her career on hold to raise your children (a decision that you will agree on). Then, if you divorce, you will likely have to pay her some money because she delayed her career for the benefit of your family, with the understanding that you would be supporting her to make up for that. If the man becomes a stay-at-home father and the woman continues to work, it is likely she would have to pay money to him instead. 

I agree that it's not always a perfectly fair outcome (especially in situations where people are extremely rich), but I think the courts do their best to make it fair. It's not like they are *arbitrarily* taking your money. I think in most situations it ends up being close to fair. 

Also ... this entire discussion seems to be missing the point. You shouldn't marry someone that you would resent sharing resources with. When you marry someone, you do it because you WANT to combine resources and you WANT to see your assets as shared assets. If you don't want to do that, don't marry anyone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> She sounds like a wonderful person :) 

I think the best thing you can do for her is to encourage her to see a mental health specialist with experience in schizophrenic or similar disorders (for example a psychiatrist). If she does have a mental health condition, the *worst* thing to do is to ignore it, because then it will get worse, and then she may end up needing to be hospitalized or even endangering herself in some way. If there is nothing wrong with her mental health, the specialist will be able to determine that and reassure you and your family. 

Even if she does end up having schizophrenia or another disorder, there are lots of good treatments for that available nowadays. She will be able to enjoy her life still. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not sure what outcome you want here. You've already gotten: 

* Positive feedback about your scene to counter the negative 
* Confirmation he was wrong (through your community, friends, dom, group chat...) 
* An apology to you and your dom
* A discussion of the events where he tries to explain, you tell him off, and then you get another apology

What are you trying to achieve? Yes, he was wrong to comment, but he's apologised, no one listened to him anyway because he's an idiot, everyone you speak to tells you he was wrong, and all of your friends/community are being supportive ... 

It sounds like any further emotions need to be handled by yourself or alone with your Dom, because you've gotten all of the support you can get externally. Continuing to talk about it will just create more drama. There isn't much else you can do at this point. If you play in a public space, sometimes people will say things you don't like. It's rude and disheartening, but it's going to happen. You just deal with it (which you have done) and then move on with your life. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I freeze up like that (happens to me a lot because of my anxiety issues) I just break everything into very very small steps, and do one step at a time. 

For example, Step 1 - Find out about when the support group meets and how to get there. 

Step 2 - Plan how to travel to the group. 

Step 3 - When it is time to leave, collect all the items I need in order to go. 

Step 4 - Walk out my front door. 

Step 5 - Get in the car. 

Step 6 - Drive to the location. 

Step 7 - Get out of the car. 

Step 8 - Walk inside. 

Step 9 - Greet people (if necessary). 

Step 10 - Sit down and take a few deep breaths. 

The important part is that you don't think about all of the steps at once, you only think about the one you're doing *right now* and that stops it being overwhelming. If the one step you're on is too much, you can break it into smaller steps (e.g. "Get in the car" could be broken down into steps like opening the car door, putting one foot into the car, sliding my body into the seat...) and then just do the first smaller step. 

If you manage to get through more steps than you did last time, or if you could do them more easily than last time, then you're making progress! That means eventually you'll be able to do the task. So even if you don't reach the end goal every time, you're progressing towards it, and you know you'll get there if you keep taking those tiny steps. 

(If you try everything and you still can't do it, it's also ok to get professional help. So don't be ashamed if you end up needing help too.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> That sounds so hard I'm sorry :( 

The rapid mood swings must be exhausting. It's common for teenagers to have mood swings and its even more likely if they have mental health conditions. If you're living in an abusive situation you might have CPTSD which would definitely make things worse. If you have BPD like you mentioned in your post, a common symptom of that is also extreme and rapid mood changes. 

So, all in all, it sounds like you are living in the perfect situation to have a lot of rapid mood changes and so, while it sucks, it's probably something to be expected in your situation and it's not your fault. 

I think if you can find a therapist that specialises in teens who have experienced trauma and abuse, that will likely be the most helpful to you. In the meantime, do your best to stay alive. If you ever reach a point where you're not sure you can keep living, call yourself an ambulance and go to hospital. It will probably suck but at least you'll be alive. If there is any chance you can move away from your abuser (like, live with someone else) that would be a good idea too but I know that's not always possible. 

Take care of yourself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That sounds a lot like your anxiety problems went untreated and caused you to develop depression as well. This happens to me too - my anxiety gets higher and higher and higher and then I reach a point where my mind just shuts down and I can't function anymore and have no motivation or energy to do anything. 

You need professional help at this point. 

If professional help is impossible, you should try looking into CBT workbooks for anxiety and depression. But, really, professional help is your best option. You need to understand how your anxiety and depression work and how to manage or treat them. You will not get better without that. It is possible to learn that yourself using online resources, but it's way easier if you have the support of a professional. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think you should discuss this with your therapist next time you see them. There are definitely treatments for depression you can do and if you're not doing them, the therapist can explain to you why they've made that choice. The therapist can probably help you work out how to talk about it with your parents or your doctor as well.

Also, are you still taking the herb? If you're taking St John's Wort and also taking anti-depressants that can be dangerous, don't mix those.

Finally ... if you only started feeling depressed and suicidal after you started taking sertraline, have you discussed NOT taking sertraline? I took that for my social anxiety and it made me miserable (not to say it does that for everyone, just that it is a possible side effect). It is also possible the depression is not caused by your medication at all, but it's good to discuss it with your parents and doctors to find out what they think.

Do **not** stop taking your medication without discussing it with your doctor. That can be dangerous (it causes nasty side-effects, and it can also make depression and anxiety worse). </TEXT>

The issue of kids is definitely something you should discuss, but it's not a decision you should make FOR him. It's a decision you should make WITH him. The same with all of your other potential issues. They are real issues, but they are issues to discuss and find solutions to.

<TEXT> I guess if it feels like a moral issue, you could examine it as a moral issue? Like, decide what defines something as "morally wrong" for you, then examine your behaviour and the situations you encounter to decide where they fit on your moral scale. 

My other idea is that it could be a self esteem issue. I used to feel like I didn't deserve company or attention and then it would feel wrong to accept it. I'm not sure if this is the same thing though. (If it is this, the way I fixed it was to think about how I'd judge someone who was not me doing these same activities. That helped me to recognise doing them was "right", and then I just had to gradually ease my way into doing them so that I didn't get overwhelmed by guilt every time, because even when I knew they were not BAD I'd still get that same reaction out of habit if I tried to do too much at once.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> It sounds like you haven't actually discussed their promise with them at all? They were reluctant and you've just gone "Okay, guess we'll pay for it ourselves", but you can't actually pay for it yourself so that was **not** a good decision. 

Instead, explain the situation clearly. Lay it out for them. Make sure they understand what's happening. If they still don't want to pay, THEN you can think about cutting them off for putting you into this situation. Currently it doesn't sound like you've made it clear to both of them what the situation even is, you're just sitting there resenting them. Be sure it's not a miscommunication before you decide anything else. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I avoid posting advice on posts that involve things like jealousy for exactly that reason. I figure it's their loss. The way I'd respond to it in my relationship is very different to a monogamous couple, so we're not going to reach agreement. 

In real life, I don't really talk about my relationships at all, so it's never been an issue. I have lost a couple of online friends when I mention I'm poly, though (one even went as far as saying he couldn't associate with "someone of that moral level"). 

The only place I've ever had someone go through my comment history to complain about me was in /r/relationship_advice and I think that person was clearly lacking in common sense. They didn't complain about my relationships though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You can check out money-making subreddits like /r/beermoney and /r/workonline \- they probably won't make you enough money to help much, but some is better than none.

You could also try posting on /r/povertyfinance for suggestions.

Also, I don't know how serious you are about the sex work, but here is some general advice about that: If you're thinking you'll get into sex work out of desperation, try looking at things that don't involve sexual activity first (for example, selling panties online in /r/usedpanties or similar places). You could also check /r/sexsells but I think they are more for paid cam sessions which is not a good idea if you're not comfortable with sex work. If you DO start sex work, be careful about who you trust and read guides on staying safe before you get into it. Do NOT just accept the first guy who offers to pay you without thinking it through and considering your safety as the top priority. If you end up murdered by some psycho, that will not help your family at all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I studied writing, I think the most useful thing I learned was not anything from the actual content of the course, it was by watching how other people's works progressed. 

In the first few weeks, I read a first draft of something that one guy in my class had written, and it was *terrible*. Like, if I'd written that, I would've just erased it completely from existence. 

But, he edited it. He took feedback from everyone on what worked and what didn't. He rewrote it multiple times. He met up with our lecturer for advice on how he could improve it. 

When I read it again at the end of the semester, it was good! It wasn't like a masterwork, but it was good enough that I could imagine finding it published somewhere. 

That is the biggest thing I learned. Even if what you write is crap, it doesn't matter. You can rewrite it and change it and fix it until it's better, and if you do that enough times, it will end up being good (and if it's not good yet, you can fix it!). You just have to be willing to take feedback and make changes and rewrite it over and over in different ways and improve it every time. 

So, my advice is that you write and you look at your work and think "wow, this is really bad" because everyone does that the first time they write anything. Then you should think "how can I fix this?" and then you rewrite it so it's better. Don't think of it like failing or being bad at it ... you haven't failed because you haven't finished it yet. It's only finished once it's good. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know about in other countries, but I found this description of a strip search in a prison in Queensland, Australia: 

 2.2 What a strip search lawfully entails   
  
The Act and the Regulation are highly prescriptive about what officers may do, and what they may ask prisoners to do, during a strip search (see Appendix 1). QCS specified these requirements in its now superseded QCS Custodial  Operations  Standard  Operating  Procedure    Search    Prisoners  and  Corrective  Services  Facilities,  version 1, 11 April 2012 (SOP).  
  
Under the legislation (and the SOP),17 a strip search involves the prisoner being asked:   
  
  first, to take off all their clothes above the waist. The clothes are searched and returned to the prisoner who puts the clothes back on   
  
  then, to remove their clothing below the waist (the prisoner may face away from the officer while doing so). These clothes are searched and then returned to the prisoner.   
  
An officer conducting a strip search may also require a prisoner to:   
  
  run his or her fingers through his or her hair   
  
  allow his or her mouth to be inspected by an officer   
  
  raise each foot and wiggle their toes   
  
  hold his or her arms in the air   
  
  stand with his or her legs apart.   
  
Manoeuvres  such  as  asking  a  prisoner  to  squat  or  asking  a  female  prisoner  to  lift  their  breasts  are  not  authorised. Strip searches must be carried out by at least two officers (of the same sex as the prisoner), but no more officers than are necessary to carry out the search. The officer conducting the search must not make physical contact with the prisoner. Prior to the strip search, the officer must tell the prisoner why the search is necessary and how it will be conducted. Following the search, it must be recorded in the correctional centres strip search register.

<TEXT> I have severe social anxiety and it works for me if I break things into tiny steps. So if I was to do that for posting ... the first step is I think about what I want to post (seems like you're already doing that). Then I type out the response, even if I don't intend to post it. Then, the final step, I hit the button to post it. 

Each step it's ok to take as long as you want before you progress to the next one. When you feel ok with one step, then the next time you're feeling brave, you can try the next step. When you're having a bad day, you might take a step down instead. 

You could also add that your first steps should be to start out by posting on a really friendly community, and then the next step (when you're ready) is to post somewhere else. 

I hope that helps. (Also, if you haven't tried therapy etc. that is always a good idea for mental health conditions.) </TEXT>

You can't "fight back" against cyberbullying by posting online *more*. 

What you should do instead is go silent and not post anything new, and they will lose interest. At first they might attack more, hoping for a reaction, but once they don't get one they'll get bored and move on. 

If it reaches a level where you are receiving threats (e.g. death threats, violence, doxxing) then you should still not respond online, but you should go to the police. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If he's not able to give sufficient aftercare when you do public scenes, you should stop doing public scenes with him. 

I'm also concerned about the way you say you woke up covered in blood (he let you leave without even treating wounds???) and then were afraid to speak to him (instead of trusting and believing he cares about you and your well-being), and when you *did* speak to him he treated you with disdain (this would be a dealbreaker for me) and then got annoyed at you for wanting his support (this would also be a dealbreaker for me). 

Also, I'm worried that he might have lied to you about the aftercare. Can you talk to anyone else who was at the event? You say you have clear memories of getting dressed, asking for a hug, and then being dismissed and leaving. He says there was 20 minutes of aftercare - that seems completely different to what you remember. Does he gaslight you? 

Finally, why is **he** upset with **you**? He's the one who failed to provide proper support! While you were in subspace. And bleeding. He let you walk out of that event without even treating your wounds!! What if something happened to you on the way home? Would you have been able to handle it? Did he even care? 

I really think that you need to reconsider your relationship so that this sort of thing doesn't happen again. If he's always like this, you need to stop doing scenes with him. If he's only like this when you play in public, you need to stop playing in public. Lay down some boundaries. Your needs matter, and if he can't meet them, you have to stop playing with him. 

Also, to give you an idea of how healthy relationships work - my partner loves when I say I need him. It makes him happy. If I had said "Last night I needed x, y, z and I feel really hurt and I think it was not safe what happened" he would be HORRIFIED. Like, he would immediately create new rules for himself to prevent it ever happening again. One time, I was upset and ended up self-harming after one thing we did. He immediately said we are never doing that again. I had to renegotiate that rule (now we just don't do that thing while I am in a certain mindset), but it took months before he was ready to try again, even though it was one of our favourite things. 

Your master treats you with disdain when you say you need him. He got annoyed at you for raising concerns, and then blamed you for it. Your relationship sounds very abusive here, so I hope in general it's much better than this snapshot makes it look. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The reality is that some partners WILL think less of you for having mental health issues. Whether your wife is one of those people or not is something you will have to find out. 

If your marriage is healthy and your wife wants to help, she will be a great source of support. I think you should tell her for this reason. (And if she is unhelpful, well, you'll know not to tell her anything else like that.) 

Either way, you also need to find other sources of help. Often, you can find help by googling the phrase: free or low-cost mental health Georgia (replace Georgia with whatever state you are in) 

If there is really nothing, you can try self-help, which is better than nothing but not ideal. If you want to go this route, you can google CBT Workbook for Depression and choose one of the options you find. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a few things that help me, but not sure how helpful any of them will be for you since everyone's different: 

* Is it possible to reduce the amount of things causing you stress? I know it's not good to avoid things, but at the same time, they need to be approached in a structured way so that you're not causing more problems than you solve. If there are some non-essential things or things that can be postponed until you are more stable, that might be worth doing. (Just don't put them off forever - rescheduling is ok, but forgetting about them forever is not helpful.)
* Setting aside a significant portion of time each day to process everything has really worked for me. I have at least two hours of time where I'm by myself without anyone around me, so that I can process things. As part of that, I spend at least half an hour per night writing down everything that's on my mind (because that's what helps me to process). 
* Sex/masturbation. If you're storing stress in your body, releasing it through sexual activity could be helpful. 
* Ritual. I don't know if this will help you, but when I'm somewhere I feel very safe (or with someone I feel safe with) I have specific things that I always do. When I'm at home and need to feel safe, it helps to do the same things and try to create that feeling of safety even if I don't currently have access to the things/people that usually cause it. 
* Meditation/visualisation. I'm sure you've tried this too but meditating and visualising really helps me when I'm getting overly stressed. I like to breathe in, and imagine a light blue balloon of inner calm expanding and reinforcing inside me ... and then I breathe out, and let the rough lumps of dark red tension and stress evaporate. 
* Grounding exercises. (Like, 5 things I see, 4 things I can touch...). It can help a lot when I'm feeling overwhelmed and start disconnecting from everything. If the environment I'm in is causing me stress, sometimes I prefer to use this to ground myself somewhere else - like I'll imagine myself sitting somewhere peaceful near a river, and use the grounding exercise to help me imagine it more clearly so I can relax there. 
* Communication with everyone you care about. I'm sure you're already doing this one but it is really important. I find that when I don't talk to people I love about my problems, everything gets much much worse. If the people you love are not currently available, you can write them letters/emails (even if you don't actually send it, it's helpful to lay everything out and then to imagine the person's responses if you know them well). 
* Having a plan and knowing what steps I'm taking to improve things. It sounds like, from your post, that you have this one covered, but I find that I always get more anxious if I don't have a plan (even if the plan is "wait and find out what happens next" or "make it up as I go along"). 

If you find any good ways of living in constant fear I'd love to hear them too, because I have the same problem. One day at a time, one step at a time is about all I've found that helps, even if it's not a solution. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The way I would approach it is to think about what aspects of your relationship give you validation and security, and then focus on those things and less on the monogamous aspect. 

For me I've found that it's less about how my partner has no one else, and more about the fact that my partner chooses to spend time with me and chooses to support me and chooses to love me, and so I gain security and validation from those things. If, when we are apart, he chooses to do those things with other people, that doesn't take away from what he gives me. While we're apart, he could be sitting staring into space, or he could be dating someone else, and either way when I see him again he is still the same person who loves me and makes time for me. 

I think if you can find those factors in your relationship that make you feel secure, you can work on understanding them and how they might work outside the context of monogamy. </TEXT>

If you are in a face to face conversation, and you catch yourself saying something you don't mean, just stop and correct it. For example "I'm sorry, that wasn't how I wanted to react.

You're right that it absolutely isn't personal (it's happened to me too) but I wish someone had talked to me about it as a possible side effect, because I never realised it was the medication causing it until I finally went off it 3 years later and I suddenly had feelings again. It **severely** damaged my relationship with my husband. 

She's also right in that it isn't fair to you. Getting through a short-term effect is ok, but if she's intending to be on this medication long-term, she needs to speak to her psychiatrist about this. </TEXT>

If you're really worried, write her a list of in-home care organisations she can contact (do not debate the list with her, just leave it somewhere she can see it). 

She is literally ruled by hunger/food - she's going to call someone to come feed her. If you don't feed her, she'll call someone else. If you're worried she is in danger of imminent death (e.g. if you think she might kill herself) you can call emergency services and they can admit her to hospital. When she is so extremely overweight it's unlikely she'll starve to death in the next couple of days, though. 

Right now, you're in a codependent relationship, and you need some therapy (individual therapy) to learn how healthy relationships work. Take your family's offer. Get away from this unhealthy situation. </TEXT>

I don't think you can escape the usual risks of telling your partner you want to open your relationship (for example, she might believe it's because she's not good enough?), but it is likely she will understand better than a partner who is completely unfamiliar with poly. 

I think all you can do is be honest with your partner and hope things work out. You're not able to stay in the relationship as it is and be happy, so something needs to change. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is completely normal... you love him ... 

When I go out and I see something cool, I think "Hey I should show this to my husband". When I'm thinking about what movies I'd like to see, I think "I wonder which ones my husband wants to go to? Maybe we can go on a movie date!" 

That doesn't mean I don't have other interests that he's not into. Like, I volunteer, that's entirely my own thing. I'm never thinking "I wish he could volunteer here with me" because I know he has no interest in that. We both have separate friends. I talk about everything with him, but it's still *my life.* I share it with him because I love sharing with him. 

We've been married for 10 years, so, I'd say it's pretty normal. If anything I think *more* about him because he's a long-term partner, because he's a much bigger part of my life than someone I've only known a few months. 

If you're really worried about it, you could try seeing a therapist. Otherwise ... it sounds normal. I don't know why these people are calling you codependent, it's not like he's the only thing you think about. You even say in your post you think about other things (like friends, family...) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, therapy has never helped me for exactly the reasons you say. When I'm not well enough to leave the house, the last thing I need is going to a weekly session that spikes my anxiety through the roof to the point I can't function at all through the entire rest of the week (and I mean AT ALL, like I just end up paralyzed with fear even with very minor decisions ... like what to wear today ... whether I should shower or not ... etc), and then to repeat that the next week, except that it's worse because I haven't recovered from week 1 yet. 

What worked for me is learning CBT online. For example, MoodGym (free if you're in Australia, otherwise I'm not sure) or ThisWayUp (paid) are both designed by mental health experts and I've had both recommended to me by actual therapists. There are other ways to become more functional, it's not ONLY seeing a therapist (though of course, if you can, seeing an actual expert is always a good option). I've also had this workbook recommended to me by multiple specialists and found it was very good: [https://www.cci.health.wa.gov.au/Resources/Looking-After-Yourself/Social-Anxiety](https://www.cci.health.wa.gov.au/Resources/Looking-After-Yourself/Social-Anxiety) (it's free). 

So, pick any one of those and commit to learning all the things they're trying to teach you. It's ok to go slower than they recommend if you need more time to understand it, but don't go faster (it takes time to absorb all the information and practice it). 

I was scared to leave the house two years ago and now I go out regularly, and I'm volunteering doing something I love for a couple of hours per month. It is possible to make progress, but it takes a looooong time. I still have a long way to go but I am making progress and I hope you make progress too OP :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm going to disagree with what most people are saying. I don't think they're disrespecting you. I think there are multiple factors here: 1) They want to help (not because you're incapable, but because they've spent their whole lives supporting you and they want to continue). 2) They want to pay you back for hosting them. 3) They're bored.

The solution to all of those things is to redirect them into something more helpful, but they all reach that point in different ways:

1. Realise it's normal that they want to help. They're traveling to another country to visit their children's new home, and they see all this stuff that they could fix for you! Of course they want to do it for you. They're your parents! They want to help no matter what you say to them. So, you should stop telling them to do NOTHING. If they're there, in your house, and wanting to help ... give them something they can do. When they wanted to pull down the ivy, a better response would've been "Oh, yeah, we're going to do that later because of the ladder. If you're wanting to do some gardening, we could use some help clearing out this space so we can turn it into vegetable garden."
2. Let them know how much you appreciate them visiting. A lot of people (especially older people) feel like when they visit somewhere, they should gift the hosts something. Your family seems to want to gift you through their time and effort helping out around the house, and if you reject that outright it's a rejection of them. I think a better approach is, again, to redirect them into things that are actually helpful, or to say something like "You've already done enough! Come and sit down!" (But keep in mind they may ignore that because of number 1)
3. Also, they might just be bored. Visiting you is surely wonderful, but sitting around doing nothing when they've spent 20+ years running their own households must be difficult for them. Again, think of some things they can do. Visitors need to be entertained when you're hosting them (less so if they're family, but if you don't want them wandering around finding their own things to do, you still need to give them something). If you don't want them trying to "help", plan a board game night, or a trip to a tourist attraction, or a shopping trip... Make sure they have something else they can be doing instead. If they're used to working all the time, they might not like sitting around doing nothing, so getting them out of the house will be key. If they're at home they will likely have their own ideas about how they should be using their time (e.g. "helping"). You can probably also give them some general chores (vacuuming, etc) they can do to help out while they're at home if they're the type that need to be kept busy at all times.

Overall, I think you should stop seeing your family as being invasive or rude when they try to help you. They're frustrating and they don't listen properly but they seem to want to help you, so you should channel that and see their visits as an opportunity to have some extra help to get things done. That way they'll stop doing things that you DON'T need.

Good luck OP :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> My partner is like this too, but as time goes on he gradually reveals more as he feels more comfortable. I will probably never know everything and honestly I don't need to. I know who he is now, and I love him, and part of how he handles things is to not talk about it. He prefers to leave the past in the past so that it doesn't spoil his present day. That is his choice and I respect it because I respect him. 

Forcing your boyfriend to talk about things will just make him feel worse and potentially traumatize him further. The **best** thing you can do for him is to respect his privacy and give him space when he wants it. You know who he is now. Treat him with the kindness and compassion that you wish everyone else had treated him with, and *butt out*. It's not your job to investigate. 

It's normal to be curious, but part of caring about someone is respecting them when they tell you what they want (i.e. to not talk about that time). If not knowing his past is a deal-breaker for you, it might be better to break up than to force him to share with you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I say it, I mean that he's in the relationship only for the sex he gets, not for the joy of being with the woman. It's not necessarily a bad thing, if she knows and is consenting to the situation then it's fine (maybe she's using him for sex too), but if he's lying in order to achieve that then it becomes a bad thing. 

As long as you're upfront about your intentions and don't mislead any woman you're with, then I think it's fine. Some people might agree to what you say and then start asking for more ... it will be hard to handle that situation with integrity because you'll want to continue with the sex, so you'll be tempted to lie and say what they want you to say, and I think that is where a lot of people run into difficulties. It's important to stay honest, even if it means losing out on the benefits you might get if you lie. 

If you want a transactional relationship where you get sex in exchange for offering something she wants, the thing she wants is most likely going to be money (such as sugar babies or prostitutes), sex in return (such as hookups, NSA sex or one night stands), or emotional support (FWBs - some people use this to mean just hooking up, some people mean the emotional support too, so be careful if someone says they want a FWB situation). If you're looking for that sort of transactional relationship it's good to be very clear about what you're offering so that people can decide if they are willing to accept it (and be particularly careful if you offer emotional support, because a lot of people will see that as a basis for a more serious relationship and start wanting more). 

You could also try casual dating, which is where you date someone without the intention of being together forever. This lets you get the romantic stuff and emotional connection too without it getting too serious. It's important to be VERY CLEAR if your intention is just casual dating, otherwise you might be wasting each other's time. It's also important to be aware that feelings might change over time, so you may have to break up if your intentions don't match up anymore in future. </TEXT>

Overall though I think we were treated very similarly. I never felt like there was any inherent difference due to being female. The only differences were more about which risks were more likely to happen to us (me and my sisters got more talks about avoiding suspicious men, date-rape, etc), and once they were teenagers, my brothers were more often asked to help out with things like carrying heavy objects (because they were physically stronger). I was still asked to help as well if there were enough objects for multiple people, it was just that if there was one object then it went to one of my brothers first. </TEXT>

Move out as soon as you can. Stop going to his meetings and playing happy-family for him (but only once it is safe to do so - might be better to move out first). Set boundaries that limit his impact on your life. 

Give your mother information about domestic abuse hotlines, and let her know that you love her and you'll support her if she ever wants to leave him (if she can't stay with you, give her information about how to find a shelter or remind her of another family member that you know for sure she could stay with). After that, it's up to her to choose what she wants to do.

<TEXT> You know you saw it. Stop trying to convince yourself you didn't see it. 

Instead, think about what you're going to do now that you've seen it. Options: 

* Accept that she's hiding something from you and allow it (in a sort of "don't ask don't tell" sort of way) 
* Accept she's hiding something from you and pretend it doesn't exist 
* Keep asking her until she tells you (may not work) 
* Relationship counselling to help you both communicate about the situation (may not work, especially if she's unwilling to try it) 
* Ending the relationship 

If it was me, I'd try asking her more questions. Maybe not about the message itself, but about who she was texting, why she took the phone back so quickly, what she thinks the notification actually said, why she lied about who she was texting, etc. If your trust in her is right, then the answers to these questions should be simple things that she is happy to tell you. If she's betrayed your trust, she will either come clean or continue to lie, and you'll know if she's lying, because you know her so well that you can tell when she's lying to you. 

I hope this is a misunderstanding OP but there are some bad signs here. Take care of yourself. </TEXT>

I am concerned that your husband doesn't respect you when you say no to something, and instead tries to pressure you into changing your mind. That's not a good way of handling disagreements. If he does this a lot, maybe you should consider some couple's counselling to improve how both of you communicate. </TEXT>

<TEXT> idk if this is what happens with you, but for me what happens is that sometimes my feelings disappear and it's like I just pile them in a corner of my mind somewhere until I reach breaking point, and then they all come out. Or sometimes if I go somewhere I feel safe they decide that is a good time to come out too. So, sometimes I'm out somewhere in public and I'm getting stressed, but I'm not really aware of it until I get back home and relax and then suddenly I'm shaking and crying over built-up stresses that have happened over the past 3 months. 

I still haven't really got a solution but sometimes it helps if I really pay attention to how I'm feeling and make sure I schedule times to relax after stressful events so that I can get all the emotions out before they build up too much. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When he's shouting at you on the phone and it's triggering your anxiety, it's ok to say "I love you and support you and I hope you feel better soon, but your shouting is really upsetting me and I need to go now. I'll see you when you get home." Then you can hang up on him. It is *not* your responsibility to manage his emotions, and laying down a boundary like that should help him to recognise when he's getting out of hand. 

When he's calmer, you can talk to him about how the shouting affects you and how you don't want to hear it. You can also express how worried you are about him, because it's not fair to him that his family is making him feel that way. You can try to suggest that he set some healthier boundaries with them (such as saying NO sometimes), or to suggest therapy, but if he's not willing to change things then it's not your responsibility to do it for him. The only boundaries you can enforce are your own. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You've talked a lot about what *you've* done to try to change things, but what happens when you discuss the problems with him? Does he have any suggestions? Did he think setting reminders was a good idea? What did he say when you asked why he was ignoring/cancelling them without doing the things? 

You also say that he adores you and loves to make you happy. That means if you share with him how all of this is making you feel, he should *want* to find ways to make things work so that you can be happy. Be careful you don't ask for the impossible (he's never going to be "normal") but having clear goals that would make you happier is a good idea. For example, "I'd like it if he did more of the cleaning because I do more of the financial support". Then you can either discuss with him, or leave it up to him to find ways to meet those goals (for example, maybe you could revisit him feeding pets at a certain time every day). If he doesn't do that, you should express to him how that makes you feel, and explain why you think it damages your relationship (for example, "When you don't feed the pets within half an hour of the scheduled time, it makes me feel bad because I am worried about the pets being hungry and I feel sorry for them. It also makes me worry about our relationship because I worry that you not caring about the animals I love is a sign you don't care about me.") </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't have PTSD but I do have a different anxiety problem. 

Part of treatment is that you identify which aspects of your behaviour or thoughts are helpful. So, you might identify that being cautious when you meet new people is helpful. Then you also work to reduce the unhelpful things. So, you might identify that being overly-prepared actually stops being helpful after a certain point, and then you can work to reduce it to a level where it's *only* helpful and not excessive. (But you don't want to erase it entirely, because being prepared is still helpful.) 

For me, I still have a lot of things my anxiety has given me (such as being well-prepared for things), but I am working on reducing the unhelpful things it gives me (such as paralysing fear when I need to do something). I don't think you will lose the ability to recognise harmful situations early, but you might be able to refine it a bit so that you can relax more in situations that have been proven safe. 

I think you should discuss your concerns with whoever is treating you. If they can't address your concerns in a way that satisfies you, they might not be the right therapist for you. </TEXT>

A complete lack of physical arousal sounds like a side effect to one of your medications or other medical conditions. I had that as a side effect when I was taking anti-depressants.

<TEXT> I have a huge amount of self-harm scars. I usually warn partners before the first time, but out of all the people I've told (maybe 20-30 people?) only two of them have reacted badly to it and ended things. 

Most of the people I've told have been either worried about me, or just weirdly curious because they didn't understand it. Some of them didn't care about it at all and didn't even understand why I was telling them. A small amount of them were disturbed or scared but they still didn't avoid me, they just needed me to explain what it was about. When I told my current partner he wanted to touch them and kiss them to give me some good memories instead (it made me cry, and I refused for a long time because I wasn't emotionally ready for that). 

I think if your partner cares about you and wants to have sex with you, they won't be put off by some scars. Lots of people have scars from lots of different things. Imagine if your partner had a scar from having their appendix removed - that's not going to stop you having sex with them. Your scars are also from an illness, and I don't think they will stop a partner who cares about you from having sex with you either. (And if your partner does react badly ... they are in the minority, your next partner will be better.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, vaginal dryness is a side effect of lots of medications and medical conditions, so it could easily be one of those. 

If your body isn't going to get wet enough, use lots of lube and try to enjoy anyway. Maybe your body will get the idea. If it still isn't working, you could try discussing potential sexual side effects of your different medications with your doctors. 

If using lubricant resolves the situation then I don't think there's really a problem. You should still check with doctors about a potential cause but there is no shame in adding lubricant before sex. Everyone does that when they're not wet enough. </TEXT>

If what is bothering you is more the fact that he's shouting and you'd be ok with him being quieter, you could ask him if it's possible to be less loud during sex because you're embarrassed about other people hearing (for some people this is impossible, they are just very vocal, but for others this would be a simple request). 

I don't think you should **ever** just ignore when your sexual partner is making you uncomfortable. Even if it's something most people would be fine with (which this isn't), if it's bothering you, you should tell your partner so that sex is more fun for both of you. If he is unwilling or unable to accommodate you then perhaps you are incompatible. </TEXT>

If you are ready for just a small thing, just do the small thing. (For example, maybe you'd be comfortable touching each other's genitals over your clothes, just for a few seconds and then stopping.) If you're not ready to do anything yet, that's ok too. Talk to your boyfriend about what you're comfortable with beforehand, and don't let him pressure you into doing more.

<TEXT> Toys: 

If you want something non-penetrative, I would suggest some sort of vibrator. When I was looking for vibrator reviews I found this website, which will probably help you to consider different factors you might need in a vibrator: [https://vibratorvixen.com/](https://vibratorvixen.com/) 

I think, based on your post, you will want something that is a clit vibrator (unless you change your mind about penetration), and you will want to pay attention to the noise factor (because you don't live alone). 

There are several other factors that are important to consider too, such as making sure you use body-safe material. Most sex toy review sites will not recommend vibrators that are not body-safe. 

Masturbation: 

If you're not sure what you like, you could try exploring different types of porn online. If actual porn doesn't appeal to you, you could try written porn (such as on [literotica.com](https://literotica.com)) or audio-only porn (such as on /r/gonewildaudio). Often if you don't have the right mindset, it can be hard to reach orgasm even if you have the right physical stimulation, and porn can be a good way to put yourself into the right mindset. (You can also try just imagining or fantasising if those things work for you, too.) 

Another thing to keep in mind is that the clit is the centre of pleasure for *lots* of women... but not all of them. If you find that clitoral stimulation doesn't do much for you, don't give up on enjoying sex. You might be one of the women who enjoys or needs other forms of stimulation in order to reach orgasm (penetration, g-spot stimulation, nipple play, oral sex...). However, clitoral stimulation is still a good place to start if you're exploring. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. I think it's important to realise that someone else's memory or version of events is equally valid to your own. In this situation, you got more hung up on being right than on listening to what your friend is telling you, even though she was just as certain as you were. In that sort of situation, where both parties are equally sure they are correct, something that acknowledges the possibility you're both telling the truth (without offering any explanation, because sometimes there isn't one) is usually best. I would say something like "I believe you, but I still never got that information". Often this prompts one or both of you to think of alternative explanations (like maybe the network wasn't working, or maybe someone she gave the message to didn't pass it on, etc). This is a pretty complex situation though - everyone has misunderstandings sometimes, so I wouldn't worry too much about it. I think you can work on listening to and believing what the people who matter to you are saying, which should help to stop things escalating, but I don't think there is a simple solution to situations where you both remember different things. 
2. I think, honestly, this is just about conversational style/interests rather than a "niceness" issue. Some people love to share trivia, and other people don't. If you're worried about how your conversations go, you could look up conversational turn-taking and try to make sure conversations flow when you're engaged in them, but that might distract from letting you actually enjoy the conversation so it's probably not something to be thinking about constantly. If you're worried that you're generally dominating the conversation by spewing facts, you could try to ask more questions so that you can learn from the other person too. 
3. I think it's normal to like someone less when they mistreat others or lack authenticity in their interactions. I'd probably approach him the same way I was talking about racist people in the previous post - look at the way he's behaving as a sign that he doesn't understand how to be better, and treat him as someone who is still learning. That usually allows me to treat people like that with a basic level of respect and understanding, even if I don't particularly enjoy their company. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree, it sounds inconsiderate (but still not like she intended to hurt you). 

I think that in an ideal world she would apologise for that, but right now I think there is the bigger issue of how you handled the conversation around weight loss and her health, so it is probably unhelpful to focus on this comparatively minor event. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Whether you intended it as a suggestion or not, it comes across as a list of things you think she *should* be trying. I think at the very least you should apologise for how you approached that conversation. 

With regard to the candy bar, did she know that eating it in front of you would make things worse for you? I agree that from your perspective it was not the most considerate thing, but from her perspective, she saw a candy bar she wanted and then she ate it and then you told her she couldn't do that in front of you. I can see how for her it could appear like you were policing her food choices. (If it was intentional or deliberate to hurt you I would be giving a different answer, but to me it sounds like she just didn't realise it would hurt you.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I will try sharing what has helped me but keep in mind you might be totally different to me so it might not work. 

1. I tried to learn about how these people think and what makes them think that way. What are they worried about when they say racist things? Where do those beliefs come from? Often I've found out that they carry a lot of fear with them ... and that has led me to show a lot more kindness to those people. I still think racism is bullshit and I don't agree with it, but I can treat those people with more kindness because I can understand they are coming from a place of fear and misunderstanding and they don't have the emotional intelligence to realise that they are dealing with their fears through lashing out at others. 
2. It is important to think about what your goal is. If your goal is to convey facts, then it doesn't matter if those facts are conveyed in a kind way or a less kind way. That means that kindness is a choice here - you can choose to phrase things in a way that is kind, or in a way that is less kind (think "That other dress was better, it made your eyes look amazing" vs "This dress makes you look fat"). It's also important to keep in mind that sometimes, hurting someone around you with your words is not the worst thing. It can be kinder to say something that may be hurtful in the nicest way you can than it is to mislead someone about reality (for example, if you're not interested in dating someone, it is kinder to hurt them by saying no in the nicest way you can than to mislead them into thinking you're interested). 
3. I don't miss being mean. I used to be really mean sometimes, and I think if I really wanted to be I could be again (maybe it would take some practice first), but it's just ... not worth it. If you are kind to everyone, all the time, then you don't have to be mean to make your point. If one of my friends sees me tell someone to fuck off, or if I walk out, then everyone *knows* that person more than deserved it, because usually I treat everyone with kindness. Being mean to someone doesn't really help things, even if I'm angry with them - it just escalates things into more unpleasantness. (This doesn't mean you should be a doormat, it just means you should respond to things without malice. If someone assaults you, you should report them to the police, but you shouldn't arrange for a gang to bash them up in prison. A fair resolution doesn't have to include unkindness.) 

I learnt most of this from a really good friend of mine ... one of the kindest men I have ever met. I hope it helps you as much as it helped me :) </TEXT>

I really have trouble with this. I think it's possible there is a correlation, because polygamy often happens within cults or other groups that see sex as something men are entitled to, but I don't see any way polygamy itself could lead to molesting children. Do you have anything to back that up? </TEXT>

<TEXT> You brought up that you'd like her to be more healthy (this part was done well), she agreed with you, and then ... you started laying down some rules for her? Like, telling her she needs to go to the gym with you, telling her she needs to exercise 3 hours per week, telling her she should cut out sugar... (This part with the rules is the part you did extremely badly.) She doesn't like going to the gym with you. She doesn't want to exercise 3 hours per week. She isn't interested in dieting or cutting out sugar as a way of losing weight and she **certainly** isn't interested in you policing her diet (especially when she's on vacation with you and not expecting you to be watching her choices and judging the things she eats).  There are other perfectly valid ways of losing weight, and of being healthy, and she needs to find the ways that work for her (not the ways that you think she should be doing). 

A better way would have been to *ask her* what sorts of things she'd like to do, then support her in doing them. I think that ship has sailed, though. I don't think there is anything you could say about healthy eating or diets or exercise that she will be open to at this point. 

You also made the situation worse by saying "All I care about is effort", then she said she'll try, and you rejected that. You literally told her the "correct" thing that you wanted her to say, instead of accepting what she was trying to tell you. Obviously you care more about "the right attitude" than you care about her efforts, and I'm amazed your girlfriend didn't scream at you on the spot. If someone had told me off for using the wrong words or having the wrong attitude about something that I was trying to do *as a favour to them* then I would certainly not be dating them. I would not be speaking to someone who treated me like that either. 

I think you should apologise to her. You should tell her that you still want her to be healthy, but the way you approached that conversation was terrible and domineering and didn't respect her or her ability to make decisions for her own diet and health. Apologise for judging what she was eating, apologise for trying to "correct" her attitude and not accepting her, too. 

The fact that apologising hasn't even crossed your mind is ... ridiculous. I feel sorry for your girlfriend. 

I hope you can resolve this and grow in your understanding of each other. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Is this relationship what you want? When you picture "ideal relationship" in your head, a relationship where you get everything perfectly and exactly how you want it, does it look like the one you're in now? 

It's ok to make compromises as your relationship grows, but the compromises should be on things that you can be equally happy in your relationship if you allow those things. Are you going to be equally happy if you allow him to cheat on you? Are you going to be equally happy if you only have time with him 3 days per week (or less, if he decides to randomly cancel on you)? Are you going to be equally happy if he keeps canceling your plans? 

I think you know the answer to these questions. 

It can be very hard to leave the only loving home you've ever known, so you'll have to trust me on this, but ... you will find someone who is able to treat you even better than he does. It might take time and effort, maybe you might even need therapy, but you can *definitely* do better than someone who cheats on you and neglects you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you're struggling so much how could you *possibly* be expected to fix this on your own? How could it possibly be your fault? It started when you were 13, that sounds like you hit puberty and your brain was like "WTF IS THIS" and blew up at you. You couldn't be expected to control that, you were a kid! You're sick. You've been sick for almost 10 years now! No wonder you're struggling! Mental illnesses are *illnesses* and we don't expect people to cure themselves from physical illnesses. Let's say you start having seizures. You wouldn't be thinking "I just need to lift some weights so my body works properly again". 

Part of mental illness is that it lies to you about how worthless you are. There are soooo many examples of people who have taken their own lives while struggling with mental illness. A lot of them believed they were worthless, but you don't have to go far to find examples of people whose families loved them and miss them every day. 

Talk to your mom about it and get help. You don't have to live like this. You don't have to fade out feeling like a worthless lump. You can get therapy and you can become a person that you're proud to be, and it will definitely be tough but it will be better than living your life waiting to die. 

Even if therapy is expensive, there are free or low-cost therapy options, there are self-help books, and there is no reason to continue living like this when you could be using these resources that were created for people exactly like you. Let the experts help you so you can get better. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think he's made it clear that he still wants you in his life - he's agreed to pay for you to visit him. As much as you want. In Brazil. No matter how rich he is, that's not a small thing to agree to. He's even said he'll have trouble being without you. For someone as stoic as you describe him, that's a pretty big thing to say. 

No matter what, you know that he still wants you in his life. (For what it's worth, I think your response might have hinted to him that you're not interested in more - he said he'd miss you, and you said you'll find someone else.) 

I don't think you need to label your relationship, just say something like "I really like what we have. I'd like if we could continue it, and if you move to Brazil and I stay here, I'm worried it won't continue. Can we talk about other options?" Then you can talk about things like him staying in New York, or you moving with him. 

If you *want* to label your relationship, I think describing it as "a long-term relationship with someone I like a lot" is definitely truthful and doesn't put too much pressure on either of you. You could also say something like "a long-term relationship that works very well for us both and that I'd like to continue". 

I think after he agrees whatever you agree on, you can start asking about labelling the relationship as something else, if you'd like to (for example, "Does this mean I can call you a boyfriend now? We don't have to change anything, just the label") </TEXT>

That way she can definitely pick one, or if she is genuinely busy at all of those times it's up to her to suggest an alternative. If she tells you she can't do any of those times then I would assume she's not interested. 

No matter what happens, you should just assume she wants to be friends unless she does something to indicate she wants more. Telling you she has a boyfriend is a sign that she isn't interested in dating you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In order for him to be ready to date you again as an equal, he needs to: 

1. Realise he needs help (may take anywhere from a few weeks to many years to never) 
2. Actually get the help (may take several months or maybe years, depending on his barriers to getting help) 
3. Grow and change as a person with the support of his professional help (will take months, years, or may be a lifelong thing) - this is the only step that you could, theoretically, support him with, but you can't sit around waiting for him to reach this point if he's not even interested in step 1. 

All of that will, realistically, take him years. In that time, you're both going to grow and change as people, and you're going to move on with your life and discover new things and life will take you in different directions. 

If in several years time you get back in touch with him and things spark off again, great, but more than likely you will both have found new partners in that time, and your lives will have changed dramatically, and you won't want the same things you wanted in the past (that change will likely include what you wanted from each other). 

I don't think he's going to suddenly realise he needed to be different, because if he was going to do that, it would have happened already. Maybe one day in many years time he will know, but by then, neither of you will be the same people and your relationship will just be a part of your history (as it should be). 

You're doing the right thing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> She was picking up men on Craigslist ... she could've done worse than a guy who genuinely enjoyed her company and had lots of hot sex with her.

It's not your job to police other people's decisions. If she was consenting and happy with what was happening, then it's not your job to second-guess that and slow her down. If you noticed she needed help or needed to slow down, that's different, but from what you said you had no idea.

I hope her life improves. I think you were part of her downward spiral, but only because she made you part of it. You didn't ruin her. It was her choice, and if you'd known, you would have refused to be part of it.

Questions:

* How old were you feeling that you needed to feel "young again" at 34?? What had you been doing up until that point?
* Are you going to keep talking to her?
* Do you still feel "young again" after your time with her or does it disappear completely once the relationship ends? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, what you need is therapy so you can be happy independently of your family. Removing yourself from your entire remaining support network (girlfriend, friends, etc) is not going to make you feel more supported. 

It is going to be far easier to fix your mental health in your home country, because you will not be considered an immigrant who has to prove their entitlement to mental health care. You can go and get it now (though there is probably a waiting list). 

If you still want to move away after you've tried therapy, at least you'll be in a better financial position to move and find yourself a new start somewhere else. You will not find "parents" who will take over supporting you, but you might find mentors and people willing to offer emotional support (however, you are equally likely to find those in the UK as anywhere else in the world). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why is he feeling pressured? You didn't even ask him for sex. Where is the "pressure" coming from? It sounds like something is off about this scenario. He's making you feel horrible and guilty for something that you didn't even do - in any relationship that would be a red flag, but due to your large age gap, it's even more concerning. It suggests that he may have unhealthy ways of dealing with his emotions and relationships, where he blames you for himself feeling inadequate (the old "It's not MY fault that I'm doing this, it's yours for pointing it out!). 

It's also concerning that you've become scared to initiate any physical contact with the man you love, and neither of you seem to think this is a crisis in your relationship. This is a crisis in your relationship. This is the sort of thing that kills relationships. This needs to be addressed, immediately, and the fact that you feel the problem is *him feeling pressured* rather than *him ignoring what you need and making you feel guilty for it* is a huge red flag and suggests, again, that he may have unhealthy ways of dealing with relationships, and also suggests you might be believing him when he says things are your fault, even though they are not. 

Thirdly, I am concerned that you can't discuss this with him. Part of this could just be because you're young and afraid, but if he genuinely would be offended by you saying he's not meeting your sexual needs, that's a problem. If he would be angry at you for bringing it up, that's even worse. When you find out about his needs, your reaction is not "You're making me feel like a bad person, never mention this again", your reaction is "I need to do better for you because I love you". That should be his reaction too, and the fact it isn't is another huge red flag. It indicates, again, that he has unhealthy ways of dealing with his emotions and his relationships. 

Listen. I know you love him. He probably is very kind to you, and makes you feel like no one else does. I really feel that in your post, and in the comments you're making. I'm just very very worried about you, because from what you're saying, this man has great difficulty dealing with his emotions in a way that is fair to his partner, and he has great difficulty treating his partner as someone who is equally important to himself. Those factors can lead to someone being abusive. It also sounds like you would do anything to make him happy, and you feel guilty easily (even for things that are totally normal, like wanting sex with the man you love). That can lead to you being an easy target for abusive men. The age gap makes it even more likely your relationship could be abusive. 

I hope I'm wrong and that all of these huge red flags don't actually lead that way, but please be careful OP. Read up on abusive relationships. Read up on setting healthy boundaries, on emotional blackmail, on guilt-tripping, and on how to manage conflict in a healthy way. If you're not sure about anything, find a therapist or some other third-party who you can discuss things with. I am so worried about you. Please stay safe. 

tl;dr Don't feel guilty. You didn't do anything wrong. I really hope he's not abusive. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It sounds like you have a few issues in your relationship: 

* He is afraid of everything, and you feel like that holds you back
* Sex is not as great as it could be
* Balancing extroverted and introverted personalities 

None of those issues are insurmountable. You shouldn't leave him unless you WANT to leave him. 

Possible solutions: 

* Therapy (you mention he has some anxiety issues, and if he has untreated anxiety that is going to make it really hard for him to do new things) 
* Discussion of what new things he WILL try, and then you try them together at a rate he is ok with (maybe one date night per week where you try something new together?) 
* Discussion of what things bring him satisfaction and joy in your relationship, and then do those things together at a rate you are ok with (even if you're bored with the old things it's important to connect with him and enjoy the time you spend with him, in addition to doing new things that you want to try) 
* Sex therapist (can be good for resolving sex problems) 
* Discussion of what new things appeal to each of you in sex, and which things he and you would be comfortable trying so that you can come up with new ideas 
* Starting very slowly with new things (For example, if you want to be spanked, start out by getting him to touch or grab your ass during sex sometimes, then progress to light taps, etc. Lots of encouragement and joy throughout and no pressure to continue or do anything he doesn't want.) 
* Discussion of what each of you actually needs in order to be happy in your relationship (for example, how many nights per week/month do you need to be doing something new? How many nights does he need to be at home to relax? How often do you want to spend time with friends? How often do you want sex?) 
* Discussion of how you can communicate things with each other best (does he prefer face-to-face, emails, texts, phonecalls? does he need time to think things over before responding? does it work better to discuss things in the mornings or evenings?) 
* Discussion of things that will make each of you feel bad or insecure (e.g. him feeling pressured, you feeling trapped/bored) 
* Discussion of every single thing that bothers either of you, so that you both know exactly what the problems are and what is being done about them

 #x200B;

Your relationship has serious problems, but a lot of them are solveable with good communication and possibly professional support. Don't let reddit tell you to break up with him (of course, if nothing improves that is an option, but there are a lot of steps between where you are now and the break-up point). I met my now-husband at 17 and got a lot of stupid advice because "you're young, just dump him!" and that didn't help. Talk to your partner about what you want, and what he wants, and find ways to do both of those things. Work on any individual problems you have (both of you). If you **both** want to make it work, it can work, it just takes time and effort and willingness to understand your partner's perspective. </TEXT>

Also, if at any point you deliberately harm yourself, that is another sign you need professional help. 

I'm glad things are starting to improve but if they're still really bad then it's definitely worth it to see a professional.

I think the DVD was the right idea but maybe not exactly the right thing - maybe you can send her a few different stories from literotica (I suggest stories because women often prefer written porn instead of videos, and it might also be less confronting) and then ask her to list three things she thought were good and three things she didn't like from all of the stories (three things in total, not three for each story). That way you should at least get an idea of her general preferences and you can try to gain more knowledge from there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Do you have trouble getting hard when you're masturbating? If not, then it's probably related to deathgrip or porn or something and you should work on reducing your porn usage and masturbating in different ways. 

If you do have trouble while masturbating too, are you taking any medication that could affect that? For example, anti-depressants? If so, it's probably due to that. You could see your medical provider to discuss changing medication or lowering your dosage. 

If you continue to have trouble getting hard no matter the situation and there is no medication affecting you, then you should see a doctor to check if you have any physical health issues. For example, heart problems can cause issues with erections. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If she doesn't know how to begin, maybe you could try by exploring different ideas together (or separately, then coming together with your ideas). A good way to do this is through reading erotica (such as on literotica), watching porn, or listening to audio files (like on /r/gonewildaudio). 

This article, also, gives several different exercises you could try with your wife to explore and find out what works for you both: [https://www.healthline.com/health/healthy-sex/sex-tips-relationship](https://www.healthline.com/health/healthy-sex/sex-tips-relationship) 

You could also try discussing with her what might make her enjoy sex more, and what things get her in the mood. If she doesn't know, exploring together can be a lot of fun (and if something fails miserably ... well ... at least you can laugh about it). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maybe you can talk about using other methods of birth control that are more reliable. The pill is very reliable when taken correctly, but there is room for error - you might feel better about her using another form of birth control that is more long-term and less reliant on remembering to take it. 

You could also try doubling up on methods of birth control (e.g. in addition to the pill, she could use a sponge or spermicide or cervical cap, or she could take the pill and also track her fertility and you only cum inside her on her less fertile days). </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's serious now. You started *planning your own death*! Don't wait until it gets worse. The sooner you get help the better the outcomes are and the more likely you make a full recovery. 

Also ... Mental illness isn't the same level of "bad" every day. I have crippling social anxiety and some days I wake up and think "This would be a great day to go and visit someone!" -- that doesn't mean my anxiety is cured, that means I'm having a good day. On a bad day, I can't leave the house. Most days it's somewhere inbetween. Sounds like you had a bad day (or couple of days) with your depression, and maybe you have some ok days too, but that doesn't mean your depression is gone. 

I'm glad you still function but I bet it would be a lot easier to function if you got some help ... don't wait until you're worse to get help. It will be better tell people now, *before* it gets worse. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would ignore the size issue altogether unless he brings it up. Compliment him on the stuff he does well, tell him you enjoy it, tell him he feels amazing and you love the sex (assuming that's true, of course). 

Reassurance takes time. If you keep giving him compliments about things that you genuinely enjoy, he will start to believe you. Don't lie to him, because that will break his trust and then he won't believe any reassurance at all. Don't agree with him when he puts himself down, but don't get drawn into arguments either. Just say something like "That's not what I was thinking" and change subject. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, that sounds like squirting (it doesn't have to spray into the air like in porn). It feels like peeing yourself. It's annoying. It soaks everything. 

I don't think there's any way you can stop yourself doing it. I usually **can** avoid it by not continuing when I start to feel the initial stages, but that usually prevents me reaching orgasm so maybe not ideal. Sometimes I can only orgasm by squirting and sometimes I just have non-squirting orgasms instead, so it's ok to explore and find out what works for you. 

The way I deal with it when I'm expecting to squirt is to put a towel down (folded into 4ths so that it's thicker) and I also have a waterproof mattress protector on my bed just in case. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Assuming that this event came from a place of mismatched expectations rather than lack of caring... I think you and your husband have missed some important discussions and learning that should really happen before you meet up with anyone. You can likely work through this as long as you communicate with each other and try to understand each other's perspectives.

First-up ... The fact that he made out with her and had sex with her for longer means **nothing** about the quality of your relationship. Meeting a new person can be exciting, and he was probably excited by it. That's normal. I think if you read up on NRE (New Relationship Energy) it will help you to understand and put his behaviour into context. As a loving partner, he should be able to channel that energy back into his relationship with you, too, in order to kick up your sex life together. (Note that you may have to discuss this with him before he understands it - he should be doing his research into this too, but if he doesn't know about it he can't research it.) This discussion about how to handle NRE is best done before opening the relationship at all, but since it's already happened, you may as well have the discussion now. You can also read about jealousy in open relationships and possible ways to work through it (though in this case, I think the jealousy has been made worse by your night not meeting expectations). 

 #x200B;

However, even disregarding the NRE aspect of it, he still missed a few important points that you are rightfully hurt by:

* He kissed her before you both had agreed you were ready for that to happen
* He had sex with her before you both had agreed you were ready for that to happen
* He had sex with her *in your bed* ***after kicking you out*** without discussing that with you beforehand
* He disregarded your sleep schedule and needs by allowing her to stay until almost 3am
* You both disregarded your sleep schedule and needs by allowing her to show up three hours late at 11PM when you wanted to be asleep
* He disregarded your sleep schedule and needs by bringing her back into the house even though he knew you wanted to be asleep (even worse because he kicked you out of your own bedroom to do so)

I think you should have a serious discussion with him about what your boundaries are, and what your expectations are moving forwards. For example, an expectation that all partners respect each other's sleep needs/schedules is reasonable. Ideally when opening up your relationship, you should discuss every single step before progressing with it (that means he should have discussed kissing her with you before he did it, then he should have left her in the car and come back inside to discuss with you before sex with her was even on the table at all). Since this has already happened, it is important to discuss what both of your expectations *were* for the night, as well as what you both expect will happen moving forwards. Don't assume he's on the same page, because based on that night, he isn't. It's important to discuss so that you can reach agreement on what outcomes you need.

If he went against any agreements you already had, you can still resolve things, but it's important to understand why he went against those agreements as well as what is likely to happen next time. If this is the case, it will likely take more time and discussion to resolve things. You need to be sure you're both on the same page moving forwards so that something like **this** doesn't happen again. If you can't resolve things on your own, you could try seeing a sex-positive relationship counsellor to help you to understand each other.

If he is unwilling to consider your point of view, or he keeps ignoring the agreements you have reached, then you might have to consider closing the relationship or even leaving him. Most likely though, this is a misunderstanding and can be resolved with time, discussion, understanding, and consideration for each other (on both sides).

If you go ahead with meeting anyone else in future, consider what boundaries you both can agree on beforehand to ensure the situation is something you're both happy with (e.g. a maximum duration of visit, a time the guest must leave by, whether sex is a possibility or not, when to check-in with each other about how things are going). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think you're inferior, you're just different. Your life experience is different to theirs and it makes you see the world differently. Then when you talk with them, you can't relate and you're not on the same level because their lives were so different to yours. 

It can be really hard to get across that gap and I don't really have a solution for you. I run into the same problem myself (not because of childhood abuse, but because my mental health problems dramatically changed my childhood in ways most people can't relate to). 

For me I just keep trying ... there **are** some people out there who I can connect to, but they are few and far between and I don't expect there to be one in every group I find. I think you'll find people you can connect to, too (I'm assuming you connect pretty well with your wife, for example). If your peers can't relate, try looking elsewhere for people you can connect with. There are some really empathetic and perceptive people out there who will be able to connect with you no matter the differences. 

You could also try to find people with similar backgrounds (i.e. survivors of child abuse). You won't get along with all of them but there might be a greater percentage there who can understand you than in the general population. Even if you're not there to talk specifically about your experiences, people with that shared background often have a better understanding of what you need to feel connected (or at least that's what I find when I speak to people who share my diagnosis - some of them annoy me *so much*, but others really "get" me in a way that most people don't, simply because we see things in a similar way). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why are you going back to uni if it makes you overwhelmed and stressed, you don't want to do psychology anymore, AND you already had a job you loved anyway? It doesn't sound like you want to go back to uni at all. I suggest you reconsider this course of action. 

I think you should speak to your doctor or any other specialist you're seeing about this, but I wouldn't rush to abandon the job that you enjoy. You were able to do the job just fine before, so I think it's likely that you will be able to do it again once the extra stress is taken off. I think, at the very least, you should wait a while and see how you feel about work once your stress has leveled out again. 

If you still want to quit work after your stress levels have stabilised (give it AT LEAST a few weeks), then it might be time to talk to work about scaling back or even quitting, but don't do it without a plan of what you're going to do next. Quitting in order to stay home and do nothing is not going to help. Quitting or taking a break in order to get more intense therapy and work hard on your mental health is ok (but do it with the support of your care team, not on a whim). Quitting to heal may also be ok, but it's important you have a plan of how that will work, the timeframe, and what you'll do next. I think, also, if you do decide you need a break, you should try to take time off from your job rather than quit it entirely (if possible, I know not all workplaces would allow this). 

I know what it's like being so scared and I wish I could help you :( I've been scared like that too. Please contact any support you have in place (friends and family, as well as doctors, psychologists, counsellors...) and discuss with them before you decide anything. Find someone you trust and feel safe with who knows you well, because their advice will probably be far better than mine. 

Right now you're doing too much, and that's what your anxiety is telling you. You need to be selective in what you remove from your life in order to bring it back to a manageable level, though. Don't start by removing everything. Remove one thing at a time until it becomes manageable again. 

I hope things improve for you soon. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Haha I started writing tips and got a bit carried away, sorry. Hopefully some of this will be helpful to you! 

Efficiency: 

* Plan out where everyone is going to walk. For example, when you build the kitchen, how are the chefs going to get the ingredients from the delivery area to the kitchen? Adding corridors to my planning helps a lot. 
* Prisoners and staff are annoying and sometimes they won't take the most direct route somewhere. Instead they try to take the route with the least number of doors they have to open. (Though it's more complicated than that because they also take into account whether they can unlock the doors or not.) So, plan where you will put doors too. 
* Use floor types. Some floor types make people walk faster. Put those in the places with a lot of traffic. 

Managing Snitches: 

* I love the snitch sorter mod. It puts all Snitches and Ex Law Enforcement in protective custody automatically when they walk past it. Otherwise, its best to check the reputations yourself when new prisoners arrive and put them in protective custody if they have those traits. 
* Keeping protective custody prisoners safe is hard. Have a plan for that because otherwise they will keep dying. (I do it by giving them a completely separate regime, so they are always in their own area when the med/max security prisoners are in the shared area.) 

Reoffending rate: 

* Pay attention to your reoffending rate. If you parole prisoners and they don't reoffend you get a bonus, so it's good when you can do that (it also stacks because then you get paid the intake fee for the new prisoner to replace the old one). 
* Reducing reoffending rate means balancing all the factors (you can check each individual prisoner to see their score for each factor). 
   * Punishment: If your punishment rate is too low, make sure your prisoners are not spending too much time in free time. (If you have a lot of work/freetime scheduled they may be taking advantage of that to get extra free time.) 
   * Rehabilitation: If this score is too low, make sure you are running rehabilitation programs during work hours and that your prisoners are passing the programs (they are better at passing programs if they are NOT suppressed, and if all their needs are met beforehand - I usually schedule 2 hours of free time right before the programs start). 
   * Security: For me this is usually fairly average (around -1 to 2), unless they're a crazy prisoner who keeps trying to run to freedom or start fights. If you have consistent problems with this then you might need more guards. 
   * Health: This is usually fairly average too unless they keep getting in fights or they're an addict, but you can get a good bonus from this if you make sure your prisoners are well-fed. If this is low across all prisoners, make sure you have enough guards and doctors to prevent and recover from fights, make sure you are running the drug treatment program (addicts have a penalty), or try increasing how much food your prisoners get. 

Avoid accidentally suppressing prisoners: 

* Regular guards don't suppress prisoners, but armed guards do, so be careful where you place armed guards (I usually only have them in the supermax wing because I like to feel good about rehabilitating all these criminals, but its up to you). 
* Snipers also suppress prisoners if the prisoners can see them or are too close to them. I usually have snipers on places where the prisoners try to run to freedom in escape attempts, but out of sight of the yards (except the supermax yard). 

Managing contraband: 

* There is basically no point to having regular visitation tables. Visitor booths work just as well and with no risk of contraband. 
* Put metal detectors on the doors to any room a prisoner can visit and steal metal from (workshops, kitchen, infirmary, library). I also put a line across high traffic areas, like the corridor between the cells and the shared area. This is to stop the passage of contraband around the prison. 
* Sometimes metal detectors fail so I try to have prisoners walk through at least two every time they leave a metal-containing room. 
* Put any room a prisoner can steal drugs from (infirmary, cleaning cupboard, psychologist's office) at the end of a long corridor, and put a dog at the other end of the corridor. I found that dogs don't sniff prisoners who they have just sniffed (that is why I add a corridor). I usually try to put at least two dogs, so that if one is on break the other one is still present. 
* All deliveries should go through at least two metal detectors and be sniffed by a dog on the way into the delivery room. I used to put dogs outside patrolling the streets (trucks would just drive through them no problem) but when I'm trying to be more realistic I put them in the doorway to the delivery room. 
* Metal detectors don't work if there isn't a guard somewhere nearby to see them and search the prisoners that set them off. 

Random other stuff I thought of: 

* If you make sure you satisfy your prisoner's needs, they will be far easier to control. (They also do better in Rehabilitation.) 
* When recruiting confidential informants its good to get the ones who are basically in there for life, because they get up to 100% coverage and never get paroled. The best candidates for this are Death Row prisoners who have won their appeal and become max security. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Once I have a general idea of a prison I like, I usually continue until it's either fulfilled OR it's become clear that my idea won't work. I restarted a lot more when I was just starting because I kept finding problems in my designs that were insurmountable without dramatic rebuilds. Now I've played a lot more, I don't have to restart so much and I only restart once I've finished the prison and don't have any "extras" I want to add to it. 

Also, initially I had a mixed security prison, which worked fine (as long as I was happy to let my Snitches be killed) ... but if you segregate the prisoners by security levels it becomes far more complex trying to manage how the different levels interact and deciding which rooms should be shared or not shared by different security levels.  Another level of complexity is giving them separate regimes (I usually give separate regimes to min/protected and med/max and supermax) in order to keep them all safe and allow them to sell to each other from the shop. 

I say this because these extra complexities make it far more likely that I will stay with a prison longer while I work it all out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have the same age gap with my husband and I met him when I was 17 (we didn't do anything sexual until I turned 18, though). We've been married 10 years now. 

I would be wary of your situation, though. In my situation, it was definitely mutual and in fact mostly me pursuing him. There was no pressure at all from him, and he was willing to wait for me to be ready to do anything. Your boyfriend seems to trying to pressure you. He's pressured you into dating, and now he's pressuring you to get rid of the end date. 

You say he's a nice guy, and you appreciate his friendship and attention, but you don't want to be in a relationship with him. So, don't. 

Him pressuring you like that is a red flag, and the fact you feel like you can't say no is another red flag. 

You should end things with him because you feel weird about it, because he makes you feel immature in comparison, and because he's pressuring you. The age gap is not the real issue here, all the other things are. The age gap just makes those other issues worse. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You have a lot of wasted space in your visitation/parole area. The parole rooms could share that wall between them instead of a random empty corridor, and there is a huge empty space in front of the kitchen there that you could put another room into if you move the kitchen door either down or up. 

You don't need so many visitation rooms, either (I have two for my supermax wing with just over 20 prisoners in there). I also agree with the other people that booths are better to prevent contraband. If for some reason you don't want booths, I would put metal detectors and dogs on the exits to the visitation rooms (or else make them all in one long dead-end corridor and put metal detectors and dogs at the open end of the corridor). 

I'm also not sure why you have two separate kitchens - why not just one larger kitchen? 

I'm also not sure how you play, but there will be a lot of prisoners with unmet needs (family, recreation, exercise) in that setup - they are more likely to riot and cause problems if their needs are not met, so I would probably create a common room or yard or something that they can go to that has the things they need. 

There are also a lot of narrow corridors which are not ideal for max sec prisoners because they seem to be more likely to start fights when they're all bunched together. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's nothing wrong with dirty talk or riding his face. Those are sexual activities. They're not "bad". It's not like there's only one way to have sex that's "good" and all the rest are "bad" - I really don't agree with that. To me, sex is all about enjoying whatever you enjoy and sharing that with your partner (as long as no one is getting hurt). 

Your partner sounds wonderful, but it also sounds like you both subscribe to the idea that there is a "good" way to have sex and that is limiting your enjoyment of sex. I think one of the best parts of sex is exploring all the different things you can do and finding out which ones work for you both. 

I agree with the people saying you could try seeing a sex-positive therapist. There is a lot to unpack here and I think there are lots of positive things you could explore with the right support. </TEXT>

I met my husband when he was 25. He was a virgin who had one ex-gf that he'd never had sex with (she cheated on him and left him for another man). I never thought of him as a failure or helpless in any way, he is amazing and I love him and we've been married 10 years now. 

My point is ... you don't have to be successful now. It's not like "be successful by 25 or you'll never achieve anything" - if that was true there would be a lot more failures in the world. It takes time to become the best version of yourself, and it sounds like you're still on the journey. 

You have time. You can change. You don't need to change to be the "alpha man" TRP would have you change into, but you *should* think about who you want to be. Do you want to be a man who hates women? Is that the outcome you **want**? If the answer to that is no, then think about what it would take to change your opinions, and seek that out. If the answer is yes, think about how you can cement that idea, and seek *that* out instead. At the moment, you're kind of exploring both sides by posting here and reading TRP stuff. My advice is to think about what will make you a better person, then go with that. 

The whole world is full of people. Some women choose douche-bro alpha-male types so they look good together. Some women choose cuddly men they can play video games with. Some women choose a man they can go hiking and exploring with. Some women choose a man they can go out partying with. Some women choose quiet geeky chess-players. Some women choose bikers. Some women choose men who devote their whole lives to charity and helping others. And some women even choose men in prison for domestic violence / murder. 

No matter who you choose to be, there will be a woman who is into that. You don't have to be anything unless you want to be. Look at people older than you who are in relationships. There are a lot of men who find relationships and end up happy, even if they don't fit the stereotype. Do not make life decisions based on what will get you women. Make life decisions based on what will make you proud of yourself. Something that if someone says "Dude you're a virgin" you can say "Yeah but I'm still fucking awesome, look at this thing I did!" 

Maybe you're in a situation where you have a lot of shallow women around. That's common (especially when you're in your early 20s, because everyone is more shallow around that age). That doesn't mean all women are like that, and it doesn't mean all the women you know will always be the same way they are now. Look outside of your immediate surroundings, talk to more women (including older women) about what they want in a relationship, and listen to what they say. You'll find that most of the time, what they want is NOT a red-pill alpha male. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think a carefully-selected truthful account is a good idea. Don't dump all of your problems on them, but it's fine to say you're struggling with your mental health and having difficulty coming into university. A few examples of symptoms are ok too (but don't get graphic and in-depth). Then, end with what you're doing as a next step (e.g. seeking help) and what you want them to do (e.g. "I just wanted you to be aware of this" or "Due to all of this, I would like an extension on XXX assignment"). 

If they don't believe you or they judge you for it, they are idiots and you should ignore their opinion (and also get documentation from a uni counsellor or someone similar who can force them to make accommodations regardless of what they believe). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have extreme anxiety problems so I have a lot of difficulty discussing things I want, even though usually I know what I want and just can't say it. What works for me is that I write to my partner every night ... in that message I usually write about what's working well for me, what needs improvement, and anything else I'm thinking about. It's often about my everyday life (which includes sex, but not only sex), but if we're doing something new, he will also request that I answer specific questions about that new thing (both before and after we try it). The questions are usually things like "Why do you want to try x?" or "How did you feel when I did x?" With some things, we don't progress with them until I have actually asked for them myself, even if that takes a long time. 

Specifically for planning new activities, I have found it works well if I write how I want something to happen for the first time and then ask him if we can do it and what he thinks about it. Then when it comes to discussing it, it's a lot easier, because he can say something like "I read your description and I liked x but I think we should change y into z because of these reasons, is that ok?" and then I can say yes or no, instead of freezing because there's too much anxiety to communicate what I want. And when he says "Do you want to try now?" we both know what I'm agreeing to and we don't have to discuss it further. (Once we've done it once or twice, we don't have to plan it out in advance so much, but for the first time it's good to have a plan). You could get her to write something for you too, if you think she will have an easier time writing than talking. (You could also try asking her while she's blindfolded, or while you're on the phone or texting, in case that makes it easier for her to answer honestly.) 

This also works in reverse - he will come up with an outline of what he wants to have happen, and then ask me to approve it. You could try this with your lg too. I think the key thing for me is that with new things, he gives me time to go away and think about it, and then write down my thoughts because I have trouble verbalising things. That way he is always sure I enjoy what we do. 

I also have trouble verbalising some specific things because I don't know exactly how to put them into words, and when I know the words, I feel really awkward saying them out loud. Maybe you could practice having her repeat some things that you know she likes (e.g. "Fuck me Daddy") and don't act until she says them. That way, when you want to discuss things, she will have the vocabulary available to discuss them because she's said them before. It will also help if you normalise the words you want her to use (like fuck, pussy, cock, tits...) because then she won't feel so awkward bringing them up. 

This advice assumes that her problems are similar to mine - she may be totally different but those are things that work for me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I advise you divorce him, because he has clearly shown he doesn't respect you or your relationship in any way. 

A key part of polyamory is **consent** of your partner. 

If you really don't want to divorce, I guess you should look for relationship counselling to try to work past this. Personally, I'm not sure I could forgive it, but if you want to try then that would be the way forwards. You know your relationship best. 

I would also suggest seeing a therapist for yourself if you're not already, because it sounds like this situation is terrible (and if you have an anxiety disorder a therapist will probably be helpful with that too). 

I am pro-poly but only with people who actually want to be poly. I wouldn't want to be forced into monogamy and I wouldn't force someone who is monogamous to accept a poly relationship either. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think you should cancel the cable, internet, and phone, but keep paying the car insurance until you get your car back. If she wants to keep your car, she needs to transfer it into her name immediately so that you don't have financial responsibility when she crashes it into someone. (And once it's in her name, you can cancel the insurance.) 

I recommend pursuing getting your car back, because you loved it and it's vintage and she will probably just trash it or sell it, but if you're happy for her to keep it anyway then get her to change it to her name. Give her a time limit to change it in, and if she fails to do so by that time, get it back anyway. (You may have to do this in writing, or via her friend, but I'm sure there is some way you can communicate to her what she needs to do.) 

It sounds like she is financially irresponsible (even if she's otherwise a good person), so you don't want to have your finances dependent on her decisions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, the way to get help for homicidal thoughts is to speak to a mental health professional. They won't put you in an institution unless you are planning to act on your thoughts - suicidal/homicidal thoughts are very common with mental health issues. 

If you're worried about anger issues, again, the best way to resolve those is through therapy. There are male therapists who specialise in "men's issues" which I think might help since I saw in your other comments you identify as an incel, and checked your post history and saw you're worried about female therapists failing to understand you. So, I think you should look for someone who specialises in men's issues (and also a male therapist, if you can). 

I do want to add that sometimes the first/second/third therapist you see is completely useless, even if they have great reviews. Be prepared you might have to see several before you find one that can be any help, but try them out anyway because once you find one that CAN help it makes a huge difference. 

I've seen several therapists myself so let me know if you have any other questions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> All men are not like that. 

If he's not interested in helping you, you should get rid of him. 

If the problem is just that you see mess differently then maybe you can talk to him about it. Maybe he doesn't recognise that clothes need washing until he's running out of clean clothes, or thinks the bathroom needs cleaning once per month instead of once per week, etc. If you talk about frequency and how often things should be done, and what warning signs there are that things need doing, then maybe he'll pick up on things better. For example, my husband and I wash our clothes whenever the basket gets full (or when there are enough dirty clothes to fill the basket, even if they are not all currently in the basket). You could also do it by regularity - for example, every day all of the dirty dishes need washing, no matter how many clean dishes are remaining. If he doesn't like that idea, ask him what regularity he feels is appropriate and try to compromise where you can. Different people have different ideas of what "clean" is so if you don't match on that, it might be causing problems without you even noticing. 

The fact that he says all men are like that is a bad sign, but the fact he makes dinner most nights is a good sign. Definitely try talking to him about it and see if he's willing to help out more to keep your home to a standard you can both enjoy. (Again, if he doesn't care, kick him out.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, I don't think there's anything you can really do if she isn't interested in leaving him. 

You should warn her and give her a copy of the results of the check you did, and you should give her resources that might help her if she needs to get away from him (for example, domestic violence counselling services/hotlines, women's shelters). Let her know that you hope he's changed, but if he hasn't, you're happy to help her move out somewhere safe (if you are). 

Encourage her to get into therapy no matter what. If you want, you can phrase it as "to better understand how to help him", but they should also be able to help her build her self-confidence and self-esteem so that if she DOES need to leave, she can. 

Keep in mind that as soon as she mentions to him that you're doing all this for her, he'll fly into a jealous rage and tell her you're trying to break them up. So ... be prepared that she might cut you off instead of listening to you. 

I hope she gets away from him before he does too much damage. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you can't communicate with your wife about your sex life, I'm not sure that opening your relationship is going to help. Communication is *essential* in an open relationship. 

Sex is a need, and your need is currently unsatisfied which is making it harder to think reasonably. That's normal in your situation, but you need to be very careful in how you react to this problem. I think if you push to open your relationship right now, with the current level of communication, you risk losing your relationship. 

I recommend relationship counselling with a sex-positive counsellor. This way you can talk in a safe environment, and communicate with your wife about your sexual needs not being met (hopefully in a way that doesn't make her feel guilty). Then, once you're both aware of the problem, you can talk about potential solutions, which **might** include opening the relationship. Rushing to opening your relationship is not going to solve things for you. I understand why you want to (you're suffering and you want to solve it NOW) but you need to communicate better with your wife about what other solutions might exist and what solutions will work for her, otherwise you could hurt her badly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's definitely the latter. It only sometimes gets *really* stuck to the point of needing surgery. Still, if your body has sucked it up, it's much more difficult to poop back out than you'd think. Poop is squishy and reshapes itself to fit out of the hole. Imagine if you stick an object in and then your body rotates it sideways... it's going to be stuck until you manage to reach in and twist it back around the right way to poop out.  

It's also like the other guy said ... there is a pointy end that helps it slide in, and a not-so-pointy end that makes it harder to get it back out. If it's small enough you can also reach in and rotate it back the other way but it's not exactly simple.

<TEXT> A panic attack is short-lived and you feel like you're dying ... it can last up to around 15 minutes. 

An anxiety attack where you feel extremely anxious, but you know it's because you're anxious and you know you're not dying - it's extremely unpleasant but it's not the same as a panic attack because you are aware all of the feelings are due to your anxiety. It can also last much longer, though the most intense part of it is usually fairly short (15 minutes or so). 

The two are easily confused, because a lot of people get anxiety attacks and *call* them panic attacks, and even mental health professionals sometimes call them that. I don't get actual panic attacks but I do get very intense and extreme anxiety attacks and I never know what to answer when professionals ask if I've had a panic attack before. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not normal, but it's not unheard of either. [This study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2879692/) says

 Epidemiological studies suggest that auditory verbal hallucinations  (AVH) occur in approximately 10%15% of the general population, of whom  only a small proportion has a clinically relevant psychotic disorder. 

It *could* be a warning sign of something more serious, like schizophrenia. This page has a lot of information about warning signs to watch out for: [https://www.helpguide.org/articles/mental-disorders/schizophrenia-signs-and-symptoms.htm/](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/mental-disorders/schizophrenia-signs-and-symptoms.htm/) 

If it's been that way most of your life and it's not bothering you, then you're probably part of the 10-15% of the population that experience minor hallucinations regularly and I don't think you need to worry about it. If it's getting worse or you're getting new symptoms, you should probably see a specialist to make sure it doesn't turn into something more severe. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I guess you could try to find solutions that don't involve leaving work? For example, talking to your boss (if your boss is understanding) to organise a cool-off room where you go when you have a panic attack. You could also try taking a 10-20 minute break in the bathrooms or somewhere quiet until you've calmed down a bit, then get back to work. That way having a panic attack at work won't be such a big deal and hopefully it will reduce your anxiety a bit. 

You could also look online for techniques to interrupt a panic attack if you feel one happening, so you know ways to slow it down or prevent it happening. For example, controlling your breathing often prevents you hyperventilating which will help because hyperventilating makes panic attacks worse. This article has a lot of information about controlling panic attacks: [https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/290177.php](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/290177.php) so you could try some of the techniques there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Have you done any CBT? It really helped me with identifying unhelpful thought patterns and working to change them. It sounds like you have identified this one but you don't know how to change it, so if you're in therapy this is a great thing to bring up with the therapist. 

For me, what helped a lot is that if someone said something nice to me I started off by thanking them. Even if they are completely, totally wrong about me, I thank them because it was a nice thing to say. I would keep the argument in my head, and then later (like as part of therapy, or in a thought diary as part of CBT) I would use therapeutic techniques to examine it. Now I can accept compliments much more easily. 

I hope things improve for you. I definitely recommend bringing this up in therapy if you haven't already. Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you're the type that likes skirts/dresses, they're hard to move around in if you're used to pants/shorts. Practice at home first so you don't accidentally flash everyone when you try to sit down (particularly practice sitting, sitting comfortably, sitting with your feet up, and *especially* practice sitting on the floor if that's something you could potentially be doing). Sitting on the floor in a short, tight skirt is probably best avoided altogether. Looser skirts can be strategically arranged, and longer skirts usually cover enough as long as you keep your legs together. 

Women's clothes are often thinner than men's clothes. That means you might have to wear more layers to stay warm in cold weather. I've never been very good at layering so ... I guess I don't have a lot of advice other than to keep in mind that wearing a sweater might be enough if it's a men's sweater, but might not be enough if it's a lady's sweater. 

Also be aware that many many women's clothes either don't have pockets, or else they have tiny pockets. If having your phone on you at all times is important to you, either be careful to buy clothes that DO have proper pockets, or get comfortable tucking your phone in your bra. For anything else that you like to keep in your pockets, you'd probably be better off getting a handbag (but I don't like to keep my phone there because I never notice it vibrate). 

Socially ... I don't think there's anything that's entirely off-limits, but women as a group do interact differently than men as a group, and people will treat you differently as a woman than as a man. I don't think there's anything that's really "wrong" but it might take some time for you to get used to being treated differently. If someone says something like "Wow that's really direct for a woman" don't panic. They say that to me too and I am cis female. You don't have to fit "stereotypical woman" personality to be female (and, really, life as a woman involves a lot of people telling you you're not being womanly enough lol so don't worry if you run into a few of those people). 

I don't wear makeup so I have no tips for that, sorry. 

If you're growing your hair longer as part of your transition, you might need to learn more about how to look after long hair (for example, using conditioner is more important for long hair) and how to style it. Youtube is really good for that and there's lots of other stuff online too. And if you already have long hair or you've decided to keep it short that's cool too, just letting you know in case it's something you didn't think of. 

If you have any more questions feel free to ask :) We all have to learn somewhere. </TEXT>

 We talked a lot while walking however every two minutes or so, my mother  would turn around and say "We aren't here to hear you talking." "Do you  even breath sometimes?" "You annoy me please stop talking." "It's been a  few times that you said this name, I don't care." And she snapped when  we arrived close to a monument "Anon shut the fuck up now we're in a  family meeting not in a we-have-to-listen-to-your-lunatic-speech  meeting." And I shut up. It made me terribly sad 

Do you think he listened to that and thought "She seems like such a lovely mother" ??? 

 At one point we were talking about our mother, he said that she reads a  lot and loved books, I told him that in 19 years of life I never ever  saw her reading a book and that she constantly watches TV, this is a  very important bit as she said to him ***"See  how she badmouth your mother, making me look like I'm not an  intellectual? Just like your father's mother badmouthed everyone."*** 

The way your brother responds to disagreements is to joke and explain his point of view, not say things like "Just like your father's mother!" Do you think he thought your mother had a reasonable response here? 

 #x200B;

Not to mention she mistreats him too, for example: 

 When he talked to me about his life stories, every time he says that he  worked on something that didn't work my mother muttered that it was a  bad idea and that he could've lost it all/shouldn't have done that. If  he had listened to her, he wouldn't be here now. 

Do you think he enjoys his mother telling him off for his career choices? Especially career choices that **ended up being successful**?? 

 #x200B;

He's not going to think you're lying, OP. She treats him badly, she treats you badly in front of him, she treats his daughter badly (according to your comment), he's not an idiot. You can't be "trying to make her look bad" when you talk about how her behaviour makes you feel. Example: "When she kept telling me to shut up while I was trying to talk to you, it made me sad, because I was really enjoying getting to know you. I wish she didn't make me feel that way." 

He won't think you're after his money if you never ask for it. Come up with plans that don't involve asking for his money. If he wants to help you, he will say so. (It's ok to say things like "I looked at X School but it was too expensive, so I'm going to Y School instead." Then go ahead and go to Y School.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, a guy I met in a course I did.. he gave me such a bad feeling. I avoided being alone with him and I considered reporting him because he usually worked with really vulnerable people (elderly/disabled). In the end I didn't report him, because he never did anything I could point to as actually wrong, he was always polite and professional, so I figured I was just overreacting (and maybe I was). 

I finished the course. Nothing bad happened. A year later when I visited his old company for something, they said he'd moved to another state and no longer worked there. That's the last I heard of him and I hope I never see him again. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Did you actually read the post? I was talking about when I was a teenager and used to manipulate people. That was over 10 years ago, and the entire point of it was that I DON'T do that anymore. Not that a post I made 3 years ago should be relevant to a discussion we're currently having anyway. 

 Just because it's a tragic event for her (of her own partial fault)  doesn't mean that this discovery is any less traumatic for him. He's a  completely innocent party in this. One moment he has a happy  relationship working towards marriage, the next his future wife is  telling him there's a video out there online of her fucking this guy  that she regularly maintains a close friendship with, who posted it  online, and she's still trying to act like he's a good guy. Most people  would be pissed in that situation. 

Of course most would be pissed, but if his first reaction is that him being pissed is *more important* than his fiancee being violated by someone she trusts, I don't think that is an appropriate reaction. 

He **was** an innocent party until he called her a slut. That made him a joint attacker. </TEXT>

The person who experiences the trauma goes at the centre (that's OP), then the people most affected by it are on the next ring (that's her fiance), then others go further out. 

I'm not saying it's not traumatic for him, I'm saying that he's making it about him (i.e. putting himself in the center) when OP is the one who has been harmed the most. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If he's wanting more than you are comfortable with and he's not ok with going slowly for you, then he sounds more like a predator. The fact he's so quickly said he thinks you're the one also suggests that he is a predator of some type. 

Real relationships take time to build trust and intimacy. He is using you as a fantasy dispenser, and when you can't keep up, he will drop you and find the next one. 

If you **want** to be his fantasy dispenser, you don't have to come up with any ideas, just tell him that all of his ideas are SUPER hot and then go along with them. When you run into an idea you don't like, he will probably get angry (because as I said he sounds like a predator who only wants a girl who will do his fantasies for him) and so be ready to drop him once he stops being fun. 

IF on the slight chance he is for real (he's not), you don't have to fake it to show you're in his league. Just because he said he likes you doesn't mean you have to do anything impress him. If he likes you, he's already impressed. If he starts saying things like "a good girlfriend would do x" or "anyone else would do x why can't you?" or "I thought you were the type to do x!" those are manipulation tactics. A guy who likes you will say things like "We can take as much time as you need" and "It's ok, we don't have to do that if you don't want to" and then he will follow through with that without making you feel guilty for saying no. 

I wish you luck, but please be careful and don't fall for his lies. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know what you mean, one of my serious partners right now is an online partner and its hard when I want to speak to him but he has to work :( 

Have you got any rituals with him? For me that helps a lot (I have anxiety too). When I get anxious with him, we always do some specific things to help me calm down, so going through those things on my own helps me when I am anxious while he's not there, because it makes me feel his presence and comfort even if I can't actually speak to him. 

I also write to him every night before bed, which is a good way of de-stressing. When I get anxious during the day, sometimes just planning to write it down later is enough. (It also means he always knows what's going on in my life, and anything I'm particularly worried about, and it gives me space to bring up issues that are hard to bring up in conversation but I still need to say.) It also gives him time to decide how to address anything and if he wants to write back, talk about it, or let it go. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My point is that IF their mental state is so dire that they are at the point of seriously injuring themselves just to get into the country, they should be treated for that (which may involve being let into the country anyway). They shouldn't be *actually injuring themselves* before anyone cares.

Everyone ends up a victim in some way in a warzone and you were no exception. You didn't want to be involved in that, but you were. 

If you haven't tried it, therapy can really help. Even if you don't have PTSD (I'm not an expert so I can't tell you either way), it's such a hard thing for anyone to deal with that it's worth talking it over with a therapist. If you can, I'd look for one who has experience helping people who have been involved in war because they will know best how to help you. 

Take care of yourself OP. You deserve some happiness. </TEXT>

I support the medevac bill because I support people receiving medical care that they need. I don't believe that granting medical care in emergencies constitutes "weakening border protection laws", but if it does, then I want that. 

The ones who could be resettled in the US ARE being resettled in the US. The US refused to take several of them, though, and the rest remain in detention. Several of them attempted suicide after hearing that the US had rejected them. 

If we're so determined for them to be resettled elsewhere, why don't we let NZ take them? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know what the solution is because I'm not an expert but I am SURE Australia can do better than indefinite detention and scare campaigns. We *should not* accept indefinite offshore detention as the "best" option. There are multiple groups and experts offering opinions on how to improve things, and we should be listening to those people! 

At **no** point should we be overruling experts on something as basic as "These people need medical treatment and should receive it". If Australia is placing people into a position where basic human rights are denied, then Australia needs to stop doing that. 

I don't think offshore processing is evil but I think the conditions Australia is currently enforcing are. I agree there are concerns about refugees, and they are valid concerns, but we need to find ways to address those concerns that don't involve human rights violations. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I used to have this problem with one of my partners, but I have changed how I view sexual success. Instead of looking at an orgasm as a sign of success, I ask him directly. "Was it good? Are you happy?" and if he says yes, I believe him. 

At that point it comes down to trust ... do I trust that he's telling the truth? And if he is, then it's fine. He'd tell me if there were problems. 

I think you need to talk to him about it, and you need to listen to what he says. If you can't do that, you should try some therapy to find out why/how this makes you panic when there is no need to. That sounds like more of an anxiety problem than a relationship problem. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I guess it depends what the purpose of the party is. 

When I've thrown/attended a housewarming party, the purpose has been to celebrate a new place to live. You can celebrate anywhere. If you're showing off your new home you can do that via pictures (as I already said). 

If your main purpose of the party is to invite guests TO YOUR HOME then yeah, in your home is necessary, that's why I added my final point about "If for some reason it MUST be in your house". 

In my opinion, inviting guests to your home for a housewarming celebration is traditional but not necessary, and so I'd just have the party somewhere else. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ohhhh I empathise so much :( I could have written this myself :( 

I don't think there's much I can do to help. Like you say, meds and therapy are just ... tools ... and you getting better is all on yourself once you get the tools. It's still hard. It takes time and patience and practice and even then it's a rollercoaster of good days and bad days and terrible days and sometimes a great day, and NO ONE GIVES YOU ANY CREDIT, that is the worst part for me. 

Two years ago I was scared to leave my house (like clinging to my partner shaking as we went outside). I go on walks with him for fun, now. I am making so much progress and doing so much better now but most people don't SEE that, they just see that I still can't go hang out with friends in a coffee shop ... and that I don't even HAVE friends ... and that I can't work ... and they conclude nothing has changed. Everything has changed! My whole life is different. I have so much less fear, I go out more, I am happier with myself, I am making progress towards my goals ... 

The point is, the progress you make isn't always obvious to others. It doesn't mean you aren't making progress. You're fighting your way through, you're getting better, you're TRYING things even if they're hard and even if you struggle, and I know it's hard and I see you and I'm proud of you for continuing. You deserve to be proud of yourself too. 

What I'm doing that's working for me, is that I'm starting very very slow, with incredibly tiny things. Like ... I started with looking out the window. No one's going to think THAT was an achievement, right? Even **I** wasn't really scared of that. But ... it wasn't about scaring myself. It was about taking the first step to something bigger, so that I could take the next step after that. I'm sure you're already taking steps too, even if they feel inconsequential now ... in two years time, you will look back and realise how much better you've gotten and how much progress you've made. 

I don't really know what exactly will work for you, or if my experience is helpful to you in any way (maybe it's totally different for you), but ... just know I'm on your side. I see you and I know you're trying. In future, you will be better than you are now. 

Take care of yourself OP 3 </TEXT>

<TEXT> You definitely sound more paranoid or anxious than schizophrenic, but I'm not sure I'd describe you as either of those either. You DO sound extremely stressed, possibly to a level of needing therapy to manage or reduce it (especially given difficult/stressful childhood). That may be an anxiety problem or you may just be highly stressed (as you said, moving and having a brother diagnosed with a serious illness like schizophrenia would be a stressful time for anyone). 

Zoning out into your inner world is probably not a helpful coping mechanism if it just stresses you further, so maybe therapy could help you to adjust that to be something more beneficial. In fact if you feel like you're having trouble coping, therapy is always a good idea. 

To me it doesn't sound like you have schizophrenia based on what you've written here but if you're worried you could always see a specialist to get their opinion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What you're feeling is the effect of social isolation. I spent about 6 months in a similar situation, not really interacting with anyone, and it was ... bad. 

You do lose yourself. You start dissociating (that's the "not real" feeling you have). 

Social isolation also makes any mental health conditions you have worse. According to the internet (e.g. [this page](https://www.lifeline.org.au/get-help/topics/loneliness-isolation)) it can also cause or worsen headaches, so ... I don't know what you can do about that. Not being able to do your hobbies is probably making all of this worse, too. 

I think you should probably try to reconnect with the outside world. Maybe get some really dark glasses, like blind people wear? Or even just wear a blindfold or something if being outside your room is too bright. Then you can start going for walks around your house, or in your yard (with your mum or a friend, if you can't see). Maybe you could also start going out at night, to parks or someplace there won't be too many bright lights (but be careful of safety in that case, don't go wandering in an alleyway alone at midnight, and always tell someone where you're going). You could also try hanging out with your family or friends at your house, or their houses, so that you get a chance for more interaction but in an environment you can control so that hopefully the headaches are less bad. If too many people at once is too loud you could also invite just one or two at a time. 

I'd also recommend keeping in touch with people online - the more video calls you can do, the better, because the way you connect with someone is WAY better than if you're just texting them. I don't think online-only is the best way to go but it is probably the easiest, so you could start with that. 

You should also either try to find a new hobby that is headache-compatible, or try to modify your old hobbies so that you can still do them. I guess you could try listening to podcasts? Or doing some sort of craft (ceramics? origami? drawing? knitting?) Or maybe you could try exercising more? Reading? Whatever works and doesn't make your headaches worse (even if you have to do it in very short periods of time with lots of rest inbetween). I don't know what your regular hobbies include but maybe there are videos of other people doing them that you could watch? Or with just the audio? Or podcasts about your hobbies? Or maybe you could try doing a more low-key variation of a hobby, like for a few minutes at a time or with some modifications to make it better for your headaches. </TEXT>

This article seems like it might help with some other position ideas: [https://themighty.com/2018/02/disability-wheelchair-sex-positions](https://themighty.com/2018/02/disability-wheelchair-sex-positions/?PageSpeed=noscript)

I think the biggest thing will be arranging both of your bodies to the right position. That might take time and communication and patience, which might be hard if he's feeling self-conscious about it. So, try to keep positive and be willing to adapt your plans as you find out what works and what doesn't. All you can really do is try things out and explore together. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It depends on the person. Some people just make sex jokes and banter a lot, and some people don't. If you can see how she treats her other friends that should give you a good idea. 

It DOES sound like flirting, though. Some people are fine with casual flirting that leads nowhere and some people only flirt when they want a relationship. Again, if you can compare to how she treats other friends, that's best. 

I guess you could also try asking her about it - like "Hey we make a lot of sex jokes! Do you make jokes like this with everyone?" (downside to this approach is that she might think you WANT it to be a special thing only between you) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I mean ... there's not really a line. Anxiety is just a manifestation of fear/worry. If it goes on longer than a few days, you should get help for it (you've been experiencing it for months so you're already at a seek-help point). 

It's ok to have anxiety about the future... lots of people get that... you should go and talk to someone about it so they can help you sort through everything and you'll feel better. If necessary they can treat you for an anxiety problem too (but from what you're saying, it's about a specific situation, so it's more like you have a lot of anxiety about this situation, not like you have a severe anxiety disorder). Either way, talk to a counsellor or a therapist, they can help. If your uni has a counsellor, that would be the perfect person to see - I'm sure they've helped lots of students sort out what they want to do with their futures. 

Good luck :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> It sounds like you're still working out how things go. Right now it's normal to be upset and confused, so don't worry about that. 

I don't know if your relationship will work out or not and nothing you've said here strongly leans one way or the other (a few things in support of both sides). If possible, it would be a good idea to try relationship counselling with a sex-positive counsellor. 

I am concerned that you might be trying to use poly/openness to bandaid over her cheating. I don't think that will work, and that betrayal of trust needs to be addressed. 

I am also concerned that you say living together has killed your relationship. Sometimes that can just mean that people are incompatible (at least at living together). 

However, 

It's a good sign that you say she doesn't want to break up, and that she still wants to be with you, and that she's agreed to a poly/open arrangement. 

It's also a good sign that you're still communicating with her about everything, including how she's feeling and why she's doing what she's doing. 

 #x200B;

The fact you haven't had sex is pretty normal in major relationship upheavals like this, but I think it's something you both need to examine more deeply to work out WHY you're not having sex. Obviously if you never have sex again, your romantic/sexual relationship is going to be severely affected, but at the same time, you shouldn't be rushing into it until you're both comfortable. That means you need to understand what the source of the discomfort is so that you have an idea of when/if it can be resolved. 

I'm sorry I can't really help you more than sharing a few thoughts. I hope things get clearer for you over time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think you should be opening up your current relationship so you can date someone else you like better. That's **not** a fair way to do things. 

If you like someone else better, you should end your current relationship so your partner can find someone who sees her as the girl of their dreams. 

You could *try* being honest with your current girlfriend about how you want to stay with her for the sex, and see if she's ok with that. Don't lie and pretend you love her, though, because you say here multiple times that you don't. I think it's unlikely she will want to stay in that situation, but you should tell her anyway because if she doesn't have the full information, she can't give informed consent. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I tend to panic in new relationships too. 

What's worked for me is to go very slowly, and to be honest that I'm having trouble. I also do "tests" with myself. The test is that I try one tiny thing that I know my partner will like, and I see how they respond to that. If it's positive, that's great! Then I have more confidence, and I can do it again. If it goes badly, I look at the reasons why (usually the reason is something like "I didn't communicate what I wanted so he didn't know what I was doing and accidentally stopped me") and then do another test after I fix the reasons it failed. 

If you can't get control of the compulsive trauma-thoughts, it could be a good idea to try some therapy to talk things over and find a way to heal before you try dating again. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You should definitely discuss this with him and find out what he was thinking. I would be very upset in your situation too. 

It's possible that he was concerned about you hooking up with a girl while drunk, and he expressed his feelings poorly. It's also possible he's a hypocrite with double standards. Talking to him should clear up which of these it is, so you can react accordingly. 

It's possible he didn't know you wanted to be told about the other women. It's also possible he deliberately hid that from you. You will have to work out if this was a case of mismatched expectations, or him deliberately misleading you, so you can react to that too. 

Depending on what happens in your discussion about the events, and how sincere you feel he is, you can make a decision about if you want to continue with the relationship. </TEXT>

We don't have to have an in-depth discussion about every aspect of sex, only on the important things that you should know in advance. 

And apart from that, obviously if we do something new its good to do it slowly so we can stop if one person doesn't like it. Communication is important but it doesn't have to be a discussion beforehand, as long as it's clear everyone is consenting and communicates during what's happening. </TEXT>

If you have it, then ... nothing changes. You're still you. If you already have BPD, having a label just makes it easier to name what problems you have, it doesn't change the problems. And if you don't have it, that doesn't change the problems either. 

No matter what, you have problems. It doesn't matter if the label is BPD or something else or maybe no label at all. You don't need a diagnosis to know that you're having problems. Therapy can help with the problems, so, I think you should try some therapy. </TEXT>

I think a good way to start is to consider how much of a role you will take. Do you want to be essentially a co-parent (i.e. the daughter will live with you sometimes, has a bedroom in your home, you help to discipline her or manage difficult behaviour, you show up to all life events, and you get a say in parenting decisions?) or more like a family friend or auntie (visits sometimes, positive role-model, gives some advice, may be there for major events, but no real parenting role). When you and your ex agree on the role, then you can try it out. Remember that if you DO take a parenting role, it's not something can easily give up without damaging the girl, so don't take on more than you're willing to commit to. </TEXT>

This is not going to happen because he is not interested in it and you can't fix it by yourself. 

Your marriage will not improve. Your relationship will not get better. Knowing that, think about what you want your life to look like. What changes can you make that will make you happy? Don't think about changes your husband can make, because he won't. Think about what YOU can do. 

If you think cheating on your husband will help long-term, go ahead, but *really think* about what long-term outcome you want here, for both you and your children. If you're not sure, find some therapy (you say you're studying - the place you're studying probably does free counselling for students, so you could check that out). 

You say you feel lucky because he's no longer violent, but honestly? I feel sorry for you. Your situation is awful and no one deserves to be stuck living like that. I hope you find something better that gives you actual happiness. </TEXT>

I think those are the important questions you should be asking yourself. 

If she's not capable or not willing to build a relationship with you that you want to be in, then you need to end the relationship with her.

<TEXT> She makes you feel amazing and your connection is strong and you love her very much. That doesn't mean your relationship is healthy, and it doesn't mean you should stay with her. 

I think you should consider the possibility that she's already flirting/dating or having an emotional affair with the woman whose touch she craves. 

I also think you need to consider what you will do if she continues to abuse the trust you place on her. Is she worthy of the love you give her? Is she treating you as though she feels you're worthy, too? 

It's possible you can resolve this with good communication and potentially couples therapy, but don't expect it to be easy and it sounds far more complex than just this single issue you've presented it as. (FWIW I agree with you on the single issue - if she's ok with open relationships or being poly, she should be ok with that for everyone. If she's NOT ok with that, she shouldn't expect you to be.) 

I hope things work out for you OP but whatever happens it sounds like you're in for a difficult time. Take care of yourself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Every relationship has its unique quirks that you have to keep in mind. If you date someone who had a traumatic past that still affects them, that's a thing you have to keep in mind and work around. If you date someone with a fetish for melted cheese, that's another thing you work around. If you date someone who is incapable of doing dishes until they literally run out of dishes, that's another thing you work around. 

Some of that stuff is going to be a dealbreaker for some people, some of that stuff is going to be stuff you negotiate and try to find compromises to, and some of that stuff is going to be stuff you love. 

The same is true for an age-gap relationship. There will be some aspects that become more difficult because the person is younger. For example, I'm MUCH younger than one of my partners and the biggest impact on him is that sometimes, I mess things up or react in a way that a average person of his age would not. Usually this is just due to lack of experience, and once I get a chance to think about it I get better, but it does mean he has to be patient and let me sort things out, and if he dated someone closer to his age that would not be an issue. 

For every issue you find in an age-gap relationship, you have the same situation - you can compromise, you can decide it's a deal-breaker, or you love it. Relationships are complex are there are going to be all of those things in there. For some people there may be more negatives than others. 

If you're having fun, treating each other with respect, and dealing with any issues that arise, then there is no problem. Don't let the age gap itself put you off. Focus on the relationship, and facing the problems you encounter. If the problems make it not worth it, it's fine to break up, and if the relationship is still worth it despite any issues you encounter then go ahead. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am loving reading all of the other responses to this. I feel like I've found my people 3 haha 

I think mono/poly is a bad dynamic for a lot of people because a lot of people who are monogamous aren't interested in understanding poly. They don't **want** to work through jealousy, because to them there is no reason to. They tend to think that their poly partner should be happy with only them, and don't understand why you'd want to explore relationships with anyone else. 

I am currently in a relationship with a monogamous person (my husband), but it's working fine because he doesn't judge me for being poly and he's not interested in restricting me. He just has a personal preference for one partner at once. Most monogamous people are not like that. 

To me, poly is about not having to restrict myself. If I meet someone and I want to get closer to them, I don't want to have to say *no* to that because that's what society says I should do. I want to pursue that. The fact that I can love multiple people at once, and that it seems to be my default state (i.e. I don't "stop" once I have one) is why I would say I'm hard-wired to be poly. I tried being monogamous, and it wasn't bad, but there was a lot of denying things that I wanted just to avoid cheating and I MUCH prefer being able to not cheat while I still do things I want, which is what poly is. I find it more true to myself and my own values. 

 The main thing Im having trouble understanding (and am trying to learn)  is, if youre in love with one person, and you love them that much, why  would being mono be a deal breaker, if that person means that much to  you? 

Being mono isn't a dealbreaker. Denying who I am to suit what someone else wants is a dealbreaker. Putting up with jealousy and unnecessary restrictions because my partner is insecure and has decided it's MY problem is a dealbreaker. Helping someone deal with jealousy in a constructive way is fine, temporary and reasonable restrictions during times of crisis are fine, but most mono people don't want that. They want control, they want limitations on who you interact with and what sorts of things you say and the types of interactions you have, and that just doesn't work for me. 

You could ask the same question back to mono people - you love someone that much, why would them being poly be a dealbreaker? Yet for a lot of mono people, it is. 

There are exceptions on both sides (again, I am in a poly/mono relationship) but the reason most poly people don't want to date mono people is because we approach relationships differently, we approach jealousy differently, we have different ideas of how much you "own" your partner, and we have different ideas of what a "reasonable" restriction is, and those things are pretty incompatible long-term unless both sides are willing to communicate and compromise and understand each other's position. And, often, that isn't a thing both sides can do. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  He came pretty quickly, and then afterwards told me I was one of a  kind and that his cum was amazing. It wasnt until a few minutes of  his afterglow that he realized I wasnt okay. I wasnt crying or  anything, more shocked/dumbfounded/at a loss for words. When he sensed  something was up, he immediately started apologizing for nothing  specific. 

This particularly disturbed me. He came in an "amazing" way after violating you?? Does he get off on unwanted sexual contact? 

Also, he knew you didn't consent. He apologised BEFORE you told him what he'd done. That wasn't him being caught in the heat of the moment and forgetting (which would also be awful and violating and worth reconsidering the relationship over). That was him *knowing your wishes and choosing to ignore them*. It's even worse. 

And he's done this twice. 

I would have a very serious conversation with him about it, and express how awful his behaviour is, and refuse to have **any** sex with him at all for quite a while (at least until I felt safe around him again and I was sure he wouldn't rape me again!). Don't let him downplay it. Tell him directly. "You knowingly raped me and you thought it was fun. I'm not going to have sex with you anymore." Don't let him ignore how you feel. Don't let him argue with you about how it wasn't rape. You KNOW you told him, you KNOW he understood, and you know he did it on purpose. That's rape. Don't back down. 

If he isn't immediately apologetic and seeking therapy to find out how he could POSSIBLY have thought this was appropriate, then you need to prepare to leave him. You may need to leave him anyway, even if he does everything right. 

When it happens a third time, what will you do? Plan that now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think a good way to start is to think about what things you already do with him and enjoy, and then incorporate those into your scene. For example, say you love when he makes you suck his cock. In your scene, you could tie him up and tease him with your mouth. Or maybe you love when he spanks you, so you could order him to spank you in a specific way, with a specific intensity, and only when you tell him to. Things like that. 

If there are some things that you really like and don't get a chance to do very often, you could also try adding those. If he dislikes them but they are not hard limits, you could use them as punishments when he fails at something else (you could set up some impossible tasks, you could just announce you want to punish him, or you could just tell him "I'm going to do x until y happens and then I'll punish you"). If you don't like the idea of punishments, you could do still do them, but it would have to be "because I want to" or something instead. 

Finally, think about what things he loves, and use those as rewards. If you enjoy them too, even better, but still use them as rewards and make him work for them anyway (unless you don't want to - you're in charge of course). </TEXT>

<TEXT> If it was done ethically, I think the conditions it would be feasible under are that each woman only wants one man, and is happy to share, while the man wants multiple women and is dedicated to keeping them equally happy. 

There are examples of successful poly/mono relationships so I assume it's possible to have one poly man with many mono women who are in a relationship with him. There is no reason it would be impossible, just difficult to find people who would agree to that structure (and as several others have pointed out, potentially problematic due to how often this is done in cults and in certain interpretations of religions which don't allow women equal freedom of choice). </TEXT>

(I know this is not really a possibility for a lot of people due to financial reasons, but depending on where you live, it may be covered by the government because of your disability/mental illnesses.) If you could get someone who at the very least helps with basic hygiene and food, that will help a lot. If you are able to get full-time care, they may also be able to help you manage to get to some social events. You could also consider moving into supported accommodation or a disability care home, which is likely cheaper than paying for rent AND in-home care, but you'd have to live with other people. 

When you say your body doesn't let you, what exactly does that mean? How sure are you that this symptom is caused by your mental illnesses? I know it might be, but it can also be a sign of other neurological conditions so if you haven't seen a neurologist and it's an option for you, I would try that too (especially if you can find one that specialises in neurology AND psychiatry). Of course, continue consulting with your doctor, too. 

If neither of those things are an option, find a social worker. I don't really know how to get one, so you could ask your doctor for a referral to one. There will also be social workers at a hospital if you go in and ask to see one, and I don't know if they'll be able to help you or not but at the very least they should be able to tell you a more appropriate place to contact. If that doesn't work, you could try contacting Adult Protective Services (or whatever it's called in your location - they help disabled, elderly, mentally ill, or other vulnerable adults who are unable to care for themselves). Social workers should know what services are available in your area, and should be able to help you contact them for help. It's their job to help you find services that you need. 

If this seems like too much, contact one of your family members who seem to be helping to care for you and ask them for help to do these things. 

Here is a tl;dr version: 

* Get an in-home carer to help with hygiene and cooking
* See a neurologist/psychiatrist and ask about executive dysfunction
* Find a social worker and ask what services can help you
* Ask family for help if you get stuck </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have been in a similar position as your wife. One thing that has helped my husband is to remember that I love him a lot, and I chose to marry him and stay married to him, and no other relationships can ever take away how much he means to me. I don't love him any less. 

For him, I think that's resolved most of his problems - I make sure to give lots of validation of our relationship, and of how much he matters to me. It's not about validating him as a person, but about validation of him as a meaningful and loved and important part of my life. His biggest concern was that outside relationships would detract from how positively I see ours, but that hasn't happened. If anything, it's made me more positive about my relationship with him, and I make sure to share that positivity with him to reinforce our relationship. 

I'm not sure if this helps you or not because your situation may be completely different, but either way I wish you luck on sorting things out. It sounds like you're on the right track at least. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, just start. If you get uncomfortable, stop and wait, and eventually that feeling will reduce a bit and you can continue. 

For example, start by undressing. Don't show off or anything, just get naked and do something totally normal (watch a movie with him or something). Then when you're more comfortable, let him look at you more closely. Then when you're comfortable with that, let him touch a bit (start with non-genitals, then as you get more comfortable, let him explore). Then once you're comfortable with that, let him kiss your legs/thighs. Then let him explore more, and by then it won't seem like such a big deal because he's already seen and touched everything so you know he's happy to stick his face in there. 

For me it helps if the steps are mutual (like, he undresses and lets me look/touch too, even if I've already touched him in the past it still helps because it makes it mutual instead of all the focus being on me). I have severe anxiety so I have to do this with every partner but for most people once they're more comfortable with sex or sharing their bodies it becomes much easier and you can usually rush through or skip several steps. It's ok to take it slow if you need to though (especially if it's the first time). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a woman, feminist, very sex-positive (if that helps you). 

From what you've said, it doesn't sound like you did anything wrong. If she never communicated there was a problem, then how could you know there was a problem? The fact she had concerns about rape/dominance that she didn't tell you about is not your fault. (I think she's 100% wrong about you "making her the rapist" but if that's how she felt then obviously BDSM was not for her, and she should have said something.) If she didn't say a thing and pretended to enjoy it for you, that's her own fault. 

If she DID communicate a problem (even through lack of enthusiasm or through silence) and then you ignored it or pushed ahead anyway, then some of the fault is on you. Still not entirely your fault, but not entirely her fault either. (Unless she clearly said something like "No I don't want to do this" and you pressured her into it anyway, if that happened then it's probably largely your fault.) 

Either way, ten to twenty years is a LONG time to hold a grudge against someone you're supposed to love, especially if you don't communicate it. I agree with you that your relationship is dead but I do think she could have worked to save it. It doesn't sound like she's interested in that (and the time to work to save it was about ten years ago, by the sound of it). I'm glad she's healing now and I'm glad she's finally able to communicate how she felt. I'm sad for both of you that she couldn't communicate at the time and that she let it reach this point where everything is resentful and messed up. 

If she wanted to save your relationship, I think this sort of conflict could be worked through with relationship counselling and a willingness to listen to each other and understand, but it sounds like she's not interested in understanding your side, so you are better off letting it go and moving on. 

I don't think BDSM is bad, but it sounds like it was bad for her and she was unable to communicate that. 

I wish both you and your now-ex well. I hope any future relationship you have (when you're ready for it) is filled with open communication, exploration, and love. Take care of yourself OP 3 </TEXT>

It's already done now, so nothing you can do except plan how to avoid it happening next time. If you're worried about how it will affect your grades, you can also talk to your teacher and ask what you can do to bring them back up.

<TEXT> Anyone who has sex with you isn't going to feel self-conscious! They will literally be the best you've ever had and that can give them confidence to try new things without fear of being judged. You're not going to say "All the other people do x during sex! Why are you different?" because you won't know, and that can be amazing for people who need reassurance. 

You have the whole vast array of sexual things to explore ... I will never again feel what it's like to have someone penetrate me for the first time, because I've already done that. It's not new anymore. When it's new, it's a whole different level of exciting and fun because you've never done it before and you don't know what to expect. You still have THE ENTIRE WORLD OF SEX to explore! How awesome is that?! 

You don't have any leftover shame from idiots treating you badly. No one has stopped and looked at you mid-sex and said something hurtful about your body so that even though you know that person was an idiot and your body is gorgeous you still sometimes have a moment of self-consciousness when you see your partner glance down at it... That won't happen to you. 

You're giving your partner (when you eventually have them) free reign to teach you to do anything they like. Some people get set in their ways but you won't be, you'll be open to learning about whatever your partner needs. 

It is really easy to excite you. This might sound like a bad thing but it is wonderful. People who've seen 20 other bodies are not as excited about seeing a new one, but if it's your first one ... it will always be exciting and special and wonderful for you and your partner (assuming the sex happens in a good way, not like a drunken mistake). 

Your sex drive is more manageable. Like, yeah, you *really* want to have sex before you have it for the first time. But afterwards ... you can never replace it. Masturbating is different after you've had sex (still good, but different, because your fantasies change and you want the same feelings you get from a partner and masturbating can't replicate that). That means that if you don't have a regular partner your sex drive will suddenly start wanting SEX and you can't really fully satisfy that, only masturbate. It helps a lot but it's not the same thing. 

You don't have to worry that the person you had sex with was lying about their sexual history and has transferred you some STIs that will lie dormant in your body for years before surprising you with herpes or something one day. You can be fully certain that you DON'T have any STIs! 

Along the same lines, you don't have to worry about pregnancy or unknown children wandering the world. As a woman, for example, every time a period comes late I immediately think "omg am I pregnant???" even if I haven't had sex in months. And if you're a man I imagine you worry more about your partners getting pregnant, or if someone has gotten pregnant in the past and not told you. So being a virgin means no fear of that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm high libido too and I think you're just not understanding what "not in the mood" means. 

There's "not in the mood" - that's where the idea of sex is something you do NOT want. 

There's "neutral" - that's where you're not aroused, but performing a sex act will trigger arousal and you're open to that idea. 

There's "in the mood" - where you actively want and pursue sexual activity. 

99% of the time I'm like you and I'm either neutral or in the mood. But in that 1% of the time where I'm *not in the mood* there is no real way to fix it. Trying to have sex makes it worse. 

I think forcing yourself to eat when you have no appetite is a pretty good analogy for "not in the mood", except that it leaves out the social pressure (you have no appetite, but your partner LOVES this food and wants to share it with you and wants to see you enjoying it too!). </TEXT>

<TEXT> It really depends which sort of social skills you need. If you're bad at carrying on conversation, read up on conversational turn-taking and how to make conversations "flow". If you can maintain conversation but have trouble getting closer, read up on how to build closeness and connections with people (e.g. active listening, asking questions, sharing appropriate levels of vulnerability...). If you're bad at making jokes or getting jokes, read up on how humour works and how to detect it or use it during conversation (you can have "set" jokes that you make when you first meet someone, and you can detect if someone is making a joke by listening to their tone of voice or if what they say doesn't make sense in context). If you're bad at "appearing normal" read up on body language and tone of voice (how people sit when they're relaxed, what an appropriate amount of variation in tone of voice sounds like). 

 conversations die out. I know it takes two to have a conversation but  when the same scenario happens with most people there is probably  something I'm doing that could be improved. 

I would start with reading up on conversational turn-taking, in case you're killing conversations accidentally in how you respond to people. After that you could try reading about how to build deeper connections and intimacy with people, in case you converse fine but the problem is just that you never get closer. 

Once you've read up on it, you still need to actually go and practice it and try to use the techniques you've learned. I think you can probably just interact with people anywhere you go - in public, at work, with friends, whatever. If you have trouble finding people to practice on you could try volunteering as someone else suggested. 

Also, a lot of people don't NEED to read about skills like this to learn them, so if you find that you learn better just by practicing you should just go ahead and practice. For me though that wasn't really enough, so knowing how everything works helped a lot and then practicing after that went much more smoothly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We essentially "adapt" by only living in the parts where there is a good water supply. If you look at [this map](https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/61cfc5401332ba40ca2570d60018db27/21ae6b87d3fe7523ca258291001dfefd/Body/0.810!OpenElement FieldElemFormat=gif) of population density, you can see that most people live in certain areas - those are the areas with the best water supplies. We're not well adapted at all. We're constantly at risk of running out of water and dying. About the only adaptation we might have is that we're all aware of how to conserve water during a drought, but only because we've all experienced it in our lifetimes, not out of a great desire to learn. We're currently IN a drought that a large portion of us prefer to ignore. 

There are very few people who live in the actual arid parts of Australia and I guess maybe they are better at it than the rest of us, but I wouldn't know because I don't think I've met any of them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There might not be a hierarchy in how much you matter to him in his life, but there is definitely a difference in how he treats each of you and the type of relationship he has with each of you. "No hierarchy" isn't important when what you're noticing are obvious differences in treatment and you're hurt by them. The important part is whether or not you're getting what you need from the relationship. You need to feel secure in the relationship and like he places equal value on both of his partners, and you see marriage and children as very valuable and relationship-securing things (as they should be). So ... what you need from him is not a reassurance about hierarchies. It needs to be reassurance based on commitment to you and your relationship, security, willingness to build your lives together, and it sounds like he's not giving you that. Instead he's saying "this can never happen with you" and of course you're feeling less secure as a result.

I guess you'll have to talk it over with him, discuss how he's treating you and see if he can give you the security you need, and then if he can't give you that security, you'll have to decide if the relationship is worth enough to continue without it. Hopefully you can compromise to find other ways to give you the long-term security you need. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Invest in your SO, but don't do it in a way that destroys your future. For example, when you're choosing where to live as an adult, choose somewhere that you're both happy to live. If you hate living in cold places, don't move to somewhere it snows 8 months of the year. If he hates hot places, don't live somewhere tropical. Find somewhere you both can enjoy. 

I think as long as you make joint decisions while taking both of your preferences into consideration, it's fine. It's ok to delay your plans, or adjust them to make things work better with your partner, but don't IGNORE what you want in your life. It's ok to think "I'll delay my studies for two years so we can achieve this goal" but it's NOT ok to think "I don't really need to finish my studies because I can be a housewife for him" unless that sort of relationship structure is something you both really want and you wanted it before you even met him.

<TEXT> I think you should just write them in regular English, because the people who speak in Geordie don't write their words like that. They use regular spellings because it's more of an accent/dialect, not another language. 

If you want to, for flavour you could add one or two words that are less widely known and more specifically Geordie (e.g. wikipedia lists words like 'bairn' and 'canny' and 'howay' that don't have widespread usage). 

Personally I really hate it when people try to write in weird spelling to match the accent or "how people speak" because when I speak, I don't think I sound weird, and I don't think words require weird spellings to sound the same way I speak. However, I'm Australian, and I've seen people try to write out Australian accents. When I read their attempts, it doesn't sound Australian, it sounds ... bad. It only sounds "Australian" to people who speak in the same way the author does and who read and pronounce what the author has written in the same way the author would (and even then, it's usually wrong). 

In short, I think writing in "translations" of someone's accent narrows your audience AND makes your work harder to read, so just stick in some words to give a general impression and it will be fine. 

I read this post on tumblr a while ago that sums it up pretty well: [https://referenceforwriters.tumblr.com/post/97244716085/your-characters-speech-and-their-accents](https://referenceforwriters.tumblr.com/post/97244716085/your-characters-speech-and-their-accents) 

I also really liked Naomi Novik's books, Uprooted and Spinning Silver (I haven't read her other ones). Both of the books have a strong sense of culture and heritage which is conveyed through word choices and the way the characters interact, and I think she does it very well. </TEXT>

If you can finger yourself without pain, it might be a good idea to try that more often just to get yourself used to it. Then later you could try using a small dildo to practice with. If it causes pain though, it might be better to speak to a gynecologist. Don't try to force yourself if you're in pain because that will probably make it worse. </TEXT>

None of those things are your fault. 

You didn't ask for all this health stuff to happen, but it has, and you know what? You're doing your best to manage it. You're getting treatment, you're talking to your workplace, you're dealing with all the crap that comes with severe health problems and you're still going! You deserve a trophy! 

You didn't ask to work a job you hate, but you are, and you're doing it well. You're doing it despite health problems that might knock down a lesser woman. You're doing it despite having to negotiate with your boss about accommodations. You're doing it even though it's wearing you down. You deserve a trophy for this too! 

And you know what, you deserve a fucking trophy for living in a rural area that you and your husband both don't like, too. It's not easy. You switched up your lives for a chance at something better, and yeah it's not working out but you still did it! That's an achievement! Own it. Be proud of yourself. 

Your husband is miserable because you're both miserable. Issues with seizures and stress and anxiety and fertility and being far from your support systems and a job that drains your soul ... no wonder you're feeling like crap. 

But you, OP, are not a burden. You are a person, a woman, a wife, a hard worker, and you are doing your best and you should give yourself the credit that you deserve. You're not a waste. Is your husband a waste because of his chronic health issues (anxiety)? Of course not. And neither are you.

<TEXT> I don't think it's exactly "normal" but I think a lot of people feel that at some point. 

For me, home is a place I can sit and relax and feel safe and regroup to be ready to go out and face whatever's coming next ... there were several years I lost that feeling of "home" and now I have a slightly different feeling of "home" but it is there. 

If you think about specific memories you have of being somewhere you felt at home, you can try to recreate that in your current living environment to make it feel more like home for you. One thing that I did as soon as I moved in here was that I hung pictures on the walls. Over time I've changed them to be photos of my family, and cross stitch pieces that I've made, but when I first moved in I just got my siblings to draw me a quick picture on some scrap paper and I stuck them around on my walls to remind me of my family (for me home is very much about family). I also cooked some chocolate pudding, because I couldn't imagine my home being a place I had never eaten chocolate pudding in. 

Turns out for me, "home" is mostly about food and family and if I have those (or memories of those) then I feel home. For other people there might be different things though, I don't know. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm lucky in that sex doesn't cause me pain but discomfort is very common and I'm always amazed when men (or even other women, when I've asked for their advice) seem to think I should just ignore that and continue. 

I'm also lucky that my mother is a very strong and individualistic woman, and taught me that my feelings on anything *matter* and I shouldn't let other people's opinions bother me. As I've gotten older I've realised she did an excellent job in that regard, and it's helped when I've dealt with sexism or encounters with judgemental people. So, for the most part I don't really struggle to speak up during sex if I dislike something, but I have encountered a lot of people who think I shouldn't or who are shocked when I do, and I think that's another side of this problem. If you're uncomfortable speaking up about something, and then when you finally do you're met with surprise and people seeking to silence you, that makes things worse. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think you need to understand what their real concern is. Are they worried your guests will damage or somehow lower the value of the master bedroom? Are they worried you won't take care of it? Did they really build the master bedroom for YOU and now they're unhappy you don't want it? Are they worried about how it appears to guests/others when you don't sleep in the master bedroom? 

All of those concerns would have different ways of addressing them. 

Is there a reason you won't sleep in the master bedroom? What's wrong with moving bedrooms? That would probably be the easiest way to resolve things. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you go to see a therapist, you can talk about what you're worried about and why that scares you. The therapist doesn't want to get rid of that protective repressing/suppressing thing all at once either, because that can damage you, so explaining why you're scared of it should help them to help you. 

A good therapist will help you to slowly dismantle it, in a way where you still feel safe. 

If they try to force you to do anything, find a new therapist. They should encourage you to push your own boundaries, but not force you. It should always be your choice. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm sorry :( Sending you some hugs, because I don't really know what else to say. 

Here are some ideas. I don't know if they will help or not. Feel free to ignore them if they seem dumb: 

* Are there any grief support groups you can join? At the very least they should get you some people you can talk to who might share your grief. 
* Maybe you could try volunteering? It's a good low-stress way to meet people, and for me it makes me feel a lot less worthless. 
* Forget about breaking through the scar tissue. You can't get rid of it. Think instead about how you can live inside it. What needs to change so that life is still worth living? Then improve those things. 
* Why are you bereft of human interaction? Join some groups. If real life interaction is too much, join a discord server. Bereft of human interaction will make things worse. Find some interaction, even if it's not much. 
* Look into programs that help people with financial difficulties in your area. For example, where I live there is a government subsidy that helps poor people pay their bills and I have applied for that. Look for things like that. 
* Find tiny things that bring you peace, or that make life slightly less crap. For example, maybe you enjoy looking at the stars at night. Or maybe you enjoy going for a walk in the park. Or you like the taste of your breakfast bagel. Or your curtains remind you of a happy moment in your past. Every day, try to do at least one of those things. Even if it just makes you cry, do it because it lightens the load for a few seconds. 
* If you can afford it, get a pet. Otherwise, see if you can volunteer at an animal shelter or visit someone you know who has a pet you can spend some time with. 
* Exercise. If running is too much, set smaller goals. Go for a ten minute walk each day. Or visit the gym once a week. 
* Build a routine filled with everyday activities that you want in your life. It's YOUR life. Pick what you want, and do it. Start small, but don't give up. 
* Set aside some wallowing time. I don't know if this works for everyone but it really works for me. It has three parts: 1) pick a day, or a few hours, and sink down into your sadness. Wallow in it. Cry. Write it all down. Punch pillows. Scream about how everything is awful. Let yourself feel all of that. (Only rule is that you can't do anything that will damage yourself.) When you have done that enough, move to part 2) Be kind and gentle to yourself for a day or two. Eat your favourite foods, wrap yourself in fuzzy blankets, do whatever you do for fun to relax. This second part has a time limit. One day is the usual, and no more than two days as a maximum. After that, part 3) You go back to trying to live. You do all the life-improving stuff that's "supposed" to help. Trying to make friends, trying to exercise, working, enjoying the little things... 

And, I know you probably know this, but ... your parents would still be proud of you, even now, when everything is falling apart. You're still the same guy and you still have the same inner strength that has carried you so far and you can still keep going. It will get better with time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think you should sit down and speak calmly and rationally to your parents. First of all, tell them that you thought about it, and you're willing to do a trial of one month not playing video games and see if your studies improve. 

Also explain that your laptop is essential to your studies - breaking it will cause you to fail college completely, because you do work on it. 

Apologise for shouting at them. Tell them you were upset at the idea of losing something you need for college, and surprised and hurt that they thought you were addicted. 

After the one month trial is over, think seriously about restricting your time playing games. Maybe you only play on weekends, for example, and you focus on studying during the week. That way there is no chance they will think you're addicted, because most of your time is spent studying. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They sound VERY abusive. You are not overreacting. 

If you speak to your teachers at school they will likely report your parents to child services, and that should allow them to learn more about being better parents (and if they continue to harm you, you may be put into foster care). 

You should tell your teachers and social workers about the threats your parents make, including the threats about not feeding you, the fact that they hit you, your fears of being harmed if you come out, and your troubled childhood. Tell any adult who can help you. Someone will help. You might have to live with strangers for a while (in foster care) but you won't be hurt. If your foster family DOES turn out to be equally crazy and abusive, you can report them too and get moved to a new one. If you're worried about foster care, you can speak to the social worker about your fears and they will work to make sure you're safe. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think there is anything inherently wrong in your preferences, but you're right that in your specific circumstances they may be damaging you. 

I think the biggest concern I have is that you said you tell your partner to keep going even when you know that he's hurting you and he doesn't want to be. That, to me, is a problem because he hasn't agreed to that. You're using him to hurt yourself in a way that he didn't consent to and that is definitely a worrying behaviour. I think you do need to be more strictly honest with your partner, and with getting him to stop when he's causing pain. 

In future if he's causing you pain, it should be deliberate, discussed beforehand, and you both need to be consenting to it (like in the porn you enjoy). It should never be accidental pain. You also need to pay attention to how it makes you feel - for me, if I feel scared at any point, it's not beneficial to me and causes problems. Otherwise, it can be very beneficial for me. You need to watch your emotions and find out how different things make you feel so you can enjoy the things that promote good feelings and health, and avoid the ones that are unhealthy for you. (Note that the example here is just for me, for others those emotions might mean different things. For ME, if I get scared it's damaging, but for others getting through that fear might be very beneficial to them.) 

Enjoying consensual kinky porn is ... *probably* not harming you, but its still a very individual thing. If you find that the porn provokes you into other damaging behaviours, you may need to stop watching it. (For now though, I'd say the porn is ok, but keep an eye on what happens after you watch it.) 

If you're still struggling with it, it might be worth finding a kink-friendly therapist to help you unpack your feelings around this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think a good way to start is to be less detailed at first. So when you're still getting to know each other, you can start by talking about "health problems" or "very difficult teenage years". Then, if your partner asks for more information you can tell them more (if you're comfortable doing so). 

Later when you're closer, if you haven't already then you can go into more detail about what actually happened and how you feel about it. There's not really a good way to do it, just pick a time and then say it. 

For me I try to tell people as soon as possible, but my mental health conditions still severely impact my everyday life and so it's really hard to connect with someone while trying to hide that. For you since they're not so immediate anymore, I think it makes sense to wait until you're comfortable with someone before you say anything. 

Honestly, those sorts of mental health problems ARE a pretty big deal, so it probably won't be as light-hearted as you'd want. I think that is something you'll have to accept when you tell someone - you can't really control their reaction, even if you can warn them beforehand. People who care about you will do their best to treat you exactly the same way, but be prepared that it might take a few days or even weeks to get back to "normal" in your relationship once you open up about everything. There are some people who can get past it immediately, but that's not everyone. There are also some people who will NEVER be able to look at you the same way, and ... that sucks, but if your partner turns out to be one of those people it's better to move on. 

I hope everything works well for you :) Good luck with your new person. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think you should look into therapists that specialise in treating people who have been sexually abused as well as people in abusive relationships. (There will likely be a lot of overlap, most therapists who help adults that were abused as children will be familiar with treating people who are in currently-abusive relationships.) Find one that she can afford or that her insurance will cover (or if you want to pay for it, find one you can afford instead). 

Then, you should ask her if she'd like to see this therapist you found. Make it casual and non-confrontational (the same way she told you about being molested). Just like "Hey, so I found this therapist who helps people who have been molested in the past, you want me to come with you to your first appointment? Looks like it will cost $X per session" 

If she says no, ask if she'd like you to make her an appointment. If she says no to that too, just pass on the contact details of the therapist and let her make the decision (hand her the contact details on a physical piece of paper, or send them in an email or text, don't just tell her and expect her to write it down). If she says yes, go ahead and book the appointment. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, just start with the very basic information like you did here - "I think I have PTSD and ADHD and perhaps BPD". Let them ask followup questions if they need to, that's their job to know what to ask. If they skip something that you think is important it's ok to mention it, but don't worry if you don't get all of the information into one visit. 

After that, you can ask them to take an action that you think will help (e.g. "Can you please refer me to a specialist who can give me a formal diagnosis?" or "Can you recommend a treatment plan?"). Most doctors will do that without you asking, but if they miss that step it's important to ask. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm honestly not sure what is causing the problems you have, but since you say getting formal treatment is unlikely, you should see if you can find some DBT workbooks online to buy and then work through them. DBT is supposed to be really good for people who self-harm or have suicidal behaviour. 

I think if you can, it's good to find a doctor who can help you. Even in countries where mental health is taboo, there will be experts who are up to date on mental health diagnosis and treatment (though they may be hard to find or expensive). If possible you should seek out one of those experts, or even someone in another country who is willing to treat you long-distance over the internet. It may be easier to find those experts if you get hospitalised in a major city, rather than in a more local hospital, so do some research about which places have the best treatment in your country and how to get into them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You can't save your brother if he doesn't want help. You need to move yourself out of there ASAP because it sounds like it's getting dangerous. Look for women's shelters, domestic violence shelters, and homeless shelters, and see if there are any of those that you could go to. Continue looking for work - also ask all of those places if they know of any free resources for finding work you can access. 

Once YOU are safe, you can start to think about how to help your brother. It sounds like he needs serious mental health treatment, and involuntary hospitalisation may be the way to go if he won't get any other help (that means you call an ambulance or police and tell them he is a risk to himself and others - it might be best if you have proof because if he can pretend to be normal they might just assess him and then leave). Again, don't do this until AFTER you are somewhere safe. Your safety comes first. 

If you think he is likely to shoot you immediately (like, if he's going for the gun) then call the police straight away and get as far away from him as possible.

<TEXT> I think some people can recover from mental illnesses like anxiety/depression, but for most people they just adjust to living with them and then try to continue with their lives anyway. (Mental health people often call this "recovery" but it's not the same as being cured like when you have a physical illness you recover from.) 

I think the mental injuries thing sounds like a good idea when you're just thinking about PTSD - because it's caused by *something*. But PTSD often goes along with anxiety or depression, and sometimes you get anxiety or depression partially due to your environment and partially due to other factors, and what if you experience a non-traumatic life event (like a breakup), but it triggers you to spiral into depression or anxiety? Does that mean your depression was inflicted by your boyfriend leaving you? Or were you already predisposed to depression and him leaving was just the final straw, so it wasn't inflicted at all? Even my own anxiety has so many possible sources (including genetics and predisposition) that trying to categorise where it actually came from would be impossible. 

I think categorizing some disorders into separate groups is just going to cause more problems in being diagnosed and finding a label that fits. The way mental health conditions present are so varied that the labels are already sometimes too restrictive, and making labels MORE restrictive is just going to leave more people feeling like they don't fit anywhere. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have such severe anxiety that I can't always initiate conversations, let alone sex. It took my boyfriend and I three months to work up to me being able to give him a blowjob without panicking and needing to stop. 

My boyfriend treats me with nothing but love and respect. He is never angry at me for being awkward. He always talks to me about any problems he has with things. 

My point in saying these things is to explain that you don't need to live this way no matter how awkward or bad at initiating you are. The problem here is him and how he's handling these things. Getting angry at you for not magically doing what he wants with no communication whatsoever is HIS fault. Also, "spicing things up" isn't going to work, because I bet he either has some specific idea in mind that you'll never guess without him telling you, OR he's enjoying sex less than he used to and doesn't know why, so he's blaming you (even though the problem is internal to him). 

If he's willing to improve his communication skills then maybe things can improve, but if he's only interested in blaming you then it might be time to move on. You are not selfish or naive to expect him to communicate. That is a basic requirement of healthy relationships. </TEXT>

Definitely tell her. If she can't handle the idea that someone else has problems too, she's not that great a friend. Since you say she's amazing, I'm sure it'll be fine and she'll be happy to support you in finding help. 

I will address what some other people are saying - make sure she's not your only outlet for help. If you both lean on each other, but you're both falling down, you might end up bringing each other down instead. It's important to have other supports around you to help too (since your plan is to find a counsellor though, I don't think this will be much of a problem for you). </TEXT>

It prevents/reduces std transfer because you only exchange bodily fluids with a select group of people that you are certain do not have stds. When you fluid bond with a new person, it is only done after they've undergone std tests and they also agree to not exchange bodily fluids with anyone else (or only within the group). </TEXT>

I think the majority of the left/feminism/menslib movements don't blame men or white people. I am a feminist for example, but I don't think it's a man's fault that women are under-represented in positions of power. It's a severe issue, and it needs to be resolved, but I wouldn't *blame* men because it's not like men are conspiring against me to oppress me (or at least most of them aren't). And I'm white, I'm certainly not blaming myself for any problems in society related to race issues either, even though I still believe the problems exist. 

I think we need to resolve things through compromise and understanding on both sides. No one individually is to blame for problems in society, but the problems still exist and need to be improved. I completely agree with you that either side using bigotry is a terrible idea and won't help anything. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think that the "good" in TRP is basic common sense, and doesn't need to be taken from TRP because it can be taken from literally anywhere else as well. 

e.g. "If you take care of yourself, more women will like you." - no fucking kidding. Yes that is an element of TRP and it is useful knowledge, but it's not something that you need to take from TRP because there are other less toxic places you can learn that. 

I think people who follow TRP are usually misguided and looking for answers, and they end up in TRP because it's the first place they find them, but I don't think that means that they need TRP. It means it's a pity they didn't find a less toxic place to find those answers first. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I opened up my relationship for similar reasons and it has never been stronger. Now that I'm getting my sexual needs met I have no resentment at all and it's very very easy to love my husband as much as he deserves, because he is amazing. If anything, I love him even more now. 

I agree with everyone saying that you need to be careful about *how* you open up, because it did almost destroy my relationship with my husband (I was not nearly as careful as I should have been and we are only still together because he is so forgiving and not a jealous person at all. I didn't cheat, but the way I brought up what I wanted was terrible.) 

However, I disagree with the people saying that opening your marriage when you have problems with sex will destroy your marriage. If the problem is *only* that one of you needs more sex, and then that person gets more sex ... that's a solution, not a problem. Any solution will come with potential extra problems, and you need to work through those no matter what. 

Also ... I would like to note that we started with opening our marriage just for sex, but through that I've discovered that I'm poly. So. That is something that may happen, and I think if you or your wife is uncomfortable with that idea you definitely should get some relationship counselling (with a counsellor who understands open relationships). 

You could also cross post to /r/nonmonogamy or /r/polyamory if you want advice specifically about how to make a non-monogamous relationship work (e.g. with regard to boundaries, jealousy, how to find/approach new partners..) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maybe she's just asexual or has a low sex drive. It might be a good idea to think about having less sex, but making it good sex each time (e.g. include lots of the things she likes, like bondage and foreplay). Since it takes a long time, you could schedule it. Once per week (or per month) you set aside an hour or two and explore something she really likes, instead of having "duty sex" that neither of you really enjoy. Good occasional sex is better than regular bad sex. 

Another thing you could try is that if she's very submissive, maybe you can explore that more. For example, you could discuss a situation where you order her to tease/edge herself before sex starts sometimes, or where she's covertly submissive during the day (e.g. bondage harness under her clothes, ducking into a bathroom to send you a pussy photo, wearing a butt plug, things like that). If you can incorporate more of the things that turn her on during the day she will be more ready for sex at the end of it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, I felt terrible about myself after ONS sex too. It's definitely not religious guilt (I was raised atheist), it's just that I feel bad after letting someone use me for sex. I know that sex is ok outside of a committed relationship, and I even know I can enjoy sex outside of a committed relationship, and I have done so, but I also know that it's not for me. It makes me unhappy long-term. 

I need to feel a connection with a person before I have sex with them, and I need to maintain that connection afterwards. It doesn't have to be deep and intimate, it just has to be like we enjoy each other's company and he wants to spend time with me for more than sex. 

I've had bad experiences too ... they made me feel worthless as well. You're not alone, and you're not worthless. Give yourself time to heal, do something that makes you feel nice (pamper yourself, or do something fun), and then continue doing what makes you happy (whether that's ONS or FWB or only having sex in a committed relationship). </TEXT>

<TEXT> It sounds like you could have some problem with sleep, perhaps? It also sounds like you might have some problems with anxiety or depression of some sort. 

Problems with sleep and anxiety/depression usually feed off each other so it is hard to know what causes the other. It could also be a physical health issue causing you to be more tired and have trouble thinking clearly, which would affect both sleep and anxiety/depression levels. 

I think you do need to see a doctor, because it is impossible to know what the underlying cause is without medical help. They can help to diagnose you and hopefully then you can make progress towards recovery. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The [first result](https://www.psychologytoday.com/au/blog/the-science-behind-behavior/201609/how-should-market-researchers-ask-about-gender-in-surveys) on google supports your survey format (i.e. having male, female, and transgender as options) but if you read the comments there is a robust discussion going that includes a transwoman explaining that having "transgender" as a separate radio button is off-putting to transgender people and also doesn't make sense. 

Every other source I can find suggests that its better to ask something along the lines of "Male, Female, Other". (For example, many sites dedicated to research/surveys have guides to asking about gender - [SurveyGizmo](https://www.surveygizmo.com/resources/blog/how-to-write-survey-gender-questions/), [SurveyMonkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/ask-survey-questions-sexual-orientation-gender-identity/), and [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/post/Best_practices_for_survey_question_about_gender).) 

For surveys where trans status might affect the data (i.e. where biological sex is important), most places recommend you ask about biological sex and current gender status separately (this [Williams Institute PDF](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/geniuss-report-sep-2014.pdf), this [inclusive language guide](https://www.vic.gov.au/inclusive-language-guide)). 

Out of all of these though, I think [this write-up](https://medium.com/@devonprice/bad-gender-measures-how-to-avoid-them-23b8f3a503a6) is the most useful. It talks about how to create surveys that capture gender demographics without alienating transgender or nonbinary people, and explains why including "transgender" as an option is problematic. </TEXT>

<TEXT> An HOUR??? My partner is happy when I go for 10 minutes. 

What the fuck is wrong with your boyfriend?? If it takes so long and you're *in pain*, how can he want to continue? 

Next time you're in pain, stop. Don't continue. Definitely don't continue to the point of breaking down in tears. Sex is only fun when it's fun for BOTH of you. I love giving blowjobs but if my jaw starts hurting, it's time to switch to my hands, or to stop completely. 

It's not your fault if he doesn't cum (it's not his either). If he's blaming you, he's an asshole, and it's unfair, and you need to have a serious discussion with him about how what you've been doing is hurting you (physically, with jaw pain, and emotionally, because it's making you feel bad about yourself). Then you need to make plans together to not do it anymore. If he doesn't care that it's hurting you, you need a new boyfriend. 

I just can't get past ... How can he possibly be angry and upset because you've given him a blowjob? You need to slap him (figuratively, not literally). 

Honestly, at this point I would just take blowjobs off the table altogether. Clearly he's not that into them anyway if it takes him over an hour to cum. Do something else that you both enjoy instead. 

Also, I want to address this: 

 I love him to death and I just want to please him.    I've tried talking  to him and explaining why I'm feeling the way I am, but he just won't  hear it. He's just angry and upset and thinks I don't love him anymore. 

Do you think he's acting like someone who loves you? He's not trying to please you, he's not listening to how you feel, and when you cry he gets angry at you. Is that how you would treat someone you love? Do you think he's behaving fairly here? 

I don't think you're the one who's in the wrong here. How he's behaving is NOT normal. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sometimes that feeling of holding back comes because you're moving too fast - you WANT to trust someone, so you go ahead, but part of you isn't ready to trust him and so that part of you holds back no matter what you want. You need to prove to that part of you that he is trustworthy, and that's going to be hard if you keep getting flashbacks to times he's scared you. 

The best way to rebuild trust is by letting him show you he's trustworthy. If he can't do that, it won't work. If you're entirely sure he's ready to be the person you trust, you can start small. Once he's proven (probably several times) that you can *fully* trust him with that small thing, then you can go a step further with the first thing, or you can add another small thing. 

For example what works for me is starting veeeery small, with me controlling the situation (e.g. he says "Can you touch this today? You don't have to, and you can stop touching it whenever you want"). Then gradually doing more, with me still in full control (the same situation, but I decide that I can continue for slightly longer). Then we add more elements (he says "Can I touch it with you today?"). etc. It only works if the person will let me do what I want to without pressuring me, and will let me stop whenever I need or want to, even if he doesn't understand why and even if he disagrees with me. You can try a similar thing with your Dom. You have to be allowed to stop for **any** reason, including as a test to check if he allows it. This might sound like it's not a strong D/s dynamic, but it's not really meant to be. It's a trust exercise. And it probably has to be done many many times, over every aspect of your relationship. 

As long as he is truly accepting of what you need and want, it's a good way of building trust. (Of course, if he DOESN'T respect you stopping something, it will be a sign he's not worthy of your trust yet.) 

If you've already been slowly building up trust like I describe, then there are two options: a) The trust is still being rebuilt, and all you can do is continue rebuilding it; or b) The trust isn't coming back, either because it was destroyed so completely in the past or because he isn't behaving in a way that proves he is trustworthy. 

I hope your relationship is healthy now and that you are happy and safe. If you're not feeling that way, think about why, and what needs to happen for it to change. And if it's *likely* to change. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Has she ever been the type to be "sexy" how you describe it? If she hasn't, that might just be how she is. The rest of my advice assumes that she used to be more sexy in a way that you like, but things are different now: 

From your other comments it doesn't sound like you're doing much to make her feel sexy either. You're touching her body, because that's what works for you, but that's not what works for her. You need to find out more about what works for her. 

Maybe instead of asking her to be better, you should ask what she would need to feel better. Reframe the conversation from "I want you to act more sexy" and make it "You don't seem so confident with your looks anymore, what would help with that?" 

You could also try making specific suggestions rather than asking for "sexy" or "effort". For example, "Could you wear that red dress I love when we go out tonight? You look amazing in it", or "This weekend, lets get a babysitter and hang out in a hotel room and go on a dinner date and try to respark some romance." 

If she's really incapable of talking about this with you at all and doesn't care how she looks and doesn't want to try anything you suggest, I think you should start asking about her well-being. Is she happy? Is she depressed? Tired? What does she need in order to feel more like herself? What turns her on and makes her sexuality spark? All of those are things to discuss with her. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have issues with self-harm and have for most of my life (I'm 29 now). I always tell my partners. Hiding it from them destroys my relationships, because I feel like then I can't trust them and I'm hiding from them, and I spend enough time hiding from people ... I don't want to hide from people I love. 

I think even if you don't tell him every time it happens, you should still tell him that it's still something that happens sometimes. You don't have to tell him the exact times. Most people I've been with haven't minded (though they prefer me to cover up if there are recent injuries). There have been a few guys who have just directly told me I'm crazy ... so be prepared in case he reacts badly. Also, a lot of people don't understand self-harm so they are not sure how to respond, and they are often fairly disturbed by it. If that happens with your boyfriend, you could try giving him links to some general information online (like "how to help someone who self-harms" or "why do people self-harm?"). That might help him to understand. If he doesn't mind or he's generally supportive, then how much you talk about it with him is up to you. 

He's not "entitled" to know anything, but I think it's not good to hide something like that in a long-term relationship. However, every relationship is different, so if you're happier not talking about it then you don't have to. What works for you and your relationship might be different to what works for me. </TEXT>

I am on my second implant now (total of 5 years) and both times after it was put in, I had weird irregular periods for a few months, then a month where I got like three periods in a row so I was bleeding for three weeks (it would start, get heavier, then get lighter ... then start again). After that I get irregular periods but they are much lighter with the implant and sometimes I just get cramps and no blood.

Maybe I'm not literary enough, or maybe I'm a lazy reader, but I just don't enjoy novels where you have to "dig deeper" to understand it, and since I'm reading for fun, I don't read those. 

You could start by going to a bookshop that maintains a bestseller list, then reading the backs of those books and picking whichever sound the most interesting and that you want to know how the story unfolds. Then try them out (from a library if you can't afford to buy them). 

If writing style is a big deal for you (it is for me) then you could add an extra step of reading the first paragraph and seeing if you want to continue or not before you purchase/borrow the book. 

If the problem is just that you have trouble with more complex plots because you haven't read in a while, you could try some books aimed at young adult readers or teenagers. The Hunger Games and Harry Potter have recently been successful and they are both pretty good. </TEXT>

OP was creepily following and filming this girl. OP confirmed it was "a man" based on the person having short hair. OP posted video of the girl breaking down crying on his porch while he laughed at her.

Matt immediately believed OP and shouted at his fiancee instead of asking what was happening. 

Fiancee immediately came to OP's house and screamed at him instead of explaining or telling Matt he was acting like a douche. 

They are all incredibly overly dramatic and that is why I would never have said anything - to avoid people like this.

<TEXT> From what I understand (I'm not into scat at all so maybe I have this wrong), there are a few different reasons. I'm talking mostly about the scat "poop on my chest" side of things, not the diaper "wear this diaper and use it" side of things which I think is often more about ageplay than scat. Though I am sure some people combine them, lol

One of the largest parts of the attraction is that it's taboo, and taboo gives it this strange appeal. Like we have porn of people in authority, or religious people sworn to celibacy, I think scat is often just a more extreme version of that attraction to the "forbidden" stuff. 

Another thing people are into is that it's "dirty". Like some people get off on things like saying "such a dirty girl", others take that more literally and get off on *actual* filth. Mud, trash, piss, and in more extreme cases, poop. 

Another thing I've seen people talk about is how it's extremely private and intimate. Like, most people will only poop in private, with no one watching. It's a thing that's usually embarrassing if you're caught doing it. So some people get off on sharing that private moment with someone, that moment that they don't usually share with anyone else, and from an angle that isn't usually used (e.g. below the person pooping, so you can watch it happen). 

And, finally, there is what someone else said, the power side of things. Like "I can make this person do what I want". Controlling their bathroom usage means controlling them even further. It could also be used to humiliate or embarrass them (in line with the previous point), which some people are into too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It sounds like you're under a lot of stress at the moment so the little things impact you much more. 

What are some things you do when you've had a bad day? I would start by making sure to take care of yourself ... do whatever makes you feel most at peace usually. If there are some things you save for really bad days, do those things too. 

If you're not sure, here are some general categories of things that some people find helps them (you'll notice some of the suggestions fit into more than one category, that just means they help in more than one way). You could come up with some ideas in those categories, or you could try some of the examples and see if they help: 

* Physical comfort - weighted blankets, soft and fluffy blankets, taking a bath, touching textures that you enjoy, hugs and physical affection
* Reducing physical tension - breathing exercises, getting a massage, progressive muscle relaxation, sexual activity 
* Exercise - work out until exhausted, go for a peaceful walk, hit or kick something
* Accomplish something creative - art, writing, make a collage out of some old magazines
* Emotional release - scream, cry, write about how you're feeling, talk to someone, punch something
* Emotional support - talk to friends/family, spend time with a pet, post online for support, speak to a therapist 
* Distract your mind - learn something new, complete a task that requires you to think, read a book, play an immersive video game, movies
* Keep your hands busy - fidget toys, sewing, craft
* Improve your environment - organise something, tidy your room, go out and pick up litter
* Scent - light some incense or a scented candle, cook something you like to eat, go somewhere you like that smells nice
* Food - eat a favourite food, cook
* Examine your thoughts - think about how you'll feel once the situation is resolved, examine why you're feeling the way you do, decide if what you're feeling reflects the reality or if you can remind yourself the reality is different
* Try to focus - write lists, meditate, complete tasks one step at a time 
* Help someone else - give advice online, volunteer, speak to a friend/family member about their life and offer support, help a friend redecorate their house

There are probably a lot of other things too. Just pick one that looks like it might work (or if none will work, pick one at random). If it works, great! If not, at least it will fill in some time until you get your results back, and then you can try something else. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You are making some significant errors in judgement here and I think you need to stop and think carefully about what outcome you want. 

Errors in judgement you have made: 

* Not working on either resolving your relationship with your husband or breaking up with him
* Getting a crush on a guy you don't even know, based on his twitter account
* Contacting a guy to date him while still married to your husband
* Believing that he "accidentally" gave you his last name, even when he tried to use that as leverage to get information about you 
* Hiding your reality from this guy that you "mesh perfectly" with. You don't mesh perfectly if you're still afraid for him to see the real you. 
* Sending a photo of your daughter to this man that you barely know and don't even trust enough to share your name with (Honestly OP, WTF?) 
* Ignoring your gut feelings that he is *stalking* you because you're so happy to finally get some kinky attention. 

Now, it's entirely possible that this man is harmless. If he is, you're very lucky. If he's not ... I guess you'll find out soon enough. You can't change what's already happened. 

Either way, you need to take steps to protect your family. Do NOT give him any more information about you, including photos. Contact your daughter's school, make sure he can't pick her up from school. Make sure your house is secure, because he knows your address. Change your Facebook and other social media settings so that random strangers who google your name can't find out your personal information and see pictures of you. 

Talk to him about how what he's done is a serious breach of trust. Talk to him about slowing down the relationship for a while to help you process everything that's happened. Don't let him hand-wave this away, or guilt you into forgiving him, because he sounds predatory and dangerous and you need to draw some boundaries to keep yourself safe. (If he's genuinely a nice person who means no harm, then he should understand you need some space to process this massive invasion of your privacy.) 

If he is dangerous, his next move is likely to threaten you in some way. Think about what you'll do if he introduces himself to your daughter while she's at school, for example. Or if he tries to blackmail you with threats of contacting your husband. What if he shows up at your house? Think about what plans you can have in place to keep your family safe. 

After that, think about what you want for yourself in the future. Do you want to be a person who cheats on her husband with dubious internet men? (I'm guessing probably not.) Do you want a kink relationship of some sort? Do you want to resolve things with your husband? What sort of household or relationship do you want to live in? What do you want for your daughter? Once you know what you want, take the steps necessary to achieve it (though remember it doesn't have to be with your current partner if you don't want). </TEXT>

<TEXT> what if I do disgust him somehow but that's an excuse as to why?

Even if you did disgust him (which I doubt), the right way to deal with it is to break up. Cheating on you is not acceptable.

There's no hope of restoring this. You'll never trust him again (and that's his fault). It doesn't make sense because he should never have behaved like this. It's not your fault. You didn't do anything wrong.

Call someone who loves you and can support you (family, best friend, someone like that). Let them help you. Also, seek legal advice. You don't have to say anything to your husband yet until you decide what the best approach is, but you deserve support while you're making that decision. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When you agreed to an open relationship, it seems like her first thought was the one person you said she couldn't have, and she's falling apart because she doesn't really want an open relationship with anyone else. This doesn't mean it's a disaster, but it does mean you two need to slow down and renegotiate your rules. If the only person she wants to be "open" with is your best friend, does she really want to be in an open relationship? Maybe she wants a closed triad instead but she's offering to be in an open relationship because she doesn't know how else to get what she wants. If all she really wants is permission to have sex with your friend, that's a completely different conversation to the open relationship conversation and you've both been talking about different things while you were negotiating. 

I don't think she's behaving reasonably. She's not treating you right, at all. But, I can also see how she might be so excited to start on this new chapter of your lives that she's jumping in too fast and destroying things. Maybe you two could try reading more about how open relationships work and common mistakes people make as they open up their relationships (make sure you're BOTH reading those things even if your motive is to make her understand that she's making a mistake - maybe there's one you've made too and haven't realised, and even if there's not, being open to that idea might encourage her to be open to the idea of making mistakes too). 

If she starts fighting with you every time you try to talk about it, maybe you could try writing each other letters or emails? That should give you time to clear your mind before replying to each other and hopefully keep things slightly less intense. If writing isn't your thing, you could also try relationship counselling (with a counsellor who is familiar with open relationships and how they work). 

Ultimately, if she's not willing to talk to you about this and the only thing she wants is to sleep with your friend and nothing else matters ... I guess you need to decide if that relationship is what you want. However, before that point, I suggest talking more (through emails, or with a counsellor) and finding out what she really wants and if it's possible for you both to be happy with that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It depends on how much she needs or expects sexual activity from him, and I think initially she'd think she's more okay with it than she might actually be (because long-term that sort of thing can be more of a problem than it seems when you first encounter it). Is it a new revelation to her that he's asexual? 

I'm also questioning why him being asexual means he sleeps in another room. My situation is largely similar to this (I'm a woman married to a mostly-asexual man) but we still sleep in the same bed and enjoy cuddling. Is he worried she'll try something sexual? Is there some other factor contributing to this? </TEXT>

<TEXT> My bf assigns me topics to write about (e.g. "Explain to me how you progressed from being so scared of this to enjoying it and how you felt at each stage"). Maybe you could ask him to do something like that? That way when you hand it over it won't be awkward, plus he can better understand things you like. 

You could also try to talk more generally about how when you engage in BDSM you need to review afterwards (e.g. what went well, what didn't, what you want to try next time) and ask him to help you talk about all those things. 

I would also suggest that if you'd feel bad handing him a note, you could try emailing him. It's less confronting because you're not face to face when you send it, but it still lets you communicate with him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> haha I do this to myself too, like "I don't *really* have anxiety, I'm just weak and lazy. I could totally go out and do things and not be scared and I'm just hiding behind a diagnosis!" 

It's ridiculously not true. I've tried going out and doing things. Doesn't work, I get scared no matter what I want. The diagnosis just *describes* me, it doesn't change who I am. 

I've spoken to people like the people you describe too, the ones you are like "just do x and you'll be fine!". They just don't understand mental health. You're not a failure. You have a legitimate medical condition that causes suffering in your life. You are valid. You are trying. You know you're trying. Don't let that doubt eat you, you're doing the best you can with what you have. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you feel like this all the time, that's a problem. You should see your GP and ask for a referral to therapist. They can help you work out why you feel so bad and why you can't feel happy.. it could be depression or maybe something else, and a therapist will help you work that out. 

If you only feel this way while drunk ... its probably better to avoid getting drunk in future. 

Either way, getting drunk can make you feel more depressed. I hope you feel better soon. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have trouble with people touching me too. If we meet online, I tell them before we meet up and make sure they understand it's a serious issue (I talk about how it triggers my anxiety and physically scares me), and then if they have trouble with that or they make "jokes" about ignoring that boundary, I don't bother meeting them.

If I'm meeting someone who can't respect that boundary in person, I will step back from them and if necessary, physically remove their hands from me and be like "Please don't touch me, it makes me anxious." Anyone who can't respect that, I don't bother spending time with. A more gentle version of this (like if they've been really nice so far) is to *gently* step away and say something like "I'm not very good with casual touching, sorry."

It's not extreme to keep people out of your personal space. Having personal space that is different to someone else's personal space is not an insult to anyone, and if they take it that way, THEY are the problem. The best sexual partner I've ever had is the guy who immediately stepped even further away from me, and apologised (he'd touched my shoulder, I think?), and then going forwards he made sure to ask before he did anything that might bother me (and respect me when I said no, or even if I wasn't sure). There were still a few times he scared me because I *am* very easily scared, but none of them were his fault and he immediately backed away once he realised what was happening.

I say all of this to let you know you're not alone in disliking being touched.

In response to your questions:

1. Basically, it's not excessive to enforce boundaries that you need to feel safe. If they view it as excessive, they are the problem. The only real way to get more comfortable with enforcing boundaries is just to do it lots of times and find a way to think about it that works for you. For me, I try to look at it as benefitting the both of us when I set the boundaries I need. If they're a good person, they'll either realise we're incompatible and leave me alone (great! Time saved!) or they'll appreciate the warning so they can adjust their behaviour to make me more comfortable. If they're NOT the sort of person I want to date, they might try to push boundaries, and a good solution to that is just to get away from them as soon as possible.
2. Being compassionate to yourself means enforcing that boundary even when other people try to minimise it, or they pressure you to change, or they make "jokes" about it. Your boundaries reflect who you are and what you need. They are nothing to be ashamed of. When you maintain that boundary and people around you respect it, you make your own life better and you empower yourself to pursue a relationship you actually enjoy. Being compassionate to others means that you understand that they might need you to explain your boundaries in more detail (because they are unusual), and that you can forgive them for genuine misunderstandings. It also means you might forgive occasional slip-ups if the person genuinely forgot, as long as they apologise once you remind them (I think this is where your example of chilling and someone touches your shoulder comes in). It's important to remember though, that compassion for yourself comes before compassion for others - if someone consistently forgets your boundaries or misunderstands what you need, you don't have to forgive them. You *shouldn't* forgive them. A one-off might be ok (or it might not), but a string of "accidents" is never ok. Where you draw the line is up to you but be careful not to focus too much on being compassionate to others instead of yourself (I made that mistake a lot so I just wanted to make it really clear ... you don't OWE people anything, they don't have a right to touch you. You choose whether they are allowed to or not.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I set rules for myself - if I've already asked him if he cares about me, and he's said yes, then I will BELIEVE HIM and not ask again in this conversation. On bad days, I might say "Are you sure? Because what about x, y, z" and then once he's addressed those things I relax. Sometimes they're really minor things that my mind is blowing out of proportion - for example (a bit of an exaggeration but not much), "Last week you said you were tired and now I'm worried that our entire relationship is falling apart" and then he clarifies "No, I just meant I hadn't slept enough" and then it's fine. Sometimes they are more major things, but either way, once it's been addressed I calm down. 

On really bad days ... sometimes I do overdo it. My partners know they should just say something, like "I think this is just because you're having a bad day" and that usually fixes it because I realise he's right and so I deliberately change the subject and distract myself. 

I think most importantly, I need to keep in mind that it's not *his* job to fix my insecurity. He can answer questions or reassure me, but it's *my* job to manage my anxiety. That is usually enough to keep everything under control, but my partners are still very patient and supportive (and they have to be). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Her problems are legitimate but the way he's responding to them is unnecessary. Let's use the examples you gave in your post: 

* He canceled attending a wedding with you in order to fix this woman's car. Her car being broken is a legitimate problem, but other solutions include: 
   * He fixes it the day after the wedding
   * He fixes it once he's back from the wedding
   * He recommends a mechanic he trusts who does low-cost repairs
   * He helps her search for mechanics in the area,
   * She handles this problem herself and gets it fixed without him because he's busy today. 
* He cuts short attending your friend's wedding to celebrate this woman's birthday. Celebrating her birthday is a legitimate desire for someone he cares about, but other options: 
   * Celebrating another day because he has plans already. 
   * Dropping off a quick gift and card before attending the wedding. 
   * Making a quick visit after the wedding (without cutting it short). 
   * A phone call 
   * A combination of some of the above (e.g. a phone call on her birthday with a plan for drinks another day). 
* Different standards around money sound like he knows you can be trusted to pay things back, and she can't. His solution to this is to require you to repay loans, but not her. It also sounds like he knows he can tell you he can't afford something, but not her, so he just spends on her when he can't afford it because he thinks he "owes" her. Other, more reasonable, options: 
   * Not loaning her money or buying her gifts, because her gift to him should not oblige him to do anything. 
   * Gifting money instead of loaning it (to both you AND her). 
   * Only loaning her enough money until it's covered the cost of rent for those six months he lived with her, and then not loaning her more. 
   * Gradually paying off his debt to her (i.e. the six months rent) over time without giving her any extra money or gifts. 
   * Giving her one large gift to demonstrate his gratitude, then cutting her off because she's taking advantage of him.  
* She is moving in with him. 
   * He could say NO to this woman who is taking advantage of him and moving into his house 
   * He could contact her ACTUAL children, if she has any 
   * He could consider WHY she has no one else - For example, does she run them all dry like this? 
   * He could refer her to homeless shelters or adult protective services 
   * He could at the very least set some limits on how long she's going to say, how she's going to contribute to the household, how much her being there is allowed to interfere with your relationship, and how many pets she can bring. She can be homeless for a couple of weeks until the pets ARE adopted by this animal shelter she's referring to, for example. 
* She's moving in with him on Mother's Day, a day he has already planned to spend with you 
   * She can move by herself
   * She can move with the help of the three other people she apparently has helping her (thought she had no one?) 
   * She can move another day
   * She can hire removalists 
   * She can use those three helper-people to pack up all her stuff and stick it in storage, and then he can help her move parts of it into his house on a day he's NOT already busy. 

You are being ridiculously accommodating by allowing him to make these decisions. He sounds like a very nice person, but he's TOO nice and he's letting her take advantage of him (even if she's not intending to, she is). He needs to start making fair compromises that don't involve dropping everything to do whatever this woman wants, and that DO involve some consideration for his own preferences and those of his girlfriend. 

Is she aware that he's canceling plans to help her out? Does she see that as reasonable? Where is his doormat behaviour coming from, is it himself or is it her requesting he do these things? If it's himself only, you could try talking to her about how he's so bad at planning things (I suspect it's at least partially coming from her though, there are a lot of red flags there). 

You should talk about all of your concerns with him, and then see what his plan is to resolve things. If his plan is to ignore how you feel and continue on without change, then you know he cares more about her than you, and you'll need to respond accordingly (I would break up with him in that case). If his plan involves trying to focus more on you and your daughter, who are becoming his family, then there's a chance it could work but you both need to start making compromises like the ones I list above - helping out this woman is fine, but not at the cost of his own life and his own plans. Step one, he needs to stop canceling plans with you to do last-minute things with her, **even if** the things seem important. Real emergencies are an exception, but if they start happening all the time then he needs to find an alternative solution. And really, she shouldn't be moving in with him, but if she does he should at least put a limit on how long she can stay before she needs to find somewhere else. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think this is probably a side effect of her medication change and you should get her back to whoever changed her medication ASAP so they can adjust it further. Also encourage her to discuss the problem with her psychologist and anyone else involved in treating her - maybe they will have some ways to help her distinguish between the false and real memories. The focus should be on fixing her medication, though. 

If changes to her medication don't improve things, you should also get her checked out for any physical problems in case she has any other condition causing this. (However, it is WAY more likely that it's just the medication - focus on that.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> You said no and told him to stop and he didn't, instead he pinned you down and told you the new rules that he had invented. That is not ok and there is no context that it is ok (unless in cases of consensual non-consent which this clearly wasn't). 

Even if you ended up enjoying it in some way that doesn't make his behaviour okay. There are several points he should have stopped and didn't, e.g.: 

* You said no, he should have stopped at that point. Continuing after that point is obviously sexual assault. 
* He had to pin you down to get you to "agree". That should have been an obvious sign to him that he was assaulting someone. 

The shoulder-bite thing is pretty questionable - if a guy pins you down for a sexual assault and THEN says "oh by the way, if you want out, just bite me" ... *obviously* the person being attacked is going to be unsure if biting is a good idea. I probably wouldn't have bitten him in that circumstance either, because I'd already said no and he'd ignored it, so how would biting help? 

You enjoying it is also pretty normal in cases of rape or sexual assault. Your body wants to enjoy it and your mind doesn't want to believe it's happening, so often you end up enjoying the act, even if you realise later that you were being assaulted. Whether you enjoyed it or not, his behaviour was not okay and I would definitely call it sexual assault or rape. 

I'm sorry OP :( </TEXT>

If he doesn't realise, or if treatment fails, then I think you should consider separating. 

Either way ... there's nothing you can do now. Let the hospital take care of him, and you focus on caring for your children and taking care of yourself. Let your father take care of you and help you when he can. 

You can't help anyone if you're falling apart, so just take a slow, deep breath, and make sure you're ok first. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Since you say he's abusive, it's possible that any presumptions about your husband were made by her boyfriend, and not by her. For example, say she tells him she got a text from you talking about how upset you were ... her boyfriend is a controlling and abusive idiot, so he is immediately going to think there's no way you sent that text BY YOURSELF. He probably assumes your husband is just like him and is angry too. So he goes off at both of you, and she's not going to correct him, because he's an abusive asshole. 

It's also possible she misrepresented things in the way that she thought would get the most sympathy, or in a way that she hoped would make him reconsider his actions (like, maybe they were arguing about how he treats her, and she used your husband as an example and stretched the truth to make it fit the scenario). 

Either way though ... this guy is a terrible person and your friend is probably not thinking clearly at all. You should draw boundaries that keep you safe (emotionally as well as physically), and then support her as best you can within those boundaries. What the boundaries are will vary depending on what you feel comfortable with - I guess what you're discovering is that lying about your husband is a boundary, so you need to work out how you will enforce that boundary going forwards. You should also think about what other boundaries you might have and how those will be enforced in future (also, only say things like "or I'll end the friendship" if you WILL end the friendship, otherwise your boundary is meaningless). </TEXT>

<TEXT> ok well clearly things are not working right now, burnout or not (and I have no idea, it probably depends how you define 'burnout'). You should do something to improve your situation. Go and talk to your doctor and see if you can get some medical leave to take care of your mental health. Also, ask for a referral to a psychologist who can help you plan out your next move (treatment, job change, or both). 

If neither of those things are an option, your priority should be trying to see any psychologist, psychiatrist, mental health support person or counsellor ... pretty much any mental health specialist, and talk to them about your situation and how you're feeling. If the first one you try doesn't help, try another one, because sometimes it takes a while to find a good one. 

Also, if your work is something that is known to cause people to burn out quickly, you could try inquiring about any mental health support services your workplace might offer (but be careful, some workplaces are very judgemental about that sort of thing, so only ask if you know it's safe). </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's normal to feel a bit awkward/vulnerable after sharing something like that, and it's also normal to feel more affectionate. I think if you're feeling like you want to be more affectionate, be more affectionate. If you're feeling uncomfortable, hold off a bit for a day or two (but of course still be nice to her). 

I doubt she is going to be scared away either way. If you were making her uncomfortable, hopefully your relationship is strong enough that her first thought if she's getting uncomfortable is to just say "Hey, I'm getting uncomfortable, can you change what you're doing?" and then you'll know and can do something. If she's not saying anything like that and she's behaving like she's happy, you don't need to worry about it. </TEXT>

Apart from that, I loved my wedding. My dress was cheap, we got married in a park, tiny guest list, no formal wedding party - just us standing in front of guests and we all walked in together, wrote the vows ourselves using templates and ideas from the celebrant, reception was dinner at a local restaurant and my mother paid for it as her gift to us, we brought a bunch of flowers my aunt had given us and stood it on a table behind us for decor... very low-stress and affordable, exactly what we both wanted. :)

<TEXT> You should keep asking. You even said that you got SOME responses that helped. Part of asking for help is filtering through all the advice you get and choosing what works. Since you're asking online, you get more responses, and you have to filter more. 

You should also think about where you're asking. Sometimes you get totally the wrong sort of responses (like with the crate training) and that shows you're asking in the wrong place or in the wrong way. It doesn't mean you should give up on the resource entirely, it just means that the way you've asked for help wasn't the right way for that resource and you need to be more specific. You could ask other questions that include notes about your specific situation, or you can find more specific subreddits that are better to ask advice on. For example, when I ask for relationship advice on the general subreddits, the advice is *terrible* for me, because I'm poly and most of the people there aren't. My options are 1) add a note about my specific situation (like "also I'm poly") to my post, and accept there will be idiots who try to argue with me; or 2) Ask on a more specific subreddit because they will understand my specific situation better, and accept that I will get less broad advice and responses. 

Whatever resource you use there will be a tradeoff, with different benefits and drawbacks. That's part of doing research - casting a wide net and then focusing in on whatever options work best for you. You shouldn't abandon a resource because it has drawbacks, instead you should work to minimize those drawbacks when you use it (in this case by being more specific with your questions - like you didn't realise no crate training had to be specified, and now you know, so you can ask again in a more specific way). 

I've run into that thing with US people being scared to call police too - it's interesting, because in that case it was me giving unhelpful advice based on different cultures. There is *no way* my first concern in calling the police is that they would murder someone. However, since I was replying to someone from the USA, they said they couldn't call the police because they didn't want their friend to die just because he got drunk and started smashing furniture. It was an important cultural context that I hadn't considered, and it meant my advice was useless to this person. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It depends on what her mental illness is and how it affects her, but I will try to explain how mine affects me so you can get some idea. 

For me, I have extreme social anxiety disorder. 

Maybe it's easier to explain this with an example. The other day, I had a nightmare about getting off the bus one stop too early and having to ask directions to walk the rest of the way. I *know* this should be a minor thing, I *know* that if this situation came up I would be able to handle it, and I *know* having a nightmare about this is stupid. It doesn't matter though, my anxiety doesn't care. The nightmare scared me so much that I woke up shaking and couldn't get back to sleep until I'd done breathing exercises to calm down, then meditated to clear my mind, then done more muscle relaxation to get rid of the tension so I could relax. It took half an hour (maybe more?). Then, after one hour of sleep, I woke up with another nightmare about another pointless thing. So I went through all the relaxation *again*... Repeat for the whole night. 

My nights aren't *all* like that but when I'm really stressed about something, they are. "Really stressed about something" includes things like "I have a doctor's appointment sometime in the next week", or "I am planning to meet a new person" (this can be up to a month away). Eventually I get tired enough to sleep through the night with no dreams, but then it restarts as soon as I've caught up on sleep a bit. (Also, I do all of the stuff you're supposed to do to manage stress - diet, exercise, CBT techniques, meditation, mindfulness... the anxiety doesn't care though, and if I'm not awake to counter it, the anxiety spikes back up and causes nightmares.) 

Even on the nights where I sleep alright, I am often disturbed by nightmares at least once. 

So, part of my anxiety is just constantly being tired and worn out and on edge because I can't RELAX, and part of it is being immensely frustrated by myself because I *know* all of this stuff I'm feeling is pointless and I don't want it to exist but no matter what I do I'm still scared. 

Then, part of it is constantly pushing myself to do more... because the only way to improve my anxiety is to keep pushing my boundaries and expanding my comfort zone, so I can't just hide in my house where I feel safe, I have to do all this stuff that scares me more. It's just a constant balance between trying not to be *too* anxious because then it triggers my self-harm and my depression and I end up getting worse, but also I'm supposed to be pushing boundaries and practicing new things because then my anxiety will lessen (as long as I don't overdo it). It's a constant struggle and a lot of the time it doesn't feel like I'm achieving anything, because my achievements are tiny things that most people don't even think about doing to begin with (like, walking past someone in the street). 

Also, despite how incredibly debilitating all of this is, part of living with my mental health condition is just ... trying to get other people to believe it exists. Like, I say "I have social anxiety" and the reply might be "Oh, yeah, I had that too but then I tried talking to more people and it went away". That's not how it works. I *wish* that worked, but if that worked I wouldn't have anxiety to begin with, because I am already doing that. I think everyone with mental health conditions experiences this to an extent... if you think of the classic example of someone with depression being told to "just think of the positives", it's a similar experience. 

Oh, and none of this even begins to cover how much I do throughout the day to manage my condition. I'm constantly monitoring how anxious I am, if I'm reaching the point I need a break (am I on the verge of harming myself if I stay in this situation?), if I'm breathing too fast (do I need some relaxing breathing exercises?), if I'm thinking realistically or not (is that true, or is my anxiety lying to me?), and keeping track of how much more I can do today because I need to be ready for whatever's coming in the near future too. It's exhausting and time-consuming and frustrating and half the time no one believes it exists in the first place. 

None of this really conveys what it's like day-to-day, which you can only really understand by living with it or talking near-daily to someone who has it. It takes time, but it IS possible to understand to an extent... my best friend understands quite well now, for example. I think if you talk to your girlfriend about how it affects her, it will work much better than reading all of our accounts of it (though they may help you to put it in context too). You should also look at symptoms of whatever condition she has and how her condition is usually treated, as well as how people often react to treatment. She might not be the same as everyone else, but there will be some similarities and it will help you to understand her condition in context. </TEXT>

If everything seems great, it's probably great. Don't let other people's opinions spoil what you say is a fantastic relationship.

For what it's worth, I'm a woman and I love the intimate conversations where we share emotions and dreams and insecurities and what might be called "beta stuff". Quite likely your girlfriend likes it too. Everyone likes to know more about the people they love, I think. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If there are periods of time where you feel normal and then periods of time where you are more severely depressed ... have you looked into the possibility of bipolar disorder? That sort of cycling sounds familiar to how I have heard people describe being bipolar (though I'm not, so maybe I'm just totally wrong). It could also just be fluctuation in your depression which is a thing that happens too. 

Either way, I think telling someone and getting a proper diagnosis is a good idea. I hope you find someone you can tell irl soon. </TEXT>

That is of course if you take sex as a whole, there may still be one time that was incredibly good that may not be matched by a new partner, or one aspect that can't be matched or reproduced (e.g. age), but that doesn't mean your sex life or your sexual partner is not your best ever when you weigh up everything together. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why doesn't he care that he's making you sick? That seems pretty inconsiderate. I think you should be having a serious conversation about how he's ignoring your comfort and well-being for his pleasure - I know that's a thing that can happen in BDSM, but it should be happening as a mutually agreed thing that you both enjoy, not a thing that he demands and you do even though you're suffering and unhappy and he doesn't care about that. 

If he's not willing to do anything to stop his semen physically repulsing you and making you ill, then YOU need to do something. Your options are to get him to cum somewhere else on your body (like your chest?), use condoms during oral sex, or stop giving blowjobs altogether. 

I would also think carefully about his reluctance to do anything to help and if that is part of a larger pattern of inconsiderate behaviour in your relationship. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Firstly, I just want to say you sound like a very supportive partner and she is lucky to have met you, whether this relationship works out or not. 

Apart from that... The extreme negativity and selfishness are probably symptoms of her depression and can be worked on (if she's willing to work on it). It took me a while to adapt to that, but one of the things that helped a lot was the people around me drawing boundaries of how much they were willing to listen to (e.g. when I first met my husband, he was happy to talk about how I was feeling, but if I started talking in depth about harming myself he would leave the conversation... or another friend, he was happy to talk to me about my problems, but only if I was actually trying to improve things - not necessarily in ways he suggested, but I had to have some sort of plan that I was trying). Respecting those sorts of boundaries and creating them for yourself is an important part of interacting in a healthy way while you are mentally unwell, but it can be really hard to learn because it feels like someone is telling you that you can't feel how you do. Still, if she is willing to work on it with you, it might be a good idea to attend some therapy sessions with her and talk about where appropriate boundaries are. 

I got married when I was 19 so I have no advice about breakups in your 20s, I'm sorry :( 

I can say that when I was 16 (I know this is probably not really comparable but it's the best example I have) the guy I leaned on for all my emotional support - similar to how your girlfriend is leaning on you, though I probably was worse than it sounds like she is - he ended our relationship and after that I had several months of instability and I was unable to cope with life, pretty much. But I didn't die. I cried a lot and it I was thinking a lot of things like ... "this is confirmation that no one will ever like me because my problems are too much and I will never recover" ... etc. But, you know, it was ok. It took me a few months and during those few months I was fairly out of control and throwing my problems at anyone who would listen in a really unhealthy and unsafe way, and that continued to an extent for over a year, but the first few months were the worst. If I had been well enough to tell anyone what was happening I think I might have been hospitalized, but I guess I'll never know because I never said anything. Still. In the end I was fine, which I guess is what you were asking. I started making new friends after a couple of months. 

I started dating my husband soon after that too (around six months later), and have managed to be significantly more stable and happy with him. A huge part of that was him enforcing appropriate boundaries during conversations - if he hadn't done that I'm not sure I would have learned so well how to manage. Now I am more stable and understand my mental health problems better, I don't need him to enforce those boundaries because I maintain them by myself, but when I was learning it was very helpful to have him tell me clearly that I was crossing boundaries and he was going to take some space. (If you're not willing to try that with her, or if she's not willing to let you, then breaking up may still be a better option. Ideally people learn and practice those sorts of boundaries through therapy and while they are still single, but learning them now is better than not at all.) 

I'm sorry for the giant wall of text. I'm not sure if any of that was helpful or not but I wanted to give you all the information I had that might help, so you can pick out anything you think is relevant. (And ignore anything that's just me rambling lol that happens too :P) </TEXT>

<TEXT> If wherever OP is from is the same as where I live, the neighbours didn't know. I literally never speak to my neighbours and probably wouldn't even recognise most of them if I passed them in the street. There is one guy that I recognise because he lives right next door and he's often outside when I walk past (but we still never speak). 

If they were starving there is no way I would know unless they came to my front door and told me themselves, and they'd probably have to start that with "Hey I'm your neighbour and I live over there" so I knew who they were. And I'd probably help them out and give them some food or go buy them some groceries, because no one deserves to starve, but I'd also be kind of disturbed and upset and refer them to a few charities that would help them out with food so they didn't have to speak to me again in future. 

(To be fair, I have extreme social anxiety, so speaking to random people disturbs me more than most, but no one else I know speaks to their neighbours much either.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> My partner is monogamous (by choice, I am open to him being poly if he wanted). When I'm anxious/depressed, I *still* get thoughts like "What if he finds someone better and leaves me and then our relationship is doomed and I will never recover or be happy again?". Sometimes I even get thoughts like "Maybe he's going to leave me because I'm poly and he doesn't really like poly people, despite how he's been saying it's fine for our entire relationship and happily listening to stories about my other partner, any day now he'll realise he deserves better!" ... etc. 

My point is... I don't think being in an open relationship is causing these thoughts. It just changes the direction of them. If you were mono, you'd still be worried about him finding someone better. You'd still feel inadequate. The *specific* situation you worry about would change, but the thoughts would still exist in some form or another.

<TEXT> I've been like your wife. If she IS getting treatment, it is possible things might improve. I definitely improved with treatment. 

However... it's never going to go away entirely. I'm still pretty needy. If your relationship is more stress than happiness, and that's the long-term outlook, then it's not worth it. 

I am married and my husband supports me a lot and sometimes has to step into a role as  carer, too (my mental issues are pretty bad). But despite all that ... he still finds being married to me 100% worth all the struggle of supporting me. He loves our relationship and he loves me and he is happy when we are together. And I love and support him in return. (There is obviously more to our relationship than this, I'm just keeping this brief for the purposes of reddit.) 

I have also been in relationships where that wasn't the case. Not all men want to be, or are able to enjoy being with me, because I *am* very needy and sometimes unstable. If you're not able to be happy while supporting her, you should end things. I had at least two boyfriends who did that, and I understand. In the moment it hurts, but ... I know I'm a lot to deal with. It's ok. I moved on and started dating people whose natural way of being in a relationship was more compatible with what I needed and what I could offer in return. 

I'm not trying to say you're a bad person or you're weak or anything like that. Breaking up with someone who is incompatible isn't bad. It isn't abandoning her. Some people just need different things, and it sounds like you need a life partner who isn't like her, both in terms of what she is asking from you and what she is giving you in return. If you think talking to her will help, talk to her about it, but keep in mind that no treatment can erase *who she is* and it sounds like part of her will always want to lean on you. It's up to you to draw boundaries that you feel comfortable with, and you should do that if you think it's possible, but if she can't be happy in a relationship with those boundaries then it's probably better for the relationship to end. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are so many significant issues with this that need to be addressed. I'll try to separate them out.

* Co-parenting in a poly relationship is a complex situation that needs significant discussion with both biological parents and all other partners too. It should **not** be discussed with little to no input from his nesting partner. That shows a complete lack of respect for the impact a child would have on your life, a complete lack of respect for your potential desire to have a child with him, and a lack of maturity and consideration throughout the entire situation.
* A FWB is not a close enough relationship for your partner to have a child with. It *is* possible for it to work, but given all the other problems here I think it is unlikely that this particular relationship is going to make it work. The fact he hasn't even considered this an issue (and neither have you for some reason?) suggests that neither you, he, nor his FWB are taking *raising a child* seriously. I'm hoping that she is at least a serious and long-term FWB and that just didn't make it into the story.
* Parenting is not a decision you make on a whim. He should be **sure** he wants a child before he agrees to impregnate someone. He should not do it just to make her happy, or when he hasn't taken the time to consider how certain he is. This suggests, again, a lack of maturity and consideration of the situation and lack of concern for the well-being of his future child.
* In addition to all of the extremely poor decision-making around parenting, he is now fluid-bonded with his FWB as a result of that.
* As well as all of the above, your relationship has more general problems relating to how you communicate. (Around boundaries, around sex, around children and parenting, around fluid-bonding...)
* I am particularly concerned that he tried to arrange a threesome without discussing it with you and while both of his partners weren't into it (you only wanted to watch, she didn't even want you watching).

Given the lack of communication, lack of respect, lack of maturity, and lack of consideration demonstrated by your partner, I'm not surprised that you had trouble having sex with him. He has shown some extreme errors in judgement here.

It is very normal to react badly to a demonstration of such poor judgement, and so many negatives coming out all at once probably have a strong psychological effect on your sexual relationship with him.

As for what you can do ... honestly, I don't know. I am not sure that I, personally,  would be able to salvage it after so many profound failures in communication and judgement. However, assuming you care about him a lot... I guess you could start by addressing all of the issues that this has brought up. You probably need to discuss all of these points with him *in depth* and try not to impregnate anyone until you are all satisfied with the results of this conversation.

* How serious is he about wanting to be a father? What actions is he going to take to care for a child?
* Can he financially support a child?
* When he says "coparenting no feelings", that needs a lot more detail. E.g. Whose house is the baby going to sleep in? What about once the child is older? Who is in charge of medical decisions? Decisions about schooling? How present is he going to be in the child's life? How present is the mother going to be? How about other partners (like you, the one who lives with him, for example)? How will difficult topics be navigated? All of these and more are serious questions that he needs to think about BEFORE having a child.
* How are you going to handle new fluid-bonded partners in the future? (E.g. do you need to see results of STI tests?)
* How long do you intend to discuss major decisions in future? (E.g. If he's intending to impregnate someone, how long should he wait between notifying you he's thinking about the idea and actually doing it?)
* What qualifies as a major decision that requires you to discuss it with your partner?
* How are you feeling now as a result of his decisions? What can be done differently next time? Why did he choose the decisions that he did, and how can you understand his decision-making process better? How is he feeling?

 #x200B;

As you can see from this massive wall of text, you have a lot of communication to do with your partner if you want to salvage this relationship. Please take care of yourself and don't agree to anything you don't want to :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you are desperately unhappy while living with your husband and adopted kids, and happier without them... Why are you staying there? Leave! Go and live with your mother or something. Ask your family for their help to get out. (Seek legal advice before you take the baby anywhere though in case it causes problems.) 

If you're worried about having nowhere to stay, contact women's shelters. I think due to your situation (the age gap, constantly working for your husband, taking care of children you are barely old enough to have given birth to let alone adopt/parent/school, no say in your living standards or home arrangements) they are likely to help you out. Even if you don't stay in the shelter, they likely have the contact number for a good lawyer who could help you with issues like divorce and custody of the baby.

<TEXT> Honestly, "fake nice" is indistinguishable from "real nice" as long as you don't drop it and start being mean. Being a nice person is about choosing things that make other people feel good so by making that choice, you ARE nice. It might not feel right to you (that's why it feels fake) but once you get used to it you do it out of habit and then you are being nice and it feels authentic to yourself too. During the transition stage it might seem fake to other people too (because they're used to you choosing the less-nice options) but once it becomes your normal behaviour it will only seem fake to people who just can't accept niceness. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think there is any "trick", you just keep going and it will eventually even out and become normal again. 

As long as you and your partner are clear of where your boundaries are, and you maintain them, it will be fine. (If you think your crush-girl may be unsure, maybe take a moment to clarify with her that what happened was only ok in an orgy context and not a long-term thing.) 

Finally... If you want to stay purely monogamous, that's entirely up to you, but given that you went to an orgy with your partner it sounds like you *might* be interested in opening up your relationship to an extent (at least sexually). If you haven't read up on different types of open relationships already, it might be worth looking at them and how they work, and considering if they'd work for you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Look, there are undeniable facts here that need to be addressed. You should focus on those. 

* *Someone* took your son's piggy bank. If not Sara, then who? Are you *sure* Andrew didn't take it? 
* Anxiety is an illness. Is she being treated? At the very least she should be going through self-help manuals online, or attending free/low-cost mental health clinics. 
* Is she contributing to the household in any way? I have extreme anxiety to the point that I can't work. I get government payments because I'm unable to work, and I use those to help pay my rent and buy my food (also I live with my husband, not for free in my sibling's home). If Sara's not doing that, *why not*? 
* If she needs documentation, diagnosis, etc. then she should be working on that. Again, why isn't this happening? 

What does your fiance think the outcome will be? What happens when you ask him these questions? What is his long-term plan for Sara? 

You're focusing on this piggy bank thing because it IS a major problem, but a larger problem that you're ignoring is that you have Sara living there with no long-term plans and no intention for her to improve. She's going to be there indefinitely and that seems to be the entire plan. You need a better plan. 

As **part** of your better plan, talk about how you'll handle any future things going missing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're not a monster. Hugs 3 I've been in a similar situation, but different enough that my resolution wouldn't help you. Still, I can really empathise... this is a terrible situation to be caught in :(

All you can really do in this situation is to be true to yourself and your own needs and wants. Lay out the facts.

* You want to be in a relationship with your wife.
* You want to *also* be in a relationship with your boyfriend.

This means you want to be poly (which is also in line with how you've identified in the past). That's what you want. Your boyfriend wants that too. Your wife does not. Therefore, the one you need to be renegotiating with is your wife. You *don't* want the relationship that she is asking for.

The outcome of that negotiation *might* be the relationship ending, but it might be something else, too. Be clear though: You're not choosing your boyfriend over your wife. You're choosing to be upfront about your own preferences. Your wife was honest about hers, now you're being honest about yours.

I think you and your wife should get some poly-friendly relationship counselling. I'm not sure there are many options that don't involve at least some form of separation, but if there are any, you can examine them during counselling.

For example, how would you and your wife feel about taking sex completely off the table, but otherwise staying together? Or about her finding another partner to be sexually exclusive with? Is she willing to work on accepting you being poly? Maybe meeting your boyfriend? Can she work on finding ways to feel safe that don't involve you being monogamous? Or maybe you two could start living separately and having set times where the relationship is "on" and "off"? Or transitioning your relationship to be less romantic and more close friends? Or maybe a more complete break-up where you separate and take time apart, then potentially become friends once you've both healed? I think this is the sort of conversation you should be having, but because it's such a difficult one, relationship counselling should help. (It has to be poly-friendly though, as I expect hardcore monogamists will not be open-minded enough to consider options beyond divorce.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Welcome :) I'm pretty new here too but so far I've just jumped in and no one has complained...yet... lol 

I don't think you'll mess up but if you do you can just apologise and try to be better next time. Everyone messes things up sometimes. So, don't worry about that. 

I've found this community to be really open and supportive (and one thing I really like is that no one's first recommendation is to break up! like, it's a possibility, but there are lots of other suggestions to try first and no one is shamed for having feelings, even difficult feelings). 

 #x200B;

In response to your comment about your husband (his "what's in it for me" attitude) ... I guess that might be something you discuss a bit longer, over time. The reality (if he's solidly monogamous) is that there *is* nothing in it for him except your happiness. For most people in active poly/mono relationships (I am one of them, I'm the poly side), the mono person is willing to work through their jealousy and any problems that arise because they want their poly partner to be happy. If your husband is unwilling to do that, it might mean you have to make a difficult decision in future, but I think for now it's a good idea to keep talking, find out what he's most afraid of, what his major concerns are... things like that. Discuss those and work through them. Try reading morethantwo and The Ethical Slut and any other educational resources you can find (and if you can, get him to read them too, or at least the ones relevant to him. If not, be willing to educate him about the stuff that you read). Let him learn about poly and give him time to get more comfortable with it. He's probably not going to make a final decision yet as long as the conversation is still open. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had an emotionally abusive friend for a long time, and I felt exactly the same way you did ... he had the potential to be so much better, and I wanted him to be better, and I had risen above how he was treating me and showing him how to be a better person. And I think ultimately I did have a positive influence on his life. 

However... 

He's still abusive as fuck. I said "Hey, how have you been?" and he said "Bitch. Have you gotten even more like a whale since I last saw you?" 

Do you think I should have let him say that to me? I did. My response was something like "I'm doing well, thanks for asking. What have you been up to?" because I was so used to being treated like that that I didn't care. It didn't even register. 

I KNEW he was abusive. You know your guy is abusive too. He might not be as blatant, but you know. 

You describe the cycle of abuse (seriously, google it - he gets angry and abusive and awful, and then he tries to reconcile, he's really kind and says he loves you and you're amazing, you have a period of calm, and then it escalates back to craziness again). 

He blames you for all of the problems. He can't discuss problems with you without blaming you for them. He twists everything in his head so that it's YOUR fault. 

You're sitting there, upset, wanting to be friends with him, worrying about his well-being, wanting him to be a better person because you love him... what do you think he's doing? Do you think he's trying to become a better person? Planning out how to manage his anger? Of course he's not. If he's thinking about you at all, he's thinking "fuck her". 

I don't hate my abusive ex-friend. I wish him all the happiness in the world, and I still hope he becomes a better person. I even check in on him once in a while. But I don't let him abuse me anymore. I stopped spending time with him. I stopped letting him say those things. Now if he calls me a bitch, I just leave. If he starts trying to insult me, I block him, or I walk out. 

You can do that too. Develop a system. If he says something that you think is abusive or disrespectful, you leave, and you don't talk to him again for a week. Next time it happens, 2 weeks. Next time, 3 weeks. Eventually, you will reach some ridiculous number of weeks and lose count of when it's ok to get back in contact with him, and that's ok. That's when you decide you're out of contact with him indefinitely (but you can still do occasional check-ins through friends, just leave when things get abusive... it shouldn't take long). Do not allow him to argue with you about what counts as abusive. It's what YOU feel is abusive. Trust your own judgement. What matters is how the comment affects you, not how he pretends it was intended. Do NOT back down on your decision, no matter what, because that will just teach him he can harass you into changing your mind and he'll do it even more next time. 

If you care about him, you know he needs consequences for behaving like a complete prick. He won't change without them. He probably won't change anyway, but this at least creates a chance. And, also, it's not nice to be abused all the time even if you don't care what he says anymore. Trust me on this. It's **so** much better not being abused all the time, even if you never believed a word. 

Good luck. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think you and your wife are going to find anyone that likes you both exactly the same. I think pursuing that goal is only going to lead to unhappiness, because it is impossible. 

You could read up on this on [morethantwo.com](https://morethantwo.com). There are several important sections, and you should really just read the whole site, but I'll link a few of the more relevant ones for your situation:  

* [Common mistakes in poly relationships](https://www.morethantwo.com/polymistakes.html) \- *especially* the section under "**Dont expect someone to develop the same relationship with both you and your partner**". You should also read the section under "**Dont ignore the consequences of your actionseven the unintended consequences**", because it seems particularly relevant to how you're feeling right now. 
* [Polyamory and couple privilege](https://www.morethantwo.com/coupleprivilege.html) \- especially "**Part 2: The unicorn**" 
* [Guide to dating a couple](https://www.morethantwo.com/coupledating.html) This guide is aimed at people who might be looking to date you and your wife, but it will be useful for you to understand where your third may be coming from. It's also where I got the quote below from: 

 **Dont assume that its necessary to develop**a  relationship with both people in a couple in exactly the same way;  relationships grow on their own, and no two relationships are ever the  same anyway. Doing this may impose unrealistic expectations on you; even  if you were to date identical twins, it would be reasonable to expect  each relationship to develop differently! Remember, you may be dating a  couple, but each person in that couple is still an*individual.* 

 #x200B;

I think you need to discuss with your wife whether your expectations are reasonable, and maybe reconsider what your goals are when dating someone. It sounds like what you're currently doing is not working for you or your wife, so something needs to change. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sounds like a shitty relationship. You're not saying things like "He's wonderful and supportive but I'm struggling with him having another partner", you're saying "He pushes me away because of his mental problems, AND he prioritises his other partner". That sounds like the relationship is the problem and his other partner just adds more complexity to the problems that already exist. 

If your relationship makes you unhappy or unsatisfied, you should end it. 

If you're interested in being poly, you can explore it in future with someone else, or even by yourself. You're not stuck with the first poly guy you encounter. If you want to explore poly while being with him, there is nothing stopping you, but keep in mind that poly isn't going to fix a relationship. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Has she expressed that she feels smothered? I worry about this too, because I am much more expressive with emotions than either of my partners, but I've discussed it with them and they both love how enthusiastic I am. If she hasn't said she has a problem with it, it might be your own insecurities projecting onto her. Just be careful with that. 

That said, the way I manage this when I want to tone it down is that I just ... write letters. Or journal entries. I write all that enthusiasm and affection down, and all my plans of things I want to do to show my love, and then I keep it to myself, or I select small bits of how I feel to share with my partner. If I am still full of energy and wanting to express that, I exercise until it's under control (or, if exercise is not currently possible, I do some breathing exercises to calm down, and then distract myself with something else). Those techniques are most useful in newer relationships, where my level of enthusiasm is far too high for the depth of the relationship that we have. When the relationship is more serious, I might try to channel how I'm feeling into different things that I know my partner *will* appreciate. For example, one partner I had did not enjoy me sharing the long lists of things that I loved about him, but he did enjoy physical affection, so I'd surprise him with hugs and kisses and sex. That made him feel loved, and let me express my love, but it didn't smother him. 

However, another thing to consider is... if your partner doesn't enjoy you expressing your love, is that something you want long-term? The partner I mentioned above would reject the love I would give him in any form that was not physical or occasional simple words - I think that is one of the things that destroyed our relationship. Of course it's ok to take some time to get used to each other's ways of expressing love, or to have occasional days where your love just doesn't line up with each other, but if your partner is consistently put off by you expressing your feelings for her, it might be a fundamental mismatch. I think this is something to seriously discuss with her - what ways of expressing and accepting love work for each of you, what affects the love you can accept and express (e.g. if you're really tired or stressed, you often want different types or amounts of love than if you're happy and relaxed), and whether there is anything you can compromise on. One thing I have heard being mentioned is the 5 love languages, so you could use that as a starting point for discussing different ways of expressing love, but I think its more complex than just that. Be willing to venture into anything else that works for you and your partner too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They sound like wonderful people. 

However... you need to heal. From what you're saying, keeping in contact with them is preventing (or at least delaying) your healing. It's not your fault, it's just how things are. If you need space, take it. 

If you have to tell them anything, you could say something like that you need time to sort things out and heal from the relationship with your ex, and that speaking with them is bringing up past hurts. Then say you're going to take a break from being so close with them to give yourself time to heal. (Then that break could extend into forever, if necessary.) 

If, after that, you're still struggling to process, therapy might be a good option. It sounds like he did a lot of damage and therapy could help you to rebuild. 

Take care of yourself. You don't deserve to feel like garbage. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're allowed to be upset. You're upset because it hurt and you're shaken by that. I'd be upset too. And you're *definitely* allowed to be in pain. Imagine if you fell off a ladder and injured yourself - you'd tell your boyfriend about that, because it hurts and you want comfort from someone you care about. Treat this injury the same way. It hurts, so you want comfort. As for mad ... I'd be mad too if I kept getting hurt and nothing was changing. 

I think you need to have a serious talk with your boyfriend. Not about this particular event, but about the pattern you've noticed - you often end up in pain, and you don't like that. Maybe he could try being more gentle and slow with EVERYTHING that he does to you, so that you get a chance to tell him to slow down or stop. If he just dives in right away there is no chance to stop him (for example if he'd gone slower with sticking it in your ass, you'd have stopped him before it did that much damage). Then he can speed up a bit once he knows for sure how rough you like something (and how that varies on a day where you want to be treated gently vs. a day where you want it to be more rough than usual). Anything that's even slightly new, he should go very slowly. 

Getting injured *on rare occasions* is normal when you spend a lot of time around someone, because accidents happen. Getting injured *often* means that someone needs to be more careful. 

If he's apologetic and he's promising to be more careful in future to prevent something like this happening again, then I think you can hope things will improve (as long as he follows through with that promise). If he's apologetic but going to continue approaching sex in the same way then it won't improve. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're not over-reacting at all. 

Lets write a list of everything she should have done: 

* Your girlfriend didn't apologise at all. Someone who loves you should apologise when they do something wrong. 
* You girlfriend mocked you for saying it bothered you. Someone who loves you should care how their behaviour makes you feel. 
* Your girlfriend doesn't think she did anything wrong. Someone who loves you should agree that *hitting you in the face out of anger* counts as something wrong. 
* Your girlfriend is threatening to break up with you if you continue to feel bad. Someone who loves you should work to make it up to you so you feel safe with them again. 
* Your girlfriend continues to "jokingly" hit you. Someone who loves you should stop that once you say it bothers you. 

Please get away from her. She doesn't care about your boundaries and she's going to continue running over them. You deserve to be safe in a relationship. You're not over-reacting. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My university had a security office. They were unarmed. I think I saw one officer, once, when he came to unlock our classroom because the lecturer forgot her keys. There was also the phone number to call them on signs around the campus in case you needed someone to walk you to your car late at night (I never stayed that late). 

My primary school and high school never had any security officers at all. The few times I remember students getting in fights, the fights were broken up by teachers. Near my house there was one school that I never attended and they did call the police once, after a student stabbed a teacher, but they called the regular police. I think they had some unarmed security for a few weeks after that. (Also the stabbing was on the statewide news because that level of violence in a school was shocking.) 

The only armed security I've ever seen have been actual police officers, guards at important government/military locations, or people in armoured vans or transporting money into ATMs and things like that. Regular security officers that I've seen have never been armed, and definitely not in a school. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ugh, I agree completely. I had this problem when I was doing treatment, and even more when I was studying to become a mental health worker.

It's immensely frustrating trying to convince people that you don't fit in the box, even if *parts* of you do. And even harder seeing people treat others that way when you know it doesn't reflect how things work in reality. If it works for 75% of people, it's recommended to everyone, and a lot of the time the fact it **doesn't** work for everyone is not emphasised enough. 

I know what works for me, and I'm *doing* what works for me. I wish the emphasis was on supporting me to do that, because I'd be making a lot more progress that way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think those things were created for the benefit of the person posting them. People probably make them because they wish someone would *genuinely* say that sort of thing to them, so they post it to say it to everyone. Then other people see it and think "oh, that's a nice sentiment" and share it. And I think some people make them because they've seen those other ones and they think that it might help someone. 

I think it does help occasionally... Like, if you need a remind that you're not worthless just because you didn't shower today, and you see one of those posts... it's not like it instantly fixes things but sometimes it can remind you that you should be kinder to yourself. You're not a failure at life just because you didn't achieve that today. 

The whole "You are a warrior! Be proud!" doesn't really help though. I'm not a fucking warrior, it's just that my other option is literally death. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is probably not much you can do except wait for one of the services to be able to help you, which might take some time. I'm sorry :( 

This is stuff that I'm assuming you've already done, but I'm going to put it here anyway in case there's anything new: 

* Contact [Onelink](https://www.onelink.org.au/services). Keep in contact with them, because they are supposed to be helping you find other services that can help (even if there aren't many, they should at least know what's available). I've never worked with them, so no idea how helpful they will actually be (guessing not much). 
* Apply for [government housing](https://www.communityservices.act.gov.au/hcs/services/social_housing/how_to_apply). Looks like the wait time is currently 191 days for "priority" housing (which I think would include you, because you're homeless, but I'm not an expert). That's a ridiculously long time and hopefully you find something better well before that, but at the very least you will not be homeless forever. 
* Go to those places that give out free food. (If you don't know where they are, ask the Onelink people.) Even if you don't NEED the free food, it'll be useful to have someone who treats you with kindness and respect, which it sounds like you need. 
* I also agree with that person who posted the link to Safe Shelter ACT. It looks like that's starting up this weekend, and is probably a good idea to go if you can (again for the kindness and respect, but also because they may have other resources for you). 
* If you need some more social things to do (not sure if you do or not), you could check out Libraries ACT to see what [social groups](https://www.library.act.gov.au/whats-on/social-groups) they run. Lots of them look like they're based on writing, reading, board games, or chatting on different topics as a group, and they are run by volunteers, so they probably don't cost anything. (If you're unsure you could also ask the librarians about them.) They probably have a lot of older people but if you just need somewhere to hang out and relax, they could be a good resource. 
* Keep asking about social workers that could help you, or free community social groups you could join. It sounds like you really need someone on your side. 

I know all of that is just more stuff that may or may not help, and I'm sorry I can't be more helpful than that. I hope everything improves for you soon. 

Sending you some hugs. Take care of yourself OP. 3 </TEXT>

<TEXT> Try one more serious talk. Write a list. Present it like you're really worried about him (because you are). 

"Boyfriend, I'm really worried about you. Your anger, violence, and drinking has been getting worse. 

* You drink *a lot*. According to drinking guidelines, 3 standard drinks or more in one day is "heavy drinking" and carries severe health side effects. The amount of vodka you drank the other night is equivalent to more than 14 standard drinks. 
* You are awake at 2 AM shouting, swearing, slamming things, and harming yourself. 
* This behaviour is not a one-off, it happens almost every night. 
* This behaviour continues even when it affects others, like your mother, or your girlfriend. 
* When I try to talk to you about it, you tell me to ignore it, or to do nothing. 

Boyfriend, this is a problem. I can't ignore this. What can we do about it?" 

 #x200B;

Most likely, he will try to dodge the question, and if you push it, he will get really angry at you and refuse to change. Because of how violent he gets when he's angry, I am worried about your safety. Please stay safe and try to have this discussion somewhere where you have multiple exit routes, and with an agreement that someone will check in on you to see how it went and call the police if you don't answer. (And DON'T have this discussion while he's in his angry-state.) 

If, on the slight chance that he listens to you, he needs ideas for recovery ... he should see a doctor, because if he's drinking so much, it might be dangerous for him to try to quit on his own. Also, he needs to quit drinking (or at the very least, severely cut back). He needs to control his anger. If he still can't control it even when he's drinking less, he needs anger management classes. He needs therapy of some sort (whether that's joining AA or some other alcoholics support group, or if it's more like a therapist specialising in substance abuse, he needs *something*). Those things are the bare minimum. 

For yourself, you could consider getting therapy or joining Al-Anon (or both). It will teach you about how to handle his drinking without taking responsibility for it, as well as teaching you about enabling behaviours you might be doing by accident. 

 #x200B;

You deserve to feel safe and it must be so hard to see someone you love hurting like that :( Please take care of yourself, OP. You can't make him get help, but you can get help for yourself, so start there. Please check out Al-Anon or other therapy options. Good luck. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree, I think we can't force other people to feel the same way about relationships that we do. If the OP was happy with it, then why cause trouble by talking about how evil it was for her husband to find someone else to meet his needs? 

If she was posting there distraught that he'd found someone else, I think THEN there is some space for talking about how she deserves better (though honestly, my approach in that situation would still be to try to understand his point of view and look at him with some compassion). Instead she wanted advice on how to handle telling their children, a completely different problem than what most people were focusing on. At that point, "getting back at him" or "making him take responsibility" is a useless endeavor (especially because she didn't seem to be upset about it in the first place) and the focus should be on what is most healthy for their children moving forwards. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was new to reddit I posted advice in relationship\_advice and it was edited by a mod without anyone telling me. It was still my words, but the mod erased some things I said that I think were important. It shrank from being four paragraphs long to being only two paragraphs. 

I never posted there again and unsubscribed. 

If this is still going on, it could easily be skewing the advice to support one viewpoint. 

(Though to be honest, I had a similar experience when I posted my own question in /r/relationships \- anything that is not "normal" is judged pretty harshly. So, maybe redditors are just not good at "unusual" relationships.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think that's true. I mean, it kind of is in that SAD causes you to *behave* awkwardly, because you're anxious, but it's not like you're a socially awkward person. The social skills are still there. You know how to interact with people. You have an impediment you have to learn to work around, but it doesn't erase the fact that you still have the necessary skills. Once you're comfortable with the people and the anxiety reduces, you can socialise just fine. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I completely agree, there is no going back. 

What I've found is that you keep going until you find a new way of living... one that accepts you might have this feeling, you might be damaged, but it won't stop you finding things you like and it won't stop you living. It's so, so unfair that you have this condition that makes things harder for absolutely no reason, but even if it never goes away, you can still take time, and still find a way to live with it. 

One person I knew a long time ago described it something like "I still have the shadows on the edges of my mind, and sometimes they still grow darker, but I've found a way to live in the lighter part of my mind and I know how to enjoy the flashes of brilliant light when they happen." I think that's a good way to describe it. My mental health problems aren't going to go away, and I have to accept that, but I can still improve how I live with these problems so that my quality of life improves. (I imagine it's similar to any other disability when you first get it - at first it seems impossible, then with time you can adapt and learn new ways of doing things and quality of life improves, even if you can never go back to how you were before.) 

Some people really can be cured, but others can't, and that's ok. Keep living anyway, and keep trying things, because it always takes time to adapt and find what works. 

Take care of yourself. I'm sorry this is happening to you :( </TEXT>

<TEXT> You have a legitimate issue, in that it sounds like you've done everything she wants in order to make her happy, and she is no longer doing anything you want in order to make you happy. 

Her argument might be "but I tried being poly for you" but if you had known that she wasn't into poly, you would have addressed that issue much sooner. Your entire relationship would be different. You were both poly because that's what she said she wanted. 

It's not like you take turns getting what you want. You need to find a way to compromise so both of you to get what you want. I think you should talk to your wife about how long you think you can handle being monogamous for (if at all), along with open communication around how and when you will work poly back into your life (not necessarily her life, but at least yours). If your wife is not interested in even discussing these things that are necessities for your happiness, then maybe your relationship is over. I am already concerned that you are allowing her to unilaterally end your other relationship without any discussion of your needs (or any consideration for your girlfriend!). You need to discuss why both of you allowed this to happen, along with the accompanying resentment in your couple's therapy (and you *definitely* need to make sure that your therapist is poly-friendly). 

Your wife is important, and I hope she manages to work through her trauma and find ways to feel safe. You are important too, and you need to work out how long you're willing to wait for her to heal, especially because once healed, there is no guarantee she'll want to be with a poly person at all. It sounds like you love her a lot so it may be worth trying, but remember to take care of yourself too. If you sacrifice everything for her, there will be nothing of yourself left to give her. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not sure there's really a foolproof way, but I guess here are a few options that usually work for me: 

* Decide what you will think instead when you find yourself thinking negatively about the past. For example, if you catch yourself thinking "Remember how bad it was when I...", interrupt yourself and think something else (like "I learned from that experience and I will be better in future"). 
* Decide what you will replace the thought with when you find yourself projecting into the future, too. For example "There is no point worrying about this and I will deal with it when it happens." 
* Keep something you will use as a distraction. For example, every time you find yourself distracted by visualising failures, you will instead ... do a few situps. (Or draw a picture, or read an affirmation, etc... pick anything that will work to distract you). 
* Try some grounding exercises. (For example, [the ones on the second page of this PDF](https://sydney.edu.au/content/dam/students/documents/counselling-and-mental-health-support/grounding-techniques.pdf)) 
* Keep yourself busy. Studies, work, exercise, hobbies, friends, all the things you can keep in your life. 
* Pick one time to worry about all that stuff ... like every day between 8:15pm and 8:30pm. Then the rest of the day if you find yourself thinking about it, just be like "nope, I'll worry about that later" 

If you want to google more about it, it's called 'rumination'. [This article](https://psychcentral.com/blog/8-tips-to-help-stop-ruminating/) looked pretty good but I'm sure there's a lot out there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're asking about what's best but you need to think more about what you want here. 

You didn't want sex with this friend for months, from what you've said, but you continued with that anyway. Now he's surprised that it's not continuing, because he managed to guilt you into it before and he wants to continue. 

It's not going to work because you're finally paying more attention to what you want than what he wants. 

If he can't respect that, give him a time-out. Make it clear why ("Since you can't stop talking about sex, I will block you for a while."). Then block him for a few days. Then if he continues, block him for a week. Then two weeks. Etc. He will either get the message, or you'll end up blocking him permanently. Don't engage in arguing about if what he said was "really sexual" or not. Just do it. Be hardline. 

None of this is your fault. You were clear about what was being offered and where the boundaries lay. It was his responsibility to manage himself, and he's not, so you need to enforce your boundaries. Good luck. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Have you ever been in therapy? If you haven't, I think that could really help.

One thing I'm noticing you're using a lot of common [cognitive distortions](https://psychcentral.com/lib/15-common-cognitive-distortions/) and when you do therapy you learn to identify and manage those. One that I'd like to mention is black and white thinking:

2. Polarized Thinking (or Black and White Thinking)  
  
In  polarized thinking, things are either black-or-white  all or  nothing. We have to be perfect or were a complete and abject failure   there is no middle ground. A person with polarized thinking places  people or situations in either/or categories, with no shades of gray  or allowing for the complexity of most people and most situations. A  person with black-and-white thinking sees things only in extremes.

Before the girl semi-ghosted you, did she enjoy your company? Was she having a good time with you? There must have been some connection or conversation for you to try to be in a relationship, right? So, those parts of it were positive things that you're ignoring because you're thinking "It has to be perfect or its a failure". 

There were some parts that were a success - you talked to a girl, she enjoyed your company for a while, you got a bit closer with her. 

There were some parts that were a failure - the relationship didn't work out, the girl semi-ghosted you. 

Because you're using black and white thinking, you're ignoring all the parts that were a success and deciding you will never succeed.

It wasn't a complete failure, and even if it was, you could still build on it to know what NOT to do. Since there were some parts that were a success, you can build on those too and see if you can make them work better next time. 

Please don't wish death on yourself. You deserve better than that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maybe you could put some stacks of pamphlets about how to get help with anger management, abusive relationships, relationship counselling, therapy, and other similar things, into a common area that you know she will see. Especially free or low-cost options, since students and young people are usually fairly poor. That way if she needs help, she will have a way to get it. (And may be useful for other people in your flat too!) 

It sounds like their relationship as a whole is pretty toxic so I'd be reluctant to call police because they would likely both get in trouble and then decide to blame you for the whole situation (instead of themselves). Of course if it sounds like someone is in danger, call anyway. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Relationships that I've been in that ended with us still being at least friendly acquaintances (not all of these were romantic or even long-term, but should still work for your purposes): 

* We never actually officially got together, because part of our "thing" was that we'd playfully reject each other every time the other one tried to initiate anything. Everyone knew we were dating but we never formalised it, they just assumed based on watching us flirt constantly. It ended when he got a job and had less time to hang out and fake-flirt. 
* He got into a major car accident and everything changed and we just weren't as close anymore and so we never really officially broke up, it just ended. 
* I moved to another school. 
* I never expected the relationship to go anywhere serious, but he wanted a long-term commitment and was talking about our future together. It scared me and I broke up with him. 
* Neither of us intended it to be a long-term thing. It was just playing around, and when one of us got bored we ended it. 
* We were mostly together for the sex, and then he met someone he wanted a serious relationship with. I was happy for him. 
* I was only with him because I wanted to try out being submissive. Turns out I'm not submissive. 
* Turns out I'm not a Domme either. 
* He had a thing for a certain sex act. An *obsessive* and borderline fetish for it. I don't like that sex act. 
* A girl cuddled up to him and touched him under a blanket at a party. He never asked her to, but he enjoyed it and didn't stop her. He confessed to cheating on me so I broke up with him (now I am older and realise he was possibly sexually assaulted, but at the time I didn't think of it). 
* He lied about something very important to me that was very minor to him, because he thought it was a white lie that would make me happy. 
* My mental health issues were too much
* Not proud of this but ... I saw that other people wanted him, so I got with him to prove I could. Then it ended when I realised I wasn't interested in him that way to begin with. (I was immature and dumb, I wouldn't do this today.)
* My close friends made fun of him and I didn't want to be judged. 
* He was into partying, and I hate parties. We both expected the other to change. 
* I discovered he held a political view that I strongly disagreed with, and I could never see him the same way again. 
* He didn't like children. I do. 
* I hated his stupid hairstyle. 
* He wanted a clear relationship hierarchy, where one of us was the final decision-maker on all things. He didn't care which one it was, just that we needed to have one so he didn't get confused. I do not want that.  
* He had unresolved mental health issues and wasn't able to maintain a relationship 
* A stupid misunderstanding where we both thought the other was saying something really awful, and by the time we'd worked out it was a misunderstanding the entire relationship had fallen apart 

And a few where the end wasn't due to him being an asshole, but we didn't keep in contact afterwards: 

* He tried really hard to help me with my mental health problems, but his way of helping actually made it significantly worse. I knew he was trying to help, so I never held it against him, but it was sooooo bad for me that after we broke up we never spoke again. 
* I recognised I was behaving abusively towards him (using him as an emotional outlet, taking bad moods out on him, neglecting/ignoring his needs, brushing him off when he wasn't useful to me, using my mental health condition as an excuse to mistreat him, only being kind to him long enough to keep him around). 
* Suicide

Hope this helps. It should at least give you some options for your character's past relationships not working. :) 

More generally, you should think about any friendships you've had where you used to be close but the relationship has broken down or ended (or even just been damaged). For teenagers, everything is more extreme, so if you think of a relationship difficulty you've encountered, then that could very easily have been a breakup for a teenager. The ability to "stay friends" is often because the relationship wasn't that serious to begin with, or because both parties recognise the relationship ending wasn't anyone's fault and they want to salvage the non-romantic portion of their relationship. Sometimes it's just because it's easier socially, because they are all at the same school and have the same social groups and so ignoring/avoiding your ex causes problems for everyone. If it's due to social pressure, it often goes through a process of avoiding the ex entirely, then ignoring the ex and focusing on others while they're present, then polite conversations that include ex on the fringes, then gradually relaxing into regular conversations where the ex may be included, and then (rarely) a regular friendship with the ex. </TEXT>

<TEXT> All of those experiences you list sound extremely traumatic and I'm sorry you went through that :( 

But, I think talking about that could easily upset your friends. When a friend of mine told me about how his wife had died in a car accident, it was still very difficult to hear him talk about it, even though it had already happened years ago. Seeing how it made him feel was difficult for me because I care about him a lot and it hurt me to see him in emotional pain. 

I think your friends might be having difficulties too. Maybe if they do not have experience with supporting someone who has a lot of emotional trauma, they don't know what to do so they run away and stop talking to you. It's not a good thing for them to do and it's not fair to you, but it is possible that's what's happening. 

I'm really not sure how to help you, because there's not a way to magically make people better at helping you or listening to you. 

I guess the only thing I can really recommend is that you tell the intense versions of the stories to professionals first. That way, when you speak to friends, maybe you can tell a less intense version (or at the very least, maybe you will be hurting less when you tell the story, so it will be easier for them to hear). Molestation, abuse, depression, warzones... none of those are easy topics. 

I don't think it's toxic to open up to people about depressive thoughts, but it can be very hard for people to listen to, so they might call it toxic if they can't handle it. Some people will never be able to understand, and it's up to you if you want to spend time with those people or not. 

I hope you can find the support you need. Being able to talk about your life is important for everyone. </TEXT>

I saw what you said about "what if one person gives them everything they need?" and I wanted to talk about why that is a dangerous and unhealthy mindset to have, and why it won't work. 

Poly people talk about New Relationship Energy (NRE) and Old Relationship Energy (ORE). When you're dating someone new, everything is new and exciting and you want to focus only on them. While he's still in the NRE stage, he will probably be happy to only be with you. In the NRE stage (which all relationships go through, including mono relationships), you are dedicated to making the relationship work no matter what and you're excited about being in love. It's easier to ignore some of your preferences because you have this amazing person in front of you who can be everything you'll ever need! 

Part of ORE is that you know the other person very well, and you accept them, and you choose to stay together because the relationship is worth it and you love the person enough that you want to stay with them. All relationships also reach the ORE stage eventually. For many people (including many poly people) it's the best part of the relationship, because it's all about comfort and security and trust and knowing the person like you know yourself.

However, once you get to the ORE stage, you also know that the person can't meet all of your needs. No one person can EVER meet all of your needs, forever. That's just not physically possible. People's sex drives change, and people's needs change over time (maybe in ten years time, you need five times more conversation per day and your partner needs five times less? Or maybe in ten years time you'll have developed an entirely new need that your partner can't meet at all and never will). Poly people can resolve that by dating more than one person, and spreading their needs between partners. For example, I have my husband who I have been with for over 10 years, and with him I'm playful and giggly and we draw each other cute pictures and we go for walks together and cuddle and cheer each other up and support each other through everything. I also have my boyfriend, who has deep conversations with me about how people and society work and how we both choose to interact with them, and gives me endless comfort and advice and support, and leads me to be a better person (through encouraging things like exercise, eating healthy, confronting my anxiety, etc.), and through our relationship we have both been evolving into better people and exploring things we never thought we would. Also we have amazing sex. So, the relationship with my boyfriend is much newer, and it's still developing, but both of my relationships build me up in different ways, and give me different things, and satisfy me and my needs in different ways. 

If your Dom is used to poly relationships, when he reaches a point where he has a need that is unmet, and he knows you will be unable to meet it, the natural inclination for him will be to find someone else to meet it. Not because he doesn't love you, but because he knows that you can't be everything (because no one can, and forcing you to try would be damaging to both of you) and he doesn't want to make the relationship miserable when there is an easy solution. Some poly people *are* able to live a life slightly less fulfilled because their mono partners want it, and others can't. I can't. I tried doing that, but it was like denying who I was. (Just like some people into BDSM can live without it, while others have it as a core part of their sexuality.) 

When mono people encounter the problem of their partner not being able to meet all their needs, their options are to accept that they will never have that need met, end their relationship and find someone new, or cheat. Accepting you will never have that need met can lead to resentment and damage to the relationship in some cases, or even breakups (and in other cases, it's fine - everyone is different). My point is that your fundamental approach to any unmet needs is going to be different, and either way, the solution is NOT to try to be everything your Dom will ever need. That's impossible, and trying is unhealthy and unrealistic. 

If your partner says he's willing to try being mono for you, then I think it's ok to try (but if he's never been long-term mono before he may find he can't do it). If your partner says he's poly and can't change, then don't expect him to change.

<TEXT> Talk to your mother about this and about how it's not being resolved. Your sister has serious problems. If she's underage, she's still young enough that your mother can get her psychological help that may reduce her disturbing and abusive behaviour. 

If that's not an option or it doesn't work, you need to move away from your sister. You can't heal from abuse while the abuse is still happening. Is there any other family member you could live with? Or a friend's family? How long until you are old enough to move out on your own? 

In the meantime, spend as much time away from your sister as possible. The way she's treating you would make ANYONE extremely insecure. It's not your fault. You could also try getting some therapy (not because it's your fault, but because dealing with your sister is obviously damaging you and it might be good to have someone on your side that you can talk to - make sure you talk to the therapist about your privacy concerns and make it clear nothing should be sent to your family home that your sister could get hold of). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Who does she want present at the proposal? (Or does she want it private?)

Who does she NOT want present at the proposal?

How does she feel about asking her father's blessing beforehand?

Does she want to be involved in the ring shopping? (If not, does she have a trusted friend she would like to be involved in the ring shopping? And if not, ask her for guidelines about what she'd like her ring to be like ... price, shape, colour of the metal, what jewel, overall style of the ring)

What is her ring size? What does she want you to do if her ring size may have changed between now and then? (Mine did. I got fatter. Don't ask "what if you get fatter?" though, obviously :P)

Following from that, how does she want you to handle anything else that may have changed between now and then that might affect proposal plans? (e.g. friendships changing, different taste in jewellery, fights with her family...)

Is there anything she thinks is essential in a good proposal? (e.g. going down on one knee?)

Is there anything she thinks is cliche or bad and you should avoid it? (e.g. putting the ring in her food?)

What does she want you to do if you come up with a very important question outside of those 24 hours? (Like, what if you forget to ask what sort of ring she wants?)

Is it ok if her friends/family/acquaintances/coworkers know you'll be proposing before she does? (And how much detail is it ok for them to know?)

How much of a surprise should the surprise be? Should she know it's happening that year? That month? That week? "Sometime soon"?

 #x200B;

Also, all of those questions are questions about the proposal itself. There are other questions that you should be asking before taking the step to get engaged (compatibility type questions - do you both want kids? etc). Make sure you've asked those questions too before you actually propose, though they probably don't have to happen within that 24 hours :P </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is definitely something you should discuss with the professional you saw (if you're still seeing them), because there can be lots of reasons and without knowing the full details it's hard to give good advice. 

However, one thing you could consider is that it can be really hard to support someone with depression. So, if you're able to, it might be a good idea to only tell your problems in small parts, and the only thing you tell everyone is just a general overview. 

So, here is an example: 

First, you give just a general overview ("The professional said that I'm depressed and I don't share enough"). 

Then, if your friend says something like "Why did they say that?" or "You can talk to me about it anytime" you can give a tiny bit more detail, like "I have had a lot of traumatic experiences, including as a child, and they think it really affected me and they are probably right" 

Then again, if your friend says something that invites more conversation, you can share any more details that you like (like you could go into more detail about the traumatic experiences if you want to, or else you could tell them something new like "Yeah and they think I have social anxiety too") 

If your friend says something like "Wow that's awful" or "That sucks man" and nothing else, or if they change the subject, that's a sign they don't need to hear more and so you just leave them with the general overview. (This doesn't mean they don't care, just that maybe they're having a bad day or have too much of their own stuff to deal with to support you more. You can still try again another day.) 

Since some days people feel better than others, it's best to start at the general overview stage every time you want to give more details of something mental health related. That way you can gauge how your friends are feeling and lean on them without overwhelming them. 

(Of course, it's also possible your friends are just assholes who don't care, so if they don't care... find new friends.) 

Finally, there is one person it's ok to share all your mental health problems with, any time you see them. That's a professional. So, if you need to tell someone everything, you should try seeing a therapist regularly. 

If you think you can handle carefully sharing with your friends, then it's ok to just do that, but keep in mind that if they have their own problems they might not be able to be as supportive as they'd like to be. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree with you, the best way to solve it is to just go out and find someone, but you're also right that it has to actually be someone you like. Of course, you can't just magic up a girlfriend lol. So, I guess the next-best thing that works for me when I'm anxious about something, is to plan it, and then take a step on the plan so that I know that EVENTUALLY I will solve the problem, even if I can't solve it yet.

So, think about all the steps that lead up to you having sex.

* Before you have sex, you need a girlfriend that you are comfortable with.
* Before you have a girlfriend you are comfortable with, you need to find a girlfriend.
* Before you find a girlfriend, you'll need find a girl that's interested.
* Before you find a girl that's interested, you need to
   * a) meet and spend time with girls
   * b) Be attractive.

Those last two things are things that you can start doing immediately.

For a) think about how you're going to meet girls. Do more stuff that involves girls. Take a class or something that has girls in it, and try making friends with them. Talk to girls that already exist in groups that you are a member of (e.g. if you're on a gaming discord, there are probably girls there somewhere too ... try saying hi to them, with no expectation for more).

For b) pay attention to your appearance and your general health. You don't have to be a body builder or a model, but if you're not already, try exercising sometimes, eat healthy food, shower regularly, think about what you're wearing (you don't have to change your style, its more like if you have one pair of jeans that doesn't fit right, and one that does, wear the jeans that fit better and make you look more cool). Things like that.

So, those two things are things you can do right now that will help you to deal with your problem *eventually*.

Also keep in mind, it's VERY normal to have some anxiety about sex, especially if your first time wasn't great. So don't hate yourself for it. That will make things worse (and I know, easier said than done). It sounds like you'll be fine, and you're already pretty self-aware and understand how it happened the first time, so you can avoid making the same mistakes the second time around. Most people who have some anxiety around sex still go on to have perfectly normal sex lives.

If it does become more of a problem, you should consider finding a therapist (or sex therapist), but judging by your post I don't think you're at that point yet.

I'm also happy to talk more if you think it will help. I have extreme social anxiety so I am very good at finding ways to deal with anxiety, but to me it sounds like you're mostly on top of this so I won't be surprised if you don't need my help at all :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Where did the time 11:00 come from? Did he just arbitrarily decide that or did you tell him you'd be home by 11?

Either way, the way he has handled this situation is ridiculous. He's being ridiculous. He's throwing a temper-tantrum because you're not doing what he wants. Even if you were TOTALLY in the wrong here (which you're not), the appropriate way for him to handle it would be to sit down and discuss it with you. Or, if it was really extreme (which it definitely isn't), then he should take a short break and then come back to discuss it with you.

Do not apologise to him. You have done nothing wrong. Definitely do not beg for his forgiveness like he's hinting at.

HE should be apologising to YOU for over-reacting, shouting at you, trying to control what you do, interrupting your time with friends with controlling text messages, ignoring you, talking about how he "allows" you to do things, and for having the nerve to ask you for an apology for HIS problems!!

I agree with him that you should think it through thoroughly. Then, you should break up with him. I know you want to fix it, but unless he's willing to change and apologise to you and never shout at you like that again, then you can't fix it.

I've been married 10 years OP. My husband has never EVER shouted at me like that, even when we had major arguments where I was unquestionably in the wrong. You deserve to be treated with respect. Please break up with this person. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's what it sounds like to me too, but I don't think there's much you can do about it. How he manages his relationships is going to have to be his decision because you can't force him to change. 

I guess all you can really do is ask him questions and be a safe space for him to talk about his feelings. Hopefully, if his feelings are driven by something like fear or judgement, being able to safely talk about them will help him to process them. And if they're not driven by something like that, letting him talk about it should give you more understanding of how he's thinking (hopefully). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'll start by saying I'm not a POC so maybe I'm missing some important points. 

I think you could take her to groups where other Indian people will be present. I'm not sure what those groups would be, but they surely *exist* in your community. You don't need to adopt a token brown person into your friend group, but seeing other brown or Indian people regularly as part of a group event (like a class or something) will give her opportunities to find her own role models if she needs them. Maybe you could look at groups that do activities specific to Indian cultures (even if not the specific area of India that her bio-father is from, at least it will be a starting point). At the very least, it will help her to know a little more about Indian culture, and let her meet other people from Indian backgrounds so she won't feel isolated or disconnected from her culture as she gets older. 

I think what you're doing with making sure she has books and things that include people that look like her is a good idea too, although I'm not familiar with the books you mention and I'm not sure that Hispanic girls (based on the name Martinez) will be people she associates as being "like" herself at all. 

I agree with others that are saying you need to tell her about her bio-father soon. This website seems to have a lot of picture books about India that could also be useful for prompting a discussion with her: [https://www.thebarefootmommy.com/2017/12/childrens-books-about-india/](https://www.thebarefootmommy.com/2017/12/childrens-books-about-india/) You could read her one of these books, and that would be a good way to lead into telling her she has some connection to India too because her bio-dad was from India before he moved to Canada. 

Her being brown is a reality that needs to be talked about, but you also have to be careful to balance talking about it with not making too big a deal of it to the point that she feels "othered" by her own family. So far, I think you're doing a good job, although the balance may not be perfect (but you're aware of that and working on improving it!). She is lucky to have you. :) 

Finally, I'm sure you've already seen this, but if you haven't this might be useful: [https://www.childwelfare.gov/topics/adoption/postplacement/transsupport/](https://www.childwelfare.gov/topics/adoption/postplacement/transsupport/) I know she's not adopted, but information about trans-racial adoptions and the challenges they face will likely have a lot of overlap with your situation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're not an idiot for not knowing how things will work. You didn't know, that's ok. You're learning. 

If you're ok with your girlfriend exploring this (it sounds like you might be), then it's ok to take it slowly, as long as you're aware it will probably lead to more. Tell her it's ok for her to flirt back, or send a picture back, but you're still adjusting to the idea so you want to take it slowly. Then, once your anxious side has seen that it didn't suddenly end your relationship and your girlfriend still loves you just as much, you can take another step and tell her it's ok to go on a date. 

Talk a lot through the whole process. Talk about what you're scared of, and what you want, any boundaries you want or need (including any that seem obvious), and listen to what she's scared of and what she wants and her boundaries too. 

If you get jealous, don't panic! Take your time and think through everything, consider some of the suggestions you've read here, ask for more help if you need it, and communicate with your girlfriend about it (but be careful how you phrase it, use I-statements to avoid sounding accusatory. Say things like "I'm really struggling with jealousy and I don't know what to do" instead of things like "You're so inconsiderate") 

Later, when you're ready, you can take a look at different types of poly relationships to think about what might work for you and your girlfriend (though part of it will always be trial and error). I read *The Ethical Slut*, which gives a good overview, and while a lot of it seemed like common sense to me, other parts of it gave me a framework to think about things, and it did give me a broader understanding of how other people approach poly (which would have been really useful at the START of my poly relationship, but I didn't actually read it until I was already in the relationship and had made many of the mistakes they mention... oops). Think about if you'd prefer kitchen table poly, or parallel poly, or something inbetween (also listen to what your girlfriend and her potential partner want, too). Obviously none of this has to be set in stone, and a lot of it can be decided as it comes up instead of beforehand, but when you're ready it's a good idea to be aware of these things. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, we used to skype call and he would creepily masturbate while looking at me. I'd tell him not to and he'd deny he was doing anything (like I'm blind and can't see your arm moving???) 

Sooo I blocked and deleted him (didn't say anything, just did it). 

A couple of years later, hanging out on the same site I met him on, I meet him again. He apologised a lot. We talked a while... he says he's changed. (And to be fair, he doesn't seem to masturbate creepily while we talk anymore.) We're still not very close but I talk to him occasionally. Added him back on skype. Don't turn the camera on very often though... and I refused to meet up with him when he was in the area (he was pretty hurt, but I explained that he'd already demonstrated he didn't care that much about my boundaries so it was never going to be safe to meet him). 

I think keeping him at a distance is ok. We only really chat when I'm bored and no one else is online. If he started wanting more I'd probably just stop talking to him again. </TEXT>

I'd be concerned that he might be willing to lower his standards if his priority is to find a second partner. Though, if he has experience with this, I'm sure he's aware of that and he's being careful not to rush into any new relationships just to meet the partner count. 

I guess my understanding doesn't really matter anyway, as long as he's happy. I hope he finds a new partner soon. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It doesn't sound like your two styles of poly work very well together (in fact it sounds like she is not necessarily poly at all, but it is also possible she's still just adapting). 

You should try to discuss this with her, and not back down from telling the truth (i.e. poly is a need you have, and it is possible that the relationship will end if it turns out she needs you to be monogamous with her). Definitely try to phrase it as gently as you can, but it is a harsh truth and so however you phrase it, it will be difficult. 

You can help her to work through her worries about poly, but that will only work if she's interested in doing that. If she's not interested, there is no point in trying to "work through it" because she won't. I think this is one point you need to discuss with her as well - whether a kitchen table poly relationship is something she wants, or if she's only going along with it out of fear of losing you. 

There may be some compromises you can make (e.g. progressing more slowly, drawing some boundaries that will help her to be more comfortable) but ultimately it comes down to if you can both find a way to make it work, or if you're just incompatible in what you want out of your relationship. </TEXT>

Of course if you can get therapy, that will be better, but the work book can help to teach you useful skills too.

If you want something less formal, I guess a good place to start is to think of something social you can do that's only a little bit scary, and then do that.

If there are flies breeding in open bottles in the living room, that is not appropriate for children. I agree it *likely* won't kill them but it's certainly not ideal. If things do not improve soon I think you should contact CPS anyway. They will likely require the house to be cleaned. 

When I googled I found [this PDF](https://www.azdhs.gov/documents/prevention/health-systems-development/sliding-fee-schedule/sliding-fee-behavioral-health-providers.pdf) of free/low-cost mental health services in Arizona that you could check. It looks like it might be out of date (it's from 2017) but contacting those places should at least give you an idea of where to go next. 

[This site](https://sites.google.com/site/arizonahoardingtaskforce/self-help) is based in Arizona and has a list of hoarding-related resources, so you could look at that too. I'm not sure how useful it will be. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not the person you asked but it happens to me too when I watch porn. I switch between imagining myself in the female or male POV in the porn I'm watching, depending on what looks more enjoyable and what the camera is focusing on. When I watch gay porn (both men), I still switch which position I am imagining myself in, in the same way. 

In an actual sexual encounter, I'm not usually thinking about it, because I'm engaged in actually having sex. When I do think about it, its more along the lines of putting myself into my partner's head (like "Imagine how good my body feels to him, I bet he'd like it if I did THIS as well"), but that wouldn't be a coherent thought. It'd be something I'd think briefly and then I'd do it and then I'd think more about myself and what I'm enjoying. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, even if you start crying during an argument, that's not a bad thing. Lots of women love a man who can express his emotions openly. When my husband cries all I want is to hold him and make him feel better, there is no judgement. 

I think you should start by looking at WHY you hate being emotionally expressive, and then maybe experiment a bit with expressing things in different (healthy) ways to see if you can find a way that's comfortable for you. For example, maybe you could try thinking about how you'd handle that emotion if you were somewhere you feel completely safe to express it however you want with no consequences. (For example, maybe you would cry and smash everything.) Then you could try doing just a small fraction of that in a way that won't harm you or anyone else (maybe you're not comfortable crying and you don't want to smash all your belongings, but instead you could get something that needs to be broken anyway and break it apart). Then you could think about whether that helped or not, and why. Then, if it helped, do it again next time. If it helped but not enough, you can do it again and try some other techniques as well to see if they help more. If it didn't help, try something else next time. Even if the way you react is not something you can control (e.g. crying), you can apply the same process ... look at how you're managing that reaction - what can you do to make it more tolerable for you, and to make the outcome something you're happy with? What worked and what didn't? 

If that doesn't help you could also look for therapy, if you can find a therapist you're comfortable with (probably a male therapist?), because therapy is a good way to unpack emotions and come up with ways to improve yourself into who you want to be. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am very introverted and also have extreme social anxiety (like, sometimes meeting up with my own family that I have known my entire life, with the meeting taking place at the family home, is still too much for me). 

I don't have friends except online. I don't really meet new people. I have trouble going out anywhere. I don't drive and don't have a license (I worry about people in other cars judging me, and then I am thinking about that instead of thinking about driving safely). Public transport is difficult too (but easier than driving, because I can sit down and be invisible for most of the trip). Attending doctor appointments or seeing other professionals (psychiatrist for example) is scary and takes me about five times longer than most people because I have to work myself up to making the appointment or making the phone call or whatever. Also, most people don't see "social anxiety" as disabling, so it's really hard to explain that I'm disabled (even to like... government officials). This is made worse by me having trouble speaking in the first place, so arguing my case is difficult. I'm currently trying to get on disability and I keep running into this problem. (It turns out that even if I try really hard, I can't just ignore my anxiety and make myself work anyway, which was my first plan :P) 

Specifically as a woman, the biggest issue is that online support communities are often filled with men and those men are often not in a healthy place, especially with how they relate to women. (They say things like "I wish women knew how much us men have to suffer. They complain about it being so hard for them but it's worse for us!") They shut out women who disagree with that narrative. I've encountered this in three separate online communities for social anxiety support and at this point I avoid those communities. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maybe you and he can plan out a whole scene beforehand, and that way you'll both know what will happen and can discuss what things need to be present to make it enjoyable for both of you. Even if you have parts of the scene where you plan for him to have more freedom of choice in what happens, you should discuss what sorts of things you're expecting him to be choosing from - if necessary, give him several options. 

In addition, it sounds like you haven't spoken in depth about what you both enjoy from kinky scenes and sex in general. Does he KNOW you want to be hit more than 10 times? How does he feel about it? Does he enjoy it? What parts of sex does he really enjoy, and how can you incorporate that into any kink scenes you do? I don't necessarily need the answers to those questions, but YOU should know the answers. 

He is the Dom, but outside of that, he's still your partner, and a lot of your issues seem to be about communication rather than being specifically kink-related. You need to discuss what both of you need and work out how to compromise to achieve it (if that's possible). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Be prepared in case she isn't open to wearing lycra shorts every time you have sex. As a fetish it is less extreme than some things, but still not every woman is going to be into it. 

I think a good way to bring it up might be to have a more general sex talk beforehand, where you ask if she has any major DOs and DONTs. Then after you've discussed hers, you can discuss yours. Just make sure you actually listen to what she's saying (it might be hard if you're nervous about talking about yourself next). 

In terms of discussing yours, you can say something like "For DOs, I only really have one thing.. it's more of a fetish actually. I love when women wear lycra shorts, it's pretty much my only turn-on." 

If she seems open to the idea, then you can mention that you have an brand new pair that you'd be happy to gift her. (Only do this if you're SURE you can suggest it in a way that doesn't sound like you masturbate over them nightly or something, because that would be my immediate thought if someone said "Hey I have a fetish for these shorts and also I happen to own a pair.") 

One of the hottest things is being able to arouse your partner, so hopefully she'll be just as into them as you are once she sees your reaction :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> You can start by visiting your GP and telling them about your thoughts. They will probably want to refer you to a specialist (a psychologist/therapist or a psychiatrist) and may also prescribe you medication. 

Be aware that some medication can make you feel worse instead of better and there is no real way to predict this, it's just trial and error. So, if your medication is terrible and makes things worse, go back to the doctor and ask for a different one. 

If you don't think you can keep yourself safe anymore, you could also look at hospitalization (if you do this, be aware that some hospitals are better than others and do your best not to go to one that has a bad reputation). You can just call an ambulance or take yourself to the emergency room, and they will hopefully look after you. That is the easiest option (but depending on where you live it may be expensive too). If it's less urgent, you could also discuss it with your doctor or therapist and see what they recommend. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Did B know you expected to be told? Was B hiding it from you, or did B think it was ok because your relationship is polyamorous? 

I think if B was deliberately concealing it from you despite knowing you expected to be told, then it's a serious breach of trust and requires some serious conversations and reassurances between you and B. However, I'd still say that due to the lack of other partners, it's possible the guidelines may have been misinterpreted and if that's the case a discussion and reassurance should be enough to resolve this. It's also possible B knows that you should have been told but was caught up in a moment with C (which shouldn't lead to breaking agreed-upon rules, but is still something you can resolve if you can find a way to manage that in future). 

If B was unaware you wanted to be told, or if B thought your arrangement was DADT, then I think that B probably didn't do anything wrong, but a discussion around expectations for new partners should still be had so that this doesn't happen again. 

Either way, I think feeling disgusted when your needs are betrayed by your partner is pretty normal. What you should do next is to think about how and why your partner didn't meet your needs, and then to discuss what will happen in the future and agree on rules around interactions with new partners so that it doesn't happen again. You should also think about and ask for what you might need in order to feel safe in the relationship again, although the answer to that may just be time and honesty. If you're having trouble communicating with B, you could also consider poly-friendly relationship counselling. Finally, if you're still angry or hurt or disgusted after all of that (or beforehand if the feelings are too strong), you should find a healthy outlet for those emotions. That might be a journal or something creative, or maybe you go for a run or punch a pillow or something, but don't just ignore the emotions if they're bothering you. 

(Also, if B simply *doesn't care* about your needs or opinions, you may need to reconsider your relationship. I've mostly been assuming that's not the case but if it is then I think the focus should be on disengaging from the relationship rather than continuing it.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> It varies between people. Usually what works is some combination of medication, therapy, distraction, and generally taking care of your health (especially diet, exercise, and sleep). 

In my case my depression is always tied to my anxiety - I have extreme anxiety. When it gets bad, I get depressed (because anyone would get depressed when they are living with such extreme fear and stress). So, usually what helps me is working on managing my anxiety and/or keeping myself busy and waiting until any particular thing that is making me more terrified goes away, and then the depression goes away. 

Now that I know enough about myself to know that it WILL go away, it's a lot easier to deal with. When I first started experiencing depression I didn't know that and it was hard. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I never got on very well with my stepfather (not his fault, our personalities just clash) but one thing he did 100% right was that he respected that my mother was a mother first and a partner second. I respect him so much more because of this. If he'd been like your ex-girlfriend, I don't know what I would have done. 

Your ex-girlfriend has no respect for your children or for you. To make this request, she had to disregard what your children want, disregard what you want, and only be thinking of herself and what she wants. The fact that she's blaming YOU for this outcome demonstrates that even more. 

Usually, if someone gives you an ultimatum that boils down to "Choose me or them", the choice always has to be *the person who is not giving an unfair ultimatum*. She's chosen to be the unreasonable one, so it's her own fault. If it was your choice, you'd have chosen to keep both.

<TEXT> Dick size is not a concern that you need to worry about - him having a giant dick is just as likely to be a problem than it is a benefit to her. Either way, she's not likely to leave you for it. (Still, if you're worried about it, think about what might make you feel better so that you can ask for that. For example, maybe if she tells you directly that she likes your dick then you won't worry so much.) If you are worried about it despite trying to resolve it on your own, discuss it with her, but be careful not to make it a competition or to shame or guilt her for it. 

Feeling worried about being disparaged during sex is a different issue. You can discuss that with her and ask what she'll do if he starts with that. Maybe it should be something in your okay-but-prefer-nots? Or a must not? I have found out that for myself, it's a lot easier to keep the relationships healthy if I don't allow potential partners to speak negatively about current partners. It's now a rule, even though my current partners never requested it. 

Even if you don't want to make it a rule between you, I think it's a valid concern that you should discuss. You discussed other ground rules, after all, and I think this is another thing to discuss and communicate about. </TEXT>

I strongly disagree with the idea that we should let people make shitty comments. I agree we shouldn't be upset or waste our lives worrying about it, but responding and then forgetting about it is fine. 

If you let her reach the point where she's consistently rude and bullying, then saying something at that point is way too late because the behaviour has already become "normal".

<TEXT> Well keeping in mind I'm not an expert, the way I'd separate it is that anxiety is extreme worry (to the point that it interrupts your life in some way). 

Paranoia I think is a separate thing that can cause anxiety. Paranoia is the idea that someone/everyone is out to get you, or there's a conspiracy against you, or something like that. Usually it doesn't come with an awareness of reality (i.e. you don't think things like "But I'm exaggerating this"). I guess early stages of paranoia might include that, though? I don't really experience paranoia myself so I'm not 100% sure. 

For me personally, I have extreme anxiety - I get anxious and obsess over pointless things ("What will I say to the person sitting next to me if he asks me for a pen? I better check if I have spare pens. But I don't want to look too obvious while I check, that'd be weird. Or maybe I should just check. Oh no I'm overthinking this. What if he doesn't even want a pen to begin with? What am I even doing in this class if I can't handle sitting next to someone?" .... etc). However I'm always AWARE it's excessive, and I even have like a counter-thought-train running at the same time ("I guess I'd just give him a pen. It's fine to look obvious, everyone checks if they have pens when they come to class. It doesn't matter, stop thinking about it. I just need to relax. Who cares about him anyway?"). 

Your description of your concerns about surveillance sounded very similar to how I get when I'm anxious, except that your anxiety seems to be focused on surveillance and technology instead of on social interaction like mine is. That's really the main reason I said it sounded like anxiety, I recognised it as something that I do. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think a lot of online findoms are, sadly, only in it for the money. They take advantage of subs who are desperate to be dominated (financially or otherwise) and can't find any other way to get what they need. 

The extreme humiliation and playing with difficult topics like homophobia I think comes from the inexperience of the doms involved and the idea that MORE is always better (more extreme, more humiliation, more controversial role-playing), as well as the desire of the subs to "be a good sub" and take whatever is given by their dom (which usually comes from either desperation or inexperience or both). I think it's unlikely that *all* of the subs involved are particularly interested in the extremes like homophobic role-play, though of course there must be some. 

I think that when done correctly, it can be a kink that both parties enjoy, but I am very skeptical of most online findom arrangements. It's a lot easier to fake that sort of relationship and take advantage of someone online. </TEXT>

I think you should visit either a clinical psychologist or a psychiatrist, or, if that seems like too much, then see your GP, and discuss with whoever you see about this intense and irrational fear/worry.

<TEXT> It's impossible to answer this for all poly relationships. For some people, they ARE opening their relationship because their primary relationship is lacking. The important thing to ask yourself is if that is YOUR reason. Is there something wrong with your primary relationship that you're trying to cover up? 

Even if your primary relationship doesn't meet all your needs, it doesn't mean the relationship is a bad relationship. I think part of being poly is defining for yourself what you want and need out of a relationship, and then pursuing that in whatever ways make you and your partner(s) happy. The only people who know if the relationship is good are the people in it. (Or maybe the people closest to them, like a best friend.) 

In the end, I know my relationships are not really what everyone would want. They ARE, however, exactly what I want, and I am very happy with them. That's what matters to me. I'm happy. My partners are happy. What other people think of our relationship isn't really important. </TEXT>

So, either way, I would just wait until another day and then try watching more cool Korean singer videos with her. If you think she'll be open to discussion, you can ask what happened and why she was upset, but it's also probably ok to just ignore it and be like "I guess she was having a bad day" as long as your relationship is still ok in future. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, you can't escape being you. 

Do what you can to make being you more enjoyable. Make time for fun things that make you feel good about yourself (exercise, hanging out with friends, bubble-baths... whatever works for you). 

In the long-term, see if you can find a job where the people you work with are good people (I understand that may be impossible for now, but make it a long-term goal that you work towards). If you're stuck in miserable jobs because you have no skills, look into training opportunities. Even if you have trouble learning new things, there will be training opportunities aimed at people with difficulty learning things. They might be rare or hard to find or difficult to get to, but they *exist*. Find out one that you'd like to do, then find out what you'll need so you can do it, then work on getting those things. It might take a long time, but you can do it. 

For the short-term, a lot of people use drugs or alcohol. Do NOT do that, it will make things worse. 

You could try other forms of escapism, like reading books, or roleplaying online, or joining a community where no one knows the "real" you and you just enjoy it. Those ones are more healthy and worthwhile for you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To me, self-diagnosing DID is wayyyyy more dramatic than just visiting a therapist to talk about how you're doing. 

I honestly think therapy is the right course of action. It's not "drastic", it's pretty mild... you just go and talk about how you're doing and they give you some new ideas or things to think about or techniques to try and then you try it and see if it helps. It's not a big deal. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think you need to think about your audience when you're making those comments, instead of taking it personally.  

In a subreddit about anxiety, maybe they are too anxious to respond. Maybe they are busy fighting with anxiety and don't want to type out a long response to you. Maybe they read your post, appreciated it, and then the thought of getting help overwhelmed them. Maybe they never saw it at all because they panicked and logged out after posting. 

In a subreddit about depression, maybe they are too depressed to respond. Maybe they are busy fighting depression. Maybe they appreciated your post, but can't gather the energy/motivation to type a response to it. Maybe they feel they've already wasted enough of your time. 

In a confession subreddit (or one like this one), people aren't necessarily posting for your input. Maybe they just need to write it down and get it out there. Sometimes a person doesn't want advice in that case, so replying saying "thanks for the advice!" feels fake. Maybe they completely disagree with everything you've said and don't want to be petty and be like "Thanks but nothing you said is right and you're not helping at all". Or, maybe they read and appreciate the advice, but they don't think thanking everyone who gives unsolicited advice is a good idea. 

All of those are subreddit-specific reasons, but there's also reasons like... maybe they got a lot of responses and don't want to reply 20 times saying "Thanks!". Maybe your comment is identical to 5 other people and they've already explained/answered your questions elsewhere and don't want to do it again. Maybe they intend to reply, but get interrupted and forget. Maybe they don't see replying to random reddit people as a priority. 

In short, it's probably not personal. Just relax. No one is an asshole just because they don't thank you for your advice. Your advice should be like a gift - they don't owe you anything in return, and if they do, it's not really a gift. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think you're wrong to interpret it as lenience instead of a different order. If he says "Complete this task before the end of the week or else" then it's an order. It's not lenient. It gives you some agency to decide when it will be done, but because you get that agency, there are consequences attached if you should fail. 

 #x200B;

Adapting the order to suit your sub is a pretty basic Dom thing that he should be doing. I don't think it will take away from his dominance. 

 #x200B;

More specific to your situation though, it sounds like there was just a miscommunication here about what you needed. He thought giving orders would make you feel better but instead it made things worse. You spoke up about it, he changed the order to suit you ... that was exactly what should have happened. I don't think there are any problems here, just that you're still adapting to each other. In future he will probably have a better understanding of what you need, so his orders won't have to be adapted so often. (But there will always be occasional misunderstandings, that's just life.)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're FWBs because you both enjoy hooking up, right? 

So... hook up as much as you want. If he doesn't want to, he'll just say no. If he does want to, great. 

If you're worried he'll feel pressured into it and won't be honest, that is a separate issue. You should address that by making sure he feels comfortable to say no if he doesn't want to do something. 

I would say to just ask him, but I think if you say "Do you ever get bored of us hooking up?" he might interpret that to mean that you ARE bored. So, if you do go ahead and ask him, be careful of how you say it so he doesn't get the wrong impression. (Maybe something like "I want to hook up more but only if you're ok with it")  </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, TRP is just wrong. Just because they have sources doesn't mean their sources are interpreting the evidence correctly. 

Here are some examples of reality that go against TRP ideology: 

* I'm a woman. I love my husband, I make his life better through being with him. He loves me, and he makes my life better through being with me. 
* Relationships are meant to be mutually beneficial and enjoyed by both parties. They are not about taking advantage of one another. 
* There ARE toxic relationships, where the partners don't care about each other, where they are just looking to take what they can get, but most relationships are not like that. Most relationships are about mutual support and love and understanding, and TRP does not allow for that. 
* I, too, believe that men should be able to live their lives as they want, like any other person. I still don't agree that TRP is right. I can believe men deserve good lives without believing that women are the cause of all of their problems. 

TRP takes tiny grains of truth ("Men often are worse off economically after divorce") and twists them into ridiculously untrue things ("All women are gold diggers"). TRP ignores thousands of other interpretations of that grain of truth - for example, maybe they are worse off because women are "supposed" to be the child-rearers, and so they sacrifice their careers to look after the children while the man continues his, and divorce forces the man to continue supporting the mother of his children who has sacrificed her career for the good of their children. (I know this doesn't happen in all cases, but it IS something that happens and is often overlooked or dismissed.) 

They would see what I say above, and they'd say that I don't REALLY "love" him, it's just a manipulation. They'd be wrong. I know how I feel. 

They talk a lot about social value, and about how women will drop a man just to move on to the next one. This is also wrong. I've been married for 10 years. There are multiple long-term relationships that last for people's entire lives! It's not because that 92 year old has a really high social value so his wife never found anyone better. It's because they love each other and they're committed to their relationship. 

Now, if you WERE dating a man who followed RP ideology, then I can understand feeling like a terrible person. TRP thinks women are evil. The solution to that, though, is not to blame yourself. The solution to that is to end the relationship and find someone who treats you like a human too. (If your boyfriend says he loves you and wants to be with you, though, then he's probably not a red piller. Which is a good thing, because those people are not good partners.) 

Remember, going back to the first thing you said: Men should be able to live their lives as they want, and *so should women.* Don't let some rubbish you found on the internet stop you living your life how you want.  </TEXT>

If it's only getting worse, the best option for him may be hospital, even if the hospital is not a very good place.

(I think you should also check to see if there are any better hospitals you could put him in, maybe in a larger city? But I guess since you are in the Philippines, it is possible there may not be a good hospital. I don't know enough about the standard of care there to know.)  </TEXT>

Maybe you should find places that are clothing-optional and spend time there, instead. For example, nude beaches (as you suggested), or sex clubs. You could also try to find someone and get to know them before you get naked with them, so you can be sure they're safe.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maybe, since you're so sure you know you have nothing to worry about, you're not letting yourself feel the fear or doubt so that you can work through it? Like, maybe you \*know\* there's nothing to worry about, but because you know that, you're not allowing yourself to think through a scenario where he IS a better lover, and so you're still afraid of it. Let's say, for example, that he turns out to be a sex god who learns your wife's body better than you do. What happens next? 

If thinking that through doesn't help, it may be something else entirely that is bothering you.

When I'm not sure about my emotions I usually try interviewing myself. I ask questions like "What is the worst possible thing that could happen?" or "When x happened, what did I think?" and then answer them. I ask myself followup questions too (like "Why did you think that?" or "Let's say that that extremely worst thing does happen, then what?" or "You seemed unsure of that last answer, why was that?") 

I usually write that down so I can follow my own thought process but that is unnecessary for some people. 

You could also try writing a stream-of-consciousness letter to your wife (you don't have to send it) where you talk about all of the things you're most afraid of - especially the things that are difficult for you to say out loud, or that make you more emotional. Then read back over it and see if anything you weren't expecting is in there.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'll be honest. Everything you are saying about your relationship makes it sound like a TERRIBLE relationship in terms of trust, mutual respect, communication... 

If I was in your relationship, I would be seriously considering ending things simply because all of those aspects are very important to me and you don't seem to have any of them. 

Since you seem to want to keep your relationship, all I can suggest is that you find a poly-friendly relationship counsellor. They can help you and your partner to communicate better and hopefully that will lead to rebuilding trust and respect between you both.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, the problem is that you can't MAKE her treat you right. That has to be her choice, and she's choosing not to. 

I think you should sit down with her and discuss how the relationship is making you feel, and how the lack of communication is impacting you. Talk about how you both see the relationship progressing - what does she want your relationship to be like in 5 years time? What do you want? 

If she is incapable or unwilling to have that conversation with you, or if your goals do not align and you can't reach agreement, then it might be better to break up with her. Don't let her continue choosing to treat you badly just because you're afraid to start over.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here are some steps for you to follow: 

* Ask a nurse how you can kick him out of the hospital after you break up with him. (If they're busy they may not help much, that's ok, either pick a time they're not busy to ask again, or ask them to get someone else - like a social worker - to talk to you.) Say something like "My boyfriend is abusive and I want to break up with him. Can you help me find a way to get him to leave the hospital safely afterwards? Last time I tried to leave him he became suicidal." 
* Once you have a plan, go to your boyfriend (in a public place where he can't murder you - just in case). Say something like "Boyfriend, I don't think our relationship is working out. I'm breaking up with you. Please don't come near me or Son again." 
* Follow the plan you made with the nurse or social worker to get your boyfriend to leave. 
* Stay with your son. Call your family or friends for emotional support (if you think they will be supportive). 
* Get therapy. (This is probably a low priority right now because your son comes first, but you're dealing with some extremely difficult things here... therapy will help you to process everything in as healthy a way as possible, so once that becomes possible, please try to get some. The nurse or social worker will probably have ideas on how you can access free or low-cost therapy.)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a few ideas but ultimately it's going to be about you trying out lots of different things and finding out what works. Here are my ideas: 

* You could try masturbating while she just keeps you company, touches you in a non-sexual way (e.g. touching your chest), or watches. 
* With regard to porn, you could try being selective about which porn you watch? For example, kink.com porn usually makes sure to emphasise the consent of the people involved and to humanise them by including interviews with the performers (though they do tend to do more kink-related porn, so you may have trouble finding things you like specifically by that studio... I think the idea should carry across into whatever types of porn you do enjoy, though). You could also try non-commercial porn (like /r/gonewild) where you know everyone involved is sharing their bodies just because they enjoy being looked at. 
* You could try a long-term friends with benefits arrangement. That way you'd have a connection with the person you're having sex with, and you can develop a friendship, but it's not a romantic relationship. Obviously there are issues in setting this up, like finding someone who would be interested in this arrangement, and building the relationship, and managing your feelings, but it might be the easiest solution. 
* You could also read up on ethical non-monogamy and polyamory and especially different relationship structures, to see if there are any you might enjoy. Right now it seems like you've only considered two options (indefinitely dating new people, or one night stands). You're imagining that you would be dating and trying to impress people but I don't think that's necessary - you don't need to impress anyone. Be upfront about what you want, meet up with them to discuss how the situation will work, and then try it out. You don't need to court people, just talk to them and make friends (the same way you make regular friends) while being open about what you're looking for. 

 #x200B;

This final idea is more complicated but I will try to explain. Basically, you can separate out what needs are fulfilled by having sex, and then you can try to think of other ways to meet each of those needs separately. For example, some needs that I get fulfilled during sex are: intimacy with my partner; feeling sexually desirable; sharing pleasure with my partner; orgasms; giving sexual pleasure to another person; physical touch; cuddling. If those were your needs (your list might be different or the same, this is just an example) then once you know them, you can come up with different ways to meet each of them, either with your partner, or with others. For example: 

* Intimacy with your partner: You could cuddle by candlelight and share secrets, or personal stories from your past. 
* Feeling sexually desirable: You could post nudes online in appropriate forums (e.g. /r/ladybonersgw)
* Sharing pleasure with your partner: You could masturbate while she holds you, or watches you. 
* Orgasms: masturbate
* Giving sexual pleasure to another person: This is where you *might* have to involve someone else. However, before that you could try offering people something less than direct pleasure (e.g. posting audio files on /r/gonewildaudio) and see if that satisfies this need enough. 
* Physical touch: Hold hands, give hugs. 
* Cuddling: After you masturbate, you can cuddle with her. 

As you can see, most of the needs can still be met by your partner, it's just specific sexual things that you need to find alternatives for. 

 #x200B;

I hope this has at least given you some more ideas to think about. It sounds like your relationship is solid, so I'm sure you'll find a solution that works for both of you. :)  </TEXT>

It sounds like your FWB wants something more serious and long-term but either he thinks he can't get it from you OR he's not interested in it with you. It also sounds like you've talked to your husband and decided your FWB CAN get that serious commitment from you. So, offer it and see what your FWB says. Tell him your feelings, tell him what you want from the relationship, and tell him what you want or need in return.

<TEXT> If it's what you want, I'm sure you can find someone (or multiple someones) who will want it with you. It might take time to find a relationship that works, but being honest about your wants and needs makes it FAR easier. 

I think the poly community is honestly a better place for people who are asexual (if they're comfortable with poly), because there is a built-in understanding that a relationship doesn't have to fulfill ALL your needs, you can get some needs from one relationship and some from another, and enjoy all of the relationships you have. That means that someone might love you, have sexual needs that you can't fulfill (if you are asexual), and they can still be completely fulfilled because they also love someone else who shares that sexual need. 

Even if you're not asexual, I don't see why poly wouldn't work for you. Of course it'll be hard to find the perfect relationship but that's hard for anyone in the world. I think it's at least worth trying :)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> They're viewed negatively because the people viewing project themselves into the relationships they see. For example, I could **never** tell one woman I know (let's call her Elle) I'm poly, because if she was talking about dating a second man, she'd be doing it because she doesn't love the first man anymore. Elle can't understand that when a poly person talks about dating two men, it's because they love BOTH men. 

So, in Elle's mind, that person is just lying to themselves about loving both men. In her mind it is impossible to do that, because she can't. 

I think a lot of the dismissiveness comes from people like Elle, who are unable to accept a reality that doesn't line up with theirs. For me, it's simple. I DO love both men, so I can see it as reality very easily. For people who never experience it, it's impossible to truly know and understand, and so they project their own understandings onto it and make judgements based on things that aren't really true. 

To an extent I think this is true of all emotion-based things (e.g. falling in love, having and raising a child, experiencing depression, losing a loved one). You never really understand it until you've done it. You can read about it and try to prepare yourself, and you can read about everyone else's experiences, and with enough discussion and understanding you might have a good idea about what to expect ... but living it is never the same as you imagine it being, and you still have to predict your emotions based on what you understand from your own reality. 

Poly is different to those examples, though, because most people are very uninformed about poly and how it works. They don't understand it, they don't have accurate knowledge about it, and most have no interest in finding out. That's why the judgement is so harsh. Everyone tries to be kind to those experiencing grief, because we all know we'll experience that ourselves one day (or we already have). People thinking "One day I'll be poly too" is a lot rarer, so people don't seek out information or try to understand it, they just dismiss it. It doesn't matter to them. It's also less common, and usually kept quiet, so people don't learn about it through interaction as easily as they might learn about those other topics. 

I think with greater understanding we can get rid of some of the stigma, but quite honestly, there is no way to erase it entirely. 

If you have any questions about poly, feel free to ask (here or anywhere else), but keep in mind that outside the poly/nonmono community, advice about being poly is probably ill-informed at best and actively malicious at worst.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, that isn't how my body works. Without a vibrator (even if I haven't used it in months) I can cum once or maybe twice, and it takes 20 minutes or more. With it, I can cum over and over, indefinitely, and the first one takes 5 to 10 minutes (though it can be immediate if I'm aroused enough). 

Obviously I'm not going to give that up. Especially because it DOESN'T stop me cumming from the usual ways, which still involve clit stimulation (it does take longer, so there is some slight loss of sensitivity, but honestly... it's worth it). 

Please don't tell me to stop using a vibrator when I know my own body and what works for me. I'm not suggesting you have to use one.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The last example I gave WAS an example about a real person. 

OP didn't say "I invent lies about him and write them down", she said "half the stuff I write isnt even true and its just me being pissed". That sounds far more like my example than yours.

I agree though that if she's inventing lies and writing journal entries like "He punched me in the face" when he didn't, then OF COURSE she needs to stop doing that shit. I just find that very unlikely, given that most people who write untrue things in their journals when they're angry are not inventing lies. 

To me it seems more like you're projecting the actions of this one girl you knew onto OP and then telling OP off for things that the other girl has done.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You are heading for an abusive relationship. He's only going to get worse because he thinks his outbursts aren't a problem. He doesn't care that he scares you. Think about that. Would you ever do something that you knew scared him? Would you ever say that it's "normal" to damage property and scare your partner? Do NOT move in with him. It's definitely not normal. 

Also, read about emotional abuse. It sounds like you might already be experiencing that. 

 #x200B;

If you absolutely must move in with him, make plans to move out if something happens. Imagine it's 3AM and he's angry about something and shouting and screaming and threatening to destroy your belongings (or even hurt you). What do you do next? How do you get out of that with your important belongings and your own safety intact? 

Have separate money that you can access, and that you don't tell him about. Enough to find emergency shelter somewhere he can't find you. (Best case scenario: You never need it. Worst case scenario: You DO need it and don't have it.) 

Know who you can call to pick you up at 3AM if he damages your car/bike/whatever you use for transport and you want to leave. Memorise their number so you can call it even if you don't have your phone. If you don't have anyone, know the emergency police number and think about what you could say. (Remember that if he's really angry, he may hide or damage your wallet or break your phone, so "I'll get an uber" might be Plan A but you definitely need a Plan B that doesn't rely on those things.) 

Memorise other important contact numbers in case he breaks your phone. 

Store important or sentimental belongings somewhere he can't get to them. You know he breaks stuff (even valuable stuff, like his TV) when he is enraged, so don't risk letting him break things that matter to you. 

 #x200B;

Think about what you want in a relationship. Do you want to be shouted at? Do you want a partner with anger issues that scare you? I think a lot of people miss this step when they're choosing a partner, and they just choose the first one who shows them interest. Interest is not enough. Interest is the bare minimum. Just write a list of everything you want in a relationship (don't adapt the list to fit him, but it's ok to look at your relationship with him for inspiration of some things you think are necessities). Then once you've written it, look at everything on the list and group it into two categories. One is things that are the bare minimum in any relationship (should include things like "he cares about me" and "we enjoy spending time together"). The second one is things that you specifically want (might include things like "he doesn't smoke" or "he prefers to stay in and relax rather than go out partying"). Then think about how many of those things your partner meets. ALL partners need to meet ALL the things in the bare minimum category, and any decent partner will meet them easily. It's ok to ignore some of the things in the second category if you decide they're not really important, but if they ARE important, then they can be dealbreakers for a relationship too. 

If your partner doesn't meet your requirements, you **can** break up with him. You don't have to stay with him. You are a strong person and you have survived everything in your life so far, so you can survive a breakup too. (It will be tough at first though, of course.) 

 #x200B;

Finally, see a therapist. Even if you ignore all of the above, PLEASE see a therapist. At the very least they can give you ideas to help your partner with his anger issues.  </TEXT>

If I have a fantasy about punching someone I don't like in the face, that's not a lie. 

If I'm upset and I think something like "He's never going to care about my designer sock habit!", that's not a lie either. 

All of those things meet your definition of "creating something that isn't true", but none of them are lies. The first is meant to appear real, but it's not intended to deceive people, so it's not a lie. The second is a fantasy that's not intended to be shared with anyone nor seen as reality, and it's not a lie either (even if written down in detail in a journal). The third is an emotive statement written while upset, which is what you truly believe in that moment, (even if while calmer you quickly realise it was not a correct belief) so it is also not a lie. 

If OP has written statements like that in her journal, it's completely healthy. They are untrue, but they're not lies.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  This is both of your faults 

Um, no, this is her mother's fault. If I invent random crap and write it in a journal, it's not MY fault that someone else reads it and believes it. It's theirs! It's not like I'm publishing it somewhere people can read it. 

Being angry is a normal and healthy emotion. One completely valid way of managing anger is to write down how you feel, even if it's not something you'd seriously act on or even seriously believe, and then once you've expressed that anger you can go on to choose what your appropriate reaction will be. 

If the things you're thinking are not true and you still write them down, it's not LYING, it's expressing your private thoughts. It's not like OP said "Everything I've written is true!". It was private, and if her mother had respected her privacy, there wouldn't have been a problem at all. 

Journaling is not "acting in this immature fashion". What are you talking about? Adults journal to manage emotions too. Adults also write stories and have fantasies. Expressing those in a healthy format (e.g. in a private journal) is completely normal.  </TEXT>

You're getting wayyyy ahead of yourself here. Calm down. 

99% sure she doesn't have HIV. She should, of course, get tested if she can, but until that happens you are panicking about nothing. Do one step at a time. Offer to take her to a doctor or a sexual health clinic (preferably one that's sex positive and open-minded so she can discuss any sexual health concerns). Don't overdo it, and stop panicking! It's not helping anyone. Remember, having regular casual sex doesn't mean she's being unsafe. Even if she IS being unsafe, she should be able to discuss this with the sexual health clinic or the doctor, it doesn't have to be a discussion she has with you. And it is extremely unlikely she's HIV+ from a few years of casual sex.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> We are not in an unhealthy relationship at this point in time. Anyone  who could see us would think we are perfectly fine. Our child never sees  us fight because we dont.

My parents did this. I had major issues dealing with conflict, because in childhood, I never saw healthy resolution of conflict.

I and my siblings also all have mental health conditions. The most mentally healthy of us is my youngest sister. I think that's because my parents finally divorced while she was still young.

You might think your child can't tell, but it influences things indirectly. Definitely DON'T stay with someone just for the benefit of your child, because she will benefit much more by you being happy and fulfilled and demonstrating healthy relationships and healthy boundaries. One day if you find the right partner, he can even help you model healthy relationship dynamics. Your current partner can't help with that, because your relationship is NOT healthy.

Please, at the very least, consider some therapy to talk about why you're letting your partner treat you like this. You deserve better.

<TEXT> I have had both of my parents introduce me to their new partners and I will share how they did it. I think my dad did a much better job of it, but my mother's approach worked too. 

 #x200B;

With my dad, we were teens/adults at this point but you could possibly adapt this approach for younger children too: 

My dad started by telling us that he had a girlfriend, but that was about it. (At that point they'd already been dating a couple of years, I think? I'm not sure.) 

Then we all of course wanted to know more about her, so we added her on Facebook (to a "test" account that she'd set up especially for this purpose, as we found out later). 

Then once we all agreed she seemed nice, she deleted the test account and added us to the real account. 

Then the next time my dad went to meet up with her (they're long distance), he invited us to go along and meet her too. 

I didn't end up going (unrelated reasons) but my sisters both met her and said she seems great, and I trust their judgement :) 

I have never actually met my dad's partner, though, so I suppose I can't say for sure it was 100% successful. 

 #x200B;

When my mother introduced us to her future husband we were a lot younger (think children/early teens), but this is how she approached it: 

First, she told us she was dating someone, but not much about him. 

Then she let the eldest of us chat with him online (via text) for about 10 minutes while she supervised. 

Then she set up an event that we all went to, including him, but where we (the children) didn't know he was attending. This was partially for his benefit, as he wasn't really good with children and so it was a low-stress way to see how we behave, and partially to set up the next step, which was... 

... her telling us all that he'd been at that event, and he thought we were great kids, and he'd like to meet us properly. 

Then we all went out to a cafe somewhere (I think she bought us a bowl of hot chips and we sat around the table eating them, while she and bf sat at another table nearby with coffee). 

There were also a few events we went to as groups where he bought us presents, which I think was to bribe us into liking him? (Probably an idea they came up with together, not something he'd do on his own.) 

After that she figured the meeting was done and started inviting him around to our house, etc. I think ideally she should have taken more time before this step, but in the end it worked out ok I guess. :)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Do you want to be married to someone who makes those choices? No. That leaves you three options: 

1. He changes his mind. 
2. You change your mind. 
3. Divorce. 

You can't make him change. He doesn't want to change. That leaves only options 2 and 3. 

You don't want to divorce him, so you need to accept he's made up his mind. That means changing your life plans according to this decision: 

* He will likely die before you do. Start accounting for that when you make life plans. 
* If you DO die in a tragic accident, will he be able to look after your child? Account for that in your life plans too. 
* He will likely have health problems that are expensive. Set up a savings account. 
* He will be a bad influence to your child. Account for that when you're planning for your child's health education. 
* He will likely use a larger food/alcohol budget than you do. Plan for that when you're planning your groceries. 
* People with physical health problems are more likely to have or develop mental health problems. Be on the lookout for anxiety and depression, and be aware he might need help with those things. 
* Consider the possibility that he continues to gain weight. Decide in advance what you will do about that, and if there is a maximum level of obesity that you will not tolerate. 

I think, also, you should consider if you and your husband have different values. For example, my husband also has health problems, and he doesn't always manage them perfectly either. We have talked about it a lot, though, and I accept when he says that his life wouldn't be enjoyable to him if he didn't have a certain amount of freedom in what he chooses to do. An extra 10 years of misery isn't worth making his whole life miserable. So we accept the increased risk, while still trying to *reduce* the risk that he does have. Eating bad food, occasionally, is definitely not good for him. However, the trade-off is greatly increased enjoyment of life, and we accept that trade. He also tries to eat more healthy food than he used to, which is part of reducing the risk. 

Maybe (if you can get your husband to discuss it with you), you could try making very minor changes to improve his health. Instead of "Quit drinking", you could say "Switch to a different drink with lower calories". Or "Keep most of the alcohol out of the fridge so you can only drink a certain amount before you have to stop." This is obviously not a perfect solution, but a small change is better than nothing, and small changes can be built on to achieve larger changes (e.g. once he's switched to drinking a drink with lower calories and that doesn't bother him anymore, he can make another small change and start alternating his low-calorie drink with glasses of water). And at that point he's drinking a lower-calorie drink and he's drinking less overall and that is a big reduction in his alcohol intake. For my husband and I in trying to eat healthier this has been very effective. Neither of us are really into diet or exercise, but looking at what we already do and changing it slightly to be more healthy has worked pretty well.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not sure if this answer is exactly what you're looking for, because I don't think our relationship was ever damaged by my behaviour (thankfully my husband is not a jealous person), but I'm answering anyway because I did struggle with having feelings for other people. 

I would keep finding myself in situations where I'd go RIGHT UP to the boundary of emotional affair, and then have to stop, and leave whoever I was talking to disappointed and myself unhappy because I'd want to go further but I'd have to stop because it was "wrong". (My husband was never really involved in these situations, because he knew I was following our agreed boundaries and that was all he cared about.) I thought for a while that that was fine, because I was following the boundaries I'm supposed to follow, but after it had happened a few times I realised it wasn't really the right way to do things. Even if my husband didn't mind, it was a weird way of approaching boundaries to have them enforced to the letter, but in spirit they felt broken (to me) because the ONLY thing stopping me was that I had told him I wouldn't, and I had no personal desire to stop at all. It was making me miserable and it felt unfair to my husband too, even though he never had a problem with it when I would ask him. 

It took a lot of soul-searching and uncertainty about what I want and need. But, now I'm poly. 

We had a lot of discussions about what it would mean for us, and if it changed how I felt about him. (The answer to those questions is "Nothing, except I will spend time with other people sometimes so you might have to be alone for a few hours sometimes" and "I still feel exactly the same about you, or maybe I love you even more now")

I am a lot happier, and (thankfully) my husband is happy with our new normal way of doing things too. :)  </TEXT>

If you're in Oregon (I snooped your post history and saw a post from Oregon), this page might help: [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists/video-counseling/oregon?sid=5ca0a3739ffb3 spec=15](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists/video-counseling/oregon?sid=5ca0a3739ffb3 spec=15) I selected therapists that do video counselling (because you said remoteness is an issue) and that treat OCD (since you said that's her most accurate diagnosis so far). If you're not in Oregon you'll have to do the selection yourself after selecting your state from the previous link.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  My house flooding isn't a serious concern either but I still have flood insurance. 

Yeah, if you live somewhere it might flood. If you don't, then you don't have flood insurance, because it's such a minimal concern you don't need it. 

Said the extremely privileged dude behind his keyboard. 

My point is that IF you live in a society where you need a gun in your bedroom, then it makes sense to have one. 

If you live in the sort of society I live in, where a burglar killing you is a remote possibility, then it doesn't make sense. 

That's why I asked you where you live. There are some societies (or areas, or cultural groups, or whatever) that do have legitimate problems with safety of their citizens. It makes sense that those people would want a gun. 

On the other hand, I don't think that someone who lives in a safe society where home invasion and murder is extremely unlikely needs to be worried about it to the point they have a gun. You said it's a remote possibility and not a serious concern, so I assumed you live in one of these safer societies too. Maybe that was wrong and you do have legitimate reason to fear being murdered by a home invader.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Do you carry your loaded gun in the street at all times? Or while grocery shopping? I mean, there's a possibility you could be attacked in those places too. I would say it's even MORE likely you'd be attacked while grocery shopping - there are a lot more people around. But you weigh up the chances and you decide it's worth the minimal risk of going grocery shopping. I weigh up my chances and decide that the advantages of having less guns in society outweigh the minimal risk of not allowing everyone in society to keep a gun in their nightstand on the off-chance they get murdered by a burglar. 

If you can't feel safe *at home* then there's something wrong. 

If being murdered by a burglar is not a serious concern, then I don't understand why you'd need a gun in your nightstand to shoot this hypothetical burglar.

<TEXT> I read this, and honestly, it reads like you DO want a partner. You're happy by yourself, and I'm not arguing with that, but you can be happy by yourself and still want a partner. 

Also, 25 is a ridiculously young age to write yourself off. If you want to date someone (even if you'd be happier with a casual relationship instead of a serious commitment) then go ahead and try it out. I met my current boyfriend when I was 27. All that stuff about "I'll never be a person that someone else cares about" - that's negative self-talk, it's ridiculously untrue, and you deserve to treat yourself better than that. 

I think maybe you should talk about this with your therapist, because being single at 25 is not a big deal and you're blowing it out of proportion because you're not letting yourself feel it or talk about it. It's NOT immature to feel bad about not having a partner, and it's NOT embarrassing to be single at age 25. No one is going to mock you for it. You deserve happiness, and for a lot of people that includes a partner, even if (like you) they aren't sure what role in their life that partner will take.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> No... you came here asking their opinions and they are giving them. No one here wanted a debate to begin with except you. 

I'm reading all the things you say, but there hasn't been a convincing argument. Your arguments have been: You personally want a gun and therefore you should be allowed to have one, you don't believe gun deaths are related to access to guns, and you'd prefer if you could fight a home invader to the death before letting him steal your possessions. 

For me to decide I was wrong about this issue, I'd have to see that relaxing gun laws will NOT lead to increased mass shootings, increased accidental shooting injuries (especially to children), increased suicide deaths, or increased amounts of minor criminals (e.g. druggies stealing shit) using guns. There are probably other issues too, but those are the first ones I think of.

<TEXT> It becomes unattractive when they're doing those things to BUY love. I think if you're just giving because you enjoy giving, it's fine. It's when you start to give to "even the score" or to make her "owe" you that it becomes unattractive.

For example, if you shout at her, then you think "that was bad, -5 points to me" and so you buy her flowers and give yourself +10 points so you're coming out ahead, and you can even shout at her again now!

Or if you buy her gifts because you want her to think "He bought me those flowers, now I CAN'T say no to that thing he wants"

It's also unattractive if it's all one-sided. For example, if she's not interested, or she doesn't like the gifts but you keep throwing them at her.

What you describe (giving gifts because you love her and want her to be happy) is completely normal and will never lose attractiveness. It sounds really sweet and I'd be so happy to receive those. I guess the only time I'd worry about it is if it's excessive (like if you can't afford it, or if I start to EXPECT you to cover paying for stuff, then I'd probably talk to you about giving me a little less). Buying presents for someone you love is cute, though. Don't stop doing that. I hope she's showing you how much she loves you in return, too (either through gifts or in other ways). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think you should think about how you frame things. Maybe focus more on the depression side of things (like "For a long time now, I've been feeling pretty depressed"), then mention "I have been feeling suicidal" (like "I have been having symptoms for several years, including feeling suicidal, and recently it's been getting worse") so that they understand it's serious and you need help. If you want, you can mention the previous suicide attempts, but I think it might alarm people so up to you if you want to include that. 

The thing to realise is that they WILL be worried about you, because they care about you, but worry is normal and not harmful. A harmful way to approach it would be if (for example) you go into details about your previous suicide attempts. Mentioning them is fine, but details can be distressing and harmful. 

It will probably also be good if you have specific things you want your friends to do. For example, "Can you guys help me to get professional help?" or "Can you check on me every few days so I know I'm not alone?" 

If you're having trouble starting the conversation, you could send them a text telling them you have something serious to discuss and invite them over, and that way they'll be expecting something. If you're having trouble getting the words out, you could also try writing a letter and giving it to a friend.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Is there a therapist she trusts or that she can see quickly? If she has one, she should arrange an emergency appointment with them. 

If she doesn't, you should look up if there is a mental health number you can call (either for advice, or in a crisis). Also keep the suicide hotline on hand just in case. You may not need to call any of these numbers but if you DO need them it will be good to have them in advance. 

She needs some self-care. What are things that make her feel good? Can she do more of those things? Can she do them EVERY DAY? If I'm having a bad week I like to go out to a movie with my husband, or eat some chocolate icecream and play video games, or maybe just take a really long shower and cry. Whatever she needs that will help her to take care of herself (as long as it's safe - she should avoid self-harm, obviously). 

When is she going back to work? Is she suspended indefinitely? Once she gets back to work I think she'll be happier, but if it's an indefinite suspension then she needs another plan. 

There is nothing you can do about the cat other than to look for it and hope you find it. Keep looking, but don't make that your only plan with no plan b. 

You should make a plan with your girlfriend about what she will do if she thinks she's going to hurt herself. You should be honest about your concerns (say things like, "I am worried you might hurt yourself if I leave you alone.") but also be willing to listen to her response. You can also ask questions, like "What can we do to make sure you stay safe?" Have some suggestions, but be open to anything she says too.

<TEXT>  I prefer to just deal with things 

What are your plans to deal with this, though? It sounds like so far your plan has been "Ignore it" and I don't think that will resolve anything (judging from your post it's actually getting worse?). 

You don't have to tell anyone but I don't think ignoring it is a viable solution either. Maybe you can look up CBT workbooks online and try working through one of those? Or maybe if there's someone you trust (like your gf?) you could talk it over with them and come up with a plan to deal with it better.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Everyone comes across different life events at different times (losing a loved one, relationships failing, experiencing a traumatic event, financial issues, having children, mental health conditions, physical health conditions...) and as a teenager if you've already experienced 4 or more of those it means you've had a tough life. As a 75 year old, you've probably experienced all of them and more, and that's normal. That means that the older you get, the more life experience you have, and all that life experience shapes your opinions and changes how you approach situations. A teenager might have a lot of life experience *for a teenager* but it will still be less than average for someone who has lived for twice as long. 

I don't doubt that your approach to some things is more mature than many adults (there are a LOT of idiots out there), but when people talk about 'maturity' they often actually mean life experience, which is impossible to get without having lived longer.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> He started trying to get me to submit before we'd even spoken. I said "I know a bit about that" and he started explaining about how he only speaks to "women who are strong enough to submit" (red flag) and that even with those that are just friends he "needs" certain things (red flag) and that one thing he never allows "his" women to do is to say the word 'no' (ffs, red flag). Then he almost stopped speaking to me entirely when I refused to agree to his not-saying-no rule (red flag again, rules should be negotiated, not forced upon you). 

Somehow I got past all of those and thought "He's an ok guy. He's just inexperienced and naive." I told him I had no interest in being his sub, and he had no business giving me rules. All was fine for about a week. 

Then he started insisting I call him 'Master' and say 'Yes Master' whenever he commanded. (red flag again). I said no, and he threw a tantrum and refused to speak to me at all except to repeat the same thing (I don't know the exact words, something like "We can only talk if you'll consider my needs.") THAT was the red flag that made me end that relationship, but honestly ... there were soooo many that I overlooked and could have saved me the month or so of speaking to this guy.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It depends what area you're trying to get into. If you want to work in a warehouse carrying stuff around, or if your English is pretty good and you want to work in retail, then you'll probably get a job fairly easily. If you want to work in a more skilled role then you will need relevant qualifications and experience and it will probably be more difficult than wherever you are from, because you won't have local experience and the work culture will be slightly different to what you're used to. I don't think this will *prevent* you finding a job, but it might make it more difficult. 

We are pretty used to foreigners though so it definitely won't be impossible.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had one friend recently tell me that it's kind of slutty to have a second partner, and that my relationship with my husband is probably failing if I need to have a relationship with someone else. 

It was pretty upsetting. But, the way I decided to handle it was to focus on how she must not understand my relationship dynamics at all, and to remember she's coming from a place of ignorance. She's not trying to be malicious. 

Then, I continued to be honest about my situation. Not like shoving it in her face all the time, but if we were having a conversation about relationships I'd continue to mention both of mine. And I was patient and answered her questions whenever she had them, and I politely corrected all the misconceptions she came up with - like when she said I must love my husband less, I'd just be like "No, I love him just as much as I always did, and now I love my boyfriend too." I think she still doesn't understand it AT ALL, because she's extremely monogamous, but she's a lot more accepting now. I am hoping that in time she will understand even further, but for now at least she isn't being judgemental anymore. 

I think you should do something similar... ride out the judgement, let it happen, correct any misconceptions, and be patient. Remember people who care about you are probably confused and misinformed, not malicious. They still care about you even if they don't understand this new information they're getting.  </TEXT>

I think it's probably true that people are more forgiving of women, though.

<TEXT> You know your husband has feelings. This can't be a shock revelation to you. He loves you! 

He just *broke* because he's under enormous stress and he's been trying to hold it together for you, and you told him he doesn't care at all and left. 

He's probably terrified that he's fucked up completely, and doesn't know what to do, because his usual way of coping is to hide how he's feeling and hold it together for you. 

You need to give him other options. For example, "I need to cry now and I want you to hold me. It should take about 20 minutes, but if I continue holding you longer then please let me without interrupting. When it's finished, I will feel better and I can continue being strong." 

You should also be very clear and direct about how you're feeling. For example, "When I can't cry with you, I feel like you don't care. I know you love me, but it is very hard to deal with that in addition to everything else." 

If you think he'll be open to it, I agree that couples counseling will help, but he may not like it because it will involve a lot of emotional vulnerability. I don't know whether it's a valid option for your relationship or not. 

Nothing that's happened is your fault, and it won't destroy your relationship. It's a blip. It's tiny. Hopefully it will be a turning point that lets you both understand each other better and communicate better. Don't blame yourself for it, just think about what needs to happen to reconnect and make your relationship stronger.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can understand how it might be disturbing to you that someone has a sexual fantasy about something so traumatic to you. 

I think the important thing to remember is that a fantasy is not the same as the reality, AT ALL. Like you pointed out, if both people are consenting it's not real rape. It's more like a roleplay scenario... just like people who roleplay Teacher/student or Doctor/patient, it's not that they think it's cool for teachers or doctors to take advantage in real life, but they still enjoy pretending. 

Obviously, for you, you're not going to find rape fantasies appealing. So all you can do is just accept that some people are into rape fantasies, and you're not, and that's ok... everyone has different sexual preferences. 

To give another example... I, personally, am not into feet at all but I know there are lots of people who are and I just accept that. They are welcome to it, because it makes them happy, and I will keep away from it, because I don't enjoy it. I think you will have to adopt a similar approach here - the person you know has a sexual interest that you don't share (for good reason), and that's ok. They can still be a good person, just not the right person for you to have a sexual encounter with. 

**Now I'm going to talk a bit about why people might be interested in rape fantasies, but if you think it might be triggering for you it's ok to stop reading right here.** 

I think a lot of people enjoy the fantasy that someone wants them SO MUCH that they can't resist taking them right there, without regard for their well-being. That can make people feel sexy. 

Some people enjoy feeling powerless, or overwhelmed, so aggressive or rough sex (like what might happen during rape-fantasies) will appeal to those people too. 

Some people are also aroused by pain or fear, which are obviously very common in rape fantasies. 

Some people might like the idea that they don't have to make any decisions about the situation, or that they don't have any control. 

Some people just enjoy more roughness during sex, and rape fantasies are an extension of that. 

Some people want to re-enact their own rape in a controlled environment. 

Everyone's sexuality is slightly different, so they might have any of those reasons, or all of them, or maybe none of them and something else entirely. I think if this person is very close to you, you could try asking them what they get out of their rape fantasy (but be prepared that you may not be comfortable with the answer).  </TEXT>

Following from that, I'd lay out the things that you've noticed, and ask her if she's ever considered that he might be abusive. And maybe have a checklist or something ready that you can fill out with her. Also give her resources (like a hotline number, a website she can check out, a list of people she can call for help if she needs to get out, etc).

What she does after that will be up to her.

<TEXT> I think you should sit down with him and discuss where you want the relationship to go, and what your ideal relationship looks like (including division of chores, finances, who you live with, how often you have guests, how much time spent together and apart, etc). Ideally you would have discussed this BEFORE moving in with him, but since you haven't, you should discuss it now. 

It sounds like your living situation is not ideal, but it's also very similar to the situation I was in when my husband and I first got married (which was right after he moved here, after we met online and had 2 years of LDR). It's not impossible to overcome. You need to speak to him and agree on what your goals are and what you're working towards together, because your shared goals seem to have ended now you achieved "live together" and you need to think about what comes next. 

For little things, like washing dishes, you need to discuss and agree what constitutes "washed". Then as long as he meets that standard, they're washed. Don't expect him to know how, but don't take over and do it for him either. Be willing to teach him. You're older and have been living independently for longer, I'm guessing, so a lot of this stuff will be better once he knows how to do it. (I had to teach my husband how to do chores too.) 

If you're not into sex, and he is, that's going to make everything more difficult. You need to think about how you're going to manage that hurdle, too, because that in itself might be enough to end your relationship. 

I don't think anything here is unsalvageable, but I do think you're getting overwhelmed and you need the support of your partner here if the relationship is going to continue. For that, you need to talk to him and find some mutual goals to work on. 

If you can't bring yourself to care, then it's fine to just give up and go home. That's a valid choice too. You don't have to force a relationship if you don't think it's worth it.  </TEXT>

The membrane and opening CAN tear during intercourse, but it's not normal. Usually that only happens if the woman is not lubricated enough, or if the sex is extremely rough (which is why if a woman has been raped, one thing they take note of is vaginal tearing). If there is pain, it's better to stop and add lubricant or even change to another activity.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Increasing the speed is normal in sex. You start slow, and each thrust feels good, and then you want to feel more good, so you speed up as much as you can to sustain the good feeling. The movement is the most enjoyable part, so everyone wants to keep moving. 

The woman is not in pain because sex is not painful for most people. The vagina is lubricated so the penis slides smoothly (and if the vagina doesn't produce enough natural lubricant for it to be comfortable, using store-bought lube is fine too). Usually if I have a penis inside me, I can feel it, but it's not painful. For example, if you put something in your mouth, you can feel the thing in your mouth, but it's not painful. It's the same with the vagina (of course not EXACTLY the same, but similar). 

I don't know about the speed. Maybe you're right and in the video it was as fast as it gets. To be honest, during sex I'm not really paying a lot of attention to how it looks to other people because I am focused on the sensations and pleasure instead.  </TEXT>

15:47 to 15:51 looked like a slow/gentle speed, 15:51 to 15:55 looked like an average speed to me. 

Hard and fast involves being slammed into the bed on every thrust (which is enjoyable to both people). 

Since you (possibly) have vaginismus, it makes sense that you would be disturbed by normal depictions of sex, because penetration for you is painful rather than pleasurable. Definitely don't have sex in a "normal" way just to make your partner happy - only do it if YOU enjoy it too.  </TEXT>

Why do you think penetration will be painful? Is there a reason you're ignoring the suggestion to see a gynaecologist?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not painful, it's enjoyable. 

If it DOES cause you pain, you shouldn't hide that, you should stop your partner so that he doesn't hurt you. Sex is about shared pleasure. 

Men can have orgasms lots of ways. If penetrative sex causes you pain, you should be with a man who enjoys orgasms in other ways that are enjoyable to both of you (for example, handjobs). And you should also see a gynaecologist to discuss the pain and see if there is a solution for it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sit her down and thank her for her love and support. Talk about how lucky you are to have a friend like her who would stand up for anyone they see being abused. Talk about how upset she must have been when she thought you were being hurt, and how you understand where she was coming from when she contacted your boyfriend. 

Then tell her, very clearly, that you are NOT being abused, and she needs to leave your boyfriend alone. Go over the whole cupboard event with her. Talk about how your boyfriend reacted when you walked into the cupboard. Then thank her, again, for being so kind, and repeat that nothing happened. 

If she's still not convinced, I guess you could just ask her what WILL convince her. She is over-reacting, but I think approaching this from a place of understanding will be better than defensiveness. Defensiveness will just reinforce what she's already thinking.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Like I said, faster thrusting causes more intense sensations, which leads to orgasm more quickly. I guess some people would prefer to draw it out and take longer, and in that case they would not enjoy fast thrusting. 

Whether the man enjoys faster thrusting more or not will depend on the individual man, but I'd say as a general rule most people (including women) prefer the speed of thrusting to increase over time, and most men prefer to go very fast just before they reach orgasm - part of that is instinctive, and part of that is because it feels good.  </TEXT>

If you're telling him you need attention, and he's not hearing you, then you need relationship counselling. 

He needs to fit his gaming around other commitments. He DOES fit it around work, but he needs to fit it around all the other important things in his life too (i.e. spending time with his wife). If he can't do that, he is addicted.

<TEXT> You need to separate the situations. There is a lot to unpack here, but the issues that transfer are not really about M or P. 

I think you need to address several issues: 

* Your husband doesn't ask your permission before sleeping with someone, even though that's what you request. You need to renegotiate this to be something that you both feel is reasonable, and that he will ACTUALLY DO. Even if it's just something like "Hey, wife, I think at some point in the future I will want to have sex with this person" so that you have some warning. 
* Your husband pressures you into having sex with him and others, even when you express that you're not ready to. This was a *disaster* with P because you weren't even interested in having sex with P to begin with. It is less of a disaster with M, because at least you like her, but he still shouldn't be pressuring you. You need to discuss this with him, and encourage him to respect your boundaries and find better ways to discuss future relationships. 
* I think you and your husband need to acknowledge that when you live with someone, you end up having sex with them (or at least your husband does). There's nothing wrong with that if everyone is consenting, but it's something you need to consider when you invite someone to live with you. 
* P reacted very badly to everything, but M is a different person who has experience in an open relationship herself and will hopefully better understand how your relationship works. I don't think you should assess the situation with M while assuming she will respond the same way as P (though your concerns are still valid concerns, and should be discussed thoroughly with both your husband and M before any relationship begins). 
* Since your husband has already gone ahead and started a relationship with M, these talks need to happen: 
   * What happens when you're all sleeping in the same bed and they want to have sex? 
   * What happens if the relationship breaks down? Will M move out? 
   * What happens if the relationship between M and yourself progresses to a more serious relationship? 
   * What are the conditions you need to feel safe beginning a relationship with M? 

I hope you can sort through this, it sounds like a very complex situation.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think I would lead up to it gradually... and frame it carefully.

For example,

"Hey, I know you met my ex and really liked him" (this gives context. expect a response like "oh yes he was lovely" and "where is he?" Keep in mind that you don't HAVE to answer the questions, you can just ignore them and keep talking. 

"and I liked him to begin with too, but then... he got less nice" (this explains the new context, and prepares them that there is bad news. expect responses like "oh no!" or "what happened?" or, possibly, "I'm sure he didn't mean it")

"In fact, after we broke up, he sexually assaulted me multiple times" (this is the bad news - I have toned it down here to be JUST the sexual assault, but if they don't ask follow-up questions, you can share additional details here if you want to. Expect responses like "oh no!" and hugs and questions about what he did, if he did anything else, how it happened, what you're doing about it, and how you're staying safe now to make sure it can't happen again)

Be prepared that your parents might want you to take legal action. Be ready to explain to them why you're not doing that, and what the best outcome for YOU is, so that they can support you to get it.

I hope everything works out for you. I'm sure your parents will want the best for you and love you, and hopefully be a source of strength for you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can't watch the video at the moment, because it sounds like it involves some pornographic content and I'm not somewhere I can watch that. 

However, I will say that as arousal builds during sex it is normal for both partners to move faster. As long as the woman is suitably aroused first, faster thrusting can be very enjoyable for her too. Faster thrusting usually leads the man to orgasm sooner, and creates more intense sensations (for both partners). 

Being tense would spoil sex for me - it would cause pain and then I couldn't actively enjoy sex. I think tension should be avoided. The man will enjoy sex just fine either way - in fact I find partners enjoy themselves MORE when I am actively enjoying sex. If they thought I was in pain, that would spoil it for them (and I encourage all women to have sex with men who would stop if they were in pain).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Men CAN thrust hard or fast, but it's optional. Some men prefer slow and sweet sex as well (and of course you get some say in it too - if you want to go slower you can always say so). 

If you feel your fingers "hitting a wall" it sounds a little like vaginismus - have you looked at the symptoms of that? 

If it's cervical pain it should be easy to avoid during sex, though. In certain positions the penis doesn't penetrate as deep, so you can just use those positions with your partner and it should stay enjoyable.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I meant that all vaginas are still enclosed areas of flesh and heat and wetness, which will feel good (to the man) when around a penis. Also, how "tight" a vagina feels is adjustable - like, women can do kegels to make it feel tighter. So it's not a thing to worry about unless it's TOO tight and causing pain. 

Is the pain you feel coming from the entrance of the vagina or is it from further in where your fingers are reaching to? If it's further in I guess it could be from the cervix. (Also, if it's the cervix, it should be less painful if you insert your fingers at another angle so they don't reach the cervix, or if you push them to the side of the painful area. It should also hurt less at varying times in your cycle, as your cervix is higher or lower, and more or less sensitive, at different times.)

<TEXT> Your vagina is not working correctly if it causes you pain to insert two fingers. You should speak to a gynaecologist about this. 

I enjoy penetrative sex. I have a vagina. It is definitely not only for the man's pleasure. If you meet a man who believes this, or who tries to take pleasure while you are in pain, please don't have sex with him. 

Here are all your questions answered one by one: 

  Is having a tight vagina good?

Not really. As you've discovered, it causes pain if it's overly tightened. (All vaginas are "tight" to some extent, it's not a thing you need to worry about.) 

  Is it good for the person with the  vagina to be tense and scared during intercourse? 

Fuck no. Why would you want to do that? I don't enjoy being tense and scared, that would make sex unenjoyable for me. And it would make it unenjoyable for my husband too, because he wants me to be happy and feel pleasure with him. 

 Am I hitting my  cervix?

If the pain was due to you hitting your cervix, you would be able to stick your fingers in comfortably, and it would only hurt when you push them in deeper and poke something inside you.  

 Does a tight vagina feel better to the penis than a relaxed  vagina? 

I don't know, I don't have a penis, but I assure you that my vagina being relaxed seems to have given all of my partners plenty of pleasure. 

 Does the orgasmic platform make the vagina tighter? 

I've never heard of this 'orgasmic platform' before, but according to Wikipedia it does swell while aroused and make the vagina feel tighter. 

 What is  the evolutionary purpose of the orgasmic platform? 

I don't know. Again, according to Wikipedia, it contracts during orgasm and its swelling is due to "narrowing and extension of the sheath" which I guess promotes orgasm of the male and allows the female to feel pleasure. 

 Why is the orgasmic  platform called the orgasmic platform? 

I assume, again based on Wikipedia, that it's because it is engaged during orgasm. 

 Can an orgasm result from the  vagina alone?

For some women yes. For me, no. It has to include clitoral stimulation, which is pretty normal. However (at least in my case), penetration increases the intensity of the orgasm. 

  Is it true that vaginal intercourse or other vaginal  entry is often more about male sexuality and sexual pleasure than it is  about women's sexuality and pleasure? Thats a quote from this article:  [http://www.scarleteen.com/article/advice/i\_didnt\_feel\_a\_thing\_with\_fingering\_is\_there\_something\_wrong\_with\_me](http://www.scarleteen.com/article/advice/i_didnt_feel_a_thing_with_fingering_is_there_something_wrong_with_me)  

I think that is ridiculous. I love being penetrated. I think if you're ONLY focusing on sexual pleasure, many women enjoy other aspects of sex more (like oral sex, or clitoral stimulation), but that doesn't mean that penetration is only pleasurable for the man. 

 I ask these last two question because the quote referenced in the  previous question makes me wonder about these things. My vagina is a  source of more pain than pleasure.  Is the vagina supposed to be  sensitive to pain and numb to pleasure? 

No. If yours is, please see a gynaecologist. 

 Does the vagina just exist to  pleasure the penis? 

No. I use mine to pleasure myself without any penises being involved at all.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In mine (we were grade 11) we started off with a writing task - she gave us three items and we had to write a very short (like 500 words or less) story that included those items. Then she got people to volunteer to read their stories out. 

Later, we would read and examine different writing techniques. e.g. one week we were focusing on "poetry", so the first class we looked at Dr Seuss and other poetry that used nonsense words, then had to write a short nonsense-word poem... then the next class we looked at free verse, had to write a short free verse poem... next class, we looked at strict-format poetry with rhyming schemes, then we all wrote a poem in a set format - I think it was the 'cinquain', and then at the end of the week (or maybe the next week, not sure) we had to submit one of the poems we'd written for assessment 

We did similar things with different forms of writing. Like, there was one week on "writing from unusual perspectives", one week on different character voices (through word choice, or sentence structure, or the things they pay attention to in the text), one week on dialogue, etc. And at the end of each week we had to write a piece that was in some way related to what we'd learned that week (most of these were not assessable, but we did share them with other students in small groups so there was motivation to complete them still). We would also be encouraged to share them with the class or read them out loud, but it was always on a voluntary basis. 

At one point we talked about using pseudonyms and we had to write a piece that would be hung on the wall of the classroom, but it would only have a pseudonym attached and not our real name. (This is because a lot of people were afraid of sharing their work and she wanted to give us the opportunity to share, but without the risk.) 

At the end of the class we had to submit a portfolio of the top 3 pieces we'd written, which WAS assessable. We were allowed to edit and improve them if we wanted to but they had to be recognisably the same piece.  

I loved the class. I think it helped that she was SO enthusiastic about our writing (individually), and she truly believed we were all very talented and our writing was wonderful. She set up individual consultations with students just to discuss how we felt about the class, about our writing, and to give individualized face-to-face feedback. She was a very good creative writing teacher.  </TEXT>

If your needs are not being met then it may be necessary to end your relationship, so I'd definitely take the approach of sharing your needs first. Hopefully, she's going to care about how you're feeling, and she's going to care that your needs are not being met. Then she'll make changes to make you feel better, and to meet your needs. (If she doesn't care about your feelings and needs, that may be a sign your relationship is in trouble.)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think that if you're worried about messing up, a good way to start is just a full-body massage. Tell him you think touching him sexually MAY be part of that, but it may not. 

Then... take your time. Get him naked, lie him down, touch him all over... explore and have fun. If you start getting nervous, go back to massaging his shoulders, or his back. Then when you're ready you can creep lower and touch more. Even if you don't touch him sexually at all the first time, you can try it again another time and do more when you're ready. 

Don't feel like you have to rush. Sex is normal, but it's also normal to take your time (especially when it's your first time). Take your time and enjoy it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're throwing money into a bottomless pit. She has no plan to fix her debt, she has no income, throwing money at this will NOT HELP. 

It might feel heartless (she will definitely accuse you of it) but you can't keep giving her money that she throws away, and you DEFINITELY shouldn't help her take on more debt by buying her a car! 

You're not selfish or uncaring, you are in fact TOO caring, and you're letting her take advantage of your overly generous nature. 

Stop helping her. She's certainly not helping you.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would ask your boyfriend what he expects you to do. Does he want you to just IGNORE that your food is going missing, even though you don't have the money for that? Does he want you to keep a thorough accounting of every item alco-friend steals? Accepting $20 is not a problem, the problem is that this guy is stealing your food. 

I would definitely start keeping a thorough accounting, and I'd send the friend the bill. If he doesn't pay, I'd go to your bf with the bill and have another discussion about getting the friend to move out. 

I'd also include in the bill a fee for the inconvenience of having to repurchase groceries, as well as the price of petrol/travel to the store. 

Finally I'd also include interest for the days he doesn't pay, and that way if necessary you can "negotiate" with your bf and pretend you're being nice by removing the interest from the bill.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> What if you get PPD? Should you just give up your children? 

What if you have a chronic mental health condition, but you're managing it as best you can? Should you not have children? 

I feel like this post is extremely misguided. I HAVE a chronic mental health condition, and I'm currently not well enough to have children, and I agree people should not have children when they know they will be unable to care for them. That's why I'm not. But no one can GUARANTEE their mental health, and I think even if you have a mental health condition, if you're managing it effectively, and you know you could care for a child properly, then you should be able to have children. A child seeing a parent have a problem is not a disaster, as long as they ALSO see that the parent is managing their problem and giving the child the love and support they deserve.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If your SIL has no tact in how she phrases things, have you tried being tactless in return? For example "It's not nice to expect us to wait for hours when we've already done what was agreed by driving you here. You need to arrange your own way to get home." or "It's rude to say bad things about me and it upsets me. Please don't say that again." 

It COULD just be that your SIL doesn't understand social rules and so if you make what you want clear, it will work better. (Of course, if she understands them perfectly and just doesn't care, then it might be better to just refuse to spend time with her.) 

This still doesn't solve the problem with your MIL and FIL though because if SIL reports back what you've said, they may take offense on her behalf. Honestly, I wouldn't worry too much about that, but you could ask your husband to talk to them about it if you think it will be an issue.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I guess instead of trying to explain that it's wrong, you could try asking him to explain why he thinks it's funny. What part does he think is funny? How does the "joke" work? 

If the extent of the "joke" is "It's the n word! It's funny!" then maybe he should come up with a new word. He can call people dickfaces instead. (You can worry about his terrible sense of humour later.) 

If you've already tried those things, or if he's not willing to discuss this and he just wants to keep using racial slurs, then yeah I'd break up with him ... a guy who doesn't care what his girlfriend thinks of him is not worth your time. (Also, he keeps using racial slurs.) 

Even if you decide to stay with him because you think he'll change, you should put limits on it. Work out where your boundaries are. For example, maybe you'll leave if he uses the n-word two more times (obviously don't tell him about this, just count it for yourself). Or maybe you'll leave if he's still saying it in three months time. Pick a boundary, and enforce it. He needs to stop using the n word and you need to follow through with your boundaries because otherwise they're not boundaries at all.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a large age gap with one of my partners and I think one thing we've both become more aware of is that ... he has a LOT more life experience than me. He treats me with respect, and we are equals in our relationship, but sometimes his life experience just means he is so much more on top of a situation than I am. We don't have a problem with that, but for some people that would create some power imbalances, and some insecurities, and it's definitely a thing you have to be aware of in the relationship. It means sometimes he has to be more patient while I figure out how to approach a situation I've never encountered before, and sometimes I have to be more patient with him too because he's more set in his ways than I am and so adapting can be more difficult for him. I think it's reasonable for your partner to be concerned about those issues when you discuss dating younger women. 

It could also be that she's worried how she'll compare. A lot of people have a fear (even if it is baseless) of being "traded in" for a younger, "better" person. 

I think you should discuss with her and try to work out WHY it's bothering her, because then it will be easier to address whatever her concerns are in a productive way. Maybe to get the discussion going you could ask her why she thinks it's unusual, or for some examples of problems she thinks you'll have.  </TEXT>

Asylum seekers often arrive without papers. They are still asylum seekers, and even if the government CALLS them "unlawful" they are not actually doing anything illegal.

<TEXT> 1) We can accept both the fact that the kid didn't tell his mother AND the fact that he was sexually abused. People who have been sexually abused often lie about it, even when asked directly, and especially when they feel like the person who abused them has sufficient power over them that telling anyone would be pointless. (Like, say, if he was the highest-ranking church official in the country.) 

2   3) I accept that the jury found the proof sufficient to find him guilty. We can't argue with the jury's conclusions because we don't know exactly what evidence they were given. 

4) No other proven cases against him could mean anything. Maybe he just got better at it. Maybe he has reformed himself now. Maybe he continued blatantly offending but out of sheer luck and power he hasn't been caught. Whatever the case, the jury has found that he did it and I don't think we should try to pretend we know better than the people who actually saw the evidence. 

Publicly available material facts are: He was found guilty of sexually assaulting children. I think we should take that into consideration going forwards.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's not really a good way to stop other than just ... stopping. 

I found a good way to do that is to refer them to someone else who is a more appropriate outlet. Like, if there's someone you're not wanting to help at that moment, and they come to you to "therapy" them, you can gently refer them to their friends or to an actual therapist (example: "Wow, that sounds terrible. Have you talked to (friend they actually spend time with) about it?" ... "Oh, I just thought she'd be in a better position to help because she knows you so much better" ... "Ok, how about a therapist? I bet they could help you") 

The trick is to not start listening to the ACTUAL problem at all, just keep suggesting alternative people who can listen instead. Most people will take that hint, and if they don't, that's when you can start being more direct (Example: "Look, we haven't spoken in the past year. I don't know what you want me to say. I can't help you.")  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had one therapist who was terrible (or at least terribly incompatible with me) - I came out of every session feeling confused and upset because she hadn't understood me. I had to explain basic information about myself that I thought was obvious, and I had to explain it multiple times (not sure why, but at the time I felt that she must not be believing me). She made assumptions about my feelings and intentions that didn't line up with what I actually felt or intended. It was bad. 

I had one who was alright and able to help me. He didn't really "get" me, but he let me say what I felt and he remembered the things I'd said and didn't make me explain myself. He tried to understand and he cared about me and helped me to get better as best he could (even if a lot of the things he said just confused me, if I thought enough about it I could understand and apply it to myself and improve). 

I had one who was pretty good, but didn't help much. She asked questions, and understood what I wanted to achieve, and told me straight-up that she wouldn't be able to help me with what I wanted. Despite not being able to help me, she was my favourite therapist, because she understood me and what I wanted after only two sessions, and she was honest about the limitations of therapy and the realities of my situation.  And she supported me to make the choices I NEEDED to make to improve my situation (choices which did not improve therapy). 

So I'd say a good therapist is one who understands you and is honest and helpful in supporting you to improve your life. A bad one just ... doesn't.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So... don't stay positive. That SUCKS. I'd be so upset. 

Do something to express how you're feeling. Write a letter, or make an artwork, or go for a run, or beat the shit out of a punching bag... etc. Pick something, release all those emotions you're feeling! Be angry! Be frustrated! Be upset! Fuck *staying positive*. 

You're allowed to feel bad too. You don't have to be positive all the time. 

If you keep ignoring your emotions, you will hate yourself *even more*. The self-harm will creep in because it's the only way left to express yourself - you need to get ahead of it ... express yourself in other ways, then it won't have the same power behind it. 

Then, once you've thrown all those emotions out, expressed them all (and probably cried for an hour or more), then ... take a deep breath and pull yourself together. Be nice to yourself for the next day or two, while you're recovering, and then you can go back to trying to stay positive. 

For now though... take a break from the positivity. In a safe way. 

Good luck 3 I hope this helps, I'm drawing from my own experiences with self-harm so if it sounds like rubbish ... feel free to ignore </TEXT>

Please find support. If you can, find a therapist (preferably a therapist with experience treating PTSD, especially service-related PTSD). Even if you don't have PTSD, it will be better if the person you're seeing understands how war can affect someone and knows how to safely talk about traumatic experiences with you. You can find therapists online if there aren't any available locally.
