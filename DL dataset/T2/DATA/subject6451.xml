<TEXT> Not exactly. Depends on your definition of "optimistic nihilism", nihilists aren't optimists, as they reject both pessimism and optimism, but a nihilist is someone who accepts the meaninglessness of life. If you feel overwhelmed or depressed by it, you're not accepting it. By feeling, however, liberated by such or happy by it, you are accepting it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. That's like asking, "if love exists, why can't we see it?". Just because you give an individual meaning to yourself, doesn't mean it is actually real meaning. Just like when you fake your own emotions, it looks real, but it isn't. 
2. No. While you'll find many pessimists on this sub, most of them are just depressed people with a wrong idea of what nihilism is or trying to talk with some people, for whatever reasons, and talk about their emotions. Nihilism is accepting the meaningless of life, not feeling overwhelmed by it.
3. Yes, they've got no value, as they're something. That doesn't mean they have no value for you or anyone, but that, universally - for the universe - they've got no value.

1. If you took some time to read the comments, you would've seen I said "They don't even know what private property is at all"
2. I posted this in this sub for a reason, just saying.

The discussion was about private property, though. Not personal property, which was what him was mentioning, and you're mentioning now. While it sounds weird to call personal property to your child, for example, 'private property' means private ownership of the means of production. Unless your child is a mean of production, it isn't a private property. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  You can go right on ahead and invent your own definitions, but the one I gave is *the* definition. 

I ddin't invent any definition, what's this new trend of saying we invent definitions? Just go read some books from classical anarchist authors and you'll see I'm not inventing any definition. Also, you're using an apolitical dictionary definition, which is just vague and technically wrong. Because, anarchism isn't against the government, as it proposes a form of government: direct democracy. Just proving how these definitions are not only vague, but also wring.

 Your little group of antifa socialists might think that anarchism means democracy, it doesnt. 

Lmao, just for the "antifa socialists" I should stop answering you, I thought we were having a serious debate and you come up with this masterpiece. Nice one, for screwing up the whole discussion with a joke.

Also, who are you to say what anarchism is and isn't? I take my definitions from what classical authors wrote, which were actually supporters of democracy, real democracy. Democracy is the power of deciding and having a voice being concentrated on the people, how is that not compatible with anarchism? How is anarchism not democratic, then?

You could, of course, form groups of people who voluntarily join and vote within that group; but you couldn't force anyone outside of the group to do what you say.

I think you're confused on how our societies might work like. First of all, anarchism isn't just anarcho-communism, so not every anarchist thinks the same regarding how to organise societies, I personally think a territory should be divded in communes/communities, and everyone should have a voice and the right of being part of the government inside that community. All the decisions you make are for your community, not for external communities, I don't know what you're point is about.

 Sounds like you want and like government, you just think it should be run *your* way, the socialist way. Congrats man. Congrats. You're very confused. 

You're the one confused, have you even read the post I've sent you? No, of course you didn't. Anarchists advocate for a government, but not for a state. Also, thanks for having zero idea so far of what anarchism, and anarcho-communism, is about.

 People arent victims of capitalism, they're victims of life. 

You're saying that as if capitalism was a natural characteristic of life, because you can't deny the fact there are victims of capitalism. 

 Life is hard. If it wasn't, there would be little point. 

Life is hard because of our systems. Capitalism is a system which makes life harder for those who work and gain less profit (and own nothing), and makes it easier for those who don't work and own property, like rich people. Under anarcho-communism, life would be hard for everyone equally, or easy for everyone equally. It doesn't promise perfection or a paradise, just a better system and more egalitarian.

 Animals dont complain, lay down and die, starve, because someone won't give them food. 

Sorry for being this hostile, but if you're seriously saying this your brain cells might be kind of dead. Animals don't need someone to give them food, they get food themselves. But try to steal them something, or try to make them slaves, you'll see how they complain. They're like us with the bourgeoisie - try to harm us, and we'll not only complain, but also attack you. You can't compare animals and us, because we live in different conditions and societies. Of course they don't fucking complain because someone won't give them food, because that's not how their societies work, lol. Yet still, animals, if they could understand our concepts and the way we live - capitalism - they would be really disgusted at us and I would understand if they started a revolution against us, because, seriously, we're the fucking worst.

 They get up, and they work for it, because that's life. 

Alright, so, how is that not what anarchists or communists say? Under anarchism and communism, if you want to survive, you must work. Under capitalism, working isn't the only way of surviving, and that ways aren't that fair. Just because you're rich it doesn't mean you mustn't work and help poor people, quite the opposite, fucking give the money you don't need. Why allow them to have more money than they need? It's just about abusing of consumption and caring only about materialist things that don't have any value outside of our minds. And if it didn't cause any problems to anyone, then I wouldn't care, but unfortunately, it does!

 Yeah I get it, some people are rich, because they're clever 

The fuck, no, you're not rich for being clever. Many people that are probably more clever than the majority of rich people are pretty sure non-owners and lower classes.

 or their daddies or great grand daddies were clever 

Same thing, no. If their daddies were rich was because they were powerful, for any reason, enough to become owners of a property that gave them profit. What their children get is inherited by doing absolutely nothing, how fair, right?

That's life. Get over it.

No, that's not life. I would understand that you said it if there wasn't a solution, but there is a solution. There are lots of solutions. One of them is getting rid of capitalism, like it or not, I sometimes think being a capitalist means having little to zero empathy for people, in general. I know there are people who can be excluded from this assumption, but are you telling me you, or anyone else on this sub, show any care for those who even working get paid a shit while others doing nothing get, not only payed more, but supported by a bunch of fools who contribute nothing to society, too?

I don't know, grow your empathy, dude. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Well, we'll have to disagree. I'm curious though, as you named everything anarchism *isnt*, but not what it actually *is*. 

"Anarchism is anti-capitalist"

[Anyways, I've just written a good definition and explanation for anarchism.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNationalistFlags/comments/dlmji9/misconceptions_about_anarchism_anarchism_isnt/)

Anarchism- The theory or doctrine that all forms of government are oppressive and undesirable and should be abolished

That's wrong. Anarchism supports a form of government, which is direct democracy. Anarchism depends on the government - but not the state.

Please explain to me, what system of trade would work best in that framework?

What do you mean by "that framework"? Which one?

This is the exact question that got me banned from anarchism. Note that you wont be banned from this sub, despite appearing to be completely against it and inciteful, because conservatives are much more open to having their ideas challenged; as we are able to actually defend them.

I'd rather get banned than receive thousands of downvotes from people with no idea of what they're talking about when they discuss about anarchism, honestly. Yet still, you don't get banned in r/anarchism for asking a question, but for actually triggering. By supporting capitalism and saying anarchism can be capitalist, you're actually triggering many victims of capitalism (something many people will find absurd, huh).

 Also, I'm not a fucking political science major, I dont know, or care, about the hundreds of crazy ass labels you put on simple ideologies. You're all *democrats* 

Wrong, irrelevant and the last sentence is also funny. You don't need to be a fucking political science major to know these basic concepts. If you're going, however, to call yourself an anarchist, you must first research about the ideology, which is something I'm sure most "an"caps don't do, just like many teenagers don't do and just call themselves anarchists to feel rebellious. The same shit. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Misconceptions about anarchism - Anarchism isn't against the government </TITLE>
<DATE> 2019-10-22 20:57:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> One of the most common misconceptions about anarchism I find is thinking anarchism is against the government. In order to provide points for this minsconception, I must first define anarchism, so my point will be clearer:

**What's anarchism?**

Anarchism is a political ideology, with its origins in the 19th century, theorised by Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. While Proudhon had its flaws, that would lead to being sceptical about him being really an anarchist, he theorised anarchism as the actual ideology, part of anarchism, mutualism. Somethink was clear: Proudhon criticised concentrated power on a minority, elected or appointed, as well as capitalism and communism.

As Proudhon started becoming more known, other people started to interpret anarchism in other ways, and criticise Proudhon's flaws which, as said before, makes us sceptical of him being an anarchist. While many of these changes were mainly centered on the economy, all of these new anarchist movements or ideologies wanted the same, the abolition of hierarchies.

But the definition is still vague and wrong. Do you think anarchists oppose hierarchies like family? Or a voluntary teacher-student hierarchy? No, because these hierarchies can be justified and can be voluntary. While you won't probably find, at least in classical and oldest essays, anarchism being defined as the opposition to unjustified hierarchies, it's pretty much what all these classical anarchists were writing about. Remember that the existence of something isn't determined by if that something has an existing name or not. 

So, what's the appropiate and basic definition of anarchism? A political ideology that seeks to justify hierarchies, and getting rid of those hierarchies that can't be justified. These hierarchies that can't be justified, "injustified hierarchies", are often involuntary and exploitative-abusive, like the boss that treats the worker as a simple slave for profit, thus a property. It's necessary to understand that anti-statism, anti-capitalism and being against the police and organised religions aren't characteristics of the ideology, but consequences of the opposition to involuntary or unjustified hierarchies.

Inside of the definition of anarchism, I see many people getting it all wrong, too. No, anarchism isn't defined by its etymology, otherwise "nihilism" means "nothing" and capitalism means "the ideology of capital". Doesn't it sound vague and wrong? Because it is.  So, no, anarchism isn't "no rulers".

Another one is thinking anarchism is simply anti-statism. As I said before, anti-statism is just a consequence to the opposition to unjustified hierarchies, which is the state. If anarchism was only anti-statism, it would be called anti-statism, not anarchism.

And for the average population thinking anarchism is chaos and disorder, or lack of rules, you're wrong too. I'll talk in depth about this in another topic, but simply, anarchism was meant to be about order. The moment it's chaotic or disordered, it's not anarchism, it's a failure, or simply chaos. Rules still exist under anarchism, and again, I'll explain this in depth in another topic.

**But you said anarchism is anti-statist, then why do you say it isn't against the government?**

While most people use "state" and "government" interchangeably, this is totally wrong, especially when talking about anarchism. An easy one that'll make you easily see they're not the same, is that governments can be regional, local and basically at any level, while the state is only at a national level. Now, the state is comprised of only a small portion of the population, or a majority, while the government can be comprised of any portion. Have you heard of the "everyone's part of the government"? Well, this can't happen in a state. The state is also a top-down institution, while the government, since can also be comprised of everyone or of a majority, it isn't necessarily a top-down institution.

Anyone advocating for no government, advocates for no form of organisation or order, therefore, it's not anarchist. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. Anarchism is anti-capitalist, regardless of what these guys here tell you. Reading history, theory and a wikipedia article isn't much hard, unless you're lazy - which may be the reason why many support "anarcho-"capitalism, because the whole ideology, regardless of if its hipocrisy and fakeness, sounds inhumane.

2. Antifa isn't socialist or communist, antifa is short of anti-fascism and I've already seen lots of right-wingers calling themselves antifa and protesting with other antifascists, regardless of their ideologies. 

3. Communism and socialism aren't authoritarian ideologies or 'fascist'. Marxists may be, tankies may be, Maoists may be, but not communists. When you say communists, you're referring to De Leonists, Council Communists, Libertarian Marxists, Left Communists, and even Libertarian Communists. So, better re-think it.

4. No, you didn't find the right sub. Regardless of if this sub was really about anarchism and "anarcho-"capitalism was really a form of anarchism, people here suck like hell, by my own personal experience, and by what others have shared. This sub can be described as "hey let me downvote you for being a communist FASCIST*" and "i LiEk CaPiTaLiSm BeCaUsE iT's AbOuT fReEdOm"

<TEXT> I don't consider Rojava or Chiapas to be anarchist, but "libertarian socialist" is a fitting term. Rojava, however, has anarchist characteristics and many there are striving for actually anarchism. Take into account the PKK shouldn't be classified as ML anymore, but democratic confederalist, for example. I'm not sure how much members of the PKK are actually Marxists or Marxist-Leninists, but I guess it's decreasing its popularity inside the party.

Regarding Catalonia and Ukraine, I always say that, instead of actual anarchist societies, they were experiments under really bad times. Catalonia had enemies on every side, so they had to focus on the military and fighting on the civil war (and defending themselves) and couldn't focus on other key points of anarchism, though they did pretty well and were close. Ukraine had it even harder, in my opinion, as having the USSR as an enemy that close is a serious threat.

When anarchists experiment under peaceful times, we get results like Rojava. Not saying Rojava is an anarchist experiment, but it's starting to be successful - even though it's not an example of an experiment under peaceful times. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. Anarchists make a difference between justified and unjustified hierarchies. A family is a justified hierarchy, a boss-worker hierarchy is unjustified, because it can't be justified - it's involuntary and abusive.

2. Anarchism isn't no government, it's no state. The government can be comprised of everyone, thus compatible with anarchism, which is what happened in the Revolutionary Catalonia, or the Free Territory of Ukraine, or even the Paris Commune. Not only that, but in other non-anarchist socialist societies, like Rojava, hierarchy isn't what you expect.

3. First of all, the idea of a military isn't mutually exclusive with anarchism. Who says the military hierarchy can't be like the family hierarchy you mentioned? And anarchists, historically, used militias, which may not be as effective as a professional military, but it's something.

4. Capitalism works better in authoritarian regimes, just saying. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  What's the difference in submitting to God over government?

You know the government exists. You're unsure of God existing.

Eh.... this is wrong. There are many despots and dictators over history who have tried to play God in various forms. If it be a want for worship and adoration or to remake the world in their beliefs.

Also don't confuse fundamentalism with religion.

Catholism may just be about money, that does not mean Christianity or religion is.

Playing being God isn't relevant to the topic, they're not literally playing being God. That was my whole point. Also, I never said Christianity or religion is about that, but that the church is about that - which is what OP mentioned.

The revolutions of China and USSR say otherwise. Atheism and the attack and religion from these states is well known to be one of the key principles in convincing people with regards to the class war.

Now i would agree this is largely a excuse and power grab however Atheism was used.

Also you need to change European countries to Catholic countries. The reformation act of 1517 quelled most of what you are saying.

Also weren't the native American tribes considered spiritualist rather than having a codified religion? I honestly am curious here.

Atheism wasn't used to achieve power. pseudo-communist regimes have always fought against the church (the church, not religion) because it always sided with the right-wing. Also, I said European countries in general, not implying every country was Catholic.

And, yes, the native American tribes were spiritualist, not religious, but I was talking more about beliefs in general rather than religions specifically.

As for God stopping the spread of Atheism? This completely misunderstands and ignores most of what the religious text says about such things

Well, it's OP who said that it's God the one who should judge, not us. Therefore, what the bible says is pointless because it's not written or anything by God itself, right?

That last paragraph was more of a joke than a serious point, just like his point sounded ridiculous to me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. It gives people a sense of belief, purpose, faith and optimism in life

Are you sure it's always like this? Because I know a lot of examples of people being fucked up by religion. Also, you don't need religion to have a sense of belief, purpose, faith and optimism in life.

2. Submitting to a higher presence is good to keep your own ego in check

If being submissive and dependant on a being whose existence is unknown is now good, and can help you keep your ego in check - and you consider it something good, we've got a problem here. 

3. Each individual's relationship with God is personal to them

How is this even relevant? I'm an atheist and I have a personal relationship with people whose existence I can prove, what's the point here?

4. Any regimes looking to play God (e.g. the USSR) have attacked the church

No regime has ever looked to play God. Casually, you're mentioning the USSR attacking the church, but what about the church attacking others? Do I need to remind you that the church sided with Franco's nationalists in the spanish civil war, that they killed millions of innocent lives throughout history in the name of their religion and God? That the church is just about money and power and not spirituality?

5. A very small number of religious people do bad things - the same of any other group

A very small number? Maybe nowadays. Have you heard of the 18th+ centuries of religions, especially Christianity, and specifically Catholicism, killing people for their beliefs? And how a supermajority agreed on these measures? Do I need to remind you of ISIS? How many atheists out there kill religious people? How can you even compare them?

6. China is the most atheist country in the world and the regime now plays God

Which is the point? No country "plays God". The expression means something totally different and irrelevant to the discussion.

7. As the UK and USA have become more irreligious the quality of life has declined

When the bourgeoisie revolutions happened, atheism and secularism became relevant characteristics of these. Casually, life conditions increased significantly. Secularism and atheism opened doors to technological advances - therefore more culture, better health, better education, safety and equality. If you think this is bad, don't mind me if I call you a primitivist fascist.

8. Countries with high atheist rates have spiritualism there such as Shintoism in Japan (similar)

Spiritualism isn't always religion. You can be atheist and spiritual at the same time, they're not mutually exclusive terms.  So, your point is totally irrelevant.

9. The Jews are very religious and the most successful group in the world

I bet the most successful group in the world, nowadays, are atheists. Mind me reminding that religion plays a significant role in people's live, mainly, in third world countries. In other more developed countries, atheism rules over a majority, and most successful people tend to be atheist. But anyways, religion doesn't determine how successful someone is, nor does atheism.

Atheism is the tool of those with evil intent to gain absolute power like in China to control people.

Atheism has never been used to gain power. Quite the opposite, religion has always been the one been used to gain power. European countries of the 15th century to the 18th century are especially relevant to this: the monarch's power was considered to come from a divinity. It didn't mean that the monarch was a God, but that God itself influenced on who became a monarch, "God's will". Before this, state religion was a default characteristic of all countries, and many died for being considered heretic or of other religion. The American tribes, for example, did lots of sacrifices in the name of a divinity, or several divinities. Atheism has never been used to achieve power, religion has.

Also, don't cite the religious who hate on gays or whatever as a position for a rebuttal. It's nonsense because they don't get to cast judgement, only God does.

That sounds kind of hypocritical. Then why are you judging atheism and atheists using illogical, ahistorical and wrong facts? Shouldn't God be the one judging atheism and trying to stop it, considering what you've said? Why isn't God doing so, isn't atheism a threat to God? </TEXT>

I understand Existentialism, only related with existential nihilism (not the other forms and characteristics of nihilism), to be an approach to subjective meaning. Nihilists generally encourage not having a meaning, but that you're free to do so if you think that's useful for you, but you must always acknowledge that this meaning is created only by yourself, it's not true, it's not real outside of your mind. An Existentialist may say that this meaning is true and real, for you, and only for you, It's your personal meaning. At least, this is the key difference I see, I haven't got much information about Existentialism, so correct me if I'm wrong.

Events have meaning, however.

They have meaning, sure. Avoiding meaning is hard, if not impossible, for a human being. But a nihilist says that living with meaning doesn't mean believing in meaning. I, for example, would say "Events have meaning, and we give their meaning through our emotions. If we didn't have emotions, we wouldn't be giving meaning to this. Therefore, meaning is dependant to emotions, and emotions are just substances that, if something goes wrong, can disappear or not work properly". Given this explanation, a nihilist would think that it's irrelevant to then give meaning to things, or give such importance to feelings. But the human being is not capable, so far, of avoiding all emotions, so the nihilist has no other option than to live however he, or she, wants. This, at first, sounds contradictory with his/her philosophy, but as the nihilist starts acquiring more knowledge on his/her philosophy, (s)he will notice that nihilism isn't telling them what's the most nihilist way to live, or the right path to take. This is another reason why most people find nihilism liberating.

I don't think that it would be desirable to live in a world that was devoid of meaning.

The world, the universe, life, they're already devoid of meaning. If you mean a world where people is devoid of meaning, it's still not necessarily nihilist. As I said, events do have meaning for the individual, just like, even if you hated feeling emotions, you still feel them and can't avoid them easily. The nihilist just finds meaning irrelevant, harmful and/or illogical, and the nihilist, as a rational individual, finds it easy to cope with nihilism. A person who finds it easy to cope with nihilism, doesn't find the world devoid of meaning as something wrong or terrible.

Yet still, again, meaning and feelings aren't easily avoidable. I don't know if there has been any example of a person without emotions or meaning, but in any case, what's the chance of having their luck? In a "nihilist society" people would still have meaning, morality, feelings... It's just that either they're trying to avoid these, or find them not a truth but useful or necessary, and they find rational and logical ways to control the use of these things. For example, a rational approach of morality is when the majority of population finds something disgusting. A rational person would say that, even if this person doesn't believe in morality, if a majority of the population thinks murdering is wrong, then it's logical to state that murdering is wrong. But this rational person, this nihilist, isn't believing in morality, just accepting or using it for practical reasons.

I think I'm abusing of length, lol. </TEXT>

Yes, there was a reason. I was explaining the events in order.

we have the UN, we have the rest of the world. who is blocking the UN? who is blocking the EU. the us was not the only partner in fighting isis, where is putin? Nobody feels responsible, the whole world is betraying the kurds. erdogan is killing them thought.

Yeah, but what retained Turkish troops from invading Rojava was the US troops in the territory. Trump withdrew these troops and gave green light to Erdogan to, as you say, kill the kurds. I never said Trump is the only one responsible for this, of course, everyone is responsible. Especially those countries who aren't doing anything for the Kurds.

the "isis topic" is not under control

Many of ISIS' terrorists were jailed and retained, the situation is certainly better than it was before, not fully controlled, but close. Once Trump noticed the ISIS topic was more controlled and that theUS troops in Rojava weren't, supposedly, needed anymore, he withdrew them.

erdogan needs permission from alot more guys. this is not about the us since a long time.

Yeah, and that's why we oppose those who support the Turkish invasion. The whole point of what I've said is that if the US troops remained in Rojava, Erdogan wouldn't be having a green light on invading Rojava, with or without permission, and granted the chance of receiving permission.

he is very stupid, he says alot of shit.

Yeah, and that makes him still responsible for whatever happens to the Kurds, anywhere. It's Trump's responsibility, and anyone else with the chance of helping the Kurds and not doing so. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Google dictionary defines Nihilism as "the rejection of all religious and moral principles, in the belief that life is meaningless". That is easy enough to understand. What people mean by that they are Nihilsts, however, seems to radically differ. Nihilism can seem to mean everything from the belief that nothing exists to a generalized Ontological pessimism. It seems to be able to denote an attitude towards revolution, a particular disposition, an aesthetic, etc.

Nihilism is the belief that life is meaningless, that morals are non-existent or not objective (you can find both type of nihilists, some implying morals are non-existent, and others that they exist, but are not intrinsic-objective). Nihilists also believe that the absolute truth cannot be known, it's an extreme form of skepticism.

In regards to the rejection of moral principles, I say, "Morality? Sure." I don't think that Ethics can be at all rejected, however. Ethics arise from that there are others. That there is someone other than yourself who is an autonomous subject means that you will have to figure out how to go about your general way of dealing with other people. It's just simply the case that Ethics occur. The abandonment of Ethics altogether is not only ill-advised; it is also impossible.

The thing is that a nihilist isn't someone without morality or values. Quite the opposite most of the time, and it's not contradictory with the idea of nihilism. Nihilism is just accepting the truth: that life can't have a meaning, and that since God doesn't exist, morality can only be subjective, if existent at all. This, however, doesn't mean you can't create meaning and have morality, but always accepting and remembering what the truth is.

In order for you understand it, the 'truth' for a nihilist is a logical, rational and philosophical interpretation of life and the universe, as well as the psychology of the human being.  This often results in negation: negation of things considered to be true, negation of morality and social norms, negation of authority and truths. This is why calling the Russian nihilists, nihilists, is still accurate. Nihilism is far more revolutionary than most people think, because it isn't apathy.

Basically, you can be a nihilist and have morality, but the nihilist will always think, accept and know that this morality is just a personal construct of his mind, for whatever reason. I, as a nihilist, have a morality - otherwise, I would hardly call myself an anarcho-communist, or anarchist at all. But I always know that this morality is subjective, it's only mine, I can't expect others to accept, understand and know about my morality.

If you believe that the human experience is ultimately negative

Nihilism isn't the belief that the human experience is ultimately negative. As someone else said, that's a more misanthropic's belief than a nihilist's. While many misanthropes are nihilists (and many nihilists are misanthropes), they're not the same.

A goal of Philosophy, to me, should be to overcome Nihilism.

I can't disagree. Nihilism is the natural enemy of philosophy, that's something we all know (I hope). However, for a nihilist, this is totally irrelevant. A nihilist values reality and rationalism, not beliefs based on no logical reasoning. While we could say the nihilist, most of the time, isn't providing a logical argument, it has a logical reasoning for his beliefs. Let's say the meaning of life - how is the universe, or life, able to have meaning and/or create meaning? The nihilist, before claiming to be a nihilist, thinks about it. If he arrives to the conclusion that universal meaning is impossible, then the nihilist has two options: subjective meaning, or the destruction of meaning. While most nihilists nowadays are rather neutral - they believe in subjective meaning, but don't want to have a subjective meaning - the goal of the nihilist is to live a life without morality and meaning, which many can argue that they oppress and harm the individual. 

but I honestly do suspect for the belief in the philosophy to be somewhat pathological

Talking with different nihilists can make you see quite the opposite. Many say that nihilism liberate them and is useful as a coping mechanism. Now that my personal experience can be relevant, I've been considering myself a nihilist for slightly more than a year. So far, I've been living better than I was. I don't pay much attention to meaning, morality and such - but I'm still as happy as the average population. I don't find myself to have a pathology. And I'm not the only one going to say this.

I just don't think that there is a reason to endlessly wallow in misery.

A nihilist isn't necessarily miserable, nor engages in misery or encourages it. As I said before, most of the time is quite the opposite, which surprises many people.

you should still try to create something otherwise.

I agree, and disagree at the same time. You don't always need meaning to cope with problems. Most of the time, it's having a meaning and goals what create problems. Just think about someone who's meaning of life is to have a family and reproduce, and this person is really passionate about fulfilling this goal, as it's the meaning of his life, or at least, he thinks so. What happens when this person is 80 years old and is all alone, without family or friends? How do you think this person will be like? What do you think this person will try to do? Oppose meaning, and live without meaning, because experience has taught him that meaning just creates more problems, and it's an unrealistic thing, and goal, that you're most of the time forcing on yourself.

I would recommend meaning for depressed people, or anyone in such a bad state, however. But when you're satisfied with your life, why taking such a risk you don't need? </TEXT>

<TEXT> The definition of nihilism is clear. What many people don't understand is who is and isn't a nihilist. The short answer is simple, "if you believe in nihilism, you're a nihilist, if you don't, you're not a nihilist". Doesn't matter if you're a fascist or an anarchist, if you're unmotivated and depressed or willing to do anything and happy, as long as you believe in nihilism, you're a nihilist.

Nonetheless, many 'depressed nihilists' are just depressed people thinking that the philosophy of nihilism is related to their mental condition. Nihilists have different reasons to believe in what they believe (philosophical reasons, for example), while depressed people believe in the same for other reasons. Also, depressed people feel bothered by nihilism, while not all other nihilists do. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You can't determine what's a genuine nihilist, so you can't either determine what's not a genuine nihilist. That's because nihilism is about "nothing's wrong or right", implying there's a true nihilist lifestyle means that there's a right and absolute path anyone claiming to be nihilist should follow, and this actually contradicts the whole message of nihilism.

So, yes, you can be a nihilist, just like anybody else. As long as you believe in nihilism, you're a nihilist. It's not like "you can't be a communist and rich at the same time". </TEXT>

<TEXT> First of all:

Existentialism is also just cooler than Nihilism

You can't debate a philosophy by saying which ones is cooler, especially when it's a subjective opinion. 

I just don't get why Nihilists just don't or didn't decide to become Existentialists

You don't decide to become a nihilist, duh. If you just believe in nihilism, you're a nihilist.

Also, nihilism tells you that there's no right or wrong, meaning there's no right or wrong path, then you're free to do whatever you want and like. Not because you must enjoy life, but because anything you do is meaningless and there's nothing but abstract concepts and yourself that stop you, not the universe. So, universally speaking, you're free to do most things you can't do nowadays.

A revolutionary nihilist is still a nihilist. A nihilist with apathy is still a nihilist. A depressed nihilist is still a nihilist. A happy nihilist is still a nihilist. Not trying to sound hostile, but this post is full of common misconceptions on nihilism based on vague and wrong stereotypes.

<TEXT> I'm a Catalan anarchist pro-independence. I was neutral towards the topic years ago, but after what has been happening lately, I can't tolerate this oppression caused by the spanish government, supposedly "democratic".

It's not an ethnic-related thing. Nor an economical one. We want more autonomy, freedom and equal rights, and we don't have it. The separatist leaders have been doomed for 9-13 years of prison, the police has orders to beat down any protester - and they attack even non-protesters.

Just saying that, socialists and anarchists are a majority in the separatist movement. It's not just for the oppression, but also an opportunity to get closer to socialism or anarchism - or that's how we see it. Of course, the rest supports at least a more democratic government that this crappy spanish government.

Many of us would be satisfied with federalism by now, though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wanna give my opinion, as a Catalan anarchist, but first, just to anyone here, considering the CGT an anarchist union is as right as thinking Hitler was a good person. CGT is anarchist only in aesthetics, and it's not worth being part of it or even considering it anarchist. Just like most unions here, they actually contradict the ideology they supposedly support. As an anarchist, your only hope is the CNT.

That said. I live in Catalonia, I was born here, and I've been thinking of this topic for a long time. At first, when I didn't have political experience, I just thought, "well, if they want to leave, why stop them?". As I grew up I thought this was a vague (and indeed it is) and wrong opinion, but now I feel ashamed of ever defending Spain and not the separatist side.

It's true that many of these separatist politicians just want power, and I do agree that they're just wanting independence, not because they feel oppressed, or because they think they don't belong to Spain anymore, but because they want power they can't achieve while being part of Spain. But, the movement, as a whole, isn't about power.

As an anarchist, you may ask, "why are you supporting a movement that seeks to create another country?". First of all, historically-speaking, Catalonia has been the household of many anarchists (just check the Revolutionary Catalonia). With Spain out of this, achieving anarchism again would be easier - not easy, though. 

Secondly, ideology isn't always the most important thing. There's a point in which, as a Catalan, I can't tolerate all the oppression caused by the spanish government and the police. I've seen a lot of peaceful protesters being beaten up, the police using illegal guns to control the protesters and make them back up, and the government allowing this. Because, when a protester uses an illegal gun, they go to prison - but if a police officer does this, they're just told to not do it again, and are maybe just suspended for some days.

I can't tolerate it. I would risk creating a new country, which honestly, looks better than Spanish politics. As I'm close to the movement, I know that a high percentage of separatists are socialists-anarchists, they're really supporters of democracy and freedom and they're passionate about it. I can't oppose this when their fight is against quite the opposite: an undemocratic, capitalist/"social democrat" and oppressive government.

Fuck Spain, you can't support the spanish government at this point. </TEXT>

I honestly, given the fact that communism isn't as popular as capitalism (not in terms of ideology, but as actually put in practice), I think we should strive to cooperate for any attempt to achieve a communist society. That said, I don't consider tankies or authsocs/authcomms my friends or comrades, but I do consider Marxists my comrades, as well as other libertarian socialists.

That said, I support Rojava, regardless of if it's anarchist or not. It's close, though. Also, notice how Kurds say their political system is based in democratic confederalism, not anarchism. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're having a lot of things wrong. Socialism isn't just focusing on society over the individual, it goes further, and there are many things national socialists don't share with socialists. 

Many ideologies coming from Communism and Socialism emerged in the past century, opposing Marxism and other leftist ideologies of their kind. For example, some syndicalists, disagreeing with other syndicalists, led to forming national syndicalism. But you'll never see any national syndicalist saying "I'm a syndicalist", because the key points are different.

You're also implying fascism is national socialism. National socialism isn't fascism, and fascism isn't national socialism. They're two different ideologies. Also, why do you separate Communism and Marxism, when Marxism is Communist?

And again, socialism/leftism isn't just society over individual. Public ownership of the means of production, nationalisation of all industries, seeking the emancipation of the working class and the destruction of the bourgeoisie and wanting a classless, moneyless and stateless society is communism-socialism. Some may argue socialism is a stage that eventually leads to communism (stateless, moneyless and classless society). So, no, national socialism isn't, considering this definition, socialist. History speaks for itself.

And if you think the Nazis were socialists, they're as socialists as China is currently communist. In case you didn't know, China isn't communist.

Fascism is a far-right ideology (in the fourth-spectrum compass, it would be simply slighly authoritarian right), while national socialism is far-right and in the fourth-spectrum compass they're authoritarian center.

Even the most totalitarian socialists fought against national socialism and fascism, for god's sake. And it was for a reason. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Of course decisions made democratically are forceful! Unless they are unanimous! Majority rule is tyranny of the majority and creates a hierarchy of the group-will ruling over all individuals in that group!

The entire point of democracy is to justify use of force against the losing minority in the group, and this creates opportunity for massive power abuses.

How can you, if you call yourself an anarchist, not understand this?

No anarchist should respect democracy. Power to the people, not to the politicians.

Yeah, looks like you've got a bad idea of what kind of democracy we advocate for. We don't advocate for the crappy "democracies" you nowadays see, we advocate for direct democracy. Direct democracy means that you represent yourself, no one represents you.

And regarding the "majority tyranny", what's the other option under anarchism? You can't always have unanimous results without force, and the other option is using force and power to install your decisions without caring about a majority. What's your alternative?

I say it because you advocate for democracy! Which you just admitted earlier in this very reply!

I don't advocate for democracy, I advocate for direct democracy, which is different from what you're thinking. And yet still, democracy is not a tyranny or anything, it's just the most efficient and logical way to make decisions. You can always convince the minority to try and support the decision, so that fewer disagree.

How can you be this blind? 51% support for this, what you call "popular support" still constitutes forcing it on the other 49% of society! You think that's okay just because it's got popular consent?

I think you're the blind, when I've said "supermajority popular support" like 3 times already. Supermajority would be 75%+ of the population supporting anarchism, not a 51%, that's just absurd.

If you force it on even one person, you're the bad guy.

Are you even paying attention to what I say? I'm not forcing anyone, I'm trying to convince them. Just like you're doing now, trying to convince me of your opinion.

You can very easily have unanimous support for something new if you bring people who support that something into a new place to self-govern. You can have it tomorrow if you want.

So, anarchism for those who agree with you only, right? We should try to give everyone the right to live under a better and more fair system, not only anarchists, but everyone, as long as they're not a threat, which then, we have the right to kick the person. Anarchism isn't "no rules" and absolute freedom, that's just the wrong average interpretation of anarchism. Anarchism is a method of organisaiton through libertarian ways, without being dependant on authority too much and overthrowing hierarchies that can't be justified, which can be called involuntary hierarchies. A decision made by one person isn't justified, a decision made by a whole community to kick someone is justified.

If you support democracy and majority rule, you still support force.

No. Again, propose me a better system, because you can't always have 100% support, from everyone. What would you then? I advocate for direct democracy and at least a supermajority for a decision to be taken, not a 51%.

That's a largely failed strategy.

Yeah, the CNT-FAI revolution was a largely failed strategy. Yes, Makhnovist revolution was a largely failed strategy. If you want more examples, just search anarchist revolutions and their outcomes.

Then you're not an anarchist.

I am. You just don't know what anarchism is, you look like the typical person who reads the dictionary definition of anarchy and the average population's definition, of which only a person might know the answer right.

No you want anarchism+.

No. Anarchism is the rejection of unjustified, or involuntary, hierarchies. The consequences of the rejection of these hierarchies is the complete destruction of the State, Capitalism, the police and organised religions (mainly). It's not "anti-statism" and that's it, because then it would be called anti-statism, not anarchism.

How can you say anarchism isn't government-free? What kind of bizarro-world statement is that?

Under anarchism there's still a government. I, at least, make a distinction between state and government.

Okay, but you might end up watching as ancaps, through seasteading, spread our version of real anarchism throughout the world in the meantime.

Real anarchism is what early anarchists wrote about: Proudhon, Kropotkin, Bakunin, Malatesta, Stirner... Casually, all of them were anti-capitalist and said anarchism is anti-capitalist (except for Stirner, as he didn't even know about the term, but said that his ideology was anti-capitalist). Considering their definitions, you're the one who's wrong, including all "an"caps who are ahistorical and read zero anarchist theory. And this is the outcome: ignorance. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I advocate for people to be able to choose what property norms they want to live by.
 
 You are looking for ways to force everyone to abandon private property norms.

Huh, no, I'm not forcing anyone if it requires popular support. Or do you think decisions made, democratically, in school group works are forceful?

False, I advocate for a system of self-rule. No one should be able to force law on anyone else, no rulers.

Tell that to the bourgeoisie and the corporations who will take advantage of a lack of power and regulation.

If they want to participate freely in capitalistic business arrangements and you try to stop them

The thing is that we don't do that, and you're constantly assuming we do that just because we advocate for a communist society.

Pure supposition. You didn't even get correct what kind of political scenario I advocate, and now you're making ridiculous conclusions based on the same misunderstanding.

Says the person who told me that I'm trying to force people into sharing the means of production and being part of a community when I'm saying it would require popular support, and we can convince people of giving it a chance. If that's force, this discussion is over.

That is not the only way, and definitely not the most likely way to change the world.

Historically, the best way to create change is to go elsewhere, start something new, and outcompete the old place.

Not exactly. Without popular support, you can't have anarchism. It's not a way to achieve anarchism, it's a requirement, because otherwise the only way you have to achieve anarchism is through force, and we oppose force. Also, no, to create change you don't go elsewhere and start something new, you fight in places where the system or the conditions of the people/workers are poor and try to get support from them to start a revolution.

You should join up with we who are pioneering seasteading to create government-free international cities without rulers. We will have one built I expect within 10 years.

I don't want a government-free city without rulers, I want anarchism, which isn't government-free and goes further than that.

Meanwhile you're banking on a strategy that would have to be measured in centuries.

Maybe, but it's worth the try. We've been close and I'm not going to give up on a strategy that's been close to its goal just because it's not realistic, would take much time, would probably be a failure, whatever. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Funny, because you advocate for private property and a society ruled by the bourgeoisie, or any owner in general, call it however you want. Workers are property of owners (slaves, in other words), the bourgeoisie, and the corporations would eventually create a state using the power they're given, by giving them freedom, because thinking that the average population would be able to stop corporate power is absurd (in this situation).

I advocate for a totally voluntary society. In order for my ideology to succeed and ever happen, we require popular support. Popular support means at least a supermajority agrees on an anarcho-communist society, those who don't agree either adapt or leave, but never sabotage (as that would not only be tyranny and sabotage, but also illogical, considering the negative outcomes you'll receive). You're not being forced into anything, you decide what to do. The supermajority's popular support is for the revolution, not for anything else. </TEXT>

You can't compare the nihilist's "life is meaningless" with the depressed person's "life is meaningless". Yeah, they want to say the same, but not for the same reason.

<TEXT>  Yes. I would rather voluntarily agree to trade my labour for compensation 

There's still compensation under communism, but not in form of wealth. You don't need wealth, sure, it's probably the best option for many things, such as international trade, but that doesn't mean it's the only option we should take. And even if it was, capitalism has other flaws that would still lead to socialism, as socialism isn't the abolition of money, necessarily.

 then to be forced to share all of my wealth and resources 

If you're part of a totalitarian regime, sure, but if you're part of a libertarian communist society, you're not forced into anything, because for such society to exist it would require popular support and everyone striving hard for it. You don't like it? It would only work in small-scale nowadays, so don't worry, you've got more places to live in, and if you don't want to leave, just adapt and don't sabotage anything, and don't be a fucking jerk, because it's then when problems arise.

 And Im absolutely saying that the vast majority of people would also choose this.  

When money is proven to not be absolutely needed, people wouldn't work for wealth, but for the community, for entertainment, to have resources that also benefit them...  Something I notice from right-wing individuals is that they tend to think that financial compensation of labour is the most important, if not the only important, compensation. Which isn't true, there are lots of people who work because they want to help others, because they like the job regardless of the income and such, it's not always a matter of money.

And if you're telling me that workers would risk their health, conditions and happiness to work for an owner that finds them to be tools or property, just because under communism they won't receive any financial compensation (as it wouldn't be needed), then one of us is blind at how the working class is and how much they suffer and cry about their poor conditions. Also, that's still not a point, because many communists believe in a transitionary state, and before communism they tend to achieve socialism (not to be used as synonyms), which isn't a moneyless society.

 Id rather reserve the right to create my own wealth on my own volition and profit from my own innovations, than be forced to collectively share what Ive worked for. 

1. You can do that under communism, individualism still exists. But if you work with other people, you would have to share the means of production and fairly distributing profit - which is something we can't seem to agree on at all.
2. If creating your own wealth and profit from your own innovations results in exploitation, slavery or abuse of the working class, it's not fair to let you do it anymore, and it doesn't matter if it's a State who stops you, yourself or the workers, you should have more conscience and empathy next time.
3. You're not collectively forced to share if you work alone. If you work with other people, you're being tyrannical if you decide to have everything or almost everything for yourself for whatever reason. How is that, by the way, anarchism?

 You call it slavery because its what you dont want 

What the fuck? I don't call it slavery just because it's not what I want, I also call slavery Marxism-Leninism, Juche, any authoritarian form of communism and I don't completely disagree on it. I also completely disagree with conservatism, and I don't say it's about slavery. I have my points.

stateless capitalism would not seek to restrict your right to live free from profit and would not seek to quell whatever you wanted to do, so long as it isnt forceful aggression.

The thing is that, having the chance of joining a collectivised community instead of communities under free markets and private property, most workers would end up joining the collectivised community, and in that moment, your "stateless capitalist" society is fucked up. And, what do you do then?

 Popular support does not equate to unanimous support. 

But it means that at least a 75% of the population wants it. Considering this, only a minority would disagree, and this minority would have the option to leave, if they don't leave, they must adapt. If they don't like society, they can try to change things, but if they fail, it's their own fault, not the community's fault.

 Democracy is forceful and violent. 

Depends on your definition of democracy. You can't have everyone agreeing on you, not even in small-scale societies, so what would you do if you don't think direct democracy is useful?

 Forcing people to share what theyve created and earned, is authoritarian. 

Okay, you got it all wrong. That's not communism. Again, if you worked alone on something, you get all the profit, if you didn't work alone, you share the profit with the others who worked with you.

 You also seem to be under the impression that exploitation and abuse are intrinsically the same 

No.

 I can voluntarily agree to being exploited 

You can also voluntarily agree to be executed and burnt down, yet still, no one wants that, I guess.

 employee/employer exploitation is mutual 

No, it isn't. Workers don't even agree on exploitation, they just don't have any other option than to accept any condition as long as they receive enough money to live by, under a fair system, which isn't capitalism, you would receive enough money to live by without risking your health and freedom.

So let me ask you...how do you expect to achieve communism, without the the use of force and violence?

By waiting for workers to wake up and see capitalism isn't going to benefit them, and work together for communism. No force or coercion in-between, or at least it would be different from the bourgeoisie force and coercion - oh, and their inherent power under capitalism that is incompatible with anarchism too. </TEXT>

Aside from that, it's a petition to defend a territory under a war from turkish invasions which have no right to even step on the territory with soldiers. If no supposedly "democratic" nation will ever try to do anything regarding this, their "democracy" is questionable and we deserve the right to protest.

Still, while I do agree that having to share personal information to a government can be really dangerous, but so far there's 2590 signatures, do you think they'll even try to locate and do anything to all that quantity of people? And it's soon yet to not trust. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Catalan and French are different languages, kinda similar, but like many other languages. Also, why would they integrate/occupy another territory? There's no way in HOI4 to be anarchist other than by having a council-run government (which can be comprised of everyone) and to being against occupation of other territories, but rather they would support anarchist revolutions in these territories to create a new government, but never occupy them.

Another thing would be merging, but still, Catalans and french have different cultures, politics and history, which would collapse even if peacefully and voluntarily merged. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  voluntarily agree to forms of hierarchy 

Are you telling me you would rather be part of a class that's abused by those with wealth and property, instead of just sharing with others the means of production? Are you telling me a supermajority of the workers would agree on being slaves of property and labour? I'm not sure about that being voluntary.

 Communism is a forceful, aggressive and coercive hierarchy over the individual 

How so? How does an ideology that requires popular support can be forceful? How can an ideology that tells workers to own the means of production they use, all together,  without allowing anyone to exploit or abuse of them and generating wealthy classes? How is having a bourgeoisie-rule society anarchist and voluntary? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Anyone supporting of socialism or socialist ideologies, or anti-capitalist, falls in the left. Anarchism is an anti-capitalist, if not directly socialist, ideology, therefore leftist. Regardless of our differences with the other leftists, we're still leftists. Fascists are different from liberals, and both of them are right-wing.

It's not wanting to be part of the left, it's just that we're inherently part of the left, like it or not. If you don't want to call yourself a leftist, that's okay, but anarchism is a left-wing ideology. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  From my experience on anarchy subs there is heavy usage of Russian symbolism 

Sources? I actively read anarchist subs and I find no communist symbolism on them, except for a few times that someone decides to mix it with the anarchist symbolism, but almost everyone ends up telling them to not use that symbolism because it represents authoritarianism more than a proletarian cause.

Go to [r/anarchy](https://www.reddit.com/r/anarchy/) and ask them this very question. You will be banned in a most authoritarian way.

In r/anarchy you will find no anarchist, even if you considered "anarcho-"capitalism to be anarchist. In any case, they are "an"caps, not worth mentioning them.

 People who dont believe in government (anarchists) coming together to voluntarily share property and agreement to rules by which we to adhere... Its called provisional government. 

1. You mean state, not government. This is a basic difference you should know already. Considering the difference between a state and a government, you can't have a functioning society without a government, but you can have a functioning government without a state, but a government.
2. That's absurd, it's not a provisional government, it's a government comprised of everyone part of the community, which is what many, if not most, anarchists advocate for. If you think anarchism is a lawless and absolutely free society, you're calling it a chaotic "society", and therefore it's not anarchist.

In my opinion, it would require everyone's agreement or acceptance to make big changes. But if not, a supermajority is enough, and if someone is unable to live under certain policies, he's free to leave the community and join another one, as anarchism supports decentralisation, instead of centralisation (obviously).

 ANY form of government is antithetical to anarchy. 

Huh, no. Anarchists advocate for direct democracy under a government comprised of every member of the society, how is that antithetical to anarchism? By the way, use "anarchism" or "anarchist society", anarchy is just a synonym of chaos and disorder for most people.

 What happens when a legit anarchist tells you to fuck off with your voluntary agreement? 

Why would he be an anarchist if he did? If an anarchist broke a rule he voluntarily agreed on, for example, he would suffer the same consequences anyone else would've suffered. Therefore, if you agree with X on sharing the means of production, and you later claim to own these means of production and desapropiate X, you're being tyrannical and the community will decide what to do with you, that's something that depends on the community.

You should know anarchism isn't about absolute freedom, so this example isn't antithetical to anarchism, as it still proposes governing, but in a decentralised and voluntary way. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Stateless is just without borders 

The hell.

 Again your ideology require central planing and organization to work. Ergo you require state, just not on the nationalistic foundations. Not countries but entire word as one governing body. Don't use words you don't know full definition. 

You're saying this but you're still not providing any arguments at all, just saying plain things. Why does it require central planning?

 Stalin or Mao communism is just works of Marx that are just implemented at national level. No international communism but each country operate separately as communist one. 

I don't know how this is related to the topic and I don't either understand what you're trying to say here.

 Marx in his fiction wrote about dealing with capitalism and private ownership. Everything should be collectivized, but you can't do that without any form of bureaucracy. Who will plan everything? Who will send bureaucrats? Who will move products? You can't just drop farmers on a field and expect them to know where to send their products to balance entire economy. What crops use on each field and what field should be left alone for next season to maximize production on the local and world level. 

Well, any anarchist's answer to this is, "the people itself would do it". In a small-scale community this wouldn't be such a problem.

 You want anarchism? Then you abolish states and make everyone for them self without any central planing, bureaucrats etc. 

Okay, that's what anarcho-communists do and want.

 I can kill you, you can steal from me 

How is that anarchism or freedom at all? 

 i can have private ownership 

Private ownership consists of owners, a hierarchy that inherently exploits people without privileges (the working class). How is that anarchism, which its core is freedom and equality? You just sound like those damn retarded "an"caps.

 I have my own store and i choose who can enter and what is currency i will accept. 

It sounds beautiful like this (maybe), but you're ignoring the fact that if a whole society started being like this, you would just generate exploitation and discrimination of classes, races and 'women', as men aren't as oppressed as women.

 This is anarchy not a central planned economy run by bureaucrats where everyone is owner of everything but can't have his own property.

"Anarchy" now means chaos, exploitation, corporatism, freedom for the privileged and wealthy, bourgeoisie-run societies and unrestricted-unregulated economy that will lead to other issues? Regardless of if you think that's good, it's not anarchism. Sorry to tell you, but you're living in a fucking fantasy just because you're unable to accept communism isn't the typical liberal propaganda of "communism is authoritarian". If you're not even going to seriously read about communism (because you apparently have read Marx, and you're describing communism as authoritarian and capitalism as not exploitative and obviously not dependant of the bourgeoisie, which is another ruling class under "anarcho-"capitalism", out of million other ruling classes there would be), then you better stop talking shit about something you know nothing or have a wrong idea of.

Anarcho-communism is about cooperatives and a decentralised planned economy, without bureaucracy, because everyone is part of the government. If you think it's just another authoritarian and bureaucratic crap because it has "communism" in the name, the problem is yours, not mine or of any ancom.

 everyone is owner of everything but can't have his own property 

See, you're not even making any sense. If everyone is owner of everything, how come no one can have its own property? Aside from this, you're totally wrong. Communism isn't "everyone is owner of everything", it's "the workers own the means of production they use". Do you know what the means of production are, or do I have to explain it? As you seem very confused with all of this.

 As you can read it. You can't mix both communism and anarchism. This both ideologies are on the opposite side of a political spectrum. 

You didn't provide any valid argument on why you can't mix both. I gave you reasons why, you just made apologia for "anarcho-"capitalism and thought it was a justification to why communism can't be anarchist, which is just absurd. If we're going to do this, then let me tell you that society you're describing is, theoretically speaking, the opposite of anarchism. Anarchism was theorised as a socialist and anti-capitalist ideology, you're describing a capitalist society, therefore it is in no way anarchist. Use a different term if you want, regardless of if it fits your, or any, definition of anarchism, anarchism is anti-capitalist and can't be mixed with capitalism. That, and the reasons I've provided before. For a reason "an"caps are a small minority only in the USA.

 Btw dawn vote is not for disliking people. 

Didn't downvote you, but it's totally justified, as you're just throwing away shit you know nothing about and claiming "anarcho-"capitalism to be real and only anarchism, as if it was true in any way. That's just fucking disgusting, considering anarchists have been always fighting, alongside other socialists, against capitalism and for the working class, unlike you, you just want to fucking make the working class suffer more than they already do, and regardless of if you can or can't see it, that's fucking disgusting to support such ideology. </TEXT>

That's not true, it only advocates for regulating the economy and giving power to the workers (regarding the economy), that's not incompatible with anarchism, the people, workers, controlling the means of production isn't a state or anything like that.

 Anarchism is complete freedom of the unit 

Huh? Can you develop this further? Anarchism is just the rejection of involuntary hierarchies, not absolute freedom.

<TEXT> Oh yes, because a stateless, moneyless and classless society is fucking terrible, just like Nazi Germany.

Before any enlightened person comes, Leninism and Marxism-Leninism was what was put into practice in the USSR, Juche in North Korea, Maoism in China - and all of these have got something in common: they weren't/aren't communists. They were/are socialists, state capitalists, capitalists, just whatever, but not communists. How can, anyways, a country with private property and where the party doesn't represent the proletariat be communist or socialist in any way?

There are lots of forms of communism, you can't just say communism is authoritarian, that's really wrong. You can say Marxism-Leninism is authoritarian (after all, it was the ideology of Stalin), but not communism, because inside communism you find anarcho-communists, left communists, De Leonists...

<TEXT> No, it's because you're not even acknowledging my objections.  While at the same time making specific claims about other ideologies.  You're saying democracy will be perfect in your society but ancap society just won't work.  Answers to why on both counts is "just because."  You're using many words to say nothing.

It would work, in a world where the corporations didn't have the interest of making more money at the expense of getting rid of basic rights of the people. In a realist world, the corporations would abuse of anyone they want to generate wealth, and that's just why you can't give them freedom, because they'll get rid of your freedom. If that's really "anarcho-"capitalism, I think we should re-consider definitions.

 You're talking as if you came to these conclusions on your own. 

Dude, that's absurd. When I say I've learnt about existentialism, do I need to tell you all the philosophers I've read to learn about existentialism? That's just pointless. And still, an ideology or philosophy isn't represented by a single person, you arrive to your own conclusions by reading about everyone. You can't just say "anarcho-communist is better than communism" if you haven't read any communist theory, you would be locking yourself up. In order to become X, you read all the necessary books and authors, and then make criticism of all the points you've disagreed with of each to arrive to a conclusion. You arrive to your own conclusions, you make your own ideology, I doubt anyone is 100% like Marx, or 100% like Bakunin, or 100% like Rothbard. It doesn't work that way, you develop your own ideology by reading other theories first.

 Not the point. You should at least have an understanding of post modernism being an ancomm, even if you are a modernist you should have a mild understanding of what I'm talking about. But no huh? Just going to take everything literal and think there's no definitions besides the ones you know huh? 

How is that related in any way? I've said "none of them is communist" to later say "and that's any political science or economies student/economist would say, for a reason". But you're just answering to a small part of the argument, not the full argument, that's why you're constantly getting a wrong idea of my arguments, because you only focus on a small part of it, instead of the full or at least the half part.

 There are words for feelings, like schadenfreude, that we don't have in English but all understand that feeling is a real thing 

So? You don't need words to be in a specific language, or your own language, to understand them and acknowledge they have a specific definition or they exist. I'm studying Latin and I see how many Latin expressions are used in all languages, even though they could be translated, yet still they are all used in the same context and they all have the same original and specific definition. I don't get your point.

 To pretend that political words hold similar meanings across all ideologies is wrong by every metric. 

It isn't. Sure, fascists probably have a different definition of the state than an anarchist, but in political science, there's a difference between "state" and "government". Being the government able to be bottom-up instead of top-down (state). But I'm not talking about ideological definitions of political terms, but an objective, based on political science, definitions. Just search the difference between a state and a government and you'll see it's not a matter of ideology, but that there's a specific/objective definition of it. These ideological definitions of political terms are just ideological interpretations, they don't say the State is the same as a government, but that, for example, it should be the same. For a socialist, capitalism works on slavery because the worker is just property of labour and the owner of the means of production (a boss, for example), for a capitalist, slavery may just be when the people is oppressed by the law and the collectivisation socialists talk about. But there's a global and objective definition of slavery, which is using a person as a property or object. From this idea or definition, different ideologies arrive to their own interpreation of what is really slavery, as I said before, for a socialist, capitalism is slavery, for a capitalist, capitalism isn't slavery, but collectivisation is.

But I'll take my leave. I'm sobering up and this discussion is losing my interest as you seem to be talking pass me rather than reading and replying to what I'm saying. Not sure who you're talking to but it doesn't seem to be me.

Huh, you're the one constantly taking the conversation to another different topic, not me. I'm answering to everything you say. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Then stop talking like you're speaking about another group. You're also specific in your brand of anarchism so that's another clarification you need to make because all ideologies have their own jargon and understanding of concepts 

I tend to speak in third person because many people automatically think whatever you say is subjective and not objective or logical just because it's your ideology. It's also pointless what my ideology is right now, it doesn't matter if I'm an ancom, a centrist, a fascist or whatever, my arguments won't change, I don't need why you need to know my ideology and why it's so important to you that I don't speak in third person.

 You are ignoring my obvious and simple objections. Making sweeping statements about other ideologies you don't know well while ignoring obvious pitfalls in your own. I can look at the objections of my ideology and at least have a defense or admit it's a flaw. You aren't even attempting to defend your's. I'm lost why I should even continue talking with you. You're just stating flat out that I can't even illuminate you to flaws, never mind make you question your beliefs. You're in a cult, not an ideology. 

And all of this, just for explaining you what real democracy is and what is the type of democracy anarchists defend? Sorry for not understanding your logic. I also know the flaws of my ideology, I know that it can't work in a large scale, I know many countries will try to fuck up any anarchist society, I know we would surely fail at defending ourselves, I know my ideology isn't perfect and that many people won't adapt \[easily\], that's why I work for, at least, making people be more conscious and learn about what anarchism is and isn't, because it would help making a future anarchist society possible, and efficient.

I'm not even locked up on anarcho-communism. I call myself an anarcho-communist because I find it to be the most practical anarchist ideology, because otherwise I would call myself an anarcho-egoist or anarchist without adjectives, as I even advocate for an anarchist society divided in communities, each one free to organise themselves the way they want (under anarchism, of course) - but for this to be possible, we need to try these forms of organisation first. I'm also not even locked up on anarchism, I have Trotskyist sympathies and I have even enjoyed reading other communist essays, even if they advocated for statism to achieve a communist society. I disagreed with that, but I read it and given my own interpretation of it, and criticised the points I disagreed with. I'm not in a cult, I'm not even part of an ideology in specific, I just follow anarcho-communism because I like it, and find it practical.

Bullshit. Countries like Venezuela, the Nordics, even the USSR and USA are argued to be communist by some and not by others. These topics don't have singular meanings and have specific meanings and understandings in different groups. If you honestly don't know that then you're too insulated to ever be having general discussions with people because you speak a different language.

And none of them is actually communist, and any student of economics or political science can easily tell you that, and not only students of these two, but anyone with some knowledge can. It just requires a basic analysis of these countries, and even if you don't fully understand terminology used in economics and political science, you can easily identify which countries are really communist (none) and which aren't (every pseudo-communist country). Yet still, I'm saying that, in political science, there's a difference between state and government as two different political institutions/entities, even though the state is always a government, but the government isn't necessarily a state. However, many people use these two different terms interchangeably, when most of the time they're different things, in their context.

These terms have a specific definition. The fact that the average population use them as synonyms doesn't mean anything, if people started using "apples" and "pears" as synonyms, they would be wrong, but they're still using it. But "apples" and "pears" have a specific definition, even though both of them fall under the category of fruits and can be similar. I'm not speaking a different language, I'm using definitions I learnt through political science, econonomy, and other subjects - just like everyone else.

As for you long rambling in the middle it has nothing to do with what we're discussing. You don't clarify how a government differs from a state so all the rest is just pointless.

You asked me two different things. I answered you one and you started saying that I'm locked up on my ideology, without offering me an on-topic answer. The other one, you didn't give me an answer, which is the long answer I gave, which is about how "anarcho-"capitalism eventually leads to statism and why anarchism wouldn't. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  First of all, are you an anarchist or are you talking for a group you think you understand? I identify as an anarchist and it's weird for someone to tell me how I view things.

I'm an anarcho-communist and have been studying it for years, enough to know about it.

This isn't an argument, it's an empty assumption. Why would an ancap society surely become a fascist state but a lib left society democracy just can't create a government?

I don't need to give you an argument again, I've already given the argument to you. Direct democracy doesn't consist of votes and people representing others, you just represent yourself and become part of the government, you don't need votes or anything for that, that's why what you were describing wouldn't happen in an anarchist society, because it would be incompatible with anarchism.

"Anarcho-"capitalists don't generally understand that the State and the police are the friends of the bourgeoisie and capitalists, meaning that they actively enforce private property \[laws\] and they, in almost every country nowadays, not allow their economies to pass of "social democratic", which isn't much socialist, if any socialist. The State, in a capitalist society, protects private property and rich people from ceasing to exist and granting them privileges that other people can't have, because of their economical status. The police, which is, in a way that you're able to understand me, "a puppet of the state", meaning that every enemy of the state, is an enemy of the police. But at the same time, the State recognises how dangerous a bussiness can be if it starts governing, because the State has more interests other than economical ones, a bussiness governing would be driven by economical interests, which is why it will eventually turn out to be, any corporatist society, fascist, because they only care about capitalism and they want to extremely enforce it, and what's the best way to enforce it? Fascism.

The moment you get rid of the State in a capitalist society, you're losing a protector, a friend who tries to make sure you won't damage anyone for your own interests. So when you get rid of the State, the police ceases to exist too and private authorities, mercenaries or vigilantes, appear. The corporation with most power will eventually get power, as nothing is stopping it, and start a corporatist society. And I highly doubt this society will be democratic in any way, because the moment there's democracy, there's no corporatist rule. So, you must find a way to make sure corporations won't abuse of their power and take advantage of their freedom, and that is, by limiting or regulating them. Eventually, your society will no longer be "anarcho-"capitalist, it will be other form of anarchism, capitalist with a state and many other options, but not "anarcho-"capitalism: it has never been "anarcho-"capitalist.

Lib-left, just like lib-right, is full of diversities, but lib-left is even more diverse. You can have 2000 forms of anarchism on lib-left, you can have left libertarianism, less authoritarian forms of communism and socialism, social democracy and many more I can think of, and I must say I just categorised all of them, because if I were specific, it would have 100 ideologies of differences with lib-right. That means, that we can't generalise with lib-left at all, and it's better to be specific about this one, because left-communists could be considered lib-left and they're different from ancoms.

Anarchists believe that the State is the friend of capitalism, even a tool, because it also benefits the state more than it does socialism. The main reason why I find that anarchism (not "anarcho-"capitalism) wouldn't eventually lead to statism is because anarchists have a deeper analysis of their societies and how to achieve them compared to "an"caps. Plus, the fact that some communists would support us in our revolution, while a 95% of libertarians wouldn't support "an"caps and find it to be an absurd ideology, not worth being tried and risking anything for it. This lack of support makes it hard for the ideology to ever happen, and the lack of alternatives to make it happen, or an anaylisis, makes it already more impossible, because people would remain skeptical of the sustaintability of this ideology and, indeed, it could go really bad, because of a lack of anylisis.

 Stop making universal claims and expecting me to conform. 

I said "political science". Just like when I say "communism is a stateless, classless and moneyless society" I don't have to be specific about anything or provide sources, if you don't know that it's because you didn't investigate about the topic, not because you need sources.

<TEXT> Dude, that's not something anarchists haven't thought about, anarchism is organised in small-scale communities for a reason.

The people who collect, process and implement the vote have larger power than those who don't.

The thing is that this wouldn't happen in an anarchist society.

This is word play, not an argument and you draw a conclusion with no evidence.

No, it's not a word play. Political science differentiates the state and the government as not always been together the same, and that the government can be separated of the State if the State is removed, but the State is a government itself. It's not a word play, because "communism" has a definition that cannot be altered, you can add your own opinion and interpretation of the definition of communism, but not make it the 'original definition' or use at a synonym with the original definition - it's the same, you can't use the State and the government as synonyms, either you use State to refer to a State, or you use government to refer to a non statist government. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, that's not the real definition of democracy. Modern democracy (parliamentary, representative...) is just a bunch of bullshit that has zero similarities with the original greek purpose of democracy. The greek's original definition of democracy is nowadays called "direct democracy", and is when no one is represented by another person, but everyone represents itself, individually. Therefore, you don't need votes or anything.

Also, a govenrment isn't incompatible with anarchism, all societies require a government, but not a State. The moment you don't have a government, and therefore a State, your society turns out to be chaos.

Also a key function of fascism is companies working in tandem with the government, again, no government fascism doesn't exist.

You're again using state and government as synonyms. Anarchists don't oppose the government, but the State. The State is a top-down institution which is inherently incompatible with anarchism, the government can be made by the people and for the people, and that's compatible with anarchism, if everyone is part of the government.

Also, imagine corporations took power, there would be a state, and that's the issue and why it would be considered fascist, because a state would emerge from these corporations. </TEXT>

Certainly, the anarchists did attack first, but after the Church sided with the nationalists which already attacked the anarchists first. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The average population nowadays think the police's job is to enforce the law to prevent crimes. Reality is:

1. These people are always criticising "violent" protesters, be it against a cop or anything/anyone else, but they can't see that the police actively use violence to enforce - things -.
2. When they enforce the law, they do it just because of image and reputation, not because it's their job. Anyone can enforce laws, and you don't require authority to do so. You can see this in small groups, for example in school projects.
3. Cops enforce private property laws and serve, not only capitalism and owners, but also the State. As anarchism is both anti-capitalist and anti-statist by nature, it can't support an institution that serves the only purpose of protecting the two main things it opposes, the State and capitalism.
4. It's not unusual to see cops absuing of their power and authority. No matter how good the person is, power can always break people down, anyone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Anarcho-communism is a form of communism, even if many communists don't like it. Ancoms just disagree with other communists with the way to achieve a communist society, but that happens with everyone in communism, leftcoms propose different things than marxists, yet still leftcoms are communists.

Also, there are two reasons why "anarcho-"capitalism wouldn't be represented inside anarchism. One, which is debatable, is the fact that it can't be considered anarchist, by its original definition and the fact that it was theorised as a socialist ideology. The other, which isn't debatable, is that HOI4 (unless you use some mods which change dates) is set on the 1930s, "anarcho-"capitalism wasn't used until the 1960s, before then, anarchism wasn't considered capitalist by anyone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You don't oppose it, you take away their power, wanting it or not. That's pretty much how it's been working like since the industrial revolution, and it's not to be trusted that easily anymore.

 if workers are allowed to own means of production, that capitalism will cease to exist 

That's absurd and wrong, I never claimed that. Getting rid of capitalism is rather a slow process, giving the workers full ownership of the means of production won't make a society communist/socialist, but it will sure combat capitalism this way, as there would be no private property. Therefore, it's the lack of private property what causes damage to capitalism, not collective ownership, from example, because I know it can still be possible under capitalism (another thing is if the state or owners, the bourgeoisie, allow them to freely own the means of production, which is what I'm skeptical of, mainly).

Practice tends to be different from theory, which is the reason why I criticise and condemn capitalism, because as you say "communism sounds only good on paper" I say "capitalism sounds only good on paper", and we both have our reasons. 

 Private security forces? Sure. 

This is another reason why I can't seriously consider "an"caps anarchists. Private security forces imply coercive authority-hierarchies, which are inherently against anarchists' vision of a better and more fair society, where freedom is valuable as long as it doesn't affect another person's freedom (equality). That's what anarchism was based of, and which "anarcho-"capitalism's idea of private security forces being totally compatible, automatically separates itself from anarchism. Allowing this will mean allowing a full professional military, a police and such - which in no way can be seen as anarchist.

So-called "security forces" require violence and power, which many of you seem to deeply criticise, which is why I can't understand how can you find this to be compatible with your ideology. Just asking before I give any opinion about it, because maybe I'm wrong and you don't really believe in that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There wouldn't either be taxes in anarcho-communism, because money wouldn't be needed. The thing is that we believe that taxes should exist, but enough to distribute to the public sectors, from the rich to the poor, and the workers receiving enough to live by, not less or more than they need. Capitalism fails on all of these, which is why we oppose it.

Once you get rid of economical classes, you'll no longer be forcing the rich to pay, since there aren't rich people, therefore you can't conclude that anarcho-communism is forceful. As it also requires popular support, anyone under an anarcho-communist society knows that (s)he must adapt or leave, but not stay and sabotage everything because they want to live in a capitalist paradise, which is unable to exist (same with a communist paradise). We should seek the most logical, fair and practical systems, rather than the ones that only benefits the individual while crushing down others.

 The current system, state-capitalism aka corporatism 

State capitalism isn't corporatism and I don't know to which system are you referring to, because only a minority can be classified as state-capitalist.

Regardless of if you oppose corporatism, "anarcho-"capitalism runs the risk of turning into a corporatist system rather what it is, in theory, meant to be. Similar to when many people say communism eventually leads to authoritarianism, when it isn't an authoritarian ideology - generally. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  However, it seems like most anarchists these days 

It has always been like this, original anarchists (as well as original libertarians) were socialist anarchists, which theorised and complemented anarchism as a socialist anti-capitalist ideology, rather than a capitalist one. It was in the 1960s when "anarcho-"capitalism started being a thing, only in America, and never developed that much, especially in the rest of the world.

 because it controls peoples lives in some way 

It's not because of that, it's because we find private property to not be a natural right, nor an agreeable one, but rather an exploitative and opressive one, which we find to be against our ideals and principles, following original anarchists' criticism of capitalism and definition of anarchism.

While, AFAIK, no anarchist has ever defined anarchist as the rejection of unjustified (involuntary) hierarchies, in theory, it was defined indirectly like such. Opposition to the state because it helps to enforce private property and is an opressive entity, the police for serving the state and private property (and enforcing private property and laws with violence) and capitalism for depending on opressive and exploitative hierarchies, in which the bourgeoisie is the new ruling class that has privileges over the proletariat. The bourgeoisie revolution didn't end with the feudal classes, but rather replaced them in a way that it could benefit the bourgeoisie, so it's not absurd to compare feudalism with capitalism and see there weren't many differences, at all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> anarchy =/= anarchism

Anarchy was even used as a state of chaos and disorder caused by a lack of governing body, not a simple lack of ruler where people lived fairly. Anarchism, as an ideology, was theorised as part of socialism.

Also, how is not capitalism coercive and forceful? What about the workers who want to own property alongside the bourgeoisie-capitalist/owner? If every worker part of a means of production want to own them, according to you, they should be able to own them, otherwise you can only stop them with violence. And if you let them own the means of production, you'll soon or later stop living under an "an"cap society, and the only thing that would be able to keep society as capitalist would be force and violence, which is why capitalism required a state and a police, to enforce private property and make sure it isn't stolen or owned by someone else. That's why, if I was a capitalist, I wouldn't support "anarcho-"capitalism (amongst other reasons, which right now are irrelevant). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let me take a couple of guesses as to what the leftist will attempt to argue; A mythological set of tenets that was never put into practice, or that was put into practice but failed instantly. Use of Disregard linear time fallacy coupled with the standard red herring/strawman arguments that his type always uses, let's take a look.

Your ideology hasn't been either tried, but you're still supporting it and I guess trying to make it happen, right? Your point is absurd.

Who gives a fuck.  
  
Do you have an argument to present?  
  
Did you know that the investigator/physicist that posited the original framework for the big bang was a catholic priest, Georges Lematre?  
  
Does this matter at all? no, it's completely irrelevant, it is a red herring even in the context of a discussion about the big bang. Understand? no I know you do not. Your grasp of logic and reason appear to be tenuous at best.

The ideology was created as a socialist and anti-capitalist one, so you can't now go and say it can be or is capitalist. Also, how do will you enforce private property without the police and the state, which are the ones who nowadays enforce private property? How can you think the boss-worker hierarchies are anarchist and free? How can you think inequality is a characteristic of anarchism? How can you think an owner of a land or any private property is compatible with anarchism? You're insane if you really think that's anarchism.

 Are they right leaning politicians? no, they're all leftists, obviously. 

Yeah, and Hitler and Mussolini were right-wing fascists, yet still not every right winger is a fascist, don't you think? Keep giving pointless and nonsensical arguments, you'll just give yourself a bad reputation.

That's what we call an "opinion" and is completely worthless due to being subjectivist in nature. Also nice job cucking out, leftist.

So racism, islamophobia, sexism and such should be unrestricted? Do you think a society can progress and live fairly this way, when tolerance doesn't exist and discrimination is a trend? No, thanks, I'd rather live in a corrupt dictatorship than in a society where people discriminate me for what I've chosen to be and for what I haven't chosen to be. You suck.

Then you are a racist because you conflated libertarian with socialist. Only a racist would make such a degenerate, dishonest, Trotskyist level statement claiming that libertarians are socialists.

Now saying that libertarianism is originally and can be socialist is now racism? Take a dictionary and learn some words, cunt. And why do you relate Trotskyists with this? It has no relationship, you just sound like a troll trying to get some attention and that's even more pathetic, you're breaking the record of "patheticness", dude.

You are a racist but even worse, you're a leftist.

You're the racist and the islamophobe, saying islam is a religion of terrorism, sucker. And I can guess you're a sexist too by your name, wouldn't surprise me. "Libertarian/minarchist" sure, you're just a crypto-fascist.

<TEXT> the anarchists were only a part of the entire political structure, catalonia was still effectively using a state. 

Catalonia had the regional government, la Generalitat, which was weak and gave up, and gave power to the anarchists. Then the CNT joined the government, but it wasn't using a state, and in any case, it wasn't powerful, quite the opposite actually.

 PCE and USSR did not fuck them over 

The PCE followed Stalin, which is why I think they actually backstabbed the anarchists, because it's part of Stalin, killing anyone who disagreed with him. Saying that the PCE didn't cooperate with the Catalan government to take the anarchist revolution down is ignoring historical facts, honestly.

if you dont know your history maybe shut the fuck up.

1. I'm catalan, so I'm pretty sure I know enough about the history of where I live.
2. I was only asking, but thanks for being rude for no reason, it's for people like you that I never talk on communist spaces, because either I get downvoted or insulted, or I get banned by tankies.

My question was why did the PCE decided to not help the anarchists or let them go at their own, which with luck could've maybe helped within the civil war in a quasi-perfect world, but you're even making me ask why did it backstab the revolution then, if it was supposedly that similar to Leninism.

Off topic, I can't truly believe in some parts, as I lack from statistics and any proof, for example the "collectivisation of industries was forced" when actually the revolution was supported by almost everyone, and those who didn't support it either adapted, or voluntarily left (or died if you were a Franco supporter).

So again, if you're going to accept that the PCE backstabbed the CNT and the Revolutionary Catalonia, would you mind answering which reason was behind it? Wanting to recover the region? Strategic reasons for the civil war? Simply because they disliked anarchists? </TEXT>

Here comes the political ignorant! Do you know the ones who theorised anarchism were socialists, and theorised it as a socialist ideology? Do you know there have been 200 years of history of anarchism, and the socialist current has been more popular than the "an"cap which only exists in America and is still a minority in America?

Go read some theory and history, dude.

the left has **islam**

Wtf? Leftists are the firsts to criticise Islam and try to stop them, most islamic politicians are right-wing, not left-wing, lol.

the religion of terrorism

Just for this you should be banned from this website, dude. There's no "religion of terrorism", that's what racists say, which makes me think you're just a fucking racist. By the way, if we're talking about deaths committed by people representing certain religion, catholicism is the winner, not islam.

antifa

Antifa isn't a terrorist or criminal organisation, it has no structure and anyone who actively opposes fascism, is anti-fascist (antifa = antifascism). If you just don't like fascism and do nothing, you're not antifa, you're an average person who lets fascism empower itself by not combating it in any way.

When was the last time the right fielded hundreds of armed combatants to violently riot in a city?

Well, have you heard of fascist marches?

The black bloc has surely contributed more to anarchism and democracy than you or anyone from your "libertarian" ideology (a stolen term from real and original anarchists), which is why you'll never be successful, because you rely on the system to help you get into power, when only a minority wants you in power, which makes you even more pathetic. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Anarchism is an anti-authoritarian political philosophy 

This part is absurd, many ideologies are anti-authoritarian. What anarchism is, is against, as you've just quoted, against involuntary, which are considered unjust, hierarchies, which historically have always been "the state, the police, organised religion and those created by capitalism, such as the boss-worker hierarchy and the ownership and existence of private property, especially if not regulated". Therefore, "anarcho-"capitalism isn't anarchist. 

"However, there is a strong current within anarchism which believes that **anarcho-capitalism cannot be considered a part of the anarchist movement** due to the fact that **anarchism has historically been an anti-capitalist movement** and for definitional reasons which **see anarchism as** **incompatible** **with capitalist forms**."

"Hence, it might be true to say that anarchism is a cluster of political philosophies opposing authority and hierarchical organization (including the state, **capitalism**, nationalism and all associated institutions) in the conduct of all human relations in favour of a society based on voluntary association, on freedom and on decentralisation,"

I never said it isn't in the wikipedia, but even the wikipedia says it all, it isn't recognised as an anarchist ideology by other anarchists (which is a 90% vs a 10%, more or less, tbh) and it even says that anarchists are opposed to capitalism. Don't know if you did seriously read the full wikipedia article, just the parts that interest you or everything and decided to ignore these points. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not the reason for it not to be an oxymoron. Since Anarchism and Communism are by nature incompatible it's an oxymoron

They're not incompatible by nature, they're not incompatible at all. Marxism, Left Communism, De Leonism and such are incompatible with anarchism, not communism. I've already said what communism constitutes, and that from this idea, many ideologies with the purpose of telling how should we achieve this society arise, be it Marxism, Luxembourgism or anarcho-communism, all of them are communist ideologies. But sure, anarcho-communism is also anarchist.

Yeah, we hear that all the time. The USSR never had anything to do with communism, sure. Convenient...

Well, tell me then, what did it have to make you think it was communist or socialist?

 We were talking about communist (marxist) not socialists. 

Socialism existed before communism, theoretically speaking, just like anarchism, and communism is heavily influenced by socialism, and it even is considered part of the transition by many communists. Not only that, but socialism also includes ideologies like anarchism and communism, it's not only used as "public ownership of the means of production".

 There are a lot more reasons then just a couple of failed tries who killed millions: it's irrelevant and unsound. 

That's, again, wrong. Communism did kill anyone, because communism hasn't been achieved. What failed and killed millions of people was Marxism-Leninism, Maoism... Not communism.

Yeah yeah, with some fucking commie semantic, and all the bullshit.

Sorry for being this hostile, but I can't take you seriously if you don't even seem to know what you're talking about or understand what I'm saying, it's like as if you were afraid of at least agreeing on anything, regardless of if you think it's true or not. Analysis and reforms don't mean "semantics and dialectics" necessarily, that's some Marxist thing, but anything necessary to improve the ideology and the means to achieve it is different.

 Suuuuure. 

How does capitalism help climate change? With a communist state, the state will regulate bussinesses so they won't exploit the environment, and this could even be considered as progress. Capitalism is out of date and not to be trusted anymore, if you want to keep using it, then you're doing the same many people were doing with feudalism when it was starting to fail, trying to not progress.

 I'm not saying it's a literal dictatorship but it's a dictatorship that use authoritarianism 

It doesn't have to necessarily be authoritarian, what you've got in mind is Stalin's authoritarian regime which other Marxists, like Trotsky, opposed, and payed with their lives because of it. I agree that Marxism eventually leads to tyranny and authoritarianism, and the dictatorship of the party, which has been historically proven, but that doesn't mean the ideology is authoritarian, but that the results are authoritarian. But afortunately, there are more alternatives other than Marxism.

Also, Marx was criticising anti-authoritarian movements, like anarchism, and didn't say that he advocated for authoritarianism, but that the revolution is authoritarian (which I totally disagree with). Also, communism has never been tried, so you can't say it won't work and it hasn't worked before, because we never achieved communism, and there are many ways proposed to achieve communism that hasn't been tried so far. Yet still, we got closer through anarchism to communism than to capitalism, and we got closer than other communists - doesn't this fact already speak for itself? </TEXT>

<TEXT> The final goal is not the issue anyway, it always has been the way to reach it. Anarcho-communism is an oxymoron, as the idea of a communist state... which communist wants...

It isn't an oxymoron, again, communism is the final goal of every communist, and communism is a stateless, moneyless and classless society. Communists differ with anarcho-communists in the way to achieve communism, not in the way to organise communism.

"Long before me, bourgeois historians had described the historical development of this struggle between the classes, as had bourgeois economists their economic anatomy. My own contribution was to show that the existence of classes is merely bound up with certain historical phases in the development of production; that the class struggle necessarily leads to the dictatorship of the proletariat; that this dictatorship, itself, constitutes no more than a transition to the abolition of all classes and to a classless society  
  
Karl Marx, 1852

Okay, where does Marx says he advocates for authoritarianism or a literal dictatorship? The dictatorship of the proletariat isn't like Hitler's nazi dictatorship, for example.

 Oh, that's pretty convenient! Anyway it still needs authoritarianism, you're not going to take and abolish property without that. 

That's different, what they advocate for isn't equal to what they need. They may want to achieve communism through democracy, but maybe it requires a strong and centralised state. The thing is that we don't know because communism has never been achieved and the closest country to communism was too busy with other things.

Well, every communist country has been authoritarian, isn't it? How are you imposing a change of the whole economy and society without coercion?

So, 4 pseudo-communist countries have existed and exist (even though none of them were even socialist), and they automatically represent and constitute what communism is. Sounds legit.

You can impose a change with popular support, a peaceful revolution, democracy...  You ask how we impose the change of a whole economy and society without coercion, but it has been happening since the last century.

 Engels himself told that state capitalism would be a part of the transition toward a communist society. So they are as communist you can be in a way... 

If they were state capitalist, they weren't communists, regardless of if that was part of the transition, which not every communist follows and agrees on. Now, yeah, maybe state capitalism was part of the transition in, for example, the USSR, but it had been state capitalist since its early times, and you're telling me that in almost half a century they weren't able of getting past industrialisation and state capitalism? Or that the DPRK isn't even state capitalist?

 Anyway I don't know what's your point. Are you trying to prove that communsim is entirely bullshit? Because on that I agree. 

No. Communism isn't bullshit, Marxism is bullshit. As Bakunin said, the State will always evolve into a tyranny that supports nothing other than a ruling class and the party. Marx was warned, he didn't want to listen.

Because anarcho-communism is itself a complete oxymoron.

It isn't. Anarchism is anti-statism and against involuntary hierarchies, and it is compatible with both having currency and not having, so it totally fits with the "stateless, moneyless and classless" society that communism is about.

 EVEN! The basically always did... 

No. That's historically and objectively wrong, before anarchism many socialists who would nowadays be described as anarchists did have good vibes with other socialists.

The idea of communism is stolen from anarchists anyway... It just Marx who appropriated an idea and put some sort of copyright over it. But you can make the difference in that anarchism ends with "communism" without the use of authoritarianism while communism go toward a communist state by the use of coercion and authoritarianism.

What the fuck, no, we didn't invent or stole any definition from Marxism or Communism, we even come from communists and socialists, smh. Marx didn't focus on communism that much, as the description I've told before, but on class struggle and capitalism, and ways to combat it. That's why this description of a "stateless, moneyless and classless" society isn't famous, because Marx and Engels didn't focus much on this. But go on and ask a communist in r/communism101 what they advocate for, and you'll see it's the same definition.

We just think we shouldn't use the State as a tool, for the rest, we agree with most communists.

 lol.. "tHaTs nOt rEaL cOmMuNiSm." I was waiting for it... 

Well, next time you seriously analyse the USSR's political and economical policies, or any other communist country, you DM me and you, honestly, tell me if it was really communist.

Wtf... The communist league was founded by them... If you want to talk about who were named communists before the Communist Manifesto we gonna have to talk about another subject. Marx and Engels completely hijacked the term, as usual with them.

I mean, yes, they theorised it, but just like anarchism, we could say it already existed before. Marx and Engels were inspired by the Paris Commune, which they considered to be a good example of socialism, and after analysing it, they decided to arrive to a conclusion on how to achieve this kind of society and developed it. Even anarchists existed during the Paris Commune.

 It's the fucking title of your thread... 

I didn't make this thread...

 Anyway, communism and marxism aren't relevant. Never produced a communist state. 

That's no reason to discredit it and not try to help it happen. Communism sounds good on paper, anyone claiming otherwise is, seriously speaking, out of his/her mind. And it could even help us nowadays, regarding progress, climate change and such, it's not something to be thrown away. But it's something that requires more analysis and reforms. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're just saying that communism=anarchism. Anarchism precede communism and real anarchists reject communism and the definition you just gave.

Communists' final goal is the same of anarcho-communists' final goal. Therefore, "full communism" is just anarcho-communism, and anarcho-communism is just "full communism".

 Anyway, saying that communism and its authoritarianism can lead to communism as a stateless, moneyless and classless society is beyond stupidity. It's non-sensical anyway. 

I didn't say it does, but many communists think it does and can. Marx and Engels didn't think that, anyway.

 Still a dictatorship, still authoritarian 

No, the dictatorship of the proletariat isn't a literal dictatorship, and if it were, it isn't the typical dictatorship you think of, because it's the dictatorship of a majoritarian group (wouldn't that be similar to democracy?). The dictatorship of the proletariat consists of giving power to the proletariat, and from this idea you can have a dictatorship or a democratic government, as long as it gives the proletariat power, it's a dictatorship of the proletariat, because it serves the proletariat, not a ruling class.

 If we have to define every type of "communism" we end up with no definition of communism 

That's not the point, but if you don't want to acknowledge the fact that your claim that communism is authoritarian is absurd and not based on actual facts, then let's not mention more democratic communist ideologies that even oppose authoritarianism, okay?

 Today must communist parties have rejected the revolution, and others tenants of communism, are they communist 

Most communist parties are revolutionary, but revolution doesn't come in a day. It requires time, support and organisation, which most communist parties nowadays don't have, and those who do aren't actually pursuing their dreams, but the opposite. China and north korea are, for example, state capitalist, they have free markets, free trade... They're not communist or socialist in any way, nor their parties.

 your question is stupid. 

How is it stupid? You're claiming that communism is authoritarian, but there are anti-authoritarian communist ideologies, and you're totally ignoring that.

 Yeah they are anarchists who still believe some of the bullshit of daddy Marx 

Anarchists aren't Marxists, and even anarchist clashes against communists (Marxists) caused the division of the internarnational. All anarchists oppose Marxism, but not necessarily communism. Communism isn't Marxism, Marxism is communism. Marx and Engels didn't create communism or socialism, their writings on this topic is influenced by considered socialist societies, like the Paris Commune, already existing before the Communit Manifesto.

 Anyway, what's your point, you start by saying "Anarcho Communism isn't real" and now you define it like it's relevant 

???? When did I say it isn't real? </TEXT>

You're the one who doesn't know what you're talking about...

 That's a communist society, communism is the way to go there and it involves a strong state, AKA the dictature of the people... its stupid therefore because it makes no sense. 

No. Communism is a stateless, moneyless and classless society, a society sharing this is an anarchist/anarcho-communist or communist society. And it isn't about dictatorships, at least not originally, the dictatorship of the PROLETARIAT, is different from a dictatorship of the party (USSR) or any other dictatorship. You should read Marx and Engels, seriously.

A socialist society is the goal of the anarchists too (the left one) except that they reject authoritarianism, therefore the clash with the communists.

Left communists, Council communists, Luxembourgists, De Leonists and such communists are authoritarian too? That's just like saying "all right-wing is authoritarian except for libertarianism/'anarcho'-capitalism", that's absurd and not true.

The term anarcho-capitalism sticks as much as anarcho-communism.

It doesn't. Anarcho-communists are communists who simply believe the State isn't a tool for the proletariat, and instead is a tool for capitalism and the bourgeoise, and therefore we should get rid of it instead of using it. They're still communist, even if in a libertarian-anarchist way. They advocate for a stateless, moneyless and classless society, just like other communists. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, but who cares about facts here? Capitalism is the best thing, no need to spread and know the truth! /s

Instead of being open minded and analyse political ideologies, most people here just read Rothbard or a youtube video about how capitalism is the best and they immediately think "communism bad, capitalism good" "communism can't work if it's not capitalist!" (notice the irony on this one) "socialism is when we have nothing and the government does stuff!"

What those people don't know is that we already live anarchist socialism, and what you've said is an example, as there are many cooperatives running in an anarchist way nowdays, and it works. Why wouldn't it work under socialism instead of capitalism/social democracy?

If anyone believes capitalism can be compatible with anarchism, alright, I disagree and I'll tell why. What you can't say is "anarcho-communism isn't real anarchism" when actually, socialists were the ones who theorised anarchism and "an"caps, who were nothing else than liberals, just coined the term. I sometimes don't know if it's a lack of knowledge on history and politics, or that it's part of their propaganda against the left. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm tired of explaining this. Nihilism is about the universe, in the sense that "nothing matters", "everything is pointless" and "nothing is of value", including morality, means "universally, nothing matters, everything is pointless and nothing is of value, because the universe can't understand nor create these concepts and put them in practice". A nihilist can be whatever it wants, if a nihilist wants to live a meaningful life, he's totally free, because, according to nihilism, there's no right or wrong path, objectively, so "right and wrong" are only subjective values that, regardless of if they really exist or not, you still use.

Nihilism doesn't justify anything, and just because some people are edgy and lack a basic understanding on nihilism, it doesn't mean every nihilist is like that, and it doesn't discredit a philosophy, same with a political ideology and whatever. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't get the point, when we believe facts and truth exist, but it's not possible to be sure of these so-called "truths" and "facts" being right. Just putting God as an example, there have been proves on both its existence and its non-existence, but we won't ever be able to know if God is real, because if he is real, we won't have it easy to discover it, and if he isn't real, well, how will you arrive to this conclusion? So you just use logic to arrive to a conclusion, which can be that it is real, or that it isn't real, but it's not an absolute truth/fact, it's just a personal observation.

That's what nihilism basically says, we don't negate, we simply know we can't know everything and be sure of what's considered to be right, not even proven by scientific means sometimes, so more than negating it's about questioning. </TEXT>

First of all, anarchism is not an anti-government ideology, while the CNT did wrong in joining the government - it wasn't forced or coercive, and this 'government' focused on helping the workers and organise everything, yet still everyone could be heard. Instead of criticising how they at first didn't trust women in joining militias, you're criticising it for being part of the government, which isn't necessarily incompatible with anarchism (if you know the differences between a government and a State).

Regardless of if, for example the Revolutionary Catalonia, was an anarchist society (though it could have been libertarian, in the original sense of the word), it did achieve something, the most relevant and known one is reducing the maximum working hours to eight. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Funny though - we, socialist anarchists, the only real anarchists, were the ones who theorised anarchism and started using the ideology first, as well as libertarianism. Not only that, but the typical thought of communism being authoritarianism and anti-liberty is ignorant and mainly used as anti-communist propaganda, and using this absurd point is ruining your own reputation. Also, communism requires people to be responsible, or else you'll fuck yourself up, and everyone else.

 want to force their ideology with violence 

We may use violence, but in self-defense. We don't force anything, we require popular support.

You know, I don't care about getting downvoted by assholes who are invisible outside America who, apart from ignoring actual facts, most of them don't even open a single book from the left or at least read the wikipedia articles. If you care so much about reputation, go read some books and get informed before saying crap.

I hope you enoy my rant and my class of leftist ideologies, because not even Marxism proposes authoritarianism.

*By the way, I'm giving more details on something I've said: you only exist in the USA. Anarchism and libertarianism (or "libertarian", as libertarianism isn't even an ideology but a synonym of "anarchist" outside the USA) only mean what you call socialist or leftist anarchism, casually where it was most popular. If you really think you own the right to claim to be real anarchists, your brain is as dead as Rothbard. You think anarchism is self-contradictory? Okay, then get a new term and stop using the term "anarchist". You're only triggering pointless discussions when you're not even going to get anything done, as not even other capitalists like you and your ideology.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> We advocate for a society without involuntary hierarchies, which we, mainly, consider to be the State (not the government), any institution related with the State, such as the police (also because they protect private property), organised religions and hierarchies formed by capitalism, like the "boss-worker" one or the economical classes, which somehow many people think this can be voluntary.

From this idea, there are several ways of organising an anarchist society, from anarcho-communism to individualism, to mutualism. But remember, capitalism isn't and can't ever be part of anarchism. </TEXT>

Because then, all the movements managed by people of colour to emancipate themselves from oppression is racist, according to you.

Meaning: a movement for black people, comprised only of black people, doesn't allow white people because, for example, they're skeptical or want to fight alone. Is it racism, even though white people aren't even oppressed and almost no one discriminates white people?

making a group of black people, excluding white people, just because you want to be with black people without oppressing, descriminating or attacking white people, is apparently racism according to you.

Same thing. You're not oppressing or discriminating any race, just excluding them. If you're making a group for your friends only, you're not oppressing, attacking or discriminating non-friends of yours, but you just want to spend time in a group with only your friends. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Kinda depends on where you live and what's going on there. For example, if nationalism is a common thing where you live, saying you're an anarchist publicly won't help you much, probably.

Anyways, when I said I was an anarchist only one person approached me to change my mind (he didn't even know how to convince me of his shitty opinions). My family also discovered it and my father told me it was a silly thing, yet still never told me to stop thinking by myself or anything like that.

But the thing is that it didn't benefit me in any way, to be honest. If I didn't came out as an anarchist, things would've been the same. But sometimes you can't resist the temptation to criticise state and capitalist apologists. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, you might be reffering to state, not government. Anarchists are anti-statist, but not anti-government.

You wouldn't become a ruling class, because a ruling class would be fix. If X person becomes a majority while voting, according to you, this person becomes part of a ruling class. But if he becomes a minority the next time, he won't be part of the ruling class. In order to be a ruling class, it shouldn't depend on things like voting and such.

Also, it can't either be a ruling class. Because ignoring this argument, a ruling class rules, as the name says, above other classes. But the majority doesn't rule, but the government does, and everyone is part of the government, therefore there's no ruling class.

And if the ruling class is inconsisten with democracy, it is inconsistent with anarchism too. And since under capitalism ruling classes (focused on economy) are always present, capitalism is inconsistent with anarchism, while communism doesn't require any ruling classes, rather than that, communism even seeks to get rid of these ruling classes. </TEXT>

Didn't say it's okay, but it's voluntary, and if it's voluntary, accepted by a 95% of the population, why would they later oppose it if everything goes the way they wanted?

Of course, because everyone is part of the government nowadays in these so-called "democracies". /s

 How about no government at all? 

You can't have no government, it's always the individual, a collective or a single person that's a government, but the only way I see to have no government is through chaos and disorder.

 Ancaps do believe in the Self-Defense principle 

In order to enforce the NAP and the self-defense principle, you'll require a government, be it the individual enforcing it itself, or a collective/single person. Otherwise, without a government, you can't enforce it in any way, as people just would do whatever they want, and that means not caring about the NAP and the self-defense principle. </TEXT>

More or less. You can still sell your personal property. I would describe private property as the means of production: factories, offices, tools of a job...

Okay, you are not an anarchist, because you believe that the majority have the legitimate right to deprive the minority of their life, liberty, and/or property.

No, for three reasons:

1. Again, it requires popular support, those who support it know that they are accepting being not able to always win.
2. There are other ways of doing it, by trying to convince everyone and changing the proposal in a way that everyone agrees, for example.
3. Anarchism is when everyone has a voice and can participate in the system, not when everyone is happy and everyone's proposals can be accepted, because it's impossible, it doesn't matter what kind of government or system you have, you can't always conform everyone.

 thats still tyranny. 

Then anarchism, all types of democracy, liberalism, libertarianism, totalitarianism and fascism are all tyrannies. Right, we've got no other form of government rather than tyranny.

What would you do in these cases? Because the other alternative is real tyranny or statism, and that's inconsistent with your ideology too, right? </TEXT>

I read books which actually answer to what's anarchism (not anarchy). You probably never opened a book about anarchism, and that's why you've got no idea about what anarchism is and isn't.

 What you're referring to is Voluntaryism if it isn't state involvement. 

It's not voluntaryism wtf, and of course there's no state involvement, there's GOVERNMENT involvemente, and everyone is part of this government, so it's anarchism, not voluntaryism or anything like that.

<TEXT>  Oh, so in that case I will be free to say no thanks, Ill keep my private property, and then I can expect to be left alone and continue on about my business? 

No. Imagine a society divided by communes-communities, which function with a direct democratic form of government. If everyone in the commune you're part of wants you out for keeping your private property, it's voluntary and you've got no other option than leaving the commune. But even if you think this is coercive, you should know that you're participating in a society where everyone completely disagrees with you - what do you expect to happen? 

 If I cannot have private property, then I cannot, for instance, own a house. 

A house isn't counted as private property. Private property are work spaces (factories, offices...), work tools and such. There's a possibility that communal houses exist, however.

 who am I to stop him? 

It's your family's house, and also yours, and no one has the right to take it away from you, especially without a valid reason. You should then just report it to the rest of the commune-community and decide what to do. But in this hypothetical case, everyone would have a house under a socialist society, be it anarchist or communist or literal socialist.

 After all, its not my house, right? 

It's your house. Your phone is also yours. What isn't yours is the means of production, which is owned by everyone who works with these means of production. If you do, fine, you own them, alongside others working with you. If you don't work with these means of production, they're not yours.

 the food wasnt his property to begin with, right? 

You're just confused about terms. Private property isn't the same as personal property. We don't want to get rid of personal property, but private property.

 because she does not own her body, right? 

It's her body. Dude, anarchists have always been feminists and supporters of women's emancipation, idk why would you think we would allow this and find it morally acceptable.

 I mean this is just ridiculous. You take away private property and you lose the foundation for morality. 

I'm not going to answer to this because you didn't understand the difference between private and personal property, which is a basic difference. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not sure what you mean by "executive sense" but now you sound like an ancap.

Government hierarchies and its bootlicker institutions (police, army, sometimes organised religion). It doesn't sound like "anarcho-"capitalism in any way, huh.

 Which is it: do you oppose all hierarchies, or only the involuntary hierarchical monopoly on violence commonly known as the state?  

You can't get rid of all hierarchies, and some can be justified and useful. Therefore, I only oppose involuntary hierarchies, be it those forced by the State or by anything else (a religion, for example).

Btw, other involuntary hierarchies exist, in particular those hierarchies which are determined by genetics, such as height or IQ for example. What do you intend to do about such hierarchies, if anything?

When we say "involuntary hierarchies" we don't mean someone's IQ and its authority on a specific topic. We would consider this an involuntary hierarchy if this person was declared as the single leader of the people just for having X IQ. We differentiate two types of hierarchies: voluntary and involuntary hierarchies, like boss-worker, monarch-peasant...  and hierarchies based on genetics, knowledge and such (IQ, being taller and then having more 'privileges' in certain sports, for example).

Right, because you guys have the incredibly powerful argument that goes, "Some guy 500 years ago called himself an anarchist, and he agreed with me and disagreed with you, therefore I am the true anarchist and you are not." /s

Let me give you an example that you can't refute. Marxism was an ideology written down by Marx and Engels (even though it wasn't meant to be called that way) which proposed a way to achieve communism, therefore Marxism is communist and can't be capitalist.

Anarchism was written down as an anti-capitalist ideology (also anti-communist by Proudhon, but as "anarchist communists" already existed, we could say, before Proudhon, we're ignoring that one), therefore it can't be capitalist. It's really simple.

 Incidentally, you left-anarchists are not true anarchists because you would impose the will of those in power (afaik most of you are democratic, so "those in power" refers to the majority) upon everyone else by the threat of force. 

1. In a real anarchist society, no one has power above anyone else, so no one can force anyone. Everything is voluntary, you're not required to give your opinion about something, but you're encouraged and given the chance to.
2. We don't advocate for democracy, as the term has been coined by different systems in which the people is represented by a minority, instead of representing themselves. That's not anarchism, anarchism is direct democracy, and it isn't a tyranny of the majority. And even if it was, how do you "an"caps pretend to write down rules and make decisions? Because the other alternative is either trying to convince everyone of agreeing or having a State, and the latter one is incompatible with anarchism.

 Violence will need to be used against anyone who attempts to engage in free trade, according to your ideology. 

Why would you think that? Do you think we're Stalin 2.0? We just oppose free trade and want to restrict it, not end with anyone who participates in free trade. We would tell them to not do it and that if they want to participate in a society where free trade is accepted, he should consider moving on or try to adapt. There's no force or violence in doing this, you're given options and you're free to choose whichever you want. How is that forcing someone?

 someone is going to have to come along and use violence to stop me from making a dirty, evil profit 

Either you're using regulation and restriction of the economy as "violence" or you've got a wrong idea of how anarchist societies do organise. And yes, "anarchist societies" meaning socialist ones.

If you're having private property, anyone who sees you, and it can be an average person, will tell you to give up your private property, not force you or use violence. Now, you must be conscious of several things:

1. We're not fucking authoritarians and we'll require popular support for anarchism to ever happen. This means that, if we start an anarcho-communist society, the people will cooperate because they fought for it, and those who tried to fought against it, will probably leave or have to adapt. Not by force, but because they've got no other option. In a society where everyone but you wants worker ownership of the means of production, you'll have bad luck in having someone who'll work with you and your private property.
2. You're also stating that anarchists are either anarcho-communists or "anarcho-"capitalists, which isn't true. There are different views on anarchism (and it doesn't include capitalism, sorry). Mutualism is the closest thing you may get, alongside agorism, to "anarcho-"capitalism.

 Your ideology requires a government 

It's necessary to know the difference between a State and a government. If you mean a State, no, there wouldn't be a State, but a government. In this government, everyone is part of it, which means that the people enforce things, not a minority or majority. And having a government is totally compatible with anarchism, as long as it's voluntary and everyone's part of it. Also, every ideology requires a government, otherwhise it means there's disorder, and anarchism isn't about chaos and disorder.

 therefore you cannot be anarchist. 

Now that you're talking about hypothetical situations and how they're not anarchist, let me tell you that your ideology has a risk: once you get rid of the State, the bussinesses will have enough freedom to become the new government, the shareholders will become tyrannical economical rulers and it will turn out to be another fascist regime. Therefore, your ideology isn't either anarchist. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nationalism and socialism already existed, but not together. And yet still, the nazis were only nationalist, they had nothing in common with socialists (or maybe some things, which also capitalists can have in common).

I studied history of anarchism, more than any other ideology's history, mainly because I see many people confused on it. While I'm not an expert, I know for sure anarchists already existed before Proudhon theorised it, but they called themselves socialists or communists, but they didn't agree with the means of achieven a communist society explained by Marx and others.

And even when Proudhon finally theorised anarchism, they were still anti-capitalist. So yeah, capitalism and anarchism coexisted in the same times, but haven't been more than enemies. </TEXT>

Let's work it out. Capitalist Marxism: an ideology that proposes the 'dictatorship of the bourgeoise' and that thinks that a State is necessary as a part of a transition from socialism to capitalism.

<TEXT>  But the two words have the same root 

Anarchists oppose "anarchy" as a state of chaos and disorder and as a lack of state. Anarchists advocate for an anarchist society (notice how we call it, "anarchist society") where all hierarchies are voluntary and powerless (in executive sense).

For fucks sake man, you cant have a word whose definition is X or the opposite of X

When did I say that? Huh.

 No thanks. Id prefer to deal with the argument from etymology that I presented earlier rather than bicker about who used it first and what the first person who used it meant. 

And that's why you'll never be welcomed by the other anarchists, because you're unable to give a reasonable point as to why you should be considered anarchists. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Linguistic prescriptivism is my least favorite thing, but anarcho-capitalism is perfectly consistent with the etymology and definition of anarchism. You don't get to decide what anarchism means for everybody because of a 19th century philosopher or two.

You can't describe an ideology by using etymology and a dictionary definition of it, dude. That's not how things work. Anarchism isn't against the government, but against the State, and it's a consequence of the rejection of involuntary hierarchies, which, by those who most contributed to anarchism and those who actually theorised it, were: the State, the police and military, organised religion and the hierarchies formed by capitalism. Anarchism was always socialist and anti-capitalist.

I still don't get how these kind of answers get upvoted and backed by many people. Don't know if it's ignorance or wanting to coin actual definitions. If anarchism can be capitalist, Marxism can be capitalist too. It makes no sense, right? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Anarchism is inherently socialist, not capitalist. Therefore, gatekeeping capitalists is justified and objectively right. Now, this sub isn't anarcho-communist, we've got people from any anarchist ideology, and even not anarchists ("an"caps, capitalists, Marxists...).

"Anarcho-"capitalism is another form of hierarchy, which contradicts the original and real definition of anarchism, theorised by the classical anarchist authors (Proudhon, Bakunin, Kropotkin...).

According to anarchism definitions I've found online they simply advocate for the willing abolishment of the state/government. They never mention abolishing religion, capitalism etc. According to the name of this community you need to accept AnCaps, or change the name to Anarcho-Communism.

Anarchism is about the rejection of involuntary hierarchies, anti-statism (not anti-government) is a consequence of this idea. We don't either oppose religion, as Bakunin said, we should oppose centralised religions and religious institutions, such as the Church, which are anti-anarchist and oppressive.

Also, anarchism isn't "ancoms vs "an"caps"" anyway. There are many other anarchist ideologies. "An"caps are welcomed here, sure, but not as part of us, because their ideology is completely different to any other anarchist ideology and we oppose capitalism, and have always done so.

Both are valid interpretations though.

No, only one is a valid interpreation. Yours is justified, we can all agree, but not based on truth and theory. Not trying to sound hostile or anything like that, but if you've never opened an anarchist book other than an "an"cap book, it's not weird to think your definition is valid too. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Anarchism has nothing to do with abolishing hierarchy, it refers to abolishing the state. 

Wrong. If you read classic essays on anarchism (be it from classic famous authors or "underground" ones, it's going to be the same), you'll see that "anti-statism" is only a consequence of the opposition to other hierarchies, which are the police, the hierarchies formed by capitalism, and even centralised-intitutionalised religions. The police isn't the state, capitalism isn't the state, religions aren't the state (usually).

Socialism means that the MOP is controlled by the state/public rather than privately. Therefore, capitalism is inherently anarchistic while socialism is not.

Why isn't it anarchistic? Socialism means public ownership of the MOP, not state ownership. While state ownership is a form of public ownership, it isn't the only one. Anarchism is a form of socialism, not capitalism. Capitalism requires hierarchies, a state and corporations to function, if you remove the state, you're left with hierarchies and corporations trying to rule. Not really anarchist.

a political theory holding all forms of governmental authority to be unnecessary and undesirable and advocating a society based on voluntary cooperation and free association of individuals and groups

That's not exactly the definition of anarchism. In order to properly define anarchism, as well as any other ideology, we need a deep research. This doesn't mean opening any dictionary and searching for the word "anarchism". </TEXT>

Incorrect, sir. The left-anarchists have co-opted the term and insisted upon such a definition, but that is not the actual definition of the word.

Funny, because those "left anarchists" where actually the ones who theorised anarchism long before "anarcho-"capitalists did. That said, it's absurd to claim otherwise.

Etymologically, the word "Anarchy" comes from the Greek prefix *an-*, meaning "without", combined with the Greek root *archon*, meaning "ruler" or "master (over slaves)".

Anarchy is different from anarchism. Anarchism is a political ideology, anarchy is either chaos and disorder or a system where no one rules, which includes corporations and upper classes not ruling, which actually opposes your beloving "anarcho-"capitalist ideology in practice.

 I'm not saying that lefties necessarily can't call themselves anarchists, but I am saying that they can't rightly reserve that label for themselves. 

We actually can. We were the ones who theorised anarchism, huh. We didn't start using the word anarchy, sure, but neither did capitalists, as the first use of the word anarchy was in the ancient times, where capitalism wasn't still a thing. You should read some Proudhon and history of anarchism, seriously. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. Never use apolitical dictionaries to define a political ideology. There are pages or articles that could help you more, but in this case, a 90% of the articles (wikipedia, for example), wouldn't support your definition, so you're fucked up now.
2. No anarchist is a Marxist, and before Marx started writing, socialists already existed and didn't advocate for dictatorships and such. This includes anarchists, as some of them probably advocated for anarchist socialism.
3. Anarchism was always described as the opposition to involuntary hierarchies, which includes the State, the police, army and the hierarchies formed by capitalism. Regardless of if you think these hierarchies formed by capitalism are voluntary or not, anarchists don't. So anyone claiming that these are voluntary, isn't an anarchist, by definition. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are no privileged views. If you've ever heard of direct democracy, this will sound exactly the same to you: everyone's voice is accepted and everyone is allowed to give his/her opinion. Now, there are two ways you can make their voices/suggestions become an implemented thing:

1. Appeal to the "tyranny of the majority". By this name it sounds totally opposed to anarchism and \[direct\] democracy, but when there's no other option, it isn't really a tyranny, as a real "tyranny of the majority" wouldn't listen to the minority. Under direct democracy and/or anarchism, that minority is listened, and everyone arrives to a consensus, be it through majority, or...
2. Try to convince everyone of the same. There are many ways of doing this, but it's a way. This would work with the smallest communities. Let's put the example of a work project in class, we're divided in groups of 3. Two of us have the same opinion on how to organise ourselves, but there's another one who doesn't. We could try to convince the other person to agree with us, or reform our proposals in order that it fits everyone's idea. </TEXT>

Also, no, classic anarchist authors defined what is a voluntary hierarchy and what isn't a voluntary hierarchy. This included capitalist-based hierarchies, which is why anarchists have always opposed capitalism and fought against it. There are tons of examples of socialist anarchist societies, and zero "an"cap societies.

<TEXT> The trouble I see when discussing 'left-libertarianism' with folks is that they aren't very tolerant of diversity of systems.  Those Libertarians that don't identify as 'left' usually don't have a problem with a hundred people (or a million people) turning their local areas into their versions of communist paradises.  But enough 'left' 'libertarians' want to forbid private property, and forbid any sort of economic activity that might result in inequality.  That, to me, is not very Libertarian compared to non-left alternatives.

Egalitarianism is one of the core characteristics of anarchism, it has always been. Opposing it, is opposing anarchism too. Also, as anarchism has always been a socialist ideology, which mostly aimed to seek an alternative to the statist approach of communists to achieve a stateless, moneyless and classless society, you can't expect anarchists to allow any capitalist to claim being an anarchist or that anarchism is capitalist or can be. That's just like telling someone unable to feel happy that it can be happy.

 The way you have phrased this is not what I see from left Libertarians, and that's why I phrase my comments as I do. "If you prohibit money as a means of exchange...", or "If you prohibit private property..." or "If you prohibit people from hiring others as employees..." *That's forcing people to do things.* 

Something is voluntary when the people affected by this something agrees on it, or accepts it. If anarchism requires popular support, which can result in a 100% result in small communities, it would be something voluntary, not forced. </TEXT>

Apart from the fact that we can't just wish all of the problems and frictions associated with consciousness away, there's nothing that can stop us from being happy all the time.

"Nothing can stops me" = "the universe can't stop me", of course, you may go to prison for some things, but it's something you can even change and escape from.

 And there are still countless restrictions. You take away some of the artificial rules, but you're still left with the natural rules of the game - i.e. avoiding suffering. 

That's going to happen whether life is meaningless or not, didn't say otherwise. It opens you doors to more possibilities, more things to do. Didn't say it opens all doors.

 Being dead has no maintenance costs associated with it. There are no harms to avoid when you're dead. You're not walking on a tightrope constantly, hoping to avoid falling off. 

And I didn't say it was better or worse, just that it's as meaningless as life, and life has its good and bad things, right?

 Well once we're dead, we're not going to know whether or not we've lived life to the fullest, or given up at the first hurdle. But we don't just choose whether or not we're going to have a fulfilling and enjoyable life or not. Cancer, disability, random misfortunes, etc, don't care about our attitude. And we're still going to have to put in some serious work just to maintain a basic standard of comfort (if we're able to achieve even that) before we can start actually having enjoyment of life on top of that. 

I was most talking about death by suicide. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The problem is that people tend to associate nihilism with depression and suicide: "life is meaningless, why bother living, why not commit suicide? we are going to die anyways". Problem is that depressed and suicidal people's interpretation of nihilism is totally different from a nihilist's interpretation of nihilism:

* "Life is meaningless" then let's just enjoy, there's nothing that can stop me. Also, meaninglessness doesn't affect my happiness or emotions, as I already felt like my life was meaningless when I was 5 years old and I was the happiest human being in this universe. Meaning isn't important to be happy, or at least not for me.
* "Why bother living" it actually bothers. Life is meaningless, and that opens many doors. Why spend my short and meaningless life being a bore and crying out loud, especially for something that should make me happy?
* "why not commit suicide?" because suicide is as meaningless as life. It doesn't matter if you live or die, right? Many people say a real nihilist would commit suicide, but a real nihilist in fact, wouldn't exist, or would just live. As there's no correct path in life, any lifestyle is acceptable, and therefore nihilistic. And since we can't cease to exist (we can only die), there's no other option than living however we want to live.
* "we are going to die anyways" yeah, we're going to die anyways, but would you rather die living a crappy life, or having lived life at its fullest? Because I'd rather die having lived life at its fullest.

When I wrote that sentence, it sounded depressive and even suicidal, but when I gave it a totally different meaning and I wrote it with more details, it looked happier and not depressive and suicidal. That's the root of the problem, the different interpreations of nihilism. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's a reason why the Libertarian Party must have left-libertarian factions:

1. Originally, libertarianism was a synonym for anarchists, especially anarcho-communists, as anyone claiming to be an anarchist in some countries were jailed (or even executed), so they found a new term to use, which actually sounded cooler.
2. The name is simply "Libertarian Party", it doesn't specify any economical system they advocate for, therefore any libertarian is allowed in, as any libertarian, be it on the left or on the right, is free and totally allowed to call him/herself a libertarian. 
3. Nowadays, libertarianism hasn't got any economical stance at all. Even in the political compass, it's only used as a social axis, as opposed to authoritarianism, and not related with the economy. Therefore, we could say that any party named "Libertarian Party" focuses on libertarian social policies, rather than any economical one (or it's centrist on that sense). Therefore, it would be justified having different libertarian factions inside the Libertarian Party.

If you want to create a Libertarian party advocating for a specific economical system, go on, however it's absurd to claim that any libertarian ideology is real, as nowadays real libertarianism focuses only on social and cultural policies. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Anarchism\*

Proudhon theorised anarchism, so anyone who calls himself an anarchist is to follow Proudhon's definition of anarchism - in the sense of "it's the rejection of involuntary hierarchies". If you don't share it, you're free to separate from the anarchist ideology and movement, especially if you're an "anarcho-"capitalist, because you're not going to be welcomed by the other, real, anarchists.

Imagine "Marxism". You can't just go and say that the transition from a, for example, capitalist state to a communism isn't necessary and desired if you call yourself a Marxist. If you do, you're an anarcho-communist, not a Marxist. Same happens with anarchism. </TEXT>

Anarchism is a political ideology theorised by Proudhon in the 19th century, as an anti-capitalist ideology. 'Anarchy' isn't a political ideology, or philosophy or anything like that.

I'm not talking about anarchy, I'm talking about anarchism, which is totally different, especially considering 'anarchy' can even be chaos, which is the opposite of anarchism.

I didn't say anarchism isn't inherently economically oriented, I said anarchy isn't. Anarchists have different views on economical organisatio, but all of these are anti-capitalist. "Anarcho-"capitalists are excluded by all anarchists, except by other "anarcho-"capitalists. If a majority of us don't consider "an"caps anarchists, it's not hard to use another term (as there are tons of other terms for "an"caps: propertarians, voluntaryists, libertarians...) </TEXT>

Anarchists aren't anti-government, anarchists are anti-statist. Also, in the ancient Greek anarchism didn't exist, it wasn't officially theorised until the 19th century by an anti-capitalist, and theorised anarchism as an anti-capitalist and socialist ideology. What existed before was "anarchy", which was used as a synonym for chaos, and people described civilisations without rulers as anarchic (not anarchist).

Oh, and also, 'anarchy' didn't represent any economical system, so it wasn't neither left or right-wing. Good one, dude. </TEXT>

No anarchist considered himself a capitalist before Rothbard, which is just another reason why anarchism is originally anti-capitalist, and if it was already anti-capitalist, it can't be changed. You can't change a communist ideology's definition to a capitalist one.

<TEXT> Imagine using an apolitical dictionary definition to define political ideologies, smh.

It's just too much wrong. Anarchism isn't the belief in the abolition of all government, but the abolition of involuntary hierarchies, which for anarchists are: the State, private property, cops (as being an essential part of the State and the enforcement of private property) and the boss-worker hierarchy. Anti-statism is just a consequence of the rejection of involuntary hierarchies, and again, capitalism can't be anarchist. Capitalism can be anti-statist, but not anarchist.

Fascism is a term coined by too many people, both in the past and nowadays, we can't agree on a clear definition of it. Especially on economics, in which some say fascism is socialist (but anti-communist/anti-Marxist), others say it's capitalist-corporatist, and others say it's not socialism, nor capitalism. As economics play an importart part to label a person, party or regime, you can't just throw away a word with such bad connotations without actually being sure, and we can't be sure. Instead, anti-fascism just gets the authoritarian, ultranationalist and even conservative nature of fascism and opposes them. </TEXT>

Anarchists have always opposed capitalism, and anarchism isn't against government, but against the State, which is different.

 Antifa is anti-fascists. Youre interpreting that as anti-authoritarian 

You know the worst part of a debate? When things like this happen. I know antifa is anti-fascism, but fascism has no clear definition, so antifa just opposes any totalitarian regime/ideology.

Regardless of what tankies think, they're not far from being labelled "fascists", just because of the economy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "left anarchists" is an absurd term, anarchism is only left-wing. While anarcho-communists are a majority, there's still lots of individualists, egoists and mutualists out there, pretty visible.

Tankies support a totalitarian state, and antifa just opposes anti totalitarian/authoritarian state, as there's no clear definition of 'fascism', actually. Therefore, any tankie claiming to be antifa is being anti-himself, lol. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Punk wasn't meant to be anarchist. Early artists and bands were most labelled as rebellious and nihilist than anarchists. This rebellious nature and nonconformism against the terribly bad political times of early punk just gave no other option to punk to adopt an anarchist stance, while not forgetting about nihilism. Punk then just stopped being a simple music genre, but also a political movement, mainly related with anarchism, but also with other leftist ideologies.

But we've also got to say that one of the main purpose of early punk was to actually promote nonconformism and trigger people to raise their voices and not just be quiet about their opinions. As anarchism has always had a bad image amongst the population, they used anarchist symbolism to trigger people, as well as they used swastikas (a famous person in punk rock to do this is Sid Vicious, for example). So, we could say it started as a way to trigger people rather than actually something serious. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  \- central planing is impossible because of the information problem 

Can you develop this one? I didn't get much your point

central planing is a terrible idea because you need to give all power to the government, which always results in a totalitarian distopia

Government =/= State. Anarcho-communism exists.

 

if you give people no incentive to work, they are not going to work. If a doctor makes the same amount of money as a janitor, why would anyone make the effort?. people are lazy, because that is human nature.

In Capitalism, people work for money. In Communism, people work to have resources. Which is worse, having no money but you can at least steal and ask for help, or having no resources - which automatically means theft is pointless, as almost no one, if anyone, won't have resources? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not really. Starvation is only an issue in statist communist regimes, many collectivised societies didn't suffer from starvation, nor obesity. Mainly because they worked on a smaller scale, the USSR for example worked in a larger scale, so it had it harder to work properly.

The Revolutionary Catalonia didn't suffer from starvation, and they were even in a civil war fighting against two sides, actually. Many socialist tribes out there don't suffer from starvation and do use a socialist economy. But again, it has to be in a smaller scale, or else starvation would then become a problem, as well as a lack of other resources. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I mean, dictionaries aren't a good source to get the definition of a political ideology, especially if it's apolitical. Rather than using a dictionary, you can check the wikipedia article, as it tends to be well explained and it summarises them pretty well.

Well, I'm an anarchist myself and I'm part of several anarchist communities, and I have anarchist friends, and as well agree on direct democracy. Here on Reddit we can find lots of anarchist supporters of direct democracy, and historical anarchist societies embraced direct democracy to some extent.

I guess it's also explained on lots of sites explaining anarchism. Also, did you really search "anarchism direct democracy"? Because I did, and this is the second result:  [https://libcom.org/library/direct-democracy-anarchist-alternative-voting](https://libcom.org/library/direct-democracy-anarchist-alternative-voting)

<TEXT> Do you really use apolitical dictionaries to describe political ideologies?

Anarchism is when everyone is part of the government, without any leader(s). Anarchism is against unjustified hierarchies, being involuntary ones considered unjustified, such as the State, the police, the boss-worker hierarchy... and not hierarchies like the teacher-student. As anarchism isn't chaos, and chaos is when there's no government or when there isn't a powerful enough government, anarchism advocates for direct democracy, which is giving everyone a voice, equally. Therefore, everyone's part of the government, not a majority, a minority or a single person, but everyone. "A government by the people, and for the people", as you describe it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Anarchism is the closest thing to what OP is describing (and even there's tons of nihilists between anarchists, I loved reading Renzo Novatore). Under anarchism, all these issues are actually fixed. One of the problems of the education system is that it serves more the government and in some cases the bussinesses, rather than trying to develope the knowledge of students and help them in life. This is seen by making them pay to get basic education and resources, encouraging them to not speak when not given permission, to conform, to obey... If the education system served primarily the knowledge of students and really helped them, most people would be able to make good decisions - or make decisions, as there's no way of determining what's a good decision.

This is starting to sound like propaganda, but anarchism also fixes the example problem, not only through the education system, but also ending up with consumerism. </TEXT>

Yet still, I disagree with how most communists try to achieve communism. And the fact that in practice, instead of being a "dictatorship of the proletariat" it's just a "dictatorship of the party", which is pathetic and not Marxist in any way.

Though, a real democratic country would never attack any other country without a serious reason - and most of the time, they don't have one, and it's like this how world wars start. I doubt foreign countries would support another country invading a peaceful anarchist society, just imagine a country trying to invade Christiania. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are many proposals on this. I personally think that, since anarchism requires popular support, people would be willing to make the anarchist society work properly, so crime would be reduced.

In case you commit a crime, the commune you're in (though some anarchists don't advocate for communes) will warn you and try to help you not commit it again, and if you, for example, stole someone because you're poor (though this wouldn't really happen under anarchism, as all resources would be equally free for everyone, and it would only happen if the society lacked of resources), the commune would try to help you by giving you enough resources to live by, and then would warn you to not do it again and if you need help, just ask for it - because that's how anarchism works, mutual aid.

If this person keeps stealing, the commune is free to decide to kick this person from the commune. Notice the "commune", not a single person, a majority or a minority, but the whole commune decides. Some people still think this is incompatible with anarchism. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Libertarians shouldn't "oppose" anything in the context you are presenting. However, ideologically speaking libertarians should reject  all forms of socialism, including fascist socialism.

Again with the fascist socialism thing, that's not a real thing, for god's sake. Also, no, libertarians were originally socialist, so they shouldn't oppose socialism. They should oppose authoritarianism, just that. Since capitalists have coined the definition of libertarianism, we've got no other than make it economically neutral. Ideologically speaking, libertarians should reject any form of authoritarianism, be it capitalist or socialist.

 The people they've literally beaten down for disagreeing with them would indicate that the answer is yes.

Sorry? Minorities are the most oppressed one, compare a gay being oppressed with a Republican being oppressed. The gay deserves more respect and help, especially if innocent, which most, if not all, of these minorities were innocent.

Are you drunk? this early?

Thanks for changing "socialists" to a completely different ideology that even opposed socialism. You're great, dude.

Gee, you mean like the massacres, purges, gulags and famines that the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is infamous for? **ex** : The Hollodomor, millions dead as a result of a deliberate famine.  
  
Were they "actual enemies"? no. You do not know what you're talking about, at all. You're a typical leftist that started with a conclusion and are attempting to work your way back, the problem with that is, everything you are saying is wrong.

I'm talking about the Nazis, not the communists, genius.

 You have zero understanding of the facts. 

Says the one who's unable to understand the difference between a nazi and a communist.

Yeah how'd that work out for the kulaks?  
  
Also, nice shifting of the goalposts..... stupid leftist.

Have you readt history, and I mean history in general? What about the Revolutionary Catalonia? Or the Free Territory of Ukraine? Or the Paris Commune? Or are you going to tell me their societies weren't collectivised?

Fascist socialism is a hardcore leftist ideological framework and that is not my opinion. You can choose to be delusional if you want, but reality does not bend to your drivel. You have no clue what you're talking about and therefore it is pointless to bother with you.

Fascist socialism isn't a real thing lmao. Authoritarian communism, I guess that's what you mean, and is still different from fascism - and they've been fighting against each other since the WW2. Remember the USSR against Germany, Italy, Francoist Spain and such regimes? You do, right?

Fascism is a right-wing ideology, promoting corporate totalitarianism. Mussolini's fascism was even far from your definition. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mine makes sense, yours does not.

So, thinking that Libertarians should oppose fascism rather than support it or be neutral towards it doesn't make sense?

Absolutely I oppose all forms of socialism.  
  
What's your point?

Fascism is a capitalist ideology, not socialist. Mussolini opposed communism/socialism, and his ideas are no longer considered of relevance with modern fascism, as modern fascism seeks to install a corporatist dictatorship, not a socialist dictatorship.

Retarded and nonsensical statement.

If you oppose antifascism, you're a fascist. Libertarians, technically, oppose fascism. If you don't support antifascism, you're a fascist, not a Libertarian.

Could not possibly care less what some leftist thinks libertarianism is. I've noticed that leftists have absolutely no understanding of liberty and thus, have zero understanding of libertarianism.

Nice argument, and you call my arguments retarded and nonsensical. Also, I should be the one who doesn't care about your definition of libertarianism, as leftists anarchists used the term "libertarian" as a synonym when being an anarchist was a crime. You coined the term, and pretend to have any superiority on it or to be right with your definition of it. 

Also, yeah, ancoms are totally authoritarian and seek to oppress everyone, we're natsoc under cover.

You'd have to be delusional to think that they're not a bunch of brain-dead trust fund kiddies LARPing as revolutionary thugs. The only reason they haven't gotten stomped like the marxist socialist clowns they are, is because they're heavily protected by government.

The US government declared antifa as a terrorist and criminal organisation lmao, you don't even know what you're talking about. And most, if not all, governments oppose communism and anarchism, and they end up opposing antifa. Do you really think it's the left who has superiority on politics? Because, in politics, we're the most oppressed ones, buddy.

Also, do you really think antifa is some sort of criminal/terrorist organisation who beats down anyone who disagrees with tjem? I thought you had some brain and knowledge, but honestly, I'm starting to doubt it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The marxist socialist brutally subjugated everyone that wasn't in the politburo. Even the members of the Red Army weren't safe from their brutality \[**For ex** : The Great Purge\]. In some cases, the politburo itself was targeted \[**Ex** : Trotsky, Kamenev, Zinoviev, etc.\]. 

They weren't innocent minorities, or even minorities at all. They actually did this to political enemies, as during the Russian civil war, the anarchists (let's call them blacks) fought against both the reds and the whites, and the whites against the reds and the blacks, and the reds against the whites and the blacks. It was some kind of free for all, where everyone was enemy of everyone else. When the Bolsheviks won, they didn't exactly subjugate or execute any anarchist, but they did restrict and censor them, and then Stalin started a genocide against anyone who wasn't a Marxist-Leninist supporter of Stalin's regime.

The Nazis didn't kill actual enemies, only innocent civilians who didn't even want to fight or start a war. They weren't even armed or able to defend themselves. Also, these were real and already oppressed minorities who had no international support, but for communists and anarchists - who in your opinion (well, communists/MLs), were and are worse than nazis.

 The marxist socialists enslaved, imprisoned or murdered anyone that they saw fit regardless of whether they were supporters. Even some of their most loyal generals were executed during The Great Purge, the serfs/citizenry had even less of a chance. Your examples are small potatoes in comparison. 

You know there's a lot of reasons why someone could and can get imprisoned, enslaved or executed? The most loyal person isn't safe from the law and the orders of its superiors. If one of Stalin's most loyal person did something Stalin didn't like, even if that person was incredibly loyal, Stalin would've killed it. Loyalty isn't a privilege card of immunity.

Who gives a fuck.....  
  
That's not an argument.

????????

Wow, you have no clue what you're talking about.  
  
The Red Army would regularly engage in gang-rape of women; Ally, enemy, young, old , it didn't matter

Sources? Because women weren't slaves in the USSR, sure, they didn't have as many rights as men had, but they weren't as oppressed as in Nazi Germany.

 No, it isn't. You are delusional. 

A regime that actually fought to help the workers is worse than an ideology-regime that fought for, only, the oppression of innocent minorities? Yeah, the fight to help the workers resulted in oppression and didn't help the workers much, but the purpose was clear - the Nazis didn't have that purpose or any other innocent purpose, just to crush down anyone from a different race, sexual orientation, any jew, anyone who opposed them. The Communists' purpose was to create a State for the people, to help the workers, and to achieve communism. They didn't, right, we both agree, but you can't say the Nazis were better or equally bad.

And it's not a subjective opinion. I don't even support Communism or the USSR, but facts are facts. As an anarchist, I oppose and disagree with both, but I've got very clear which is worse. An ideology that worked for white supremacy, suppression of jews and other races, and that wanted to install a corporate dictatorship isn't better than Marxism-Leninism. It's not a subjective opinion, it's an objective one. It would be subjective if I supported one of them.

 Communism is a myth, it has never and will never be achieved because it goes against reality and human nature. What actually is implemented is **MARXIST SOCIALISM** , just as we saw under Vladimir Lenin, Leon Trotsky, Joseph Stalin, etc. 

Wow, did I ever said communism can be achieved or it has been achieved? I just said, in theory (in case you can't understand, I must specify), communism isn't authoritarianism. In fact, communism is a stateless, classless and moneyless society. From this idea, many strategies to achieve communism comes: the Marxist types want a dictatorship of the proletariat, De Leonists want a more democratic State, ancoms want to get rid of the transition part and the State and establish communism directly... Communism isn't authoritarianism.

Also, it isn't a myth. Collectivisation has been achieved before, and the USSR was closer than you think of becoming socialist and possibly achieve communism. But they spent more time getting rid of people rather than seeking allies and asking for help to achieve communism. As Bakunin said, Marxism only ends up in tyranny and won't ever help the working class.

If we were close and collectivisation of society was achieved before, why is communism impossible?

They're using marxist socialist symbology, marxist socialist tactics, making marxist socialist demands and using marxist socialist rhetoric. You are spectacularly wrong and I find it extremely difficult to believe that you're not a troll.

Yes, boy! Show me how ignorant you're on anti-fascism!

Fascism is a right-wing authoritarian and white supremacist ideology. Anarchists oppose capitalism, authoritarianism and racial supremacy. They're the exact opposite of fascism. If you search pictures of antifa, you'll see that at least a 75% of them are people with black clothes waving black flags with anarchist symbology. Thinking antifa is mostly Communist is stupid and ignorant. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That doesn't make sense. And if I said that it's because a Libertarian (well, fake libertarian, as libertarianism was used by leftist anarchists originally and the term was coined by liberals) should always oppose fascism and any totalitarian regime, criticising antifa being a libertarian is absurd and just shows that either you're not a libertarian (in any sense of the word) or you know nothing about antifa and you're just brainwashed by the media, the government and fascists, making you think antifa is a terrorist and violent left-wing organisation that beats down anyone who disagrees with them.

<TEXT> Ahem, reminder that marxist socialists , which antifa are, have always been **much** worse than national socialists.

Bullshit and wrong. Nazis advocated for the oppression of all minorities: gays, jews, people of colour... and not only minorities were oppressed by them, sexism was also common. And they opposed anyone who wasn't a supporter of their regime.

The USSR, for example, was a lot more progressive. Maybe Stalin made it more conservative, but gay rights were respected, women weren't treated as objects (which nazis did), no religions were oppressed, and POC wasn't sent to gulags or executed or anything like that.

Saying that Marxists are and have been much worse than natsoc is objectively wrong, and looks like conservative people saying "communism is authoritarianism" just to give socialism a bad image, when there are lots of communist ideologies not authoritarian, and even Orwell opposed authoritarian communism (like Stalin's regime).

Also, most antifa are anarchists, not Marxists/communists. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "National anarchism" isn't anarchism, and the term is very poor. Anarchism is internationalist, and will never defend what "national anarchism" advocates for. I just see it as an excuse of fascists to look better.

 How about anarcho syndicalism? 

Sounds good, but anarcho-syndicalism is usually a strategy rather than a way to organise society, as many anarcho-syndicalists are anarcho-communists. Try with anarcho-collectivism or left-wing market anarchism.

 Despite the existence of anarcho nationalism/conservatism, and also despite the fact that ancaps typically hold progressive views on things like gender, religion, abortion, etc. 

The progressive views you're talking about are shown on the authoritarian/libertarian axis, being the progressive ones libertarians, and the conservatives authoritarians. The left-right progressive views reffer to economical policies, more than social policies. As "anarcho-"capitalism is seen as an extreme form of capitalism, totally unregulated (since there's no State), it should be far-right. </TEXT>

Violence isn't necessarily part of antifa, as we're decentralised and follow no structure, so we don't have any ideology or strategy set. It's absurd to state otherwise. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually, it doesn't piss me off that much that Trump called antifa a terrorist organisation, because we can convince everyone of the opposite and I'm not even from the US, and looks like antifa is only a terrorist organiation the US. Or eat least where I live it's only anti-fascism, not terrorism.

But calling me a terrorist, or a terrorist sympathiser, especially when I never said I supported terrorism, for just being anti-fascist pisses me off and is something really serious, and anyone who falsely accuses anyone of anything like this should be banned or his post removed. Which is why I made this post, because I find it pathetic and hypocrite to call someone a terrorist for being anti-fascist, while those who call antifa terrorists cry about how we call fascist/nazi anyone who disagrees with us. But their accusations are justified, apparently. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You know, I can understand people being brainwashed by the media and the US government into thinking antifa is a terrorist and criminal organisation. I can understand and accept it, because I can't expect anything else from them, and we can convince them that anti-fascism isn't terrorism.

And this is what I've been doing lately, and trying to convince some guys that anti-fascism is just anti-fascism and, since we follow no centralised structure, or structure at all, and we may just be individuals or groups, we're not an organisation. And since we're not an organisation, we've got no specific strategy or ideology, that means that a neoliberal can also be anti-fascist, and a pacifist can be an anti-fascist too.

But instead of giving any reasonable point against this fact, these guys decided to call me a terrorist, or terrorist sympathiser, for just opposing fascism. Looks like now anti-fascism isn't "opposing fascism" but "being part of a terrorist organisation". I don't know anymore if I'm talking with brainwashed people or trolls, or fascists trying to coin the definition of anti-fascism.

Accusing someone of being a terrorist or a supporter of terrorism is something serious, legally speaking, it can get you in a real big trouble, especially if you're from the US. If someone publicly and clearly stated that (s)he supports terrorism, report it if you're sure and it's true. If not, false accusations can get the victim in trouble, and the accuser, if the accusation is known to be false, can also get in trouble for such.

One thing is thinking antifa is a terrorist organisation and another thing is directly calling someone a terrorist or a terrorist sympathiser for simply being against fascism. And the latter can't and shouldn't be accepted by anyone. It's a shame that the media and the government are being successful in brainwashing people, and worst of all is having to deal with the fact that anyone can take advantage of you by calling you a terrorist for saying you're anti-fascist. I'm not the type of persons demanding sanctions on people for being this way, but it's not a childish joke or minor crime being a terrorist/calling someone a terrorist. Same with calling people pedophiles, murderers, rapists and such, especially if said seriously.

I can't understand how people can think that's justified and even right. And if you think this isn't serious enough, go fight in public with someone who thinks antifa is a terrorist organisation and say "I'm anti-fascist" and wait for this person to call you a terrorist, let's see if it's serious or not. Regardless of if it's on the internet or outside, and it's even more dangerous online. Don't ever do it, and if you want to accuse someone of being something serious, collect evidences and try your luck with the system. If the system fails to sanction that person, you've got the right and need to protest and challenge the system, and it would be justified. But never accuse someone on the internet (publicly, mainly) of being seriously a terrorist, pedophile and such, especially when this person hasn't ever stated that. It's not only being a jerk, but also foolish, as it can get you in trouble too.

There goes my rant. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 'Radical leftists' didn't hijack the term, antifa is mostly associated with them because they're the ones that most oppose fascism. Fascism, as of a capitalist authoritarian ideology, is the exact opposite of anarchism, and similar in some communist ideologies only in the authoritarian part. That's why most anti-fascists are anarchists, they're the ones most deserving the label and any anarchist is automatically anti-fascist. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Real politics vs american politics:

Liberalism is a right-wing ideology | Liberalism is a left-wing ideology

Libertarianism was a synonym for leftist anarchism originally | Libertarianism is capitalist and the term was stolen by the left

Antifa is a group of decentralised persons who follow no structure and that oppose fascist or authoritarian regimes | AnTiFa Is A tErRoRiSt OrGaNiSaTiOn (and only americans think this, btw)

I think it's enough, right?

 If you support antifa you support terrorism 

Wtf man, and you call me an ignorant? You know nothing about politics or antifa. If you oppose fascism, you're anti-fascist. That doesn't include any strategy to fight fascism. Shut the heck up.

 For me if you support actual nazis then you you are a nazi 

Wtf x2, you can't compare that. If you support an ideology, you're part of that ideology. If you oppose an ideology, you're against that ideology. It's not "if you oppose an ideology, you're a terrorist, look at how smart I am lmao"

 Once again. As long as they are either on MY side or no side then they arent nazis. If I disagree with you you are nazi. Was that bad wording or is that your belief? If you believe that then does that make me a nazi? 

When did I say or what did I even say to make you understand that? If you're an apologist for authoritarian regimes, such as a fascist regime, antifa will oppose you. If you're a neoliberal, antifa won't oppose you, but individuals may laugh at you (if they're communists, for example). Antifa individuals are from any ideology but an authoritarian one - except tankies, for some reason.

Now, let me tell you a real fact; you're the freaking ignorant. When you know nothing about the topic you're talking about and keep talking about it as if you were true and claiming to be right and calling others who disagree with you ignorants, you're not only an ignorant, but in this case, you're a hypocrite for criticising antifa for supposedly doing the same.

Good luck in life being like this. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  the cops are allowed to use violence 

More or less. They're not always allowed to use violence, and they're told to only use violence when the situation requires violence, not whenever they want. And they use violence whenever they want, even when they don't need to. There are many evidences of cops abusing of their power and becoming violent without any valid reason. Worst of all, this type of violence caused by a bureaucratic institution is most of the times seen as correct and appropiate.

 what are examples of rich people/ governors using violence 

Violence isn't only physical or direct. Many bosses who exploit their workers are rich, and exploitation is another form of violence. As well as slavery, which is supported by the governors and even rich people.

 you say punching a nazi is protecting yourself and minorities, but has this supposed nazi attacked you and minorities, or have they just said statements that you think are harmful 

Oh wait, you mean that we should wait for them to torture and execute thousands of jews to take action against them? Seriously? That's not cool or justified.

By the way, antifa is against any totalitarian regime or supporters of such kind of regimes, so is fascism and nazism, amongst other ideologies. Many nazis "beaten down by antifa" wore swastikas and challenged black people, jews or other minorities, deserving to getting punched. Maybe it's an irrational answer to such an evil and nasty human being, but don't try to justify them. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Terriost USE terror as a mean to whatever the END might be trying to achieve 

That's just what I've said... 

 you label innocent civilians nazis because they disagree with you 

I didn't. By innocent civilians I mean those who have no relation between the antifa-fascist/nazi conflict, for example an apolitical person. Yet still, someone who wants to get rid of minorities by executing and torturing them without any guilt for being different isn't innocent and different from what you're bitching about.

 You justify your shitty actions by attempting to take the moral high ground 

My actions? Which actions? I've only called nazis fucking monsters and nothing else. Which actions are you talking about?

You support terrorist behavior instead of denouncing it making you part of the problem aswell.

Saying that I support terrorist behaviour is a dangerous accusation, especially when I never said I supported terrorism. Next time you're going to call someone a terrorism supporter or a terrorist, think before you do it. It could get that person in serious legal problems, or you for such a false accusation.

If you're brainwashed into thinking any anti-fascist is automatically a terrorist (or a terrorism supporter), go to a mental asylum and read about real politics, and not american politics. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Notice the "unlawful use of violence and intimidation" - it's lawful, and therefore decriminalised, when cops, rich people, governors and other authorities-hierarchies use it, but when a person does it to oppose them, it's unlawful and a crime.

When you punch someone for being a fucking nazi it's not terrorism, it's defending yourself against a threat for everyone, especially minorities. Apart from that, terrorists attack innocent civilians that have nothing to do with what the terrorists are against of, to create terror and pressure. Antifa doesn't necessarily do that, they attack fascist apologists, not innocent civilians. But sure, there's exceptions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not exactly. As I said, communism is a broad term, in which you can find the Marxist types, Council Communism, Left Communism, De Leonism... The Marxist variant wants a really centralised State to protect the transition, and as Bakunin told Marx, this would end up in tyranny and not communism or socialism.

De Leonism, for example, thinks the State should be used to achieve communism, but not an authoritarian State, but a more democratic one.  In this case then, communism doesn't put all the power in the State.

 the only way to have working communism was TO KEEP THE PEOPLE ARMED 

Yeah, that's how revolution works. The People reffers to the proletariat, who must attack the bourgeoise and capitalism, that's why leftists advocate for gun rights, to keep the People armed for a revolution. That's unrelated to the other topic, anyway. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. We have different ideas for this, however 'crimes' like theft would be reduced, as resources would be free or everyone would have access to them. Also, some statistics say cops cause a great percentage of crimes, instead of actually preventing them.
2. Anarchism requires popular support to succeed. Considering this, the most logical way to get rid of the State is through a revolution. I think it'll happen in a future, but we've got priorities (for example climate change).
3. To answer this question we must first know if anything like that would be possible or accepted. US imperialism is a thing now, I think we can all agree on that, but if a country invaded any peaceful society, the international community will go against that country. That, unless the international community is under a conflict. Anyways, we tend to use decentralised militias, which can protect the society, but they would be crap compared to the US military, for example.
4. Because anarchism requires popular support. Unless they end up opposing anarchism, they'll never allow a State to be formed.
5. "Atrocities" is inaccurate. During a civil war, or any war, you know many people from all sides are going to die. And if you don't attack, they'll attack you. That's how war works. Anarchists in the spanish civil war took advantage of the poor situation of the Spanish Republic and backstabbed the republicans and declared independence. To do this, they needed to murder people, from all sides. I don't find it bad, considering the times they were at. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Communism is a broad term, which consists of a "stateless, moneyless and classless society". From this idea, many other ideas come on how to achieve communism: the Marxist type uses the dictatorship of the proletariat during a transition divided in different stages. Stalin called his ideology "Marxism-Leninism". But inside the Marxist type, you can find many different kind of strategies too, you can find authoritarian Marxism (which isn't simply Marxism), Trotskyism...

Then you have Left Communists, Council Communists, Luxembourgists, De Leonists..., which advocate for a State as a tool, but not a dictatorship or totalitarian State.

And then you have anarchism/anarcho-communism, which states that the State isn't a tool of the workers, but a tool of private property and tyranny, something the workers must oppose, and therefore the State has to be directly overthrowed to achieve communism, not used as a tool to achieve it. </TEXT>

But instead of actually understanding that, I keep getting attacks and people calling me a communist and telling me that it doesn't work or it's authoritarianism both in theory and/or in practice... And of course the downvotes.

I don't know, but I thought this sub was about criticising how fucked up Reddit was, not only for the staff, but also the community in general, by all the things I've seen here. Now I see many people here are just like people in other subs and deserving the same critics they do on Reddit staff.

And now I'll get tons of downvotes again for criticising this sub... I even want it to happen to show how hypocrisy rules the world. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wait there. Regulating bussinesses is different.

About private property, first of all to a communist regime start, you need popular support too. This will reduce the amount of people refusing to give up their private property, to a minority. This minority will be given the option, will start negotiations, whatever's necessary and not violent and forceful, and if there's no other option left, you can't expect any other thing.

But this happens with any State, be it leftist or capitalist. However, a "democratic" government enforcing the laws with a corrupt and violent police force isn't seen as authoritarian. But since it's called "communism" it's automatically bad, even though it's the same crap as many other capitalist regimes.

The DPRK is pseudo-communist, but it's capitalist. China is pseudo-communist, but it's capitalist. These two are authoritarian. Do you agree? </TEXT>

<TEXT> How is that authoritarianism? Huh.

Authoritarianism is a form of government characterized by **strong central power** and **limited political freedoms**. Under an authoritarian regime, **individual freedoms are subordinate to the state**, and there is **no constitutional accountability**.  --- Wikipedia

It doesn't say anything about the economy. It's about political and individual freedoms, not economical. And don't come up with the myth that "capitalism is about individual freedoms!" because any economical system/theory can be authoritarian. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, they actually can. A person that only sees black and white shades will see that some people are darker than others, leading to the conclusion that the darkest ones are black people. 

Also, there are other ways of noticing the race of a person, more than the skin tone. For example, black people's hairstyles tend to be different from white (and other races) people. Also, faces can help you identify the race of a person (asian people, the easiest ones to identify this way).

So, yes, colorblind people can still be racist. It would be different if they were totally blind, but they could still be racist, even without knowing how the different races look like, a blind person can still interact with anyone else. </TEXT>

Also, communism is a broad term, "authoritarian communism" is what pseudo-communist states, past and modern, were/are, and most of them didn't even pass from state capitalist.

A Council Communist, for example, would never support the USSR's policies, especially from Stalin+. Same with Trotsky, who opposed Stalin.

Yes, because the ruling party was a party that had many factions (ideologies), which included anarchists.

I am talking recent history. Specifically, Ukrainian autonomist groups during 2013/14 (Maidan), and it was (basically) Fascists whom they sided with.

The republic failed in many things, and both the anarchists of the CNT-FAI and the POUM took advantage of the bad situation of the republic and the strong support for anarchist communism. How is that betrayal?

That's not true, it was the Republican side - or the PCE - backed by the USSR that betrayed the anarchists, and the POUM. And with this betrayal, they also gave advantage to the nationalist front to win the war.

 we would not have psychotic anarkiddies siding with Liberals and Fascists against Communists today.

<TEXT> no they aren't - they can over-lapped pretty easily. just like two political ideologies can.

Political policies related with religions doesn't automatically mean religions are political.

 "it doesn't propose how to organise a society"? are you kidding? just because it lacks a detailed, particularised administrative structure that's not to say that an ordering principle of a society (i.e. do this, do that) wouldn't be political if the adherents weren't compelled, by that same religion, to enforce it - most islamic (population-wise) states are wed pretty well to islam itself because it's incredibly easy to interpret islam that way. 

All religious structures have no political power. See the Catholic Pope, it has only religious power and authority, not political. Because religions aren't inherently political, they're apolitical. Again, which religion says a society must be organised in X way?

 if a religion tells you to kill apostates, then, that seems a wee bit theocratic. 

Again, for religious reasons, not political. Killing apostates is for religious reasons.

 yes but if you're involved in geopolitical warfare *because* of your religion, then that's a political-religious war! 

Political reasons =/= religious reasons.

 what about political philosophy? what about the economics of political philosophies...? 

These can be perfectly mixed up. "Economics of political philosophies" makes no sense.

 invalid comparison; existentialism doesn't tell you how to live or principles by which societies should be ordered. why would you use such a dreadful comparison? 

I thought you would understand this way that what you were saying was absurd. Philosophies can be related with politics, as well as religions, but they're apolitical.

 you need politics to allow for that religious conviction to be put into practice though 

Yeah, but religions aren't political by nature. Politics can be religious. </TEXT>

No religion says what political ideology or form of government to adopt, it just states morality which individuals take too seriously to the point of starting tyrannical or authoritarian regimes based on the morality created by this religion in particular. No religion ever said "Our society should be authoritarian and theocratic", these options are left to individual followers of the religion to interpret it however they want.

If not, how can it be that some Christians, catholics to be specific, are anarchists and others are fascists, if even both ideologies are the opposite? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  so I'm saying that political ideologies and religions are both ideologies 

When did I say otherwise? I was talking about political ideologies and how they are independent from religions.

so they are basically the same thing but have different principles, and different kinds of principles.

Let's use semantics, okay? Ideology comes from "ideals", which is a set of ideals. Ideals come from ideas, which is a set of principles and policies. Ideas can then be political or religious. Political ideas tend to be labelled as political ideologies, while religious ideas tend to be labelled as religions. They're different, as political ideas propose policies on how to organise a society, both economically and socially. This also means the use of religious policies, which means making religions play a certain role, or play no role, depending on the policy. A religion just tells you what's moral and immoral, what's true and not true, and what you should do. It doesn't propose how to organise a society, which is why it's different and independent from politics.

 yes they can though? if a religion says "we should all be governed by the rules of this religion" then that is a political stance 

No. No religion advocates for theocracy or any ideology, as far as I know. At least the most popular religions don't, it's individuals who claim for theocracy and other.

wait, why do you think muhammad was fighting those wars then if not in the name of religion...?

I said he was fighting for religious reasons, not political. Romans were already Imperialist and monarchist before becoming supporters of Christianity.

  what's stopping a religion agreeing with feudalism/capitalism?! 

The fact that economy, as well as politics, is independent from religions and philosophy. This is just like saying Existentialists or can have an inherent political ideology. No, they don't, it's just a set of beliefs on how life works, not how to organise society, therefore any ideology can be compatible with Existentialism. It's the individual who agrees on it, not the religion.

 yes it did - if islam said "we should have x group stoned to death" then you need an executive to enforce that law. you can't just kill people without a law saying that it's okay. 

But that group is condemned for religious reasons, not political. I've already said this thousands of times. </TEXT>

This automatically discredits your whole comment. Stop saying generalised bullshit like this.

Islam never advocated for an authoritarian society, for example. It advocated for religious wars, morality and religious supremacy. These can be enforced through politics, especially authoritarian regimes, which is why it tends to fall in authoritarian regimes - but it isn't inherently authoritarian, and a muslim can advocate for the opposite. If there's different political opinions between individuals of the same religion, how can you say that religion has a political ideology?

 A muslim opposing these things makes them... not a muslim 

This can't be more stupid, as it already achieved the maximum level of ignorance. So, if I believe in the things Islam claims, but I'm not an authoritarian pig, I'm not a muslim? Come on, fuck off. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I didn't say political ideology though, did I. I said "ideology" 

 You said it's an ideology, I said it's not a POLITICAL one. There are many types of ideologies.

 but then what religious group is the sole advocating proponent of islamism, for instance? 

All of them. Again, religions don't have a political ideology, so any religious group is okay.

islam - what do you think muhammad was doing exactly in those wars?

An individual. Individuals tend to be tied to ideals - and therefore ideologies -. No religion ever said "go start a political war against those who don't follow our beliefs" but "start a war against those who don't follow our beliefs". The difference is that one is an ideological and religious war, the latter is a religious war.

 politics can be religious in the exact same sense that religions can be political. if a religion says "we ought to have x law because of moral y", then that's a political stance 

Religions can't be political, no religion ever tied up a political ideology with it. No religion ever said "Our society should be feudal/communist/capitalist/whatever" or "Our society should be authoritarian/liberal/anarchist/whatever".

No religion ever said to have X law because of moral Y, but said that, for example, homosexuality is immoral and should be punished - but for religious reasons, as it's said by a religion. In any case, if the religion doesn't say they should be punished, it's the individual who makes a decision, not the religion. The religion contributes with the means, and the individual executes it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, but they do it for religious reasons, not political. The best way, then, to enforce their beliefs is through policies, which is why tends to result in authoritarian regimes, but a muslim can be an anarchist and totally oppose this, or be a fascist and totally support this. It's the individual who creates the relationship between a religion and politics, because religions are apolitical. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, religions are apolitical by nature. It's individuals of each religion who tie up politics with religions. No religion advocates for an authoritarian regime, or an anarchist society, they're just centered in religious and philosophical beliefs, not politics. Politics end up using religions to strengthen the power of their regimes, and sometimes to strengthen the power of their religions (too). </TEXT>

<TEXT>  religion is a kind of ideology though 

Not a political ideology.

 again, you're just shooting yourself in the foot here. fascism *and* religions like islam are ideologies 

I was saying that there's policies related to religious affairs, such as installing a state religion, which doesn't mean that the religion you're choosing to be official is inherently supporter of your regime or ideology. A religion is independent of political ideologies, you can find Christians being fascists and Christians being anarchists, two opposite ideologies, two identical religions.

 how is that necessarily true? what if a religion had a political stance? there are a shit tonne of examples of this 

A religious person interferes in politics, not religions. Tell me of a religion that says something like "we advocate for a totalitarian regime ruled by our religion's beliefs" and I'll shut up.

 never claimed that it was a matter of correlation, though. I am, however, saying that islam seems to be prosperous in authoritarian regimes because in many cases the scepticism towards that dominant religion are silenced, as per the authoritarian regime's policies 

Claiming a religion to be official of X country results in authoritarianism and it happens with any religion, not only Islam. Because by turning it into the official religion and making sure everyone is part of that religion, you're making your religion stronger and more powerful than ever. That's the whole purpose of religions' interference in politics, but religions aren't political, politics can be religious. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Liberalism of course isn't close to fascism and is a right-wing ideology, therefore it's absurd to call a liberal a fascist. Conservatism may be a characteristic of fascism, but not the only one, conservatism, and simply conservatism, is close to fascism, but not fascism - and it can be both left and right-wing. Libertarians were originally anarchists (left-wing), but modern use of the term libertarian, at least in the US, is right-wing and advocates for a minimal or no State, so it can't be fascist. "Anarcho-"capitalism is a right-wing ideology that advocates for no State, it's a form of libertarianism and therefore, it's not fascistic.

That's what I was saying.

<TEXT> No, they're not incredibly similar. Fascism is an ideology, islam a religion. An ideology has a set of ideals, which constitute an ideology. This ideology is determined by these ideals, which can be social, religious, economical, political and such. A religion is just a set of beliefs that hasn't got any interference in politics, anyone relating a religion with politics is wrong (state religion is different from what I'm saying). Just because a religion tends to be seen in authoritarian regimes, it doesn't mean the religion is tied up with authoritarian ideals. That's totally wrong to say. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, I'm being satirical. How successful an ideology is in practice sure determines how valid and reasonable it can be, but anarchism and communism haven't been tried before. All communist tries were a failure that ended up in tyranny or capitalism, and anarchism has never been able to develop further. You can't say if any of these works, because we've only been close.

Yet still, these uncomplete 'projects' were certainly successful. While I hate to say this, the USSR did achieve a lot and regardless of if it was socialist or simply state capitalist, the things it achieved when advocating for communism in a time of war and where everyone was skeptical of communism is, first of all, a great achievement. 

The Revolutionary Catalonia collectivised their society, in which you could find from mutualist federations to anarcho-collectivist/communist communes. While there were some flaws and didn't truly achieve communism, which was the goal, they indeed achieved the most complete and successful anarchist society during a civil war. 

I don't know if anarchism or communism works, but history has showed us that it's worth it. If the USSR achieved what it achieved, and the Revolutionary Catalonia was really close - and we have no proofs of "anarcho-"capitalism working, anarcho-communism is the way out. 

It's funny anyways to say that an anarchist or libertarian (which are synonyms, but American politics always screwing the terms up) can't work without property rights, when in fact it's the State and its bureaucratic institutions (cops, courts, prisons...) who enforce property rights. The people isn't going to enforce property rights, because for the people "property rights" is being able to claim any land you want without any restriction, restrictions which the government creates, not because it's socialistic, but because capitalism requires certain restrictions or regulations, as well as the corporations, to not exploit society and the consumers. For a reason anarchists were strictly anti-capitalist even before starting to use the term "anarchist" and make it an official ideology.

Don't get me wrong, though, while I don't personally think "anarcho-"capitalism is anarchism and is more of a statist-corporativist (and for some, a mask for more authoritarian ideologies) in practice, I would be a hypocrite if I said that it can't work. I don't think it will work because, as I said before, capitalism uses the State as a tool to enforce capitalism and protect it, not regulate it necessarily, contrary to popular opinion here. Once you get rid of the State, the bussinesses 'controlled' by the State will be given infinite freedom (as the people won't be able to stop the top priority under capitalism, corporations) and these will emerge as (a) new State(s), which will be even worse.

But I would be interested in seeing how it would end up. Not to tell you "your ideology is foolish", but to really get a practical ideology. We learn from errors. I wouldn't volunteer to live in an "anarcho-"capitalist society, not only for fear of becoming what I've said before, but also because I'm skeptical and a victim of capitalism. These two reasons summed up are enough to not want to step on a capitalist society anymore, be it really anarchist or not.

I would appreciate to have a pleasant discussion with those who disagree, rather than simply downvoting me without giving your opinion. Because if you think you're going to convince me or learn by only downvoting, you should think twice. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a representative because he represents the commune, and any representative has the responsability of sharing results and messages by the commune (if the commune wants the representative to do so). It's a voluntary hierachy, which anarchists accept. A society with no hierarchy can't work, a society with no unjustified/involuntary hierarchy can work.

 Negotiations between 2 communes would be difficult enough since any proposal made by commune Y after every citizen votes on it, would then have to be presented to commune X for every citizen to vote on, and every time a counter offer or revision to the proposal is made, that would in turn need to be voted on again by every citizen of both communes, until such a time as the citizens of both communes vote majority approval for something, and this is just between 2 communes. 

There are many ways of organising this better. I actually thought of some kind of an International-type of which all communes are part of. This way, we could do meetings between some or all communes, depending on the issue(s), and it would be faster and easier. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Seems like that would severely limit our ability to progress though, since cooperation would be limited to people within a commune. 

Think of it as a federal system, but with no centralised authority. Under a federal system, every federation is independent to some extent, but still cooperates and works with other federations. This would be the same, as cooperation will help all communes.

 Effective communication between communes would end up requiring a representative, which would look like the start of a state system. 

Nonono, a State is a hierarchical institution, a government can be decentralised and direct democratic, which is the opposite of a State. Anarchists are against involuntary hierarchies/authority, meaning that a Representative, if everyone for example agrees on X person being a representative of the commune, it's totally valid and compatible with anarchism. However, as you say, the only function of this person would be to representate and expand communication, it has no power to become an authority or anything like that. </TEXT>

Then, regarding economy there are different stances between anarchists, but a communist economy seems to be the most supported one.

Also, "communism" is a broad term, which means a stateless, moneyless and classless society, not an authoritarian regime. It's Marxist, Marxist-Leninists and such who want an authoritarian regime/dictatorship of the proletariat. Some others want a more democratic or minimal State, and others, like anarcho-communists, don't want to use the State as a tool to achieve communism. </TEXT>

That's actually what we do, we create communes voluntarily, by giving the workers their right to create them. I don't know what the heck did you smoke while writing this.

No communist will ever respect property rights, as the core of our ideology is to oppose private property, huh. 

 and not annoy anyone 

I think this doesn't depend of any ideology, but of the individual. This crap automatically discredits your point, no offense.

 But a lot of anarcho-communists don't believe in property 

No anarcho-communist believes in **private** property, we believe in personal and communal property.

 don't mind theft 

What's 'theft'? Taxation, which doesn't exist under communism (as it's a moneyless society)? And how can it be possible, when resources are of free access to everyone, equally?

 shoplifting 

just, what?

How? Because communists tend to be authoritarian, ancoms are authoritarian too and communism can't be compatible with anarchism? Because we want everyone to be part of a commune to have a better organisation and make them live a better life? I mean, you're part of a commune, or you're alone, and being part of a commune can be desirable, but still no one forces you to be part of one under anarcho-communism.

Your comment is full of nonsense points which only purpose is to discredit anarcho-communism. If you want to discredit an ideology, be more discreet and show valid points. Criticising a whole ideology because of some individuals (when you didn't even provide sources or statistics, lol) isn't a valid point. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Depends, kids younger than 12 are immature, that's a fact, but once you reach puberty you can become more mature than an adult, and in this case, maturity doesn't depend on age, it stops being an indicative factor. At least for me that's how it is, without knowing the person first you can't really judge by his/her age (unless this person is a little kid) how mature (s)he is.

 Does that mean that X, who is younger than Y, is *necessarily* less mature than Y? NO! Because that's not how statistics work! Are you getting any of this? 

That's what I'm saying, someone younger than other isn't necessarily more or less mature. You can guess, but not be sure without first knowing the person. </TEXT>

We don't come to this sub to progress, but to have a talk between people who views the world like us and to discuss it. We don't need to progress, I bet we would even reject "progressing" as you mean.

We just focus on logic reasoning and science, you should go talk about this on less scientific-focused subs, as we already think that science is more important and trusting.

And by the way, philosophy isn't only philosophical stances, but also philosophical ideas, and only independent ideas. "Is life meaningless?", this question hasn't been answered by science and it could be answered by it. "Does God exist?" is a more basic and common one, and scientists are already trying to answer this.

Again, philosophy gives ideas to scientists find the answer. Philosophy just shares the thought or idea. I don't know what's the problem with this, as it's actually how the scientific method works. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, it's pretty obvious, but if you don't want to understand how nihilism can lead someone to become more rational and rely on science, then it's not me who must explain it and look like an idiot.

In any case, whether I'm right or wrong, you're actually being pretty hypocrite saying that right now, as you've done it before me:

 You can't just think and philosophize about the world till you die 

How do you know this? We don't philosophise about the world till we die, we arrived to a conclusion that puts and end to all these philosophical thoughts. Life is meaningless, morality isn't real, God doesn't exist, we can't know the absolute truth - so therefore, wasting your time with all of this is a waste of time. I don't know how you got to the conclusion that we philosophise about the world the whole time. You should've said that about other philosophers and philosophies, not nihilism.

 You need action. You can do it a little bit, but your actions should be more. This is only if you are trying to progress. 

This is actually nonsense, it has no relation to your previous sentence and no sense with your following sentence(s). Apart from that, we need action, but action for what? You don't even make it clear.

If you keep thinking about nihilism such as visiting this sub instead of living your life, you are in a feedback loop.

What's so bad about nihilism that we can't think of it? You talk about science, which requires thinking and constantly experimenting, we do that. We've become nihilists after thinking about life, and experimenting if that we're starting to believe is right or just a hypothesis or something like that. We rationalise our thoughts and feelings to arrive to a conclusion, and it isn't as if scientists didn't do that. And for me, by the way, philosophy is a step to the scientific method. Shuting down philosophy will also affect science, as philosophy is trying to discover the truth, and science is a tool for discovering the truth and how life works.

 Science, such as Stephen Hawking says is what defeats modern philosophy. Aka science is what is figuring out the world.  

Science doesn't defeat philosophy (nor philosophy defeats science). Philosophy, as I said before, is a ladder to science. Philosophy shares the hypothesis, science starts the experiment. They're both working for the same thing and helping each other discover the truth. 

These fields require focus. Just like the void focus on something and you'll progress on it. This is focused on those mostly younger than 40. You got a time limit till your life is up. Understand that and your self esteem should sky rocket.

I don't really understand what you're trying to express here, I see no relation between any of these things and how it was related to science or anything you mentioned before. </TEXT>

I disagree with mutualists, but hey, it's not a bad idea and they're my allies, so I wouldn't execute them or send them to a gulag. Isn't cooperation a basic anarchist principle? With division between us, there's no cooperation.

Plus, most anarchists believe in dividing a society in different communes which can organise themselves however they want, kinda like a federal system but in a smaller scale and with no centralisation. Therefore, if you don't want to live under a mutualist commune but a communist one, go live in a communist one, there'll be no problem and each commune will respect the others. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Moderation of all leftist subs suck. Tankies on communist subs banning anarchists and downvoting them to hell, and sectarian anarchists on anarchist subs banning any other communists, even MLs and calling them tankies.

It's absurd. I'm not even appealing for left unity, but stop being little kids and understand that politics is something serious and you're banning anyone who doesn't 100% agree with you. When you decide to become more serious, then dedicate to the moderation of these subs, else get the hell out of the moderation and stop fighting for things that started centuries ago. This goes for every mod, regardless of ideology, in case you decide to ban me for having a different ideology (which I didn't even state).

Worst of all, even MLs have been banned here for saying China isn't communist and things like that. If you're a tankie mod, go to r/MoreTankieChapo or r/COMPLETEANARCHY2 (it's tankie even though it sounds anarchist, I promise). Pathetic that a communist that's criticising a capitalist regime gets banned by tankies thinking that China or the DPRK is communistic in any way. Seriously, pathetic. In case you, mods, didn't know, "communism" reffers to a broad variety of ideologies, not only authoritarian communism or Marxism(-leninism). I guess that's something we all should know here.

And same goes for the sectarian anarchists. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Anarchism is organised in a small scale, we all agree on that, for the same reason you're stating and for other reasons.

Anarcho-communism hasn't been achieved, since anarcho-communism is a stateless, moneyless and classless society, not only a stateless one. The Revolutionary Catalonia limited the power of the regional government, achieving independence from the Republican Spain and started their own government separated from the regional and national one, even though the regional government was still active, but gave up soon.

Still, the Revolutionary Catalonia collectivised and industrialised their society, and started a semi-complete anarcho-collectivist society (different from anarcho-collectivism), while some areas were individualist or even mutualist (again, not completely). The militias were decentralised. I never cited any anarcho-communist society, while most societies (specially the Revolutionary Catalonia and the Free Territory of Ukraine) advocated for an anarcho-communist society, they didn't achieve one, and became anarcho-collectivist, mutualist and such.

Also, take into account these societies were invaded during wars or civil wars. The Revolutionary Catalonia was under a civil war and the 2nd world war was arriving. The Free Territory of Ukraine happened after a revolution against the USSR, which had its internal conflicts. Nowadays' anarchist societies, which aren't much anarchist, are either tribes or Christiania (which isn't much anarchist, but shares the ideology and it's at peace) and Exarchia, which is constantly at war with the police and the Greek government. So, you can see that if an anarchist revolution happened now, it would probably last longer.

Anarchists are against unjustified, or involuntary, hierarchies. The CNT-FAI had, for a while, a centralised army to fight against the nationalists, and hierarchies were respected. But instead of being an authority with the purpose of giving orders and the ones below obeying, it was a hierarchy to organise, and everyone agreed on it, therefore it was voluntary and didn't contradict their ideology. </TEXT>

How do you know? Anarcho-communism hasn't been exactly achieved, so you can't know that. 

resolving internal conflict 

Most conflicts between anarchist communes were actually external, not internal. Internal conflicts weren't much of a problem, generally.

 defending itself from an actually well coordinated, statist, force 

I can agree, but statism has nothing to do with this, but having a centralised or decentralised army. Anarchists usually use decentralised militias, though a centralised army wouldn't contradict their ideology.

And anarchists have organised their societies better (according to their ideology and goals) than communists, which end up in (state) capitalist regimes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If we advocated for getting rid of all hierarchies, our ideology wouldn't be supported by many people. Getting rid of all hierarchies is impossible, and some will even appear after disappearing, so a solution to this is to divide justified (or voluntary) hierarchy and unjustified (or involuntary) hierarchy.

In fact, this happens with every ideology, wanting to get rid of unjustified hierarchies, but we all have different definitions of what's an unjustified hierarchy, and for us, and unjustified hierarchy is an involuntary one that uses authority, power and a minority support (or even majority). </TEXT>

I'm tired to answer, but I'll answer this one. Are you serious? Yeah, there's no State without government, because the State is a government too, but a government isn't a State. If you're saying they're the same, I can give you a list of differences between a State and a government, as they're not synonyms and are always used as such.

Under socialism you can own property and trade, another thing would be having free trade and private property, which is different. And still, the prehistoric tribes, which were the first government, didn't trade that much with 'foreigners' and property was communal, not private. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a nonsensical premise.  Suppose I want to perform charity for a friend.  My labor is being exploited because he is profiting off it and paying me $0/hr for it.  According to your logic, charity cant be voluntary.  Ludicrous.

You wouldn't have this problem under communism, as currency won't exist. Also, you've talked about 3 different things that have no relation with the other. If you want to perform charity for a friend, do it. If your labour is being exploited and your boss isn't paying you enough or nothing at all, then you can't perform charity (unless you still have money). Your logic doesn't prove how charity can be voluntary or involuntary.

 Left-wing anarchism is a logical impossibility. You cant abolish hierarchies because you need a hierarchal structure to enforce the will of the voters. Thats why your definition of anarchism is logically inconsistent. 

It doesn't abolish hierarchies, it abolishes involuntary hierarchies, those not supported by the people. And, voters? Do we also need an involuntary authority to enforce everything? Everyone is part of the government, and if we decide to have someone to represent us, it's voluntary, therefore accepted.

Absolutely false. In Ancapistan, there is nothing stopping workers from joining together to form a collective, or others forming a commune. However in your fictional leftwing anarchist utopia, voters have decided that wage labor and charity are illegal, and enforced by a governmental hierarchy.

That collectives or communes wouldn't make any sense, as they would have no purpose but protecting the working class' rights, which is what already happens and isn't enough to satisfy the working class.

Also, our ideology has been tired before, even if not completely because other regimes invaded us, but our society worked. Has yours ever been tried? If not, don't call ours an utopia. And socialism isn't hierarchy or authoritarianism, you don't even seem to know how leftist anarchist ideologies work.

 The free market existed long before governments did 

First, there's a difference between state and government, and governments exist since the prehistoric tribes, are you saying the free markets already existed before the prehistoric tribes?

Second, sources? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  This is untrue, and your attempt to disqualify anarcho-capitalism as anarchism falls with this untrue claim. 

No, it's not untrue. I use facts taken from theory, history and common sense, and anarchists have always opposed exploitation. It's a fact.

 Please provide the quote of my actual words where I did this. 

With "you" I meant to say "anarcho-"capitalists in general, not you specifically. I don't know if you ever did that. That's why I said "*(those who do describe ideologies by using semantics)*"

So what? It's also a tool of socialism. The state as we know it corrupts every aspect of life. But that doesn't mean that the things it corrupts wouldn't exist at all without the state. Corporations, as we know them, are products of the laws of states. Marriage (which is really a type of corporation itself) as we know it is defined by the state. But removing the state from these things wouldn't entail a world without corporations or marriage. It would just entail a world where corporations and marriages would be defined in stateless terms. And so on with everything else.

Yeah, state is a tool of socialism, and they take advantage of that tool. You don't, and that will condemn your beloved ideology, as you advocate for X and will end up reaching Y for not using the State as a tool. And now, once your society is achieved, you'll have a new and worse State, ruled by corporations. </TEXT>

I can accept that you think capitalism is compatible with anarchism, but I can't tolerate you think socialism isn't compatible with anarchism just because you've got no idea of what socialism is. If you want to discuss that with me, go on, I don't bite. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Big government reffers to a government comprised of a majority, or everyone. Considering this, everyone being part of the government is a characteristic of anarchism.

In case you don't understand the difference, a State is a hierarchical institution comprised of a minority, or majority, that rules over a minority or majority. A government can be the same, but can also be the opposite. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, there are lots of reasons why anarchism isn't and can't be capitalist, but I'm going to make a brief summary, risking my karma:

1. Anarchism was theorised by socialists, as a socialist ideology to counter the authoritarian communist ideologies, and to achieve a socialist society.
2. Anarchism isn't "no rulers" or "anti-statism". That's just a characteristic, which is a consequence of the rejection of unjustified, or involuntary hierarchies. A boss-worker hierarchy can't be voluntary, and will lead to exploitation, which is what anarchists are against of.
3. The whole thing of the NAP makes your whole ideology unrealistic and impossible to achieve. Your only hope is to get into the system or convince a majority outside of the system, in any case, you're seen as a joke for the small percentage of the population who somehow knows about your ideology.
4. You come up with unvalid and arguments without any sense, like defining anarchism by using the etymology/semantics. This discredits your ideology, in case you didn't notice (those who do describe ideologies by using semantics).
5. Even if the rich-poor and boss-worker hierarchies were voluntary (which I seriously doubt anyone would want to be poor or be commanded by someone who doesn't care for you, but for the money you make), anarchists have always opposed these, as they trigger exploitation, slavery and poor working conditions.
6. The "if you're being exploited you're free to leave" isn't a valid point either. Leaving a bussiness in which your boss exploits you to start working in a bussiness where you'll be exploited again is nonsense.
7. Under "anarcho-"capitalism there'll be no space for other anarchist ideologies, and if it was like this, it would be "anarchism without adjectives" or "synthesis anarchism", not "anarcho-"capitalism.
8. Even if it in theory it was anarchism, in practice you would be giving freedom to bussinesses to become the new State. And who would stop them? The people, right? But you'll have to regulate these bussinesses so this doesn't happen again, right? Then you would be becoming a capitalist society into a socialist one, don't you think?
9. The State is a tool of capitalism. Do I need to explain this? The State enforces capitalism, makes sure there's no monopolies, protects the system to end up under other's hands so that capitalism remains active... You also need to enforce private property, and the police is actually a tool of private property enforcement and protection - and you're also getting rid of that.
10. The NAP is incompatible with anarchism. No one has a right to own property that's not personal over anyone else and to enforce "self-defense" for private property rights. </TEXT>

<TEXT> *Knock knock - ignorance is knocking the door.*

Like, seriously. Most pseudo-communist states aren't/weren't communist, but capitalist. China, the DPRK... Of course they haven't achieved a thing.

Between these communists (which, by the way, there are lots of different communist ideologies: anarcho-communism, luxembourgism, council and left communism, De Leonism...), before anarchism was theorised, some of them didn't believe in the transition and wanted to directly get into the final stage of communists (communism, aka a sateless, classless and moneyless society). These received different names, but they called themselves communists, and once Proudhon theorised anarchism as an anti-capitalist ideology (important note), these communists started calling themselves anarchists, and anarcho-communists, anarcho-collectivists and such. And they did achieve a stateless and even industrialised and collectivised society, with its flaws and incomplete, of course, but still pretty well organised.

Thinking communism is only authoritarianism is part of right-wing propaganda, don't worry. </TEXT>

Which is not the case with "an"caps/right libertarians, who destroyed the whole purpose of the ideology and made it advocate for something original anarchists/libertarians opposed. Leftists can technically be liberals too, as well as capitalists can, they're not mutually exclusive, so the term wasn't stolen, but reformed.

<TEXT> Anarchists advocate for a society free from INVOLUNTARY hierarchies, not all hierarchies. Some of these involuntary hierarchies are present, and will always be, in capitalism, hence why anarchists have always opposed capitalism and it's a heresy to be a capitalist and call yourself an anarchist. If your whole ideology is about getting rid of the State and is different from the original and accurate definition of anarchism (not taken from an apolitical dictionary, but from theory), change the name and use your own and different ideology. After all, if no other anarchist considers you anarchists, and you don't consider the majority of anarchists real anarchists, why bother calling yourselves anarchists?

I don't mean to sound hostile, but it's pretty easy to understand and do. There's only one definition of anarchism, and it isn't "no rulers" or "no state". It's "no involuntary hierarchies and authority, mutual aid, free association, egalitarianism and direct democracy" all together. Involuntary hierarchies and authority results in a voluntary society which gets rid of the State - which is replaced with a direct democratic government, contrary to many's opinion, anarchism isn't government-less, only stateless - and mutual aid results in mutual help and cooperation, which is exactly what an-coms want.

I guess it's the government-state's fault of making everyone believe socialism is authoritarianism and theft. How funny, most authoritarian regimes were capitalist and many capitalist governments approve taxation, which you consider theft. </TEXT>

If by optimist and pessimist you mean "optimistic/pessimistic nihilism", as those who feel bothered by the meaningless of life and those who don't, nihilism would be only optimistic, since if you're a nihilist, you must accept the meaningless of life, otherwise you're seeking for an answer to the meaningless and to counter it, so you may be an existentialist or absurdist or whatever.

If by optimist and pessimist you mean your view on the future and such, a nihilist would be realist and rational about the future, not optimistic or pessimistic. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh, so 100% of anarchism? Tankies are insufferable, they have nothing in common with anarchists

????

They fight for the workers too, and support antifa. "An"caps may be anti-fascist, but I've seen many criticising antifa and using them to judge the left. "An"caps don't fight for the workers.

And before anyone decides to think I have sympathies with tankies, no, I don't, but for me they're better than "an"caps. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My bad to not specify, by "capitalist" I meant those who own the means of production, a land or whatever, not exactly supporters of capitalism. If I meant the latter, it wouldn't make much sense what I've said. I agree with you, workers supporters of capitalism are still workers and deserve the same respect as other workers, and can be convinced to cooperate, as they're benefiting from it. But bosses of a means of production are less going to cooperate with the liberation of the ones who make profit for them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I consider myself first anti-capitalist and then anti-authoritarian. Capitalism does more harm, at least for me and it has done to me and my family, and is harder to get rid of than authoritarianism (even though I guess it depends too).

Yet still, as I think I haven't said it, I'm not saying all "an"caps and tankies are fools and evil, but most of them are. I've also had conversations with tankies and "an"caps which were pleasant even though we disagreed with each other.

<TEXT> Better 'red fascists' than 'yellow fascists'. "Anarcho-"capitalists tend to not provide any valid point, use etymology to define anarchism, stole terms and inaccurately use them with oxymorons (tankies don't call themselves "authoritarian anarchists", afortunately), and even if you're right and without providing an answer, they'll downvote here because their ideology is far more important than the actual truth.

By my experience, tankies provided better points, even if by childish means and ways. And the only difference I see with them is authoritarianism and using the State as a tool, with "an"caps I find much more differences (the NAP, private property, free markets-deregulation, the risk of capitalism being anti-statist...) </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's funny though, how many of them probably didn't even think of answering to me.

I thought people, especially leftists, would be more comprehensive of the fact that some people may preffer to live under an authoritarian regime rather than a capitalist one because of the terrible experiences that person might have had with capitalism - but the first move is always to attack. Curious, even though I've been told in this post many times to first try to educate and convince.

By the way, you say you're disgusted by me but you're just providing a link to a raddle thread where many people are answering to me (when I don't even use raddle), but I don't see the reason why you're disgusted. Don't you have a personal answer or you're just sharing everything they've said?

It's also funny how many of them criticise the fact that I've had my problems with capitalism (and not with authoritarianism) just because I decided to consider ("anarcho-")capitalism worse than tankies. Maybe you should be disgusted with these kind of people. This is why I left raddle, it's full of people that deserve no respect from me and they keep hunting people who are in the same side as them - as they did with me for no valid reason, and got banned. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Communism was a threat for capitalist and fascist countries. Communism isn't the end-goal for almost every leftist, if you consider anti-capitalist ideologies to be leftist. If you do, social democrats, mutualists, individualists (anti-capitalist ones), left-market anarchists and such fit in the left. Mutualists have a certain mixed economy, meaning that they mix some things from both communism and capitalism to make a balanced system (free and equal). 

Well, it's pretty clear why the USSR backstabbed anarchists: ideological differences and the fact that, especially Stalin, they wanted power, and anarchists were against power. </TEXT>

<TEXT> so why bother?

Because it's my ideology, which since its early times has fought against capitalism, and I do fight against capitalism, and I really oppose capitalism. I'll never allow anyone to, then, call anarchism a capitalist ideology, or that it can be compatible with capitalism if there's no valid point. It's as if you hated someone who hurted you before and now he joins a group of friends you're part of, it's not pleasant.

I understand what you say, still for me capitalism, as well as authority, is a personal attack (for personal reasons I don't find necessary to explain). So getting into an ideology that was against both of them helped me to feel that there was at least hope and that my personal issues would be fixed thanks to anarchism, and seeing that there's people ruining its image, even if just a minority that doesn't do much harm now, is like a personal attack and something I can't tolerate.

And since I tend to debate a lot and I can get a bit nervous when people say something wrong about one topic they know nothing about, or try to sabotage the meaning/definition of it (like when capitalists say communism is authoritarianism and therefore it's bad), I have it hard to control myself with tankies and especially "an"caps, as tankies at least don't claim to be something they're not. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For me capitalism is, basic and vaguely, allowing private property, free market, the use of currency as a means of trade and profit, and having hierarchies like boss-worker and economical classes. As an addition to "allowing private property", "an-"caps introduce the NAP which in fact is mainly to defend private property against "aggressors".

Maybe I've got something wrong with this idea of capitalism, it's like I see it. I'm not saying these are exclusive from capitalism, as currency can be used in most systems, if not every. 

Private property for me isn't necessary and just another form of hierarchy and domination caused by the presence of a currency and the need for economical inequality (aka having economical classes) to exist. The one with most wealth has the right to own a land if this person pays for it. I totally disagree with private ownership of the means of production. In the worksplace, those who works are called workers, those who don't work are called other thing (boss, for example). If I work 8h a day for my boss, he shouldn't receive any profit for his work, as he hasn't worked. I should receive it, if I'm working alone, I should be the only one who received it, if I'm not the only one working, it should be distributed equally (if we're 2 and we're getting paid 100$, both of us should receive 50$). That, or the one who most worked gets most, but not the boss who did nothing.

The free markets are also a terrible idea for me. Not regulating the markets just leads to more inequality and those with a lower income will have low chances of getting anything good from the markets. If the market is regulated, prices will be fair and same for everyone.

Currency isn't necessary and just helps on the fact that not everyone will have access to basic resources, such as water, electricity and others. What I've said before would be kinda irrelevant in a moneyless society and would work completely different, and better. Many capitalists say that currency is positive for trade, but trade, both national and international, local, regional and such, can be done by giving away an object for another object you want, not money for an object you one. And this way, both persons are benefited directly and without accumulating wealth that may not even use in a while.

About the NAP, it's clear why it isn't anarchist, and it isn't about self-defense. Getting into your land without your permission isn't an attack, not more than a crime, if even that. If there's no attack-offense, there's no self-defense. Basic one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've done it many times, I just don't convince anyone and most of the time I get stupid points coming from them. All of the ones I discuss with seem to have an idea and don't seem confused, rather than that, they seem to really think with security that capitalism is compatible with anarchism and it can work. No matter how you tell them, they won't listen and will just insult you as well, saying that "real anarchism is ancapism" and that other anarchists are authoritarian scum and such.

Sorry, but if you're going to talk about politics and call yourself X, have an idea of it first. It's like saying "I was diagnosed with psychopathy with 7 years old". If you want to call yourself an anarchist, you must read about anarchism, and not only anarchism, but also other ideologies and have an open mind. I first started with leftism, then saw communism and looked cool, then I saw anarchism and found it was most accurate with my views. Then I started reading about anarchism, and discovered "anarcho-"capitalism. As I was new with this whole thing of politics and economics, I didn't know much about capitalism, and honestly didn't understand it much at first, so I started reading about capitalism until I got a more or less clear idea of what it was. Then I asked why was it incompatible with anarchism (since I still didn't know much about politics) and learned more, and especially, I learned why it can't be compatible with anarchism. If I could with only 14yo and not knowing much about politics, why couldn't an "an"cap learn?

Else they're brainwashed or they won't let themselves have an open minded. It's not hard to invent a new term, or start using a new one (since the term "voluntaryist" already exists). </TEXT>

The fact that the examples you're giving are more extreme and unrealistic, as that would condemn the whole system, I guess that if "an"capism turns out to be another statist crap in practice, corporations would privatise the police and send them to enforce laws. If cops aren't already enforcers of private property, imagine now them under "an"capism enforcing the NAP alongside owners. </TEXT>

See communism, it started as an inoffensive and disgusting ideology no one seemed to want to try and then in the 20th century it started to become a threat for many. If those who thought of communism a threat then took the ideology more seriously and attacked it before it became stronger, I'm pretty sure not even the USSR would've been as "successful" as it was, or even existed at all.

2 years ago I remember no one between my anarchist circles knew about "anarcho-"capitalism. Now they do. I guess it's an example of how such a meme can become something serious in just some years.

I'll repeat what I've said before to another person, you can't cooperate with capitalists to liberate the working class. Sure, they could cooperate with us to get rid of the State, but we want to get rid of the State for different reasons. Same goes with any fascist who would like to get rid of the State, would you cooperate with them because they also want to get rid of the State, even thought what they want is to replace it with a dictatorship?

I mean, one thing is cooperating with a tankie and another thing is cooperating with an "an"cap. Tankies support antifa, socialism and some of them aren't so close minded and jerks. They'll of course be a problem once the revolution is over, but unity can make enemies friends, at least some of them would forget about us and let us achieve our goals. And to make this happen, we could also negotiate: if they don't betray us, we'll help them with their revolution and such. If they reject the offer, they're dumb. With "an"caps you can't negotiate anything. They don't support antifa, they don't support socialism, they don't even support worker rights, they don't support equality, they even may end up creating a corporative or crypto-fascist state...

<TEXT> At this point, as an anarchist, I'm so disgusted by "an"caps that I can say that I'd rather spend my whole life listening to a tankie than an "an"cap.

By my experience with both, tankies, while being really childish and not providing any valid point (while thinking that "anarchists are utopians and liberals" is a valid one), I still know I can, to some extent, tolerate them. I mean, yeah, they're authoritarian and are always bitching about us (even though they've started most wars against us for no reason), but they're not capitalist pigs making of a precious ideology a complete crap and changing its definition.

An "an"cap said time ago that we changed the definition of anarchism (interesting, though, considering the ones who theorised anarchism, mainly Proudhon, Bakunin and Kropotkin, were all socialists and strictly anti-capitalist, and would never allow their ideology to be considered right-wing) and some say that "real anarchism" is "anarcho-"capitalism. Well, what's more real, the definition stated by those who theorised it, or by a bunch of fools who stole 2 terms from them?

Dear "anarcho-"capitalists: 'anarchism', etymologically, means "no rulers". We all agree on that. But semantics/etymology isn't enough to describe an ideology or a philosophy, and if you really do think it can be used as a definition, you just show how pathetic your ideology is. Anarchism isn't "anti-statism", it is against involuntary hierarchies, which one of them is the State. Anti-statism is just a consequence of the rejection of involuntary, or unjustified, hierarchies. Capitalism creates not only useless but involuntary and exploitative hierarchies (such as the boss-worker one) that no anarchist would ever tolerate.

Understand that capitalism requires a state for a reason. Do you want to know why? Because the State is also a tool for capitalists. Think of it, the state can protect capitalism and enforce it. The state can make sure no business will take power and start a dystopian capitalist regime similar to cyber-punk ones. And yes, I know cyber-punk is pure fiction, but that's the truth. Get rid of the state in capitalism, and corporations will take advantage of their freedom.

Just wanted to rant. I'd rather live under an authoritarian commie shit than under a capitalist "anarchy" crap. To some extent, tankies respect workers, not like "an"caps. r/fakeanarchism (lmao), r/Anarcho_Capitalism, r/anarchy (lmao x2), r/GoldandBlack, I'm talking with you all. Am I the only one who would rather spend time with a tankie rather than an "an"cap? </TEXT>

<TEXT> To get resources because the boss is the one with private property, it is less difficult than starting your own business from scratch. So every one wins, proof, If not the contract will not occur, so the dichotomy between the "worker" and the "boss" (like the boss do nothing) is completely retarded

Can't this be done without the boss-worker/employer-employee hierarchy?

 In every group there is always a natural hierarchy that occur, because not every one has the same capacity, work ethics etc. 

Depends on your definition of hierarchy. For me, hierarchy requires power, and I don't see this power in school groups (for example).

 For the same reason, because of merit, why don't you make your own business ? that way, after being successful you can give all your accumulated wealth to your "workers" like you say. 

I would do it, but unfortunately without money you can't expect to be successful. That's one of many other reasons why I oppose money. Others are the fact that it promotes egoism and doing things only/mainly for the money, generates inequality and that it restricts resources to only those who are able to pay for them, when it should be for everyone. Making water of a product to get money is pathetic.

 Because you don't have the work ethics to make your own business 

That doesn't make sense. I'm not saying "why can't I be the boss?" but "why do we have a boss?".

 No, you can always leave, negociate a better salary by working more, etc 

And what if the boss refuses to negotiate? You should leave a job and join another in one the risk of being exploited again exists? No, thanks. Exploitation isn't solved by adding or replacing it with more exploitation. </TEXT>

And again, believing that a dictatorship would be successful and useful for the transition is also utopian, not considering that it can turn out to be a capitalist tyranny. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We don't want a transition, at all. We want to get rid of the State because it's a tool for capitalists and to stop the revolution. After reading history, and nowadays' pseudo-communist countries like the DPRK or China, even if they're not socialist or state capitalist, I don't want to go through that and risk the revolution.

None of us are realistic if you think anarchists aren't realistic. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. "no rulers" comes from the etymology. How the heck can you describe an ideology by its etymology? You can only complement the definition of an ideology with it, not explain. Following your logic, liberalism is just appealing to liberty, communism is when society is divided in communities, existentialism is about existence, nihilism about nothing, fascism about a society ruled by fasces... Vague and absurd definitions taken by etymology, don't you think? Stop using etymology for that, also don't read dictionaries' definition of philosophies and ideologies, they're vague and inaccurate (as many dictionaries still use "anarchy" as a synonym for chaos, after 2 centuries trying to explain anarchy is about order)
2. Hierarchy can be voluntary, yes, but not every hierarchy is voluntary. Why would a worker want to accept a boss' hierarchy? In school we learn to cooperate in groups without hierarchies to get a better mark. Why shouldn't it be the same in our jobs? Why do we have to obey to a sucker who doesn't work and decides what do we gain, how do we work and gets a part of the money we're supposed to get? That's not fair. 
3. Boss-worker hierarchy, even if voluntary, stops being voluntary at the moment the worker is exploited by the boss. And exploitation is the nature of capitalism, you can't say otherwise, history and modern capitalist states speak for themselves. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Technically, both anarchism and nihilism oppose authority. For anarchists, because it's usually not justified and uses force, power and violence. For nihilists, because it has no objective meaning or value, and nothing can have an authority, if someone has authority, it's because we gave him/her authority. Similar to morality, it doesn't really exist, it's just a social construct, and we decide to use (or not use) morality.

I'm not saying they're both the same or anything like that, but the confusion between these two terms makes some sense. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's bad because it's trying to address problems that affect workers? Is a system in which the ones who do nothing exploit the ones who work for them to get profit? How is that better than socialism?

First of all, we live in different countries. Here having a degree is pretty pointless, specially considering that when my mother was young they were under a dictatorship trying to recover from a civil war, do you think my mother was able to study, considering most women had to stay at home? Maybe that's the whole reason why she works in cleaning services. Plus, marketing or medical degree has nothing to do with maintenance jobs, you don't need to have a degree to have a job and get paid more than any other working with you (as maintenance). 

It's funny though. You say "capitalism is about getting a good degree and doing something with it", but if getting a degree costs money, how then can you pretend we succeed under capitalism? We aren't born, most of us, with money. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My family works hard to get paid. My mother works a total of 6h, 2 jobs. Both jobs consist of cleaning and taking care of an office and a house of an old family. 8h in a boring and tiring job to get a fucking crappy quantity of money.

My father isn't working that much because of a health thing and he's on vacations. He works in transportation of resources, and with only one job he works more hours than my mother (around 8-9h). He gets paid fairly, but he hasn't got job to do for like 250/360 days.

My brother works in delivery, part of a corporation that exploits him. He always comes homes bitching about his crappy job and boss, saying that his boss makes him work more than he should and doesn't get paid for the extra-hours. Or how he's the one who most works but still he doesn't get paid or isn't respected as much as the others. Or how he's told to do the job of other workmates because they don't want to work or put up excuses to stay at home when they're okay and can work. My brother gets paid fairly, but at the cost of exploitation, something inherent from capitalism.

My sister is living with his brother, so she's not really "helping us" economically. She studied to be a teacher, but she just gets temporal contracts (of some months only) and is now working in an academy to help people with school studies. She gets paid relatively well, but again, she's constantly changing of school and jobs and waiting, and she's not fully part of our economy.

I'm a student and I'm not in the legal age to work, so if my family got fucked up right now economically, I wouldn't be able to help them. So, obviously, I don't get paid a thing.

Socialism addresses all these problems: exploitation, inequality, unfair pay, not being able to truly enjoy your life because of money, unemployment... Exploitation won't happen, as corporations will be regulated and if everything goes fine, there won't be any boss, just workers. I don't think I need to explain inequality and unfair pay. Money restricts us from doing the things we want, and socialism tries to address this by getting rid of it (through communism/anarcho-communism). Unemployment is obviously something important to address, more than anything else (like inflation) for socialists, as without a job, inflation won't matter, as people won't still have access to lower-prices resources.

Don't say that poor people are poor because they don't work hard. Under capitalism, working hard is pointless. It's common sense. An 80% of the rich population under capitalism doesn't work at all and got money through inheritance, lottery and such. And I'm even sure I will be poor when I grow up, not because I think that I won't work hard, but because that's how capitalism works. You can't have hope. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. It's the fact that you can't prove otherwise the reason why we reject its veracity.
2. Since you can't prove its veracity, and it doesn't make sense (how can something like life have meaning?), the most logical stance is to deny it. Same happens with atheists: you can't prove there's a God, and it doesn't make sense -for me-, so I reject the existence of God.
3. Any 'nihilist' (not an existential nihilist or moral nihilist or whatever, simply a 'nihilist') will believe that we can't never truly know anything. It even correlates with existential nihilism, we can't know if life is meaningless or if God exists, but the most logical stance is that it doesn't, therefore our knowledge is only based on logic and not truth, because you can't know the absolute truth. This is what we think. Epistemological nihilism isn't "nothing is real" but "we can't know everything". Considering this, you can't know if nihilism is right or wrong, so your question is absurd. Then, the epistemological nihilist is just being like a theist: I don't have proofs of God's existence, but I think it exists so I'll believe in it, regardless of if I have proofs or not.
4. Claiming life is meaningless is more logical than claiming it is or can be meaningful. Why do you think life is or can be meaningful? Because you think it is? Find a logical reason why life is or can be meaningful. The only ones who have made a valid point as to why life is or can be meaningful are religious people, claiming that meaning comes from their religions/God. The problem is that, how do you prove your religion is right? If you can't prove life is meaningful, you're just left with doubt or rejection, but when you see that meaning is just a social construct, you just think that it's not something possible or real. How did the universe create meaning? I can understand that it could create planets, galaxies, stars and such - but abstract things like meaning? Love? No way.

By the way, nihilism isn't exactly the only philosophy which claims that life is meaningless. While most of us believe that life isn't and can't be meaningful in any way, the most appropiate definition of what we think is "life isn't universally meaningful", meaning that there's a space for subjective or personal meaning, meaning that an apple may be meaningful for me, but not for another person, so apples are therefore not universally meaningful. However, it's mainly existentialism and absurdism who claim this. The main difference is that nihilists accept that any personal meaning or value you have, isn't real, but you shouldn't be excluded from it just because it isn't real. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My point is that some leftists THEORISED, not invented, anarchism as a leftist ideology, specially for those communists-socialists who considered the State to not be necessary to achieve communism, and thanks to Proudhon they got another name, anarchists. Grouping a group of radical anti-capitalists with capitalists is a terrible idea.

Considering that, the Nazis were socialists because they had "socialist" in the name. right? Well, they weren't that socialist, especially Hitler, and still they're called natsocs.

You said it, "broadly speaking". What's the developed theory of anarchism? Anarchism is anti-statist because anti-statism is one of the consequences of opposing involuntary hierarchies, which capitalism creates, which the police supports, and which the State is. "An"caps should get another name and stop considering themselves anarchists, as anarchism isn't only "anti-statism". For God's sake, even like an 80% of anarchist books are leftist/post-left and even Rothbard said "anarcho-"capitalism isn't anarchism and we should stop using the term.

Why insist on sharing our terms when you already stole 2 of them and most leftist anarchists want "an"caps to stop calling themselves anarchists? Some anarchists call themselves libertarians (libertarian socialists for those in America), why can't "an"caps call themselves voluntaryists or right libertarians or any other name? </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not hard to do so. Nihilism is just accepting reality, you're a nihilist if you believe in what it states, and you don't feel sad or happy about it, you just want to keep living without caring about meaning, value, morality and such. This doesn't mean that in order to be a nihilist you must get rid of meaning and value, since it's practically impossible for us to get rid of them, but a nihilist is only someone who, even though (s)he knows that morality (for example) isn't real, (s)he still is free to use morality, while recognising it is only a social construct, or free to not use. Since there's no right or wrong path, as stated by nihilism, no lifestyle can be considered nihilistic, but every lifestyle is nihilistic. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, terms don't evolve. Feudalism will always be the way it was first used. Capitalism will always be the way it was first used. Communism will be the way it was theorised. If you want to change something from the original theory, you must change the name, as it's done in the thousands of anarchist ideologies, or as it's done in communism, and even capitalism. 

Anarchism has always been left-wing and was theorised as a socialist ideology. As well as communism can't be in any way right-wing, anarchism can't. Stop saying it can be right-wing just because it advocates for a stateless society, when there are more characteristics which are incompatible with capitalism. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We know about history, that's one of the reasons we're anarchists and probably not communists. As Bakunin said to Marx, their ideas would end up in a capitalist tyranny and never achieve communism that way. Before starting to call myself an anarchist, I readt about other ideologies. Curious of communism and its similarities with anarchism, I readt about history and specifically the USSR, and then I checked nowadays' pseudo-communist states, and honestly, do you think it's a good idea?

We don't think capitalism will just disappear out of nothing. We think the State protects capitalism, and that without the State, the workers will work to make capitalism disappear. Because, after all, the State gets benefited by capitalism, the workers don't. The State hasn't got access to all means of production, while the workers of these means of production actually do. The cooperation to get rid of capitalism will also strengthen us and our desire to keep an ordered anarchy.

Also, the problem wasn't the USSR. The "USSR" refers to the Soviet people, when most of them didn't do anything, and some even were victims of being innocent. It's actually the bureaucratic institutions (the State, the army...) the problem. You don't have to kill people because they think you're authoritarian as hell and they oppose your regime, and when Stalin started this genocide, he transformed the USSR into a tyranny. And the next leaders didn't even do anything interesting, except finally killing the regime.

Opposing a regime doesn't mean you're going to start a revolution, Stalin was so paranoid that he thought "Opposing a regime" meant that and started a genocide against these: Trotskyists, Makhnovists/anarchists... </TEXT>

Let's imagine everyone in a community agrees on having a leader, they elect it, and it's totally voluntary. The problem is that it'll surely emerge into power, and it would be dangerous. You don't actually need a leader to organise a community. Anyways, we see revolutionary leaders, like Buenaventura Durruti and Nestor Makhno, to be accepted by anarchists. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not that what Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Mussolini, Franco and many other dictators did was fine or okay, but that morality isn't a valid argument to state that what these complete assholes did is or isn't justified or deserved to be punished.

Logic is your friend, not morality. Logic exists, reason too. Morality is a social construct, and not logical. You can say that Hitler shouldn't've done what he did because he had no logical reason to do so, and then it's totally valid to oppose him. It's not valid to oppose him just because he killed lots of jews. Yeah, he did, but 'killing jews', even if you don't like it, can be justified through logical reasoning. If Jews were planning to exterminate any non-Jew , then there would be a logical reason to attack Jews. But they didn't plan anything similar, so Hitler didn't have a valid and logical reason to start a genocide.

But actually, most nihilists would say that what Hitler did, regardless of if it was justified through logical reasoning or not, wasn't either valid (right) or invalid (wrong). Therefore, it isn't justified, nor unjustified. It simply isn't nothing, you're free to kill anyone you want, but you'll have to face the consequences. If you're allowed to kill anyone, then I'm allowed to kill you too. I think nihilism, specifically moral nihilism, is appealing to logic and reason rather than morality, not only to justify, but to seek an alternative to the way most people live nowadays. 

This means that if I'm thinking of killing you, I shouldn't appeal to a social construct like morality and act according to what I feel is right or wrong, but to what I feel is logical and reasoning, and if killing you isn't logical and reasoning because I'll probably go to jail and sacrifice my freedom, I won't kill you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, it's hard to say these will not exist. Psychopathy isn't a clinical diagnosis, and is often categorised under ASPD (Antisocial Personality Disorder), which is both genetic and nurtured. If it's a case of genetics, it can't be fixed through politics, at all. If it's caused by nurture, then it depends on what caused you the disorder. Apart from that, I don't think psychopathy or sadism are caused by any political system, except for authoritarian and totalitarian ones, such as fascism, which of course can even make you fit into the category of "sociopath" by just having a high rank/role in a fascist society.

I don't think fascism actually causes sadism, but it attracts sadists. When you've got power and privileges, you've got it easy to make others suffer to satisfy your sadistic needs. However, other disorders like depression, anxiety, narcissism and even paranoia can be caused or influenced by capitalism and any political system, including anarchism. Narcissists would enjoy a capitalist society, as people aren't treated equally and getting more money will make them think they're more special. Anxiety and depression can be caused by capitalism: poverty, leading to not having access to basic resources. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Many ancaps hate the term ancap. 

But this sub is called "anarcho-"capitalism and it's full of people using the term "anarcho-"capitalism.

 collectivism 2 refer 2 yalls shit. 

Well, that one doesn't make any sense, collectivism is a really broad term. And in case of anarchism, anarcho-collectivism is different from anarcho-communism.

 Whether u wanna play the #notrealcommunism game or not, i dont care. Each time we pursue collectivism, we get rampant suffering and death. 

Sure? There have been many examples of socialist anarchism in history, for example some tribes, in which they leaved peacefully. Modern history just offered wars, so no modern anarchist society has been in peace. But this argument can also be used against you, since many people live under capitalist societies and see how crap it is, they can lead to the conclusion that capitalism is crap, because all countries under capitalism are.

 Unlike voluntarism, we have mountains of evidence, both from past and present day 

I wouldn't say you have any evidence, capitalism without a State is different than capitalism with a State active (whether or not in interferes in the markets). Voluntaryism hasn't been tried before, capitalism has. But this capitalism has always had a State.

 whether it's the utopian flavor u authoritarians speak of so fondly, or the #notrealcommunism that took/takes place in reality every single time we pursue it 

First, saying that communism is authoritarianism is really wrong. In fact, not even Ms/MLs are authoritarians, but their ideology, as the wise Bakunin said to Marx during the 2nd International, would only end up in authroitarian regimes. But it's not what they pretend, generally. There's a difference between a dictatorship/totalitarianism and authoritarianism, by the way. But you would still be wrong, since "communism" is also a category of ideologies, as well as anarchism, and some communists advocate for a more democratic transition, others, like ancoms, advocate for no transition. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Anarcho-"capitalism isn't anarchism. Even Rothbard said it. Why are they anarchists? Because they are against the State? If "anti-statism" was the only characteristic of anarchism it would be called "anti-statism", not "anarchism". 

Not again, stop describing ideologies and philosohpies through etymology, please, it's absurd and a very bad strategy to make a point. The etymology is just a brief summary of an ideology/philosophy, not a description/definition. Anarchism, technically, isn't "no rulers", it's "no State", a State is different from a ruler: a ruler is part, alone, of the State, a State can be composed of a minority of people.

Proudhon opposed both communism and capitalism, and he created an ideology that mixed characteristics of both systems. If it were socialists who started describing themselves as anarchists, is because many socialists (or communists) didn't have an ideology that advocated for communism but without the Statist transition part. "Anarcho-"capitalists just use the etymological definition without reading theory and history, and without using common sense. And with common sense I mean that if you give bussinesses freedom (and they'll have freedom, since one of the reasons why the State is necessary under capitalism is that it stops bussinesses from taking control of society), these bussinesses-corporations will start becoming the new State. Employer-employee/boss-worker and rich-poor hierarchies are incompatible with anarchism and will be formed, and will lead to exploitation, regardless of if you desire it or not.

 Anarchism: no state. There are people on the right who don't want to have a state. Therefore they are anarchists. Your arguments don't entail that they shouldn't. 

When I see people reffering to anarchism to simply "no state" or "no rulers" I, honestly, and no offense, just want to punch them in the fact and buy them some books they should read, which are part of their so-claimed ideology.

Anarchism isn't \[only\] "no state", if it was, it would be called "anti-statism". Anarchism is getting rid of involuntary hierarchies, and the State is an involuntary hierarchy, as well as the bureaucratic institutions that protect the State. Private property is another involuntary hierarchy, you've got no right to claim ownership of a land and make profit from it just because you have or want to make money. That's incompatible with anarchism, again.

 That's an incredible arrogance. Very leftist. 

Well, a man can think of others and not money too. A bussiness will only think of and care of the money, as well as Capitalists, which is the reason why exploitation exists, because, why care about others' rights if my priority is making money?

An advice, stop using etymology to describe ideologies and philosophies. It's absurd and just makes you look stupid </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not really. Pseudo-communist states like the USSR, DPRK and China aren't communist, even if many communists (especially tankies) consider them communist. Plus, communism is divided into many ideologies, and there are many communist ideologies that haven't been tried before, only Marxism-Leninism and maybe simple Marxism. Left communism, council communism, De Leonism, Trotskyism... These are just a few.

Same happens with anarchism: anarcho-communism, anarcho-syndicalism, anarcho-primitivism, and even anarcho-collectivism we could say, have been tried before. But other anarchist ideologies like anarcho-individualism, Mutualism or Egoism haven't been tried. So you can't generalise.

And I said that you should take both theory and history into account, not to determine if it's a good or bad idea, but to determine if it can work and what's it about. History helps us understand the theory, and if anarchism has always been leftist and only leftist anarchism has been tried before, and it was theorised as a left-wing ideology, I think the most logical conclusion you can arrive to is that anarchism is leftist. And if theory says anarchism is against the State and capitalism, it's absurd to claim that anarchism is or can be capitalist. I know I'm going to get downvoted, and that I won't change anything, but whatever.

If etymology ever was an accurate thing to explain an ideology or philosophy, then "nihilism" is about "nothing", existentialism about "existence", fascism about "fasces" and capitalism about "capital". It's a vague way to describe it, isn't it? Anarchism means, etymologically, "no rulers", but "no rulers" it's just a characteristic out of many more, you can't describe anarchism by just using etymology. </TEXT>

<TEXT> More or less. Certainly, anarchists were just socialists who wanted to directly overthrow the State instead of using it as means to achieve communism. Anarchism is when there's no involuntary hierarchy or authority, not only "no one can force you to do something". No one has the right and authority to force through violence and power, but your community can decide to kick you for not following their rules, after all it would be you against the whole community.

Economically, as I said before, anarchism isn't and can't be capitalist. Anti-statism may be compatible with capitalism (or not), but it's called another thing, not anarchism. In an anarcho-communist society, there'll be no money to pay taxes, but in anarchist societies where money is used, you'll have to pay taxes, since there'll be no private property as in capitalist countries to maintain themselves. </TEXT>

Well, then... the USSR started a state capitalist tyranny, money wasn't removed, the State remained active for all the existence of the USSR (almost a century...) and Lenin and Stalin's authority created "communist concentration camps" and killed comrades just for opposing this chaotic transition that wasn't even communistic.

<TEXT> 1. I may be wrong, but by what I've readt and taking history into account, doesn't the vanguard require of participation inside of the system? Also, the use of a political party requires of a certain hierarchy not needed and is used to get power. Anarchists oppose all of these: power, and participating in the system.
2. A State is a hierarchical institution formed by a minority which have power over a majority, and unless you live in a capitalist society, the State is controlled by the corporations and other elites. Anarchists advocate for a society where everyone is part of the government (different from 'State').

<TEXT> "We" refers to anarchists, those from this sub. The NAP is used by capitalists, especially "anarcho-"capitalists, to make private property something serious and real. If I own this land just because I buyed it or I made other people work on it, I have no right to own this land alone and restrict-ban people from getting into the land. It's not a personal property, like a house, it's a private property. That's what the NAP is for. The land is owned by everyone, or at least those who built it, not the person who invested more on it. That's just another form of hierarchy, that's why "an"caps aren't anarchists and the NAP isn't compatible with anarchism, if you want to exclude the capitalist parts of the NAP (if there's any non-capitalist part), seek a new name for it, or else there's going to be a lot of confusion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I started talking about authority I was just giving an example, not relating it with hierarchy.

The USSR, especially under Stalin, was a totally paradise. Sure. Anarchists, before Proudhon, Bakunin and Kropotkin called themselves only socialists, but they were anarchists. They thought the State needed to be overthrown to achieve communism, because the State would turn out to be a tyranny that wouldn't ever achieve communism, and that happened in many pseudo-communist states, like the USSR or nowadays' North Korea. In almost a century of history, the USSR only achieved an industrialised (state) capitalist tyrannical dictatorship. Nothing more. Are you telling me that a revolution lasts more than 60 years when you've got more than a majority's support? I don't think so.

Or else the Soviet rulers didn't want to achieve communism, or their strategy didn't work. In any case, having a State transition didn't work for them. We believe that if we directly overthrown the State, we would be able to get rid of Capitalism by giving the workers the power, rather than a minority, majority or one person. </TEXT>

Now, we don't think that nothing matters because we're going to die. Sure, things matter less since there's an end, that doesn't mean less motivation, but more motivation to do whatever you want, you'll going to die, why live a boring life? The thing is that we think that nothing matters bcause life is meaningless. No matter what life you choose, it has the same ending, you'll still be another human being, irrelevant and not special in any way, everything you feel, see and hear can be simply a product of your brain-mind and you probably don't know it. That's why "nothing matters", objectively, because subjectively things can matter to you.

<TEXT> Theory isn't practice, but you were talking about theory, not practice. And you were also talking about authoritarianism, while left communism, council communism and even De Leonism exist inside the category of "communism". Also, have you ever read about anarchism in practice? It's never been +75% successful, but it sure's been successful, and could've been if they had more chances. If anarchists can, communists can.

 All authleft experiments transitioned into authright, not libleft. 

That's the funniest thing, most dictatorships tend to just end up being tyrannies and 0 communism. Communists calling anarchists idealists without taking this into account are just stupid or tankies (even though there's no difference). </TEXT>

Now I'll become a terrorist for the first time in my life (while I've been antifa for 2 years already, a bit late, sorry) and I'll plant a bomb in your house for being anti-antifa and therefore a fascist. Say goodbye to your family, you fascistic scum.

<TEXT> Are communists racist to anyone? Xenophobes? Sexist? Usually, they aren't. Isn't their goal helping everyone by having a fair system in which no one is rich or poor?

I don't know, but I'm pretty sure fascists are only liked by other fascists. Communists tend to be supported by anarchists (and anarchists by communists).

Antifa uses violence because it's the only way to change a thing. And don't say that being part of the system is going to change anything, because the system tends to only support one spectrum, and it's usually the right-wing. Plus, many fascists create a mask disguising their real ideology (as simply conservatives, liberals and such) and I'm pretty sure most of them, if they get enough power, will reveal their real face.

Any leftist who proposes working on the inside as the only option to take, is the most blind person in the world. Especially if that leftist is an anarchist. Haven't ever thought about why the left always proposes a revolution, insurrection and such to achieve their goals? Because there's no other option left for them. The system isn't ever going to help the left. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. We suffer because our brain is a fucking asshole, but at the same time our brain is a good friend who makes you suffer to make you get over certain situations. Fear is useful to keep you at guard when your brain feels like something bad might happen to you. While feelings are just chemicals, these chemicals are produced by you - your brain -, and can still be useful. We suffer because our brain is trying to help us, or entirely fuck us up. It depends on how healthy your brain is, I guess.
2. As I said before, it can help you avoid or get over situations you may dislike. I don't know about others, but when I used to feel sad I started thinking about what happened, what can I do to make sure it won't happen again, I improved my lifestyle... And by having fear I became stronger and got over some fears. Suffering may be a shit, but it helps. Certainly, it's pointless, as you don't really need it to live, and if the brain didn't process these chemicals, you wouldn't really 'suffer'. But if you think that improving your life or getting over things is better than being numb and indifferent at everything, then it's not pointless for you. I don't know how to explain myself lol.
3. Is it me or have I already answered this?

<TEXT> Technically, yes. The theory speaks for itself. But if you follow the etymology, as ancaps do, then anarchism looks compatible with capitalism. The thing is that an ancap society will just create hierarchies and give freedom to the bussinesses to become the new State, not much anarchist. That's why anarchism was more popular between socialists and it was theorised by a socialist. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Ancoms would never let a capitalist society within their system and would use force to get rid of it as they see it as a threat to their vision of ideal society. 

It's not because of that, but because if I were to live in a capitalist society and I turned out to be poor, I'll be eating crap (or nothing) while I see rich people abusing of their wealth and privileges instead of helping me and other poor people. Communism, in general, rejects this. Everyone should be equal: equally poor, equally rich, equality of privileges, equality of income (or no income)... What's the deal about this? Do you really need to satisfy your egoist needs? Do you really depend on money when you can live in a moneyless and fair society?

Sorry, but I'll never cooperate\* with a capitalist as well as an authoritarian. I can accept communists as long as they're not authoritarian. But I can't accept ancaps or conservatives or any capitalist. I see no difference in having a dictatorship, be it capitalist or socialist, and a capitalist society. Both of them are crap and allow tyrannies.

<TEXT> It's wrong if the state taxes, it's okay if the voluntary community enforces it. Anyways, currency is exploitation, so as an anarcho-communist, I oppose currency, and therefore I don't believe in taxation. But if I didn't oppose currency, I wouldn't oppose taxes. You don't need to tax through force necessarily, you can do it voluntarily if everyone agrees, and anarchism requires everyone's approval, or else it would be a tyranny of the majority.

Again, a socialist economy is compatible with anarchism. Most leftists think a State is needed, so the State enforces taxation. Anarchists believe in no State: if the people want taxation, they'll have taxation. If they want no currency, they'll have no currency. 'If the people want' means 'if everyone wants'. Everyone is 'the people'.

If you think socialism is statism, you're totally wrong, as even communists' goal is a stateless society, and anarchists are socialists and have always been. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Do you speak english? I think you understood nothing from what I've said.

Having a State isn't anarchistic, but economically, Rojava is compatible with anarchism. Socially, Rojava is Statist, so it is socialist-communist, not anarchist. If you know about communism, a State is required to ensure the transition from capitalism to communism/socialism. Once the communist revolution is over, the State disappears and communism is achieved: which is a stateless society, as well as anarchism. If Rojava does the same, it will be an anarchist example, that's why we support it.

Anarchism is a socialist ideology, especially in the economical sense. Capitalist anarchism isn't anarchism, because anarchism isn't only "anti-statism", but "anti-statism" is just a characteristic. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You didn't even read the whole post and you're already asking something I've answered. Next time don't be lazy and read everything.

Statism is the problem, not taxing or having free healthcare of land publicly owned, anarchism is a socialist ideology, so that's compatible, and it's usually enforced by the COMMUNITY, meaning EVERYONE, not the State. No anarchist example is even a 75% anarchistic, but still they represented our ideology and fought to achieve it. That's what counts. Rojava is an example of socialism, be it anarchist or not, they represent us. If Rojava starts establishing socialist policies without ending up in a tyranny like the USSR, they'll in the end not need a State and will achieve an anarchy, and communism. That's why we consider them an example of both anarchism and socialism in general, because they advocate for this, and they're starting to make it real. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The CNT-FAI wasn't fully anarchist, in its early times women 'weren't allowed' into the militias because of being women, and that changed thanks to a feminist movement. The militias weren't anarchist at all, there were hierarchies and worked like any other military, but this hierarchy was totally voluntary (as many people think an anarchist militia is when there's no hierarchy or authority, but that would just create a disfunctional army-militia). Durruti was considered a leader, though not exactly a conventional leader, many anarchists from that times would say he was indeed a leader. That's just three examples, there may be more.

The Free Territory of Ukraine didn't achieve much. Makhnovists did a certainly successful revolution that allowed them to try a real communist society, through anarchism, but they couldn't do much. Also, Makhno, as well as Durruti, a leader.

What constitutes, in this case, what is representative of anarchism and what isn't, is only the way their society worked, but also what they achieved. If Ukraine wasn't really an anarchist society, as it didn't achieve much, it wanted to achieve it, and fought for it, and that's enough to consider it anarchist, even if it didn't even achieve a thing.

A central authority mandating

Alright, that doesn't look anarchistic and the previous examples didn't have central authorities, at all. But...

free healthcare, declaring all land to be publicly owned

Is this really not anarchistic? Most anarchists advocate for this. If you mean that the problem is that it is enforced by a central authority, then you should've probably said "a central authority mandating policies".

Edit: when I say Durruti and Makhno were considered leaders, I mean revolutionary leaders </TEXT>

It's not like morality, which of course is something made up by us. It is obvious that outside of our minds there's no such thing as morality, but "male" and "female" exist outside of our minds.

The criteria for what constitutes a male or female person is completely arbitrary.

I'd say that, basically, having a penis is a great way of knowing you're a man. I mean, there's biological characteristics that can differentiate a man from a woman. </TEXT>

The best way to achieve ideologies like anarchism or communism is through revolution, because these two ideologies haven't got a neutral or good image, in general. Most people think "anarchism is chaos" and "communism is tyranny and stealing money from the rich". Anarchism and communism hasn't ever been 'achieved' without violence, because the only way to fight violence, is violence.

If the government won't do a thing, people need to protest to demand it. If protests still don't help, then the last and only alternative left is to attack the system, and this can be an insurrection, a revolution, terrorism... If you reject these because of 'noise', sorry to tell you, but that's pathetic. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For some reason, I've always been a good person. I never wanted to start or participate in a conflict, I always gave what others wanted, I always listened to them and made them have a good and funny time... I was an innocent and average kid. Still, being a good person made me no good. They always say, "be good, it'll make you good". It never did any good to me. 

I started high school, I started developing an interest for politics and started learning about it. I discovered an ideology I felt identified with and I found the most innocent and tolerant one, and do you know how people reacted to it? My classmates were criticising me for my ideals, because I didn't share their ridiculous patriotic ideal. Later, we had to do a writing, and I talked about my political stance. My teacher communicated my ideology to my parents, and my father said that it was a silly thing and that I shouldn't waste my time with politics and specially with my ideals.

My school marks decreased, I was unmotivated. Stupid classmates who irritated me, a poor family relationship, being sick of my teachers and the things they were teaching made me fail lots of times. I tried hard still to study and get better marks, but my teachers and family kept saying I didn't put enough effort and were constantly attacking me. When I finally started getting good marks, they kept saying I didn't put enough effort. Fuck you all.

Because of this shit I had to visit a psychologist for a day during school because my teachers thought I was being bullied. I decided to lie and make me look like an average teenager so that I wouldn't have to go back. I had a good relationship with almost everyone, but I never felt included in a group. Even now that I'm part of a group of friends, I'm invisible to everyone and I fucking hate it. I need attention and no one's there to give me the attention I need and deserve.

Why bother then being a nice person and having faith in humans, when all you see is toxicity in everyone? I don't trust anyone, I'm starting to have a worse relationship with people in general, my emotions are really muted and I enjoy making other people to suffer. And I haven't decided this, society made me the monster I am. And I do identify as a monster, because, why would I like being identified as something I really hate? People don't deserve my trust, help and sympathy. They could die and I would be even happier. They're always criticising me and behaving as if they were much more than me, who the fuck do they think they are? They're only crap. </TEXT>
