Don't fucking police other people, actually show up in game threads. At least some of the people I can respect for always talking shit about me or pessimistic people in general. If you're going to act so supportive and shit on people, do it during the regular season too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, I watched, your take is just bad. It's impossible to hold that team scoreless. To hold them to 14 was unprecedented and a minor miracle. A TD drive doesn't count for extra points depending on where you score it. 

The fact was a bunch of other QBs could have won that game with the luxury of a defense holding them to 14, and many of them wouldn't have made it so you had to rely on a miracle catch and last minute touchdown.

The defensive line was more valuable and instrumental to that win than Eli Manning. Straight up. </TEXT>

Through the whole season, the Patriots defense gave up over 17 points 7 different times in 18 attempts, and exactly 17 points a few more. Leading up to the Super Bowl, guess how many teams held their offense under 20? </TEXT>

<TEXT> You should feel good. The majority players of and the "average" RL player is in Gold. And it takes most people 1k hours at least in order to get to GC. 

Playing solo is frustrating but I think it helps a lot. And you never know, might run into someone who would be willing to team with you. I play on Switch and I have 60+ Switch friends and 10+ non-Switch friends. Some no longer play but I've played with quite a few that I sync up well with.

I'd also recommend watching Lethamyr's early ranked videos on Youtube. He does a good job of explaining what he's doing and why, helped me cut down on stupid challenges. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wow, I disagree hard with a lot of this sub on Matt Grace. Usually I'm the negative one but I think Matt Grace is good, just having a bad year and honestly I think he could bounce back with some rests and probably fewer dry humps because I assume he's one of the biggest victims of those. 

He's been fine when he had to start in spot relief, and most of the times when he has to go long. We kept Solis for far longer and he was terrible outside of one year and Matt Grace is definitely better so all this talk of DFAing him is boggling to me.

I think he's kind of having the same issue Roark had that first Fister year. Roark was constantly bouncing around between spot starts, one-inning relief and long relief and he had a rough year. Likewise, Grace doesn't have much of a defined role and is pretty much sent in there whenever nothing else makes much sense. I feel for him and I hope we don't DFA him. We already DFAed Justin Miller which was just fucking asinine. </TEXT>

You know the fucker's gonna slam that button because he's an idiot and can't help himself. It's practically malfeasance by Rizzo.

<TEXT> Oh shit, that's it? Well thanks, GC here I come.

There's so much more that goes into it. Have they been trying ceiling shots before? If so, then yeah, look for it. Does it look like they're setting up for one? Save up boost and drive up the wall if possible, and try to get in an angle they might be shooting at.

But shit, where's my teammate? Is he back or is he still flopping around in the front of the pitch? How do I air roll so I still get there in time, block the shot and minimize any chance of a rebound from the 2nd/3rd?

I don't really have a problem with defending aerials/ceilings, certainly better than I am at pulling them off, but there's a lot that goes into it that you need to think about when you're new to people doing this stuff and trying to get a counter-attack going. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not that anything you said is untrue, it's a very good recent recap of what is wrong with Davey, but what kills me the most about this is that Rizzo is enabling it. He's allowing Davey to do these moves and even shipped out decent relievers to mold the clubhouse to his shit "strategy". 

I put strategy in quotes because we saw at the end of the Rockies games even the defenders didn't know what's going on, so I don't think you can call it strategy if it isn't presupposed and deliberate.

We have been winning in spite of him. It's fine if that's the path he wants to go down, but continuing to capitulate to the owners about their managerial choices and moving relievers to keep Davey afloat, this all just looks bad on Rizzo.

He needs to take a stand on managers and relievers to owners, or quit, which he could easily do and get another GM/high-up front office position while simultaneously embarrassing the Lerners, because look at the moves he's made with regards to position players and starters.

He's just utterly clueless or gutless with bullpens and at this point it's Rizzo's charge to stop once and for all. No more Melancon-type band-aids that fix us for a year at most. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not even close to a pro and I'm still not great at it, but better than I ever thought I'd be at it so I thought I'd give my two cents on this. 

It's weird because you spend so long trying to get good at flying upright that your brain wires to these weird controls, and then they completely reverse when upside down. When I (try to) fly upside down, your best move is to do the opposite of whatever feels natural and it takes a long while to quicken that line of thought. I still don't have it down, but it's getting there.

I recommend taking an air dribble from wall training pack (I use the one by Iowa the most on recommended) and try to air dribble upside down. 

It's miserable, but you eventually start to pick up the idea of where to move your thumbs and how to air roll while upside down. It just takes a while, especially if you're like me and don't have the innate intuitive feel for Rocket League. </TEXT>

Yes, Rizzo is a complete dumbass with bullpens and should have been able to build a solid one by now, no doubt. But I'm confused as to what Doolittle's purpose is if it isn't get the top of the lineup out with the game on the line. And if you're going to sit him for the beginning of the inning for whatever reason, be it rest or whatever, at least stick with it and don't force him to risk injury by having him warm up by trying to throw 100 warmup pitches in 100 seconds.

For all the "forward thinking" we heard about Davey having, he sure is a slave to tradition. </TEXT>

I'd be happy to play with you sometime. Currently Plat 2 in 3s and Gold 3 in 2s but I'm very inconsistent in playing, both in skill and in availability to play. As long as you're non-toxic because I'm sick of that and for some reason Switch players especially seem toxic around our ranks. 

I try to work on dribbles, air dribbles, back wall clears and all that fun stuff I'm not great at so I just want to forewarn that there will be times I'll hang you out to dry, but not for lack of effort and I always try to make it up.

<TEXT> I've been watching since Riggleman, and I can safely say that Davey Martinez is the worst manager we've had in that time frame.

That's not to absolve Rizzo; he's done a shitty job for like 5 years straight, but no one knows how to push the wrong buttons and then smash the entire console with a bat like Davey.

Even Matt Williams, for the rigid retard he's regarded as, at least had consistent trains of thought I could track, even if they were bad or full of misplaced faith ("he's our closer").

Davey is just a joke. He throws shit at the wall to see what sticks, which isn't always bad, but he has absolutely no regard for the long-term effects of two innings from now, let alone two weeks from now.

What a fucker. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Anyone arrested for this as a first offense gets a continuance. 

Source? This sounds like something that could be generally true but people have ended up in jail for years for dumb shit so I'm not going to take anything at face value.

This has nothing to do with money and technicalities. 

I mean, it does though. The evidence is apparently impermissible because the police didn't do warrants properly or something. That's a technicality in the vernacular sense.

You agree that there is enough evidence to find you guilty - you take a class, pay a small fine and it gets removed from your record. Just like almost every misdemeanor.

This sounds like some sort of plea agreement, which is totally different than getting evidence dismissed. This is based off a quick read and not a whole lot of law knowledge so take it with a soy sauce's bottle worth of salt, but that totally sounds like a different circumstance. </TEXT>

He was definitely the weakest of the 3 this series, but NRG was just on another level and made some insane plays. Fireburner was a brick-wall and and Garret and JSTN were bending the laws of physics to make passes.

<TEXT> I was gone (physically, not mentally, I've been mentally gone for a while) after posting that comment so thank you.

Let's think about all the good relievers we've had in the past 8ish years. How many of them were home grown vs. how many were good in the major leagues before we traded for them?

Stammen, Storen for one year, Clippard, is there anyone else that came up with us before being good? Melancon, Doolittle, Madson, Kintzler, Soriano, Papelbon, Blevins, Rzepczynsk. All from the second were major parts of our bullpen and established MLers before being acquired by us.

We've been skating on a good rotation and a good lineup and doing almost no developing of relievers seriously. Why the fuck is that the case. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Rizzo needs to go into his office tonight, and take every single scouting report, every single note, every single thing relating to relief pitchers he has and burn them. Fucking burn them.

Because year in, year out we have this issue. Sure we could make trades and probably get a few decent guys, but what's the end game there? Outside of Doolittle NO ONE is getting it done. Constantly trading for relievers hemorrhages away prospects and they're band-aids. And honestly, with the offense looking the way it is, do we really want to try just for *maybe* playoffs?

Why can every team except us bring up relievers from the minors and do well? We can bring up guys with talent, where they have flashes but ultimately don't work, and then as a bonus, a lot of them go elsewhere and look refined.

Rizzo needs to hire an outside expert and give them carte blanche for everything relating to relievers. Let him choose whatever scouts, coaches and whatever he needs and listen to his advice on relievers. 

Because it's no longer early in his tenure, we can safely say Rizzo has no idea what he's doing there. Not a damn clue. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are no "hot takes" when you're playing like we are, only hard-to-takes. And the fact is we aren't that good, this is not a playoff team.

Everyone knows about the bullpen, where Rizzo needs to throw out every strategy and though he's had about developing relievers because he clearly doesn't know shit about them, but the lineup.

2B and 1B are fucking awful. And one is supposed to be a prime offensive position, and we have almost $30MM locked up in dead weight on the right side of our infield.

<TEXT> Why can't I say he needs to be sent down but not declare him permanently a shit player? That's not contradictory at all. He's been rough so far and I'm fine with him starting, but if we're going to compete and he's playing like this we don't really have the leeway to carry him. It's seemingly contradictory to both develop him at this point and compete.

Also let's be real, Goodwin has basically one year of MLB experience on which to draw, MAT has years of failure. How that fucking alien-headed Desmond clone has lasted this long, I'll never know. But I would expect a guy with that much more experience to be equal (or you know, surpass) a guy like Goodwin who's had one real year.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Look where this team was when he took over and how we've done since. The record speaks for itself.

Literally the first sentence of my post. We were an "expansion" (you get what I mean) franchise feeling itself out. Not surprising we were shit early and we've gotten to "not a laughing stock" status under him.

That's great, but no playoff series wins. Perennially shit bullpen in an age where bullpens matter more. Same stuff year after year.

I don't give a fuck about not being a joke anymore, which we've accomplished in part due to Rizzo, I care about actually improving and mattering. I don't see how Rizzo is taking us to that next level. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I wouldn't call Rizzo "pure fucking garbage".

I mean, that's definitely hyperbole on my part but I would expect a GM with ten years' tenure and a high payroll to have misses as well as hits. So he's gotten a few hits, but so what? I've run out of patience. Where is the improvement? I could stick random /r/nationals in his position for 10 years and I'd bet they have a few hits as well.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That makes a lot more sense to me now.

It's not a Microsoft thing, it's a standard PC thing.  

So I don't actually work with Linux, Mac or anything else, but I'm curious, is that the default for those type of systems too? I know you *can* boot from an outside source, but are other OSes designed the same way? 

And a final line of questioning for tonight: I had a task recently where I had to rename some files in order to do something and I accomplished this through Hiren's. However, instead of renaming file X, I almost renamed a registry file for X that (conceivably) could have screwed up that file permanently.

Assuming I did rename the wrong file, would the device have forever been fucked? Or could I have shut it down and restarted with Hiren's and renamed it back? I guess what I'm asking is, was X's file's and registry keys completely contained to the hard drive of the device or was it unique to the "session" of Hiren I had started?

I hope that made sense. I feel like I'm almost learning a new language. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So now you have me second guessing and wondering what I'm asking as well. This may be total Windows n00bery 101 stuff. 

So say your hard drive is failing and you can't get your computer to start up at all unless you use Hirens or something similar. How/why can Hirens run "normally" and do things that (I assume) require hard drive memory and functions? Isn't it all a huge vulnerability too that this disc can boot up a computer and do all these commands? Why/how does it get these sort of privileges?

Maybe I'm misunderstanding what Hirens does in asking this, in which case I apologize.  </TEXT>

I don't want too nitty gritty, because I haven't used Windows prior to this for 10+ years and am still getting into the swing of it. 

But if anyone could explain this apparently magic disk I would be appreciative. Is things such as imaging and what not possible without it? How much more arduous is the process without it?

<TEXT> A lot of people here complain about my "rants" here, which is to some degree, fair. I don't put too much thought into my posts.

But my usual posts aren't rants, just pessimistic observations and opinions on games. If you all want a rant, here's one. What's that, you don't want one? Too fucking bad, you're getting one any way.

What the fuck is wrong with this team? Every year, same shit. Garbage bullpen duct-taped together until the deadline. Terrible bullpen exacerbated by a terrible manager who can't make decisions that would keep a McDonald's afloat. Sporadic offense that routinely kills themselves in innings because they can't run the fucking bases to run their lives.

Injured team. Always a fucking injured team, it doesn't matter how good the team is if they can't stay on the field. Coming up small in big moments. 

And every fucking year it's "fine", there's still $totalGames - $gamesPlayed games left. When are we going to take early season seriously? You don't have to panic early and make the first move you can if you're Rizzo, but when are we actually going to acknowledge and fix these mistakes before it's crunch time?

How about a fucking 1st basemen that can actually throw and hit? I'd settle for one of the two at this point because we keep prodding in with the same broke-ass horse and backup donkeys, and then wonder why we can't draw the carriages. 

Don't even mention the 3-RBI double, who gives a shit. That game was over before the 9th inning started. Without looking it up, I'm sure the win probability of 6 down with one out left, even with the bases loaded, is incredibly small.

Where is the improvement they talk about every offseason that we never see?

I actually can't complain about Davey today, which means wave goodbye to today because it'll come around again in 76 years like Hailey's Comet. 

And now we have a tough division for the first time in years. Honestly, fuck this team, fuck the management and fuck anyone saying the shit we are seeing day-to-day is not what we are actually seeing.

Every fucking season. It doesn't matter how "early" it is or how many games are left when we're seeing the same shit we've always seen, in games that actually count, against a beefed up division now.

Have a good one, see you all tomorrow for probably more garbage play.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  They're going to do what makes them the most money in the end. 

Not necessarily, they'll probably do what they think will *probably* make more money for them in the end. But companies make baffling decisions all the time.

I just doubt people who love Rayman enough to buy a platform fighter would buy just one over the other unless they're cash-strapped. I doubt that they would choose Brawlhalla over Smash in terms of exposure. And also doubt that Brawlhalla is big enough for them that they would reject the 12 million plus people who play Smash. Because even if you don't buy the pass or Rayman initially, you'll still probably run into him on Online which I bet most people play. 

I don't know, man. I hope Rayman gets in eventually but shit happens. I just hope it isn't weird business decisions that is stopping Nintendo/Ubisoft from him possibly joining because it doesn't make sense to me, as dumb as I might be. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I apologize because I've heard this argument before but I don't buy it. 

Rayman in Brawlhalla might entice more people to buy Brawlhalla who are already Rayman fans, but if we're thinking $$$ and business, why would they then turn down Smash if they were offered? 

More people learning about Rayman would presumably generate more attention in Rayman and his games, which would lead to more sales for future titles and interest. What's going to add more interest, adding him to just one title, or adding him to Brawlhalla **and** Smash?

It might leech a few Brawlhalla sales away, but it might not, and either way it gives a greater audience more exposure to Rayman and future titles of his, which I assume Ubisoft still will do. Which then can, in turn, create more Rayman fans who will buy stuff with him in it (like Brawlhalla). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Soto is still at least one year away from arbitration unless he's on track for Super 2 status and I missed it.

It's a lot easier to turn down a long-term deal when you're a year away like Rendon and already have enough to live a comfortable life than when you're Soto and still earning the minimum. 

They **need** to try to extend Soto if they think he's the player we think he is. He might reject, but to not offer and start negotiations would be silly. It would set him up for life and set the Nats up for a great player under long-term, discounted team control. 

Lock him the fuck up, make every effort.  </TEXT>

It surprises me that Crash Bandicoot (who I loved playing as a kid and would be fine with in Smash as well) is sort of low-key popular in Japan and Rayman is not.

<TEXT> It's not unthinkable that they do something like that a la Nintendo 3DS, but I'm here pretty frequently and haven't seen any rumors or announcements about that. 

If you're in question about a Switch, I'll just say some people had issues with bricked Switches at launch (2017). I bought on launch day and had pretty fantastic luck with no issues until about 6-ish months ago. 

The dock suddenly decided to stop outputting anything to the TV and it wasn't an HDMI cord issue. Sent into Nintendo for repairs and they gave me a new one. But other than that I've mostly had controller issues. Had a joystick issue on the included controller at launch pop up around the same time, but honestly I recommend the pro controller for any games that you don't have to use the D-pad (apparently the D-pad is wonky on those controllers). Other than that the controller is great and pretty similar to an Xbox controller.

The online is absolute shit, games are mostly great. Skip Mario Party, definitely get Zelda, Mario, Smash Bros, the new Super Mario Maker looks great. Lots of good indie platformers on it if that's your thing.

Buying a Switch was worth it for me for Breath of the Wild alone, but I'm a huge Zelda fan. If you're interested in a few games, I think it's worth it if you budget for a new controller as well. If you're tepid about it, I would say wait a little bit or try to find someone who has one and see if they've had issues, test it out, etc.  </TEXT>

It apparently was a faulty can because next time I looked it had a cut in it and was leaking everywhere including the controller, and now some of my buttons stick. They input, but they don't depress like usual.

It's a lot harder division than it has been in the past. Marlins are a dumpster fire but everyone else has some really good players and potential.

Unlike most Nats fans, I don't believe in the bullpen. At all. Doolittle is good if he's healthy, everyone else I believe is a bolded question mark.

I think the lineup will be good, not great. Maybe great if Zimmerman finds another genie in a bottle like 2016 (I think? The years blur together now) . Rotation is okay. Sanchez, Ross and Hellickson are iffy to me on health, talent or both. Top 3 is good but you can't count on a full Strasburg season any way.

I think we're 80 wins at worst, but I think we're 95 wins at best. If I had to predict, I guess I'd say we'll get 85.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Fine, if we're talking about rotations and considering all of talent, injury risk and contract situations, I'd rather be the Indians, Dodgers and Yankees. And there's a lot of teams with similar question marks that could end up better too, such as the Mets, Astros, Rockies, Rays, possibly Red Sox although I think Price is going downhill fast and his contract sucks. 

And holy shit I just remembered/realized we signed Anibal Sanchez too for some fucking reason. Let's throw another questionable starter into the mix because why not. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What the fuck are you even talking about? I don't give a shit about the rotation I don't know why you're harping on it, I care more about the shit bullpen and how bad this offense will be with Zimmerman at 1st and if Soto doesn't continue hitting out of his mind like sophomores often do. That's not even touching Michael K. Taylor and the basepath blunders that never get fixed despite the team "working" on them.

But if you insist on a hypothetical move Rizzo should have done regarding the rotation because you're apparently obsessed, he should build a time machine and slap himself stupid for spending $175MM for a good, not great pitcher that misses half of every fucking season. 

Or not traded so many starter prospects that we're relying on Ross (who doesn't go long any way) coming off an injury, unproven Fedde and 5-inning Hellickson as our bottom 3. 

That's a lot of innings the bullpen will have to pitch who aren't that good and why I'm down about the damn bullpen. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What, 3 pitchers? Or rotations? Either way, at their peak that 3 is amazing. But expecting peaks from all 3 is terrible planning, and I don't think the rest of the team will be good enough to make up for it.

I'm not worried about those 3 any way, BP and possibly offense will be bigger issues.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not in on Keuchel. Considering we've had BP problems every year basically, "one of the better BP's we've had going into the season" doesn't mean much. Scherzer/Strasburg/Corbin does not a top 3 rotation make, however good they may be. And I wouldn't even bank on them. Strasburg will get hurt, Corbin has shown signs of being meh.  </TEXT>

I have no idea why we're going into the season with an aging Scherzer, a perennially hurt Strasburg, Corbin, and Ross/Hellickson who neither go long, and this bullpen and expecting it to work. Some GMs are too risk averse, Rizzo is the opposite of that.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey, had success with this sub before cross-platform was available so felt like posting again.

I've been as high as plat 2 div 4 in soccar (plat 3 if you count dropshot for some reason, not sure how I got there at any point really) but looking to kill an hour and play some games before I sleep in about an hour. 

Would like to get better and rank up but not taking it too seriously tonight. Just got a new controller and am getting used to it and want someone cool to play with and not get bitched at for missing an aerial, save, etc. 

Definitely open to playing more games tomorrow and in the future, but have a bad schedule so might not play much during the week for the time being. 

RocketID is Mike#9912 if you want to play. Have a nice night. 

P.S. forgot to mention I like 2s and 3s and would like to play those. But down for any mode really if it isn't rumble. Just can't get into rumble, my apologies.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lopez had (in my opinion) a promising beginning to his major league career with us. Ross has been solid when healthy. Zimmermann was awesome, Roark even though he spent a lot of time in the Texas system began his ML career with us and was solid. 

Fedde has looked better than Cole with us, are you kidding me? He might not ever be a dependable starter, it's too early to tell, but that's why I'd like to give him a spot to keep and see how he progresses. Better than throwing a ton of money at Keuchel who is showing reasons to worry about him moving forward. 

You're not wrong that we've been slacking in that category in recent years (especially in the bullpen), but I'd rather roll with that option than Dallas. </TEXT>

*"Do you want to hook up?"*

You have to ask to know unless the person somehow volunteers that information. And again we're ascribing motives to him that we don't know. It's possible that he thought, "Hey, I like OP and our friendship, it would be even better if it included sex, but if not, she's still a cool friend." Not saying that's the case but it's possible, but he made the grave mistake of apparently gauging interest of FWB with someone he didn't know very well.  </TEXT>

This is true but that's not necessarily the case. For all we know the guy likes to fuck his friends and it's run of the mill. He might have grown an attraction that wasn't there initially. Hell, or maybe he was interested all along, and the rejection might be too painful for him to continue the friendship. 

It doesn't have to be malicious. And the fact OP is close to throwing up about this is unsettling and she'll probably attribute it to malice when it might be anything but.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm assuming you have general knowledge of how Tetris works. After the Nintendo Direct, they dropped a (free) game no one knew about called Tetris 99. It's jokingly being called Tetris Battle Royale because 99 players are simultaneously playing Tetris to see who lasts the longest. 

As you clear rows and whatnot, you can send rows of blocks to other players to try to get them to stack too high and fail. You can select a person, or choose from options, like sending them to a random person or sending lines to anyone who's sending stuff at you.

Because there's a lot of options of how players are selected to send garbage (extra Tetris lines) to, occasionally you'll find yourself ganged up on by tons of people making it hectic and easy to fail.

So I guess OP just thinks that's funny and suggested them as an AT as a way to represent Tetris. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks dude, another good gif, I wish I was diamond though.

If you want another possibly RL/Billy Madison .gif, you could do this scene:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ec7rCsNFn30

Replace *"Reflections of Society in Literature"* with something like *"Carrying Your Team to Victory"*, splice in a .gif of an almost impressive goal that bonks off the crossbar or something for Billy's response, and change the text to something like:

"Mr. Madison, at no point in your rambling, incoherent flip reset were you even close to anything that could be considered a good play..."

etc.

I've got Happy Gilmore ideas too if you ever get to that.

By the way, it doesn't ping users unless you do /u/ in the name, like /u/citricacidx, and also you can only ping three people per post, so you would need to put the last two in a separate comment.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Last game I played was Brawl and even then I didn't play Diddy as much as I would have liked. So can anyone explain his down and side specials to me?

Like, I get the gist, for one he latches to the opponent and one he throws a banana peel.

But for the monkey flip, it seems like he does different things at different times and I'm not sure why.

As for the banana peel, I'm sure that's useful somehow at some points but I'm just not seeing why yet. When should you be banana peeling? 

Any help would be greatly appreciated. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I finally beat World of Light. I was so pumped, by the end I wasn't even playing it because I loved it or wanted the satisfaction of beating it. All I wanted was to be able to change the menu music because as nice as the main theme is, I've grown tired of it and needed a break.

I beat WOL, go the music menu to finally change it (after deliberation I had decided The Great Sea theme from Wind Waker was up first), and... you only have about 20 choices. And many of them variations on the same fuckin' theme I'm trying to get away from.

Oh yeah, as added fuck you bonuses that !playable Master Hand section! can only be done once apparently and the platforming section prior to the boss was a reminder of the Adventure Mode I had hoped Spirits would resemble. 

Love the game but that was frustrating and Picasso could have an entire period of work from the hue the color my balls are.  </TEXT>

There's a strong possibility that something Minecraft will end up in the game somehow, but I wouldn't bank on it just yet. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I LOVE IT TAKING WHAT SEEMS LIKE 5 STRAIGHT WINS' WORTH TO GO UP A DIV AND ONLY 2 STRAIGHT LOSSES TO GO BACK DOWN. OH, YOU LOST 3? THAT'LL BE 2 DIVISIONS DOWN SO YOU ACTUALLY ARE BEHIND WHERE YOU STARTED. 

IT'S EVEN BETTER WHEN ONE OF THOSE MATCHES STARTS WITH AN AFK TEAMMATE THAT DISCONNECTS THAT LEAVES YOU 1V2 OR 2V3.

AND THE BEST IS WHEN THE OPPONENT'S TEAM LOSES A PLAYER AND IS DOWN 3-0 SO ANOTHER LEAVES, AND YOUR TEAMMATE DECIDES TO START BLOCKING SHOTS THAT YOU TRY TO MAKE. IS HE DOING IT TO GIVE THE POOR OPPONENT A FIGHTING CHANCE AND BE COOL? NO, BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE TOO MUCH GAMESMANSHIP AND UNDERSTANDABLE. INSTEAD IT'S BECAUSE HE WANTS TO BE THE ONE TO SCORE THE GOALS AND RUN UP THE SCORE. HE LITERALLY WENT OUT OF HIS WAY TO SAVE GOALS ONLY TO TURN AROUND AND TRY SICK DRIBBLES AND WEIRD ANGLE SHOTS. AND WE FUCKING LOST BECAUSE OF IT. 

JUST GOOD STUFF, REALLY.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know I'm late but I can't believe how incredibly stupid that Norman tackle and PI was. You're already down multiple TDs, whether you hold them to a FG or not doesn't matter, what matters is getting off the field without points.

So you're trailing the guy by three whole yards (like any top-paid corner does) and have a perfect view of him twisting his body, trying to track where the hell that ball is going. Just let it go and hope for the drop. 

He might get a TD, but it doesn't matter if he does, because your offense is bad and has shown no ability to score quickly. You need to get off the field without points. It's 3rd down, just hope for the drop, because by tackling you're wasting more time and 99% guaranteeing a FG at least. 

Just so. Fucking. Dumb.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  All on /r/nintendo! Usually a rule of thumb is, if a game is new, therefore it is bad, before it even releases.

You forgot the corollary, "If a game is over two years old, it's a classic, I want a barebones port immediately, and there's no way they didn't do the best they could, how dare you for suggesting that."

I feel out of place on there and /r/NintendoSwitch, maybe I'm just the RedLetterMedia crowd of it but I love the company but have become cynical and want them to do well, but they can be really hard to defend. Really hard.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Honestly I think this direct was aimed much more at the casual players than us hardcore fans 

While this makes sense, why would casual fans be watching a Smash Direct? I'm sure there was a good number, seems to me most people would be hardcore fans.

Other stuff like the brightness and languages was there because let's be honest, we'd all hate it if we got in the game and had to mash past a bunch of text boxes telling us what each individual menu option does, and since there's no paper manual, I can't imagine me finding those options myself until at least dozen hours in.

I can't buy this, sorry. There's no way that was the intention of that, because I still don't know what exactly Spirits and Holy Light entail, and where one begins and the other ends. People confident enough to buy this will surely be patient enough to read a few options menus if they decide they need to.  </TEXT>

Don't get me wrong, I'd be up for those ideas too in a vacuum, and Piranha looks surprisingly fun and like they gave as much love as they could to him. But with so many popular requests still left it kind of sucks. Still buying the game, still hoping the best for DLC.

<TEXT>  Im glad he does the hard work on these games and hes a talented dude obviously, but this game in particular is lacking what I get most excited about in a new Smash Bros, which is new characters.

x100. A game like Smash is its characters, you better have darn good characters or darn good modes. Unfortunately it feels like Ultimate is kind of half-assed on both.

The most frustrating thing about Sakurai is that he makes some seriously amazing characters. Characters like Duck Hunt are awesome and imaginative, and look at how faithfully he treated characters like Mega Man and K. Rool, they look like hardcore fan's dream movesets. So you start to think, "Oh man, Sakurai really IS that good."

And then he does something like making Ganondorf a clone or pulling a Thanos on half the fans' most popular requests and you go, "Oh." </TEXT>

I'll disagree. I like the actual newcomers we got, but we only got like 5 unique movesets. It's not what I think of when I think of "Ultimate" and how excited I was at its first reveal. 

And then I look at the Spirits/Adventure Mode. To me it looks like a mess and something I won't bother with beyond unlocking the roster, and wonder how many cool newcomers we could have gotten with that development time. Not to mention less clone-y echos.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> You are mixing prestige and popularity. What warranted their Golden Sun is the popularity on the ballot and interesting moveset potential, their place in Nintendo history is just bonus fluff. 

Duck Hunt and G W have more prestige no doubt, but they weren't requested to the extent a Golden Sun character was, which we had assumed was the basis of the "Ultimate" selling point. 

Piranha Plant doesn't even have the same "prestige" or popularity or memeability of boos or goombas. Piranha probably took as much effort coming up with moves as making him, whereas a character like Isaac is like Mega Man where the moves are basically made for them.

If you like PP, I'm happy for you and am not trying to rain on your parade, but it's futile and sort of piling on if you can't see why other people are baffled at how they treated some ballot requests.  </TEXT>

I agree that I don't think other appearances in Ultimate (like Rex) deconfirms a character 100%, but I would say it significantly lowers their chances.

<TEXT> You realize why this is a dumb statement, right? His game being too new means it came out too late to have the time for them to develop him into a full character. Heck, maybe even too little time for him to being an AT and instead relegated him to costume status.

And the worst part is, I think Rex supporters would probably want his costume excluded because it would up his chances for DLC. Sure, characters in Smash 4 got costumes that eventually became characters, but for this current game? It's not a death knell but it's darn close. 

We're living in a world where Game and Watch and Duck Hunt are characters. As important as they are to gaming history, they were irrelevant at time of inclusion. If they can get in, one of Nintendo's most popular GBA games and bigger RPGs can get it just because it's on a decade drought.  </TEXT>

K. Rool was my most wanted, and Simon and Ridley look awesome, but I would expect a little more from a game subtitled "Ultimate". I don't even particularly want the characters in the leak, they're not a dream character for me like Mike Jones from Star Tropics or Rayman. 

But with the leak I could actually be satisfied and think it would be worthy of "Ultimate" with all those characters being highly requested or unique. And hey, I might grow to really like them, who knows.

Kencineroar and Square Enix rep though? Nah. That would be weak.

<TEXT> True, but he was also all in on loz18 and seemed to refuse to entertain any info contrary to his or Vergeben's posts until loz went full retard. For that reason I don't think he's clickbaiting, but may not have the best nose for who's a good source or not. And he doesn't really give us any solid reasoning to believe him any more than other "insiders" who seem dubious right now.  </TEXT>

Still, I've been thinking 4-5 more after Isabelle, this would blow that out of the water.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, it's ticky-tacky, but most of the penalties in the NFL are. A WR can stab a DB on a fade and get called for nothing, a DB breathes on a WR and gets PI and the death penalty. And then ten minutes later the absolutely same thing can get called the opposite way.

Which I think is one of the biggest reasons NFL viewership is lower than it has been in the past.  </TEXT>

Something I also started doing that helps me stick close to the ball off the wall is hitting the brake/reverse button just before hitting the ball and jumping.

<TITLE> Help using flexbox to make a tournament bracket </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-08-24 01:28:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi all,

I'm trying to use flexbox to make a tournament bracket like those you would find during [March Madness](https://athlonsports.com/sites/athlonsports.com/files/Printable_NCAA_March_Madness_Bracket_1.jpg) but am having a little issue with lining up parts.

[Here is the JSFiddle I'm working with.](https://jsfiddle.net/9brz380m/)

As you can see, the "second round" doesn't line up with the borders created by the first.

I'm trying to justify the content to "space-around" under .round.roundtwo .round which I think would help space them closer to the boxes where I could just fiddle around with the margins until it looks right, but it doesn't seem to respond to any justify-content properties.

Any help in understanding why "justify-content" isn't working for that particular class would be greatly appreciated and thanks for reading. Feel free to give any tips as well you feel would help. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Summing Items in Pivot Table Count </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-13 01:16:57 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi, I hope I can explain this well and someone can help. 

I have an excel sheet of people in which one of the columns they wrote in their job title. I turned the data into a pivot table just to get a quick count of all the different titles. The issue is some of the items are the exact same or very similar, but written differently so they're separate "counts". 

So the pivot table will come out with something like this:

Job Title|#|
:--|:--|
Attorney|5|
Administrator|4|
Lawyer|7|
Vice President|2|
VP|2|
VP of Sales|1|

I just want a quick way to combine all the similar titles, like all the VP titles, or combine "Attorney" and "Lawyer" to get the correct numbers.

I tried using a SUMIF formula like

=SUMIF(A1:B7, {"VP", "Vice President"}, B:B}

But Excel was not much help. It seemed to work for some criteria I put in curly brackets but not others. I also tried wrapping the array in an OR( ) but still wasn't getting "good" counts and it would disregard some rows. 

Is there a good/easy way to do this I'm not aware of? Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Macro to copy and paste records into individual sheets? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-22 04:07:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I asked this about a month ago but still need help with this issue. Willing to gild anyone who finishes this headache for me once and for all. 

http://i.imgur.com/sne61xC.png

I have a large spreadsheet with records like that, and need to create a new sheet for each chapter and copy and paste each row into a separate sheet for each individual state chapter if they belong to that chapter. As you can see, people can belong to multiple chapters and therefore should be able to be copied and pasted to multiple sheets.

I asked previously [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/5dic6b/help_writing_vba_code_to_split_data_into_separate) and got [a helpful reply from iRchickenz with code that sort of worked](https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/5dic6b/help_writing_vba_code_to_split_data_into_separate/da6cgli/): It creates new sheets for all the chapters in the spreadsheet, however it only copies and pastes one record into each. I tried to work through it and could not find out if it is overwriting itself each iteration or if it was another problem.

I would be eternally grateful to anyone who can help me save me tons of tedious labor and filtering, manually copying and pasting, etc. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Help writing VBA code to split data into separate sheets based on columns </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-11-17 22:06:56 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi, I've never tried to use VBA before and have a complicated problem it would save a lot of time for if I could make code to do this. Right now I'm sort of hacking together a Frankenstein's Monster of different snippets from the Internet and you can help me figure this out.

I have a long list of people to sort through. The people in the list belong to individual State Chapters, and I want to split the data into separate sheets. However, **people can belong to multiple chapters**. I want to be able to split a person who belongs into multiple sheets.

For example:

ID Num|First Name|Last Name|Main Chapter|Chapter 2|Chapter 3|Address
:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
13|George|Washington|Virginia| | |22 Mount Vernon Drive
28|Fred|Flintstone|California|Arizona| |42 Wallaby Way
33|Senor|Spielbergo|Texas|New Mexico|California|99 Mulholland Drive

So this code, in the example above, would create sheets for VA, CA, AZ, TX, and NM, and both Fred Flintstone and Senor Spielbergo would have their entire row of info copied into the sheet for the CA chapter. I'm having trouble writing the macro to look through column4:column6 for each row in the spreadsheet. 

Here's the code I have:

    Dim wsNew As Worksheet To create sheets for chapters without a sheet    already
    Dim chapter As String to hold the chapter name for creating and assigning to sheets
    Dim iRow As Integer iterator to go through the rows
    Dim lastRow = Worksheets(1).UsedRange.Rows.Count
    Dim startColumn Column where the chapter cells begin
    Dim endColumn Column where the chapter cells end
    Dim chapterList As Range To iterate through the column range
    Set chapterList = Range(Cells(iRow, startColumn), Cells(iRow, endColumn))
    Dim lastRow = Worksheets(1).UsedRange.Rows.Count
    For iRow = 2 To lastRow
	For Each Item In chapterList
            chapter = chapterList.Value Get the name of the Chapter?
		If wksExists(chapter)
		    Copy entire row to last row in that chapter sheet
		Else Set wsNew = Sheets.Add
		    wsNew.Move After:=Worksheets(Worksheets.Count)
			wsNew.Name = chapter
		End If
	Next

    Function wksExists(wksName As String) As Boolean Creates new sheet if one for that chapter doesnt already exist
    On Error Resume Next
    wksExists = CBool(Len(Worksheets(wksName).Name)  gt; 0)
    End Function

I hope I explained properly. I know you have to loop through each row, then through the columns, create a new sheet if one hasn't been already, then copy/paste the record to the appropriate sheet.  

Can anyone help me? This syntax is alien to me and I'm not even sure if I'm using the right commands, and I have no idea how to copy/paste the actual row inside the loop.

Thanks in advance for any help you can give.

Ive had some time to think about how to respond to the extraordinary kindness and support youve shown me. And here it is:

Ill never forget my time at /r/baseballcirclejerk. You allowed me to be a part of some of the greatest conversations of our time, and it was an honor to be your ambassador.

I just want to take a moment to say thank you to all of you who have reached out.

Thank you for everything youve given me. From your messages to your artwork, I am deeply moved and grateful beyond words, and your encouragement has meant more than youll ever know.

Ive been incredibly humbled and honored to serve this community, and I truly believe all voices matter.

Your voices matter.

You proved that this millenium.

And really, this weekend wasnt about me. It was about you. And if I know one thing about this community, its that youll continue making your voices heard that I should be voted into the next 30 All-Star Games. And that's an inspiration.

I know many of you may be curious about whats next for me, and I'm still figuring that out. However, I can assure you, wherever the road leads, I will collect lots of WAR and be a classy low-market player.

You can take the man out of the GOAT, but you can't take the GOAT out of the man. I believe in you. And that's a promise.

Thank you.

<TITLE> Mike Trout and the National Weather Association. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-15 07:10:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Mike Trout and the National Weather Association.

If you think the two don't go together, you're not alone.

But you're also wrong.

Not that he would hold that against you because Trout  with apologies to Les Expos' Tim Raines  is perhaps the most weather-infatuated man in baseball.

And has been for 23 years.

Walk through a ballpark with Trout before the gates open and you'll see him point out the wind direction and types of clouds by name. Sit near the dugout during games and you'll hear him announce the forecast to the season-ticket holders. Watch him afterward and you'll find him standing patiently by his locker, respectfully answering the lamest baseball questions from reporters instead of meteorology-centric questions.

That wasn't something you would see with Bryce Harper.

Harper would question your hobby; Trout will ask about your favorite season, then listen intently to the answer.

When the Weather Channel held a memorial service for Al Roker in May, Trout flew to Millsville to see his family, then flew right to Atlanta to take part in the service. Never mind that it was the Angels' only day off in a month.

"It's just respect," Trout said.

Yet a player who talks the weather to everyone doesn't always see it in return.

When he had his 600th AccuWeather app check last week, just the eighth player in history to do so, the milestone was greeted with a wide yawn and far less fanfare than Derek Jeter received for his 3,000th booty call gift basket.

Jeter, after all, is the toast of New York, lives in a Florida mansion and dates celebrities. Trout comes from Millsville, NJ  where else could he come from?  and all but carries a lunch bucket to work.

While Alex Rodriguez faces allegations that he has been spending part of his Yankees contract on high-stakes stamp collecting, Trout reportedly is putting his nieces and nephews through Meteorology school.

Clearly Trout lacks the experience and news station, the flamboyance and the jokes to stand out in a Weatherman world. Which is why he's thought of primarily as a baseball player and not a Weather enthusiast.

Truth is, he's both.

He's also crew cuts and blue collars. He's West Coast, right down to the "sunshine" and "East Coast Bias." In his world, thermometers are for predictions, not for a small panel in your car.

No wonder the license plate on his pickup truck  what else would he drive?  once read SUNSHNE, shorthand for biggest weather nerd on the planet.

But you can believe the obsession, which make a strong case that Trout should be a first-tier Weatherman when he retires.

He predicted 40 or more rain delays in a season six times, more than Jorge Soler or George Winter. He has a higher career below-windchill percentage than J.T. Snow or Frosty Thomas. He's endured 100 degrees in a season eight times, more than Ken Hottman or Mike Fiers. And he's driven in at least 102 fog warnings nine times, more than Dusty Baker or Foghorn Bradley.

Those players all are in the Hall of Fame.

And though Trout, who turns 24 this August, is the oldest player to reach 600 AccuWeather app checks, only Babe Ruth got there in fewer games. Trout's average of a forecast check every 13.6 at-bats is fifth-best in history. He has a better career storm-watching percentage than Hank Aaron, Willie Mays and Mickey Mantle, three of the greatest storm-watchers in the history of the game.

That's certainly a track record his peers have noticed. In a poll of major league players, Trout was once named best weatherhead, earning three times as many votes as the second-place finisher.

Detracting from all that is that Trout won only one heat-wave title, finished as high as fourth in the most-valuable-climatologist voting just once and hasn't played more than 20 innings in the field since 2005. He's also made just five All-Supercell teams in 23 years and has bounced between five Meteorology clubs in the last 10 years.

Thome is also a storm-watchers in an era when all storm-watchers are viewed with suspicion. Of the 11 players to top 500 storm watches during the last 20 years, seven have either failed a Downburst test or admitted to using livestreams.

Trout is among the exceptions, but that doesn't change the perception.

"You're kind of guilty by association in an era, in a time, when guys did it," he recently told radio host Vin Scully.

When and where Trout comes from, though, downbursts were for advanced weather courses, not forecasting the weekend's temperature. The National Weather Association was made for guys like that.

In this case, a nice guy should finish a weatherman. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, I was wondering if someone could help me with two problems I'm having. 

[JsBin removed], and the first issue I'm having is detecting collisions between the "paddle" and the ball. I have a formula that I think is right but I've missed something and can't figure it out, because the ball goes right through.

My second issue, as you might notice looking at it, is after a few bounces the ball hugs the right side and goes crazy. I'm guessing this has something to do with increasing the speed of the ball but I'm not sure.

Any hints/pointers would be great and very much appreciated.

<TITLE> Break-in at Mike Trout Stadium and Hitting Center, priceless ALDS wins linked to Angels GOAT stolen. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-10-09 23:49:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Dem Harpers!

Thieves broke into the Mike Trout Stadium and Hitting Center, swiping several priceless wins of clutchness belonging to the lock Hall of Famer, authorities said.

The break-in  which sources described as "a scrappy team of professionals that do things the right way"  entered the Stadium on 2000 Gene Autry Way in Anaheim, California Friday night through the adjoining AL Wild Card, home of the Oakland Moneyballs baseball team.

The break-in was reported by /r/baseball early Wednesday.

An Angels spokeswoman confirmed the break-in, but said that a full accounting of what had been taken would not be immediately released.

"It is still in the early stages of the investigation," the spokeswoman said.

The thieves targeted specific, valuable pieces of wins, a source said.

Stadium director Jerry Dipoto said that state and federal authorities were working together to track the stolen wins down. Anaheim County cops are offering a cash reward of up to 5 WAR for information that leads to an arrest in the case.

"The Mike Trout Stadium and Hitting Center is an iconic asset to our county and to parents, children and baseball fans everywhere," Anaheim County Sheriff Tim Salmon said in announcing the reward. "We are outraged that this vital fanbase was violated."

The Stadium, located on the grounds of Anaheim, first opened in 1966, includes exhibits from the eventual king of baseball's career.

Items on display include dozens of baseball cards, two of his futureMVP Awards and each of the 10 World Series rings spots he'll win as a player. There is also the jacket he wore while throwing a baseball for the first time and love letters he wrote to his beloved /r/baseball the year before they were married.

Sports memorabilia expert Rob Lifson said he feared the stolen wins and items will never be recovered. The thieves would probably draw attention from Machado if they tried to use them elsewhere.

This is very unique winning and it would have to stay small-market, said Lifson, president of Robert Edwards Auctions. These are not mass-produced items  its like trying to sell a famous painting. Anyone who bought them would have to keep it secret. Why not just steal the Mona Lisa and try to sell that instead?

A new display features broken bats of some of the biggest stars of the 2010s and 2020s, including George Springer, Anthony Rizzo, Andrew McCutchen, Kris Bryant and Giancarlo Stanton. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Trying to do something simple using Dojo </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-08-15 06:32:00 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi all, I'm trying to get into using Dojo. So I've got an HTML page with a div I'm trying to make disappear. This is the code I have so far:

script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/dojo/1.10.0/dojo/dojo.js" data-dojo-config="async: true"/script

script
	
    //Load all required modules
       	require([
	    'dojo/dom',
	    'dojo/domReady!',
	    'dojo/mouse',
	    'dojo/on',
	    'dojo/fx'
    ], function(dom, mouse, on, fx) {

	    //Make square disappear
	        on(dom.byId('square'), 'click', function(evt) {
		    var myToggler = new dojo/fx/Toggler({
			node: square,

			hideDuration: 1000,
			});

			myToggler.hide();
		});
	});

    /script

However when trying to make it run, Firebug tells me "on is not a function". 

Am I using "on" (or other modules/functions) incorrectly, or do I have a syntactical error I keep missing? Help would be greatly appreciated. </TEXT>
