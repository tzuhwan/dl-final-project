<TEXT> hi, i recently acquired a 2012 mini ipad (1st edition of them i guess? i'm not so sure) so it's my first apple product. (am from the uk)

 the charger it came with isn't doing so well (A1399 uk charger) are there any faster ones out there that work for the ipad mini, plug itself seems fine, just the wire attached is issue

 seen some reviews of some plugs on ebay but i want to make sure it's a genuine one AND the right one for the ipad. any help appreciated. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Without you it burns / a year and the storm continues / she has your heart and I have my cracking nightmares about everything muddled together at once /

Are you married? / are you well ? Have you forgotten me? Is it all under her spell?

Does youth really mean so much, a couple years younger, faded rust.

Think of you so often now, still hurts, I'm lonely and asleep in this dazed mess of clutz.

Yea you have better things now, still I miss you, American of my past </TEXT>

<TEXT> Our 1 year anniversary is this week actually and we do have a wonderful sex life in the bedroom. I cannot get enough of him lol.

Thing is we've mentioned shower sex a couple times now and I haven't been quite sure. I guess my own anxiety goes tenfold as I over think situations. But with a theme park trip and hotel this week, shower sex might be a possibility.

Not sure what I'm nervous of if anything, I love him very much and he looks after me I 25 f / he 34 m
But if anyone can be nice about this I'd appreciate it. </TEXT>

Turnout as the day falls into night /
It isn't always fine but you are here with me for the ride /

I appreciate the little things / how you are thoughtful for those concrete hidden insecurities / you give a pleasant time for respite in your sanctuary of quiet time /

Your love is a art of patience and pleasant experiences /
Your eyes radiates a sunshine of outer life /
Such a contrary from my sheltered life / 
You let me be myself and remain so casually my boyfriend /
Yet I get so giddy when you hold your hand in mine </TEXT>

<TEXT> missing you, still here being blue. /
what a waiting game it remains /
frustratingly trying to come up with an answer -
knowing you do not care /

knowing a new year has turned over once again /
and as cracked and faded i remain /
i know i'm not going to change /
and you are wherever you are /
in that California paradise /

all i think about is emptiness of a friend and now whatever you are feels more and more like a question mark /

timid solitude but the waves are crashing /
my fury burdens me but i am forever lashing /
soon to be 26 and yet heavily undermanned / 

thinking of a day and night without fear or pain /
thinking of a slumber where i might reawaken sustained /
thinking of a sunrise that sunsets into quiet bliss /
a holiday doesn't suffice / a empty stones throw doesn't do this justice /

i'm looking for a answer that's scuffed to the max /
i'm pleading for forgiveness without knowing how to get up those steps /
i'm fearful of work and of working to the future /
i'm fearful of everyone and everyone's self expedience /

i bite away at all the lack lustre promises inside my head /
i feel like a structure that has titled and bent into oblivion's descent /

i feel like a magnetic magnitude of anger and wit /
i feel like a cunning lioness with a pitfall of guilt /
i am forever a blooming flower in the nightly twilight essence /
i am full of thorns, jagged edges and remain never fully understood /

i hate people / animals are innocent and kind /
i hate personalities like my own that clash with the obstacles named human kind /
i hate the parasites that swarm this earth / knowing i'm probably one too but nodding into the deepest depths /
 
1st january and nothing still has changed yet /
i muster the strength of none at all

Losing the Elite tectonic armour in dangerous PvP will result in a fraction of the original draconic energy being dropped on death, based on how degraded it was, rounded down. For example, if the robe top had 52% of its charges remaining, 218 draconic energy would be dropped on death. </TEXT>

my personal favourite is melee, as i use my nox scythe alot so yeah. hope that helps somehow lol </TEXT>

Foggy dark / inward torrents /
Lonely whisper / distilled darkness /
Lost my friend in the blackness /
Time turns so much / it isn't always light /
Yet here I am / hating myself most nights /

Wishing you was here for me /
1 selfish thought too many /
Switched out from the muddy noise /
All remains is this cloudy haze

<TEXT> lost and found when i see him again / it's only in the weekday / in the time away from him / things begin to blur and bend into the grey dull sleep / hauntingly annoying nightmares watching my subconscious weep /

missing whatever left of youth that i had / unbeknownst to how this road is going to end / if i can't control my fate / how can i control my fluctuating closing gate of road closures in this non ending loop of time /

the only thing changing is everybody and my mind /
the people try to prey on you / myself is only hated by the blues
colour away my star-shine of ever searching peace time

it's wicked that the blues bite the dust beyonnd my feet and make me ill / how ill fated must i be to never see the light even beyond another year / why must i feel such hatred to the blood of another member of mine to call such a beast dad / oh how unjustified is this life?

i try my best or not at all / i flop and startle and fleet and fall /
i look to the skies and the stars for answer that does not come /
i look to my growing old mother and thank the whatever there is left to thank that she's still with me /

i am not strong, i am a weak woman / i have no powers to give to others except an ability to listen only when i want / i'm stupidly manipulating to the point it's so frustrating /
as frustrating as it is to express myself / all i can do is stumble on the past or happiness of others / unsure to be jealous or sad in the darkness

<TEXT> Looky here starry night / I have fears and letters on my mind / I am not a criminal albeit / my mind is painfully interjected by many forms of twilight /

I have done things and I paid the price /
Spinny circle of earth / it is time again /
What fate will the answer be in its head / 
Things changed so much this year / and still things that rinse and repeat stay the same oh dear

Do I run and fall and cry /
Do I leap and jump and die /
Do I take for granted and forget /
Will I ever get over my head

Daddy issues lurking back /
Walking forward Beneath the undercurrent cracks /
Sailing forward but flying high /
Bailing out and fleeting nigh /

Love is blind / much like my glasses /
Envious batteries leeching blunders /
Forensic subsonic devious lard /
My mind reminiscent of a previous bird /

Swooping and changing as the sky goes black /
Breathing / sweepers / panic attack / 

Yuk / this feeling might not end / scary unfair unfolding events / mixed feelings / gut spilling / mind shilling as I cannot cancel hearing my brain connect the lost data / error / code forfeiting until another result again /

Wishful presents on my ash /
Thinking I wasn't all that Mad /
Misunderstanding and misleading lass /
Terribly mixed / please help my head </TEXT>

<TEXT> As moody as I've been this week, it's nice to get away from the same old surface / my lack lustre motivation is moored until I feel alive again / 

Anchored deep until the rusty chains crack /
Weekend freedom at your house once again / peace and calm until our tension breaks into snapshot sexuality / where the dam breaks and all is calm as our heartbeats patter into dual singularities /

We aren't perfect and I like that / let us flourish as we continue to comeback / change remains my fiend and yet / it's just really nice to try new experiences that interject my soprano doubts  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hit the road / risk it all / drive me to some clarity /
Close the door / cut back the noise and take me to some sanity /

You and I are quite different / you smile in your quiet thoughts / my thoughts descend loudly into the airborne dust / no longer rupturing but still it links into the past whilst the present mourns /

If there ever was an absolute then surely peace would find me / instead outsourced by complex pressures / most of which never make sense until its time is up and spent /

<TEXT> Remedies versus conflict 

Wiggle my toes / bare it all as I lay downbeat /
Blank space as the darkness descends once again /
Only the night can be so peacefully intended /

Going quite the snail's pace / as my weary head rests between the pillows as my arm is under the pillowcase / yawning yonder whilst my thoughts keep tinkering / 

Lazy swayed breaths as my heart fluctuates once again / where all my flaws come to life / mocking me with mimicking waves / doubtful bounties of the past less offering / I'm under the turrets of clouded ash / dusty cobwebs in my setbacks

<TEXT> Left-handed lass / nightmares beyond the bypass /
Unable to accept myself / moving forward but still stuck behind my gate /

Dreams of school / dreams of youth / nightmares flounder in its waste / poison berries point like arrows / unable to see a resolution

25 years old and I'm still traumatized / nothing worth bothering with / where I'm just demonized in my pit / 

I got some happiness in my present / not at all grateful like I should be / where is the white flag that waves so largely that our ancestors fought for like a peace treaty /

Monster games ingrained instead / split wires / cutting fence / I'm not a genius or smart like I should be / take my prozac and still remain unhappy /

Hate the damage we've done to ourselves / hate the greed of evolutionary ego / whatever is left to love I don't know / 3am thoughts upon my back /

Lost beyond the damaged days / pity I can't free flow away </TEXT>

<TEXT> A victim long ago / now a mere victim of herself /
Society infused with its poised web of dictated ill hatred /

Unbiased by political demise / she flees to the quiet forest / surrounding undertone of paradise in its natural closet

No longer clipped by a cloud of rust / walking forward into foreign dust / footsteps showing signs of action / half looking backwards in distraction /

August humidity magnified by hearse desolation / searching for a unified resolution / doubt remains an unshakeable fiend / grit my teeth and pursue some meaning in the end </TEXT>

Jane doe met her john whilst the other fish had swam beyond / no flag that waves red or white /
Instead every time she sees him he gives her back a kite / Sundance bird flying free / my wings are no longer clipped whenever it's just you and me /

And so you treat me with a gentleman's touch /
As if I could break in a split second vouch /

But I have built a steel rib cage /
Made of rage, lies / pain and torment /
Ever-changing like my moody current /
Flipside the under turrets into the black /
And then I see you again and It feels like I'm not under attack /
No rouse or misery that enters my shelter /
As there's a padlock of happiness that comfortably consoles me / that looks after me and nurtures my Polkadots of insecurity </TEXT>

You took me out of my shell built of pain and dust /
Brushed aside the webs of anguish and rust /

Yeah it's took a decade of time /

Nothing about this relationship so far has been fake/

Time was certain and curiously intertwined /
How enjoyable and entertaining to find /
Rhythmically ahead of happiness combined /
Thank you for making my first time so right

All I needed was a call /
Yet you're getting comfortable with another fate /

Forgetting you exist by the time my nightmares end /
You deserve to be happy I suppose /

Not forgiven yet / I tell myself that /
Try and be happy that you're with someone else </TEXT>

End of the day I still have nightmares, I still feel tired all the time, I still want to avoid most things and I don't think just because I have a support system should mean I would be cured if I've been this way from a very young age.

<TEXT> cabin of one / sailboat whereby the dreary sea has no longer a name or face to it / where the black abyss pulls the plug / awakening a vacuum into the pit of despair and darkness / where all the answers lead to the bottom of the stilted heights / calling me to jump and yet I wake up again in panic

Where ignoring the signals of oncoming turbulence / onward I stare into the subconscious night / pulling the fabrication of yesterday's tears mid strife as the sun fades into the current black /

Is it unjustified that I feel this way still / even as light is pulling me up / still this sour taste on the tip of my tongue / it's as if I'm unable to shake away the true blues of my head / I cannot run in this foggy haze until I see him / and so instead of the storm / the haze parts ways onto the ocean side of weekly heaven

And how the fog fades into a sunny synchronized swim of juxtaposition; hues, moonbeams and a feeling of giddiness. And just as it arrives soon it ends and I'm back into my jail pit.

Am I lost ? / I seem to be jaded more than twice / am I found ? His lips unlock my mind of a motion of tangled peace / am I odd ? And yet he still looks at me as if an angel flew by / bypassing my negative energetic strands /

Does he undertow my wealthiest weakness / not see me for my faults / as when he drives in cautionary speed / I confess my self disliking / mirrors edge as the sword of reflection goes into overdrive / and yet the world still turns / the sun remains up and I am still absurd

Does he know when he's close / that I forget my inhibitions and all I see is a solidified state of ample kingship / where the devil's outcrop is instead outscored / hair pulled aback by the invisible tiara upon my head / where I feel the queen of the clock / no pauper or jester in feasible sight / where the choppy outlook is teased only by light clouds. 

Yeah I think he sees the skimming stones as the irregular clouds change in the minutes to hours / healing patches of scattered scars / and I still jolt abrupt in the odd rough noise of fear / back to regular walking here </TEXT>

Lakeview landslide lumber / butterfly wings quicksand akin / Anxiety askew the dashboard within / Pause for headlights / train tracks galloping / Along the pine cones of yesteryear in the midst of uncertainty /

<TEXT> I understand to only the extent I could understand. But I know what emotional and physical abuse is as I lived throughout that in my childhood, I know how raw heartache is and I know how brave you are to keep going. 

I miss my ex and it hurts knowing he's with a girl who as much as it pains my ego and heart, is better for him.

Nothing wrong with showing your feelings. Fuck those who think differently. I wasn't raised to be a sheep and from the looks of it neither were you.

I'm glad you're getting support. I have nightmares, take antidepressants daily and still have good days and bad days. Music, writing poems, getting feelings out is so good for the soul. 

I'm so glad your best friend was there at the right time. Whatever happens, I hope you will find yourself first, in the sense of self love, worth, and just to look forward somehow. Sorry for the wall of text. Depression is what I deal with every single day. If you need to cry, you're more of a man than one who doesn't.  </TEXT>

The force of happiness that elevates /
There is no reason to cry /
The day becomes night so easily /
All I do is laugh and enjoy /

I understand the idea of happiness /
Is this what I've been missing my entire life /
So far away from the doom of my room /
A car that takes me away from my fear /
A heartbeat that is so calming /
A sense of regularity here

What it means to smile /
To have wrinkles under my eyes and blush /
To have flaming locks of envy /
To hold his hand under the stars 

Is this what it's like to believe /
To forgive and forget in his arms /
To be caressed and nurtured / 
To smile and fall in love </TEXT>

<TEXT> As fleeting as the week passes by /

All I know is myself / same old song and dance /

And yet the beat clamps down on its own irregular accord /

Wasn't life supposed to be perfect?

And yet after getting what I want, I still want more?

In the downtime of loneliness, of ones own destruction /

Set the fire out /
 ash turns to stone;

 stone ignition by Clementine / foggy leaves in the wind turbine, jetfuel impaired by science and radioactivity, /

Deserted by man, self induced by a coma of sin /

All is quiet but noise stills upon thy cheek / amber lack lustre on the cord of the ropes into the creek and crevice well before me /

Yet light fades through the black and I'm still here /

Friday; drained by anecdotes of pity /

Painful rouse of seething headlights / staring; blinking without respite / and yet onward to the next of kin / the road of the damned and the road of the sin

East to valleys / moons / the defiled and the noteworthy marooned /

Life remains withered / imperfect and red /
Red as the sun's birth and amber as the Sun's death </TEXT>

Surrender to your hand / let me accept that you no longer need me / surrender to myself I miss you but it's over / I've been thinking about you in my dreams / but it's just lust like a miserable vine whip

Surrender to the point of no return / accept my new happiness is healthy and free without conflict /

<TEXT> So you hid some darkness of your past / I didn't give my truth until you told me mine / I hate myself for thinking about him again and again.

I'm wrapped up in the self conscious pattern of yesterday / why is it so hard to be happy / today's the day the folks meet you being aware of the past / acceptance is a powerful tool / yet why am I still stuck thinking about you / the one I never met but argued / the one who's fucking her instead.

Tortured but not blind / I'm a monster in disguise / I am not disgusted by you / just a little disappointed by the wait. 

Daddy issues until the end / ceramic concrete / disdainfully unspent / horrific events in my life with unease / conflicting information about you and him / should I end towards my solo route or choose a castle that's been battered by opposition

I'm flawed as you are / deep within my head / mousey waters / fleeceless Brown / angry angels set fire to my stones / devil's advocate playing tag with my head / confusing reminders of newsflash hellsbent / 

25 years of 25 to life / when will the prison gates release my mind / dead as the darkness that drowns me in daylight / supress my quicksand until the limelight of respected distaste 

Aftertaste of a madman / birds sing and the owl hoots / shoot me to a plantation of peace / history / hellfire to solidifying memories. / hate myself to the ground and back / darkness impaired by blinding taillights. 

Is it so much to ask to be set free from my head </TEXT>

<TEXT> We met on a dating site. He's told me his past which is quite serious and I can still see him for him. I've also mentioned how I have baggage from being bullied throughout adolescence. 

I smile alot, and am comfortable in his presence. But I just would like to know that my gut instinct is in tune with my heart. I'm not expecting miracles or anything. I know it's new, fun and well exciting in itself. 

But if anyone can guide me with some pro's and con's of a healthy relationship especially being my first one I'll really appreciate it. Thank you.  </TEXT>

This is new.

And fun.

And scary.

My eyes are open,
My stance is lighter,
I smile more,
And laugh often.

You give me chills,
And comfort in the darkness,
Freshly smitten in the lighthouses silhouette.

Defined by genetics,
Made several flaws,
Sacrifice boundaries,
Withdraw my walls.

War isn't so fiery,
Instead there is space for joy 
How wonderful to be allowed,
Time to enjoy oneself in,
The particular moment of freedom,
Of courteous demand.
In that he gives me a feeling of warmth. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Depression and anxiety cuts deep in so many forms for different people. Some lucky folk have never experienced anything like it. Many hours have been put into this game. Like all doses of balance, it's helpful for some time out.


Escapism however in the long-term is never the cure. I found that out the hard way. Been getting counselling recovery sessions for the past 2 years and even with antidepressants, cbt, it's always good to walk away from scape if it becomes the sole access to escape. 

So young to have a stressful situation as you've found yourself in but I wish you a recovery. </TEXT>

It burns me in the shade / even with my new Phoenix / ash set on stone / this prophecy non too revealing

Yes I think envy burns me / all the lust we once had / distance is a turnover / anything new jersey I have to flee / except when I'm in the moment of my new man / you're not even a memory

I'm fickle and ruined / just set me on fire / I've tried to put you in a box / but throwing you has a invisible string attached

I'm not on your mind / you live with her now / I could never have what you two do. / it cuts me to a point. But how weird to know / the day I found out / you met her so / was the same day / fate sent me a rose / without a thorn / to give me a chance

I have simon / you have your rose / I think of you sometimes / not with him though / I wish it wouldn't come to feeling like this / confetti aside / honeymoon bliss /

Simon is nothing.like you / simon is more / and yet at 2am / I'm thinking of you across the shore / not in desire but in envy / envy of what / which makes me question me

I never met you / I never will really / it was for the best / our online output ended with zest

He's not a looker / nor am I / yet he's understanding and quite peaceful / yet I'm so persistently obnoxious and vulnerable instead

Too early to tell / is he a keeper / I'm unsure
Don't know a red flag when I see one / but he's not controlling like my dad was to my mother. 

What do I do / do I see him again / or leave the darkness to fill my black head with negative energy again. I still feel scared / darkness impaired /

Just took one person / to be empathic and understand / just one person to be honest and not reprimand / so instead of being so terribly down, I have a date in the week later on. / 

If it goes well / I'd appreciate it. If it doesn't / such is life / back to burying my head in the sand. </TEXT>

bullies as a black rose thorn / nightmare fuel from another morn / blood as thin as water from a strand / and yet it's got my dna - my dad /

school memories are thick as the back of the legs as they had said i had / was it because i was the tallest girl in school / why yes

5 ft 10 and yet they tore me / bitter words that cursed and still bruise me / i suffer from your past ill calls / i'm 24 now and not living / this wasn't part of the deal katrina

hate is a strong word / forgiveness is another / if i knew how to move on without your ash on my head 24/7 / maybe i could suffer less and it would be a hell little less unpleasant

i have my words to my death / i'm sunken in my bed / all i want to do is rest / and here you are / all in my head  </TEXT>

Mining and the pickaxe would break in two halves, same with woodcutting. Fall to the ground etc.

Woodcutting to 99 without ivy etc, do fashion scape by buying 'boots'. See what was on the other side of the fence in falador to taverly for members. 

Pay for members on the phoneline (wayyy back)

Do most quests on release day with sals quest guides

No ge, fun times yelling at falador for trades

<TEXT> Clawing at the walls / lost in space above the hinge / bitterness blues in the darkness sweeping further into demise / inexcusable lies I did, including deceit under the stars.

I miss the laughter, arguably twisted. I miss your calls amongst the damage to each other. I miss your chances of change in my mind. Lush lust is green and blind. Now I am black without your side.

Love and lost a fool I've been. Foolish girl. Caught mimicking. Friends, fiend, foe am I, questionable how you put up for so long, too bad it's over as I miss your support. Lonely bird calling now. Spring is here and I'm not inclined to rest.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Live with mam and stepdad. Stepdad's son has learning disabilities (age 21 but mental age is 10)

My life is considered spoilt. I don't cook. I barely do anything. I play games and I live on benefits because I can't cope. 

I was vigorously bullied at school and have nightmares to this day about them. Moved away from hometown a decade ago and still can't get on with life. Live in countryside. Should be at peace. Definitely not.

Over 20k hours playing a mmo since 04. Barely play it but it says alot about what I've missed. Virgin, cannot be bothered. 

I see people who are my age having kids, in a career and growing up independently. None of it seems worthwhile. Dog turned 6 yesterday.

I colour in books sometimes. I live near the ocean but it's cold. I take daily antidepressants to keep going.

My mam is alive. My stepdad survived a heart attack and triple bypass surgery. I am not. I've never dated a guy except online. Cringe but it's something.

I wake up and hate myself. I go to bed and hate myself. So much fear these days. I'm selfish and manipulating. I am quiet with rage built from years of pain. I stress over the littlest things. I have one friend my age I see every few months.

I literally cannot be happy nor bothered. Here I am. Little miss princess bitch ranting in bed after another nightmare. I don't even want to ask for help. I am stuck in my ways. Might as well become one of the normies and get this thread buried like I bury my head in the sand. 

Yippie.  </TEXT>

i like indie, calm games as i have depression and i try not to let gaming bring me down also (not a fan of puzzles and the like) i like a good script, open world type feel, voice acting/high graphics or at least something to feel in-depth.

<TEXT> So...in a statement sorry, nothing changes, we did what we could and the players that entered incorrectly won't be punished, ...what a waste of dev time and hype.

 If anything I feel sorry for us players for bothering to put up with this incompetent daily shit. I mean considering that we go to reddit to give feedback cause guthix forbid we write a post on the forums without being locked. Also, it's not that we don't care. If we didn't care, wouldn't be here, just a endless supply of letdowns do suck. Alot.

Welp. At least new combat pets today right...no more delays with hyped inconsistencies and maybe progress would be made..darkscape comment plox?...****tumbleweed**** </TEXT>

Also I know mod moltare brought up patching edgeville, but seeing as he's left now, seems no jmod wants to bring up the elephant in the room, or should I say edgeville in the room. I mean it looks so ugly. Does no-one really care? Just a reskin? 

furthermore any concept art for the new clue rewards ? (if any surprises....ahem pink elegant anyone)....*sad at 07's pink elegant but no rs3. Yep fashion scape.

<TEXT> Being 16 and having my first dog harry put down on 31.12.09. He lived 12 years and ended up having his back legs give up, completely unable to move anymore and then to be told at the vet golfball size cancer tumors in his stomach. 

He didn't want to die. Vet put him to sleep but the injections had to be done 3 times. Harry was a fucking fighter man. God damn I miss my spaniel so much. You cannot get over pet loss. Sure he's not in pain, but if there was a fucking miracle that dogs would live human life expectancy and not to be in any pain, I'd give anything to have him back without the cancer. Sigh. Even talking about him after all this time rips my heart. But I never will forget him until the day I die. Best and only thing my dad ever did.
 
Being the second-hand salesman he was, harry, as a puppy was originally called hornet and got traded with a wardrobe, heh. That dog gave me so much happiness in such a distraught and miserable childhood. I miss you harrybo. So fucking much. I feel guilty about not knowing about the cancer. No animal deserves suffering. Ever. Sigh.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A full month to get rid of the last name.

Your original rsname is kept forever. (Unless email login) if meaning whenever you change your name via bond then you would have to change that name twice to lose said name. Examples being my previous name is magic seed. I can change it to plushies and still keep it however if I were to change it again, I would lose magic seed.

One bond can make the name change ability instant or you have to wait 14 days for a free change. (Requires membership) hope this makes sense.

<TEXT> boss pets, boss titles, skilling pets, road to all 120's, as i am now comp i just choose what i want to do, there are days i just walk around the wildy at revs/killing chaos elemental, other days i go to the arc for lonely skilling, other times...well it's all very random.

the game is what you make it, and seeing as aside from the xp caps to 200m per skill, you can really do whatever you like, i suppose that's where the enjoyment of runescape has always thrived upon; being able to do whatever you want in the moment. i still wish there was more content this year. so far it's been pretty scarce, but yeah. reaper is easy money too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> so you are gone /
and sadly that is that /
what a life to have loved and lived /
until the end you fought /

cancer sucks, indeed it does. /
no matter what the cost /
however unjust and unfair it is /
i hope you are rejoicing with your boys somewhere /
wherever the bluebird calls /
on some sunny faraway hill /


i am not religious but i have hopes /
humane hopes to save myself from the full heartache /
tomorrow we stand if the weather is right /
to say goodbye in our own peaceful wight /
for saying goodbye is a subtle private thing /

over 200 attended your funeral /
what a life to have touched so many /
not know them by acquaintance - but an actual friendship.

how rare it is to have met, someone like you. /
i talk to you in the present as i cannot accept you are fully gone /
i am sorry i did not do more, in my head it is perplexing and confusing to acknowledge /
but guilt may lay here for years to come /
the way you lit a cigarette on your shoulders;
the way you said fuck you to the world and kept on smiling;

the way you appreciated your family, friends and lover.
you fought to the depths and kept on walking.
wherever you are, wherever you be, please be at peace.

goodbye my friend, goodbye my aunt;
we may not be blood related but i am so fucking sad to see you part;
unfair and uncouth; cancer holds no sorrow. /
it wasn't your time. and i hope you will keep an eye on the family. /
we love you much and we love you still / it took a while to trust you but i had my inner demons / you were such a hero to us all. my heart breaks as i part; please be there for your brother, your sisters they shall ache now.

/ maybe grief will realize what they lost. however small and however much the cost. goodbye my friend. thank you.

<TEXT> Some seek shelter in the rain / somewhat overruling doubt descends /
For those few hours / the world forgets / dismissive symmetry / beneath the boulevard /

Cascaded shimmering stars twinkle with its whispers ;
Think too much / dissatisfaction owns / think too little / how confused will you stay /

Mice be rummaging on the lawn, owls be clearly waiting for a few until hunger tears its primal swipe /

Watching all those fairy lights </TEXT>

<TEXT> year of the disappointment for now, i mean, it's all well for putting your hands up in the air but action really does speak louder than words at this point :(

(brutal rant but from a players perspective)

i find some j-mods genuinely care about the status of updates and the core game. these collaborate with neutral feedback and others are not so set about tweaking content they've made.

apologizing only works so many times and frankly, it's almost become a weekly thing. there is something wrong WITH THE WAY IT'S BEING DIRECTED IMO.

how many sorry's is going to fix the game though? being vocal about it in a direct video is some indication of feedback. we love this game, we care about it enough to complain when we can see what it should be. is the bar too high? when we look at the history of updates, and how overtime, the amount of fixes from content that is game-breaking, that isn't properly coded, has to surely be changed, not just talked about. 

damage control isn't necessarily a fix for change. it's a step in the right direction but as it's a common thing now i don't know what to hope for. i just want updates without a hotfix every-time there is an update. is that too much to ask?   </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> angry mimicry burning down my hair /
rage fulfilling me to undeniable despair /
loneliness pulls the strings down here /
on the floor in my heroin; not the drug but my 4 walls of dimlight.

disgusting self-worth in the mirror, repulsive creature of hideous intentions /

how funny it was when we could conquer the world through innocence /

how much of an oddball to be alive, when the kings and queens are pawns; when the government attempts to behave like almighty monkeys in the limelight.

how terrifying it is to be poor, to not have a clue, who doesn't understand nor want to be part of the score...

how much death must we see until change happens? or change is beyond thee... / 

tired eyes and sleepless nights / duty calls yet i mourn the what if's. / medication and daydreams are my contender to this disconcerting fiend.

days until the 24th bell, yet who am i? a mad, bittersweet mademoiselle? 

a damsel of demise by her own head, why cannot i forgive? why cannot i let, the dooms of day begone, why cannot i grow up?
why am i in this paradox of forgone deja vu ;

addictions as of late, irregardless of my fate, stuck in the moment, gonna change; it's tomorrow; rinse and repeat; too late.

stuck in the stars when there's no god to see;
stuck in the awareness of my athiests hindsight;
stuck with the clipped wings since 4 years old;

fuck you dad, all my ex's, my head, my negative insight
fuck you world, cars that just drive by, in my silence
meanwhile at home with no drive except the jail rails of my head.

4 by 4 x 24h / an insiders distraught souls rage of fit 
such is life / a mimicry of angry fiddlesticks

/ playlist after sunset after sunrise after text by text,
who really is there that's a genuine spark? 

not me, not i.
just a bitter woman who wanted to  be loved and is stuck in my fishbowl awaiting death on the monday morning, duty calls...

depression sucks.

<TEXT> Barmy brain cells,

This anxious Sheila; not from down-under,

This topsy turvy helter-skelter

So I got what I wished for, a decade late

And now there is silence; bittersweet remains

This poison underneath the fungal growth spills,

Unimaginable madness ultrasounds. 

And yet in deja vu circles I remain; in pain, beneath my feet. 

Fear holding me back, viciously licking it's lips as I lay defeated by my own twisted mind, yet all I beg for is for another to understand my head, to help transform my resentful ways, to cross examine shame at it's brutal form, 

so many questions, peace sounds rightfully better, expectations mimicry at its finest. Who will help the weak? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey. 120 is for a purely cosmetic cape (no emote like a 99 has) however for example, if you were to achieve 120 divination, by the time you got there (104m xp) you'd be considerably wealthy in game.

 all depends on the player, it's not necessary apart from the upcoming menaphis update, where 120 slayer is a requirement for completionist but since you are a returning player it's just an extra thing to do </TEXT>

<TEXT> apart from the rare time i go on high lvl/vip forums/item discussion, my attempts are becoming more and more scarce, this sub being not dictated by over the top mods/not truly being in control by j-mods is the freedom that we obviously search for.

it's a shame but that's what happens when people get power hungry / things that aren't broken *penguins* get changed for no reason apart from *me thinks it's good for the forums ta* no..you're not the player.,...

2017 tis the year of the player being the q/a tester

rs forums being censored/ruled by the top pyramid (j-mods/rs 'forum mods' (power hungry rule targets)

new content becoming dead content (aside from *really unexpected random (few and far between)

i think what is bad is new players do come here for advice, surely it should be the rs website but instead it's this and rs wiki - that offers the most support </TEXT>

<TEXT> As someone who has anxiety and depression and takes 200 mg Sertraline daily to help me cope, it's things like this that makes me feel a bit relieved that someone does care about people like me in our situation of distress. 

I am very aware our community can be toxic but over the years there have been alot of diamonds too. Runescape has been an escape and a saviour. No other game has brought the amount of joy and sustainable motivation to keep playing. And to see the day that I acquired a completionist cape. It gave me something to focus on that wasn't destructive.

Here's a little poem. Cringy or not who cares.

Thanks runescape.


Time has passed /
Quite quickly too /
A shadow of misadventures anew /

Back before the glory page /
A simple island designed by fate /
Illiterate noobs at the gate /
Kids, teens, adults alike /
Bots / trees / pixelated daytime /

Time progressed /
As did age /
Secondary school was met /
With bullies and rage /

Sadness and isolation was commonplace /
Yet I'd run home from school /
To a welcoming place /
A place to laugh, have fun /
Not feel like the only one /

Some regret playing so young /
Not I, as it had been the only one /
Rejoiced feeling like I was accepted /
Sick and tired of feeling tormented /

There were nights that were overcome by tears /
Fear, misery and alot of jeers /
Yet here I could woodcut for hours /
Chill out and skill, feel empowered /

Over a decade has passed since school /
Still enjoying scape for good /
The bullies have gone /
Yet my nightmares stay /
I'm beginning to think /
They'll never go away / 

Thank you runescape / 
I thank you most /
For your still here /
To relieve my haste /

Good and bad days yes /
But I do try my best /
Thank you for all the years /
No more tears drowning in fear /

Someday I hope my cloud will leave /
For now I will live day by day /

Thank you runescape.

it would also be nice to earn a minimal amount whilst skilling/slayer etc. i get it's a fair. it just isn't very satisfying to bother with i suppose. idc about being downvoted, i just say how i see it, some might think well they've U-turned. just not enough for me to be content i suppose? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hits home as my stepbrother has global learning difficulties so on the outside he looks like a normal 20 yr old but on the inside he's about 10.

 More so worried about his innocence of the world vs me knowing how corrupt and evil anonymity can be.

It's a struggle also having anxiety and depression myself but don't let people get you down. Just do you.

I have always found runescape to be a safe haven irrespective and regardless of the people that play it. 

However yes it's truly difficult to trust people especially on a social platform but it's hard to trust people in all walks of life.

Baby steps is the best option. I say you and everybody is welcome to rs. Some abuse that right but if it's serious enough, consequences will remove    said players from the game (harrassment/extreme threats etc)

Good luck and I wish you the best. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Shockingly I have had a similar situation. Lass from peterlee asked if I was ok. (Mental breakdown aug 2015) I said no.

Advised me to a doc for sicknote and told me there's further help available. Thank you.

Had a psychiatrist, cbt, thorough counselling and every day is a struggle. But this lass gave me a opportunity to feel human. To seek answers to why I felt shit all the time. Why I had anxiety getting out the door and the constant negative attitude.

 Sertraline here too. 200mg/daily and it's still a long way to go. But people like her aren't just ticking the boxes. They care. </TEXT>

Hear this out. It's an idea but this might work. Have a read.

As they've brought a t.a.r.d.I.s into the game. Could redo a mini tutorial with a penguin, hinting at quests, start out at lumbridge, somewhat small flashing arrow towards outside of the castle, has a right click skip option for quick access to the game.

The tutorial would involve said penguin (ping and pong for humour perhaps) who give you a penguin screwdriver. You are led to the penguin tardis which you use the penguin screwdriver to open it. 

Said tardis would feature a few portal's. No requirements, more of a visual if the player wanted to. 

Portal one would be access to tutorial island before it was put under the sea.

Portal two would be a bit like gnome-copters/ more of a pretty HD visual having interactive use of looking around each city/main area/anything to show the variety and true beauty of the game. Again only if the player wanted too.

Portal three would have a room of all the beginner npcs gathered outside lumbridge castle grounds, examine texts, all the basic lumbridge resources, trees/interior/exterior to show the player the general consensus of what most areas will look like.


This penguin screwdriver would have a easy-to-use wearable faq for new players which would remain a cosmetic item.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Depression is pretty much the on going issue, anxiety has been since childhood. Frankly I don't know what I need. What does 'need' mean truly.

Considering I am lucky to live with a bed, food, for now my mam is alive, a dog, 

Needs are met by my dose of daily sertraline, but I suppose I wish I could get out of this rut. Where's the magic wand or sonic screwdriver or bernards watch to let me chill.

Lol sadly reality is brutal at the best of times. Struggling for me is a continuous morning of a cuppa, sorrowful lying on the floor with my dog, talking out my weekly counselling to me mam, and still feeling stuck no matter what.

Ide like to be cured but I don't think that's possible :) so realistically? It's hard to say. Being on a budget? Or dreaming of anything regardless of the cost. Welp I'm rambling. Lol.

I'm at the point I'm beyond looking at crossroads, it's just a mere scribble of black. Turning 24 this year is kind of scary too. It's amazing what people expect of you if you look normal on the outside, if they only saw my head, welp.  </TEXT>

withered by this selfish self /
stormy seas in this overcast cloud /
i hate myself and tell the world

bitter, uncouth /
mistrust and doubt /
miserable at best /
beyond hope's last door /

it's too real /
we all know that /
not unsure of the blank page /

rejection /
obselete madness /
how the fuck did i get this far ? /
i certainly never was shot towards the stars /

tumbling evergreen /
betrayed rotten glucose /
decayed submarine /

timber my chains /
these walls remain deep /
woes me to surrender /
perhaps in my sleep /

this is no heroine glory to treasures /
it's real /
brutal /
withstood with force /

why me /
why genetics /
why questions? /
why of course? /

this deposition of a matter beyond thee /
why must i meet this phase of quicksand /
movies aren't magic /
just delicate doomsday's of mankind's handstand /

this song and dance isn't fun /
why bother when these pills yield not the answer nor fun /
why sing when the stars are hidden from my eyes /
why breathe this routine in my fishbowl of shadows /
why eat to continue decaying enzymes of primal noise /

poor, tired and sick of this choice /
afraid all the time /
my god it won't end /

Dad, well. Bob.

You are an incredibly selfish man. You always have been. I know you seem to think mum has put negative pressure on your exterior description but that isn't why I dislike you so.

I dislike you....hate you for making me feel like shit. Especially the butterfly incident, tickling my feet until I cried as a infant. One cannot forgive so vividly as the memories are raw

weeping lady in a nightdress /
midnight - deserted in a satin cotton mess /
not sexual or expecting /
more of a sadness /
relentless.

i am but a fool /
not a builder
not a foe /
yet a troublemaker /

not a riddle

yet however /
all i have /
is remembering September /
forgetting ones heart /
is the first thing to go /
remembering ones past is beyond a death wish /
for those who seek death don't always receive the best intentions /

a lost skulduggery of wisdom simulations /
not all creatures are born with the fear like i have /
not all creatures can be taught about the brain like ours do /
yet we all seem to illustrate the beauty of the night /

birds sing - illusion spring
bees swarm - summer's saturn
bluebirds swoon - autumn's acorn 
snowing thistles - snowmen's fickle

beauty of an average of millennia /
succeeded by sexuality of entrancement /
accepted by natural selection /
or a divine time /

heavens no longer a fairytale /
not do i understand the oncept of hell /
forever withstanding amid our central nervous system /
for if we are dead, how will we feel pain?

how can pain receptors retaliate fate? 
if the lines are dead /
and the electrodes are numb /
no heartbeat left /
sent to hell/
how come?

choice to believe /
and choice to manipulate /
are certainly different things /
a calculator cannot calculate 

a creator of life /
or a big bang of atoms /
perhaps we are made to com bust

surprise me

hope is a odd delight /
a natural way of suggesting life /
meanwhile protruding glasses among others /

<TEXT> i mean if you have a valid reason yea people will help in the most amazing ways, but i'm a firm believer about being at the right place at the right time, some people have bank but will not give hand outs no matter what.

however others are SO eager to help, all depends on variables really, but yea there are still good people in the game...it's finding them that is the difficult part </TEXT>

And well we recently acquired a toy animals zoo (bit of string with different animal teddies connected)
Lucky certainly enjoys it which cheers me up. Happy pet lover here. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2017-01-02 10:40:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> sick of the fear; my crusade of tears /
why must i be stuck in your hatred that yields /
demonic almost but why can't i be free /
i hate you for all your misery you have put in me /
i can't enjoy the sun /
i can't enjoy the light /
when in my head it's anxiety and doomsday fluctuating in my gate /
i hate you dad /
no blood of mine /
disregarding me; disowning me twice /
well you monster; you've not won yet /
as much as you've liked to have guessed /
you've produced only a fear but not a truth /
my heart instilled isn't an illusion; it's not obtuse

see harry (pet dog) 7 years you may be gone but you showed me delight /

i miss you so much but you were my life /
some say you were only a dog /
keep the memory and stay away /
but you were the remedy of my pain /

i may have nightmares /
i may have tears /
but i am young still /
and trying not to fear.

i hate the crowds /
i hate my mind /
i may hate you but your hatred isn't immortal

however you continue to wish throughout my head /
i know i am loved, and continue to be loved instead /

i wish my subconscious leave; exit in delight /
resist losing my mind to your doubts /
but father please know this /
although you may not know me /
i still try to resist /

people say forgive and forget /
but the damage is done /
isolation and loneliness wasn't made in a day /

no longer will i feel in guilt of the escape /
that was led because of your monstrosity of hate /
forgive and forget /
i don't understand /
religion seems foreign /
memories and love seem stone /
i realize i am not here forever /
but forever i am in this cage of fear /
it isn't my fault / 
i wasn't afraid when i was born into this sphere /

they say the world is your ocean /
but my eyes are the sea /
i would like to feel released from your misery /
and yet as i type i think of my mother /
my sister, my niece, my uncle and brother

for as much as i feel trapped /
and as much as you would like me to leave (self-doubt) /
i have a dad twice the size of your cage of doubts /
not in blood but a angel of love /

sunset and the sea /
didn't think I'd live the ocean by twenty-three /
trying to be happy /
is a tardis of strings /

although love hasn't set me free of your toxic waste /
i am reminded of my love from a freedom gate /
acid may burn /
nightmares may sting /
but here i am /
loved by many to sing /

i sing in words /
i sing in haste /
i state my cause /
hesitate

burn these demons /
please burn away /
i hate myself /
everyday

anxiety and depression sucks.
i hate you dad.

The hypocrisy of folks though /
Celebrating like it's all going to plan /
Fireworks whilst there's genocide /

I fear the daylight yet the night feels more lonesome , I wish all this scripted political boas could be worn away to mever be complete, let us slumber without the walls, all I have is this seat </TEXT>

<TEXT> Savagely cornered in my box /
They say it gets better; I think not. /
Trembling and afraid /
My personality is inking in year-round raindrops /
I tell myself I will change / but the tracks are in in stone /
Circular fissures of my stampede exclusively owned to make it worse /
I wonder sometimes if drowning would hurt? /
Options and crossroads; it's all the same shit
How will I fly if I cannot get out of here /
I look at the sky and I wish I could see /
Except all that's here is foreshadowed misery /

I deny myself a physical smile, and yet I question these delusional miles. Thornes inside my captivity /
Digging under me and yet people feel better without the noise. 

I take my Medicare and I get my support /
Just sometimes I wish I could go back and be retaught /
Alas its bed time for me so goodnight all
Maybe one day I'll be sleeping without these memories of pain. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2016-11-25 15:12:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> (My depression)
 

Picture a lighthouse /
What do you see ? /
The lowest lighthouse window /
That is me /

Not in metaphor /
Not in fantasy /
But in a split chasm of a wisp /
Such as thy spirit /
Washed aside by the wind of the damned /

Lass be nimble /
Lass be quick /
Lass almighty fallen /
Succumbed by sandy sticks /
Not by season or forward foes /
But by memories /
Misery renowned /

They say history repeats itself /
I say why not change /
They say be one of us /
I say I'd rather be kind /
They say you're a failure of your time /
I say at least I'm willing to be scrutinized by an open mind/

Abolished by sand /
Abruptly engrossed /
Is this my end?

(The lighthouses answer from within)

No. /

For you speak of a disdain day /
An apples eye /
Understand my fate isn't according to your woes /

Time stands when you begin and when you end /
Yet I'm the lighthouse of eternal suspended wit /
Rotate your clock /
Do what you must /
For I am the lighthouse /
For all; unjust /

Fiend or friend /
That is uncouth /
For in twenty-four hours /
Your mission is replenished /
I will stop /
Only by the sun /
Or when eternal darkness /
Is accompanied by one /
For treatment and treasures are spellbound by fate /
Greed, disdain...unfortunately late /

For when the sun explodes with trickles of starlight /

Perhaps then I shall decompose /
Or if fast fate settles /
Perhaps the time will be /
That the lighthouse of myself /
Will be sent to the depths of the sea /

Glorified and turned to ash /
perhaps my fate is sealed from the backlash /

You never see the other side until you are wise with regret/
Perhaps Saturn's rings could enlighten some magic yet. </TEXT>

2am blues /
No duty calls for me /
Here I am /
In this selfish state /
Not once but many /
Who knew by 23 /
I'd be tired and petty /
Defined by depression /
Defined by sadness /
This is no dream /
Beyond pathetic madness /
Winter blues /
Far stretch this poverty line /
And yet I must /
Fake the forgery happiness mine /
Grenades of sawdust /
Bitter descendants of a timeline /
Trivial woman /
You're beyond your own mind.


Fate be yonder /
Fate be sick /
Fate be tested /
Fate remains thick.

I know not to ponder /
Over political taste /
And yet I wonder /
Is it all a propaganda tale /
Or shallow invasions of a malicious scale /
Questionable doubt for on going time /
And yet here I am /
Doling a sign /
Sadness remains /
From this quarter life design </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let me sleep,
Let me lay, 
This pit of hell,
Won't go away

Tired monster,
Fear inside,
Devils laughter,
Sinners pride.

Gridlocked in this maze of mud,
I am so tired of this place.
Player 2, retreat!

What's that?
Obsolete you say?
Mimicking game,
Damn it, 
I'm afraid

Dad not of blood
But loved by me
Get better soon
This heart attack of yours
May leave

Mother, oh mum
God damn it you too;
May your hip op go well
I cannot lose you

Stephen oh lad
Step brother you are
Global learning is a pain in the ass
But you genuinely are a star

Twinkle twinkle
Bo peep where are you so
These sheep need feeding yet
You've gone and lost them
Oh no

Terrible madness
This wretched year
Summer r.I.p
You deserve your vengeance 
I swear

Sister, lost soul
Married away and a mother too
I still am close in my heart
Unbeknownst to you

Unkind, this world
What a sickened time
War and death
Dreaded fear and
Doubts
What a time to be alive.

Year 2016
Not keen am I
Neither in 2017 will
I have hopes for a better time

Rinse repeat
Don't give a sheet
No chores tonight
This cinematography
Anticlimactic poem
From the forming
Ideas in my head

Maybe I will sleep it off
Thinking about it
I cannot. </TEXT>

suffering from severe anxiety and depression. Taking 100 sertraline daily, my doc check up isn't till the 19th,

 my stepdads son has global learning difficulties, age 20 but mind of 8-12 year old, his mum was a schizophrenic and ironically died from a heart attack a couple years back.

Cousins daughter got killed in a bouncy castle incident (uk was widely on news) in early part of the year

Boyfriend has ongoing liver and kidney damage

Real dad disowned me. Again.

Idk. Needed to vent. This has been absolutely fucking horrible. </TEXT>

Been suffering with ongoing anxiety and depression and these books sure are healing but it seems some of the generic patterns give me a headache wheras the moomins I can actually relax a bit if that makes sense </TEXT>

<TEXT> Friend, you never were  
Yet I remain adopted by another.     

Aging demons illustrating illogical desire for love you just do not possess.   

And here you flee, not the first or the last.           
But I cannot cry over you anymore. Not worth the salt let alone the world cannot save my wounded heart. 

I hate you as I hate my enemy. Unless you change in which you won't. How can I forgive you?

I don't forgive myself for holding onto a false dream. 
You suck and you always will.

<TEXT> When the beat stops,
Yet the heart's still pumping.
Wistfully groomed by peer pressure envy,
Never enough to foretell the travesty.
Involving oneself with the unrealistic enemy.

I wished it wasn't the way it was,
Browse the loan shark of surviving getting old.
Tiresome butterfly,
You're getting old.

Judgement by a look of slithering tact
Taxing my memory, my pain, my back
Bending over backwards for your love
Rejected and retaliation of isolation,
Numb,

Teaspoon of jeopardy and jaggered butchered hearts,
Salt on the wound
Of the generation x lungs
Unknowingly mocked
Inadvertently so
Threatened by paper
Hat's and cobblestones
Mistletoe and listless woes
That's the way it goes

sweet surrender until the nighttime /

lost, not yet found  /

except by few /

don't know how /

it became so soon /

that all that's here /

is really meant to be /

as i contemplate confusion /

at every crossroads arrowhead tree /

prayers are seldom /

but yet here i am /
staring at the sea again/
hoping for a little sunshine/

in my own bubble of mine/

aloft in the loneliest primetime/

where technology progresses at such a speed/

that only we can breathe after a calm cup of tea/

nightfall looms overhead tonight/

lost in thought/

of a previous lifetime /


not of worry nor care /

but with a childhood head. /

lost yet found /

within myself /

not needing one  /

to sustain my wealth /

sleep tonight /

young butterfly /

wisp the willows under the buttercups of twilight/

 /
let the shadows shimmer /


and the dust turn to ash /

we can be winners /

if we all but relax / </TEXT>

such a group like this can bring /
joy in spite of tragedy /
a holding hand along the pain /
and let's move past aprils rainy days of bleaky pain/
so soon bright may will be /

whether it rains /
it snows /

<TEXT> a rose for your thoughts. 

intricate sparks situating over a forgotten silver skyline |
shattering shades of Saturn, my blues are not evading |
your intimacy is neither here nor there, yet i love you all the same |

times are ever changing in this fast paced airwave |
i look above and see the oval paradise of twilight; 
yet i see blackness and misery awaiting my fortnightly incomings. |
not only are you lost, boy but i am lost too |
except you're a man now in your puddles of mild-mannered consciousness |
And yet i bloom like the sun under your company, fickle like a rosy mistletoe that's ready to sleep. |
weary, my friend i am tired.
not of you but of my own regret; of a cowardice profound like no other. sick of comparison and sharing!, |
sick of my own innocence, prejudice and disbelieving! |
sick of hate, almighty justice, encompass me upon this thistle-bud and show me compassion, i am tired of waiting. </TEXT>

Im talking 30/50 different episodes as different people up to this number had bullied me in that particular school.

<TEXT> lost in my wild head/

 changing my thoughts in the same square jail that consists of my bed/

this prism is obsolete and i feel so fractured/

a man once said "it is not the chance you get, it's the will of trying"
my trying has extinguished and the will is gone/


i want justified happiness in living/

it's not frightful, it's terrifying/

this midnight calling, tragedy from the morning light
enlightment isn't all but a housed terrice here/

this monster doesn't remain under the bed
it's there stalking passively/

this blackness deepens the best of us/

yet some lucky folk seem so lucky and transferred into positivity/

yet i have is undoubted misery and mercy/

my question for this apathetic life is : when the mercy will run out?

/
long overdue is my responsibilities yet here i am laying on the floor again/

24 hours of nothing changing/

and all i really needed was acceptance/

empty house/empty phone calls
/noone comes/

let it end and let it be/

noone deserves this stupid idiocy
that is called loneliness /

but alas my addiction stays/

in these 4 walls/

day-to-day/


wake me up pill to numb my misery/

take me home i hear you cry/

become normal and smile it's alright/

you are not alone it's okay/

just pretend lass- tomorrows another day/

cat and mouse once again/

friendly enemies at once /

siding in a harmony like no 
other/
lass haven't you spoke to your mother?

why yes but it doesn't help/

so instead here i am committing to yelp. </TEXT>

Pathetic queen on the land/
Take me out of this place I don't understand/
All I ask for is a start/
How do I survive when all I do is fall apart/
Dragon eye blues, this fate recalls/
All I want is a change of heart/

Mimic of sadness, why do you weep?/
Mimic of anger, is it all because of me?/
Such as we were not a moon ago/

Hate myself enough to be blue/

<TEXT> Disorienting chemicals within a field of doubtful judgement,
A veneer of tribulation, what a frightened decade.
So much to think about that tomorrow's fate is deciphered by yesterday's conflict of misery and change.
Youth's trust in an account of misinterpreted eye's. So long ago it was that I fought for my rights, a game of cat and mouse. Deluded in those crimson days. Looking now in 2016 I am afraid of tomorrow. Bitter of the past without sorrows. Forbidden keeper that time has no hold.
Lockdown on one's only accord. For loathsome heartbeats never formed in a day.
Tumble thimble, naughty whimsical lunatic humanist interval. Close the door and let me sleep for I burn without peace. Owners of decay and tired eye's. Let me wake without fear tomorrow's night. Sleeping willow of a thumb. Surely I'm not the only submerged one?  </TEXT>

It's almost forgotten, withered tornado.
They say spring will come but present is not my key
Hollowed whispers from a historic path contains my jeopardy.
Not once I recall this storm to ever end,
For I am numb without freedom.
I long for things I don't possess
And as I grow I weep, as it scares me
This everlasting freak. 
Pittance and perpetrated wrinkles surrounded by sinister shadows lurking in the deep.
This madhouse of my head is not a minefield of melancholy
Except when im alone but thoughts escape me.
Selfish and undignified
I look for non existing right
I am so afraid of the night.
Another dawn, another bench
Another annual anonymous saddle monster
Regret oh submit and fall in this pit of hell
Hate myself, shallow girl.
Bid me rest from this mess or ever I shall succumb to the blacklist of moonlight. </TEXT>

When will i be set free?

How bitter and twisting time remains, for what purpose is mine?

Ashamed; I must be.

<TEXT> As the meadow shined under the crisp moonlight of the twilight, an echo fell over the forest. Crackling crows porched on an old rickety fence, scarecrows stuck in the musty mist and yet as ever, the young woman arrived again, buried in a fog that the sun never seemed to clear and yet as the fog began to drift with the start of the pitter patter of the rain, the black dog was there lurking but minimal. It was almost peacefully perfect in this old forest.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pointless reasoning, mechanical arches hung by a stratospheric archive of dismal dark dust withered by the over gauntlet of a lighthouse. Tired and lonesome. Desires a must. Neglected by herself, therapists do not help. Bitter and hung over by withered withdrawal symptoms of a ever lasting addiction subconsciously immersed in it's own paradox
My Pandora's box lives a jagged heartbeat of heaved diplomacy. Its course is uncertain when my brain functions with a disfigured disguise of mortal mentality. An epiphany of ever lasting youth to confuse oneself in more mysterious mystery. Im so fucking lonely. </TEXT>

<TEXT> And so it was. the moment she finally saw it was coming. it had been happening in her dreams every now and again, blurs of pain, memories to cringe at, defiled dreams which persuited her, lost in the void of the ivory garden, she had lost her way years ago, and now in the present, the ice captures her slowly and effortlessly. joy has succumbed to her masters of betrayal;  long lost friends, love and agony all beneath her soul are lost to her doomsday book as a child. her book of long lost magic and imagination, her long lost wants and dreams, inspirations to get out the door and ride her bike up alleyway street corners in the rain, her long lost beckoning s of resentment of others, childish laughter of ignorance, to be unaware of the verbal tormentors,  yet now in 2015, that child no longer can run to fairytales, she looks too far ahead, two decades from now rather then tomorrow night. she's frail and scared to get out the door, and her parents are there but long gone, no longer can they protect her from herself. no golden broom tonight, no harry potter tonight, no butterfly lion tonight, no jack and the beanstalk tonight, no runescape tonight, no ice cream man to give her just desserts, no sitting on the same park bench for 8 years helps, no talking helps, the doc won't give her medication and the jobcentre doesn't want her. 

i wish for her to return but she never does, who is she? amanda's joy. this lighthouse of home santuary and fear is stuck and preventing her now. tip-toeing and subliminal messages from the media eradicate her. make her not found. for all that is there is gone from her heart. all is left is this fucking black cloud on her chest. and all that remains is waking up old being too late. fuck depression.  </TEXT>

Rebellious and vicious, she decides to visit a mysterious creator of the foreign isles, undeterred she whispers the noxious lullaby and calls a forgotton sluggish slumber.

'rescue me' he wails

<TEXT> To be a queen of mercy; calculating and demanding. demeaning and provoking what loyalty she can get. to be wise yet not wise. to be birthed and raised in a endless narcissistic pool of genes. will the king arise and save her? or is it a game of cat and mouse, whose only power strikes beneath them both that they remain loyal, as how else would they meet there maker? the gods that don't exist? or the gods that do in their subconscious? their selves?  

madam, the king must not wait just yet, for he who will be saved will come one day, and if they do not speak it is not the time for heroes and dandelions.

for the stratosphere is dead, we are alive yet buried under acts of misfortune, slavery, ill means and poverty, sacrificial acts of life, of mothers, drunks, homeless neglect, of the ill dead and yet here we are in this cynical labyrinth persecuted by those that speak ill against; politicians,   cowards, royalty, addicts of deluded consequence, ever searching for hope, but hope is a bottle of colour, a possession, a power, it's non - existence is bestowed by forces of uck. timid chance, happy mediums that dance in the transquility of matter, those ill-fathered puns that struck each living orgasnism once in a life time, and if they're lucky the coin dances in the moonlight, the shimmer of the everdance of the green money that comes their way

for thee that cannot resent another and be happy to one another will summer rise their lives in painyet vanity has no enemy, all will see themselves at least once.

<TEXT> alone, old soul
wearyness grows upon thee.
shop windows are searching for your money
the win dows are cracked and the facade of greed is everywhere
beggars sit beside the outer porches as they have done since dawn.
caves, train tracks, limosines
war, generosity of ill genoside,
ill hearted racism
where is the paradise?
whom be the teacher is the lessons are taught wrong
caught in decision where do I belong?
caught into the world where technology advances us
imac's and commercialism
prodding retail sweatshops
disnowned father-daughter love
mind numbing topics designed to hate ourselves
a community which co-operates on funds
where did selflessness go?
why are we so numb
 is it in our toothpastes?
is it our lack of funds
are we denominated by our prime
from choices our descendants made
have we no name in ourselves
do we decide a changing game
or do we give up, not in gods name
god did not exist when i was the beholder
did we lie to ourselves to manifest a dream beyond our
mildy matters of pearly gates?
my mind is a pack of dominoes manifested from ignited adolescence and adulthood and destructive patterns brought on from a dad who didn't care
i am 22 and stuck
the question is...why?

<TEXT> unconventional madness.
it really fucking is. i applied for over 4000 jobs all day everyday. and to get to this point. the future is bleak and i cannot escape what predicament this is. i need help and don't know what to do. it's 2am and i either go to work unable to work or i don't go to work and seek help. why am i so afraid to seek help.

why do i come to the internet? to feel anonymous when it most likely isn't.

as a child my dad emotionally abused me, and did weird stupid things. nothing too sick but sick enough to be a tormentor and probably why im the way i am

many reasons why im stuck in the past...

he'de tickle my feet till i cried, to laugh, for about 10 minutes
(between ages of 4-8)

he took me to a butterfly sanctuary and laughed as i panicked as they flew in my face. i was three. butterflies (stupid right) scare me if i'm near them. beautiful creatures but i panic if they go near me.

when him and my mother were together if we wanted to go shopping he'de have the audacity to ask her for petrol money, he was the income holder, mum was living on income support due to a long-term back injury

he'de lie about taking me places and agree in front of his mates that we;de go together so i'de assume as a kid with false hope i'de go, mind this doesn't bother me now but it did then
(aka superficial things like disneyland/lapland/pay for my new york end of school leaving trip)

he'de betlittle me and my mother but mum didn't wake up until i was about 12 and only when my dad hit her she left with me to move away but by then it's been too late. moved away at 14.

22 now...and since we left him the following has happened.

been playing runescape since i was 8 to deal with it;

i write random amounts of bullshit poetry to escape as my mind is affecting me from backend trauma

i listen to music to heal but after the music stops i'm back to reality

dated online boyfriends all my life. never experienced anything real. i mean if a skype call is real you can call that real but it's a shallow petty route. 

i'm afraid to seek help, i'm afraid to talk to mind or a doctor, i know i'm probably going to, but i know it feels so late, i'm in destruction phase and don't know how to get out of my rut. 

my dad is about 68, why can't i forgive him, the words forgive do not work, i've cried for years, tormented myself to let go and move on, yet he's still there in my head.

this job is fucking incredible and i'm fucking it up. i don't want to do it anymore. i don't want to be on the dole anymore, i just want quietness, no more getting up at 6 and getting home at 6-7-8pm
yes people do this everyday and petty me for not being used to it, 

sigh, i just want someone to love me, and i want my dad to be someone else, and he will never change, why do i expect him to wake up and see everything he's done, why do i come to a narcissistic platform that jumps on every woman's trouble?

well the answer is i'm a coward, coward as they come and i don't know what to do anymore, i just want to feel safe and i do not feel safe, safe as in sanctuary, i miss home, i miss moments of not panicing, but i don't remember the last time i did this...

if someone understands any of this bullshit please let me know?
because i feel i'm venturing lost and yes i'm rambling but who can i talk to? a doctor to get a pill? to altar my hormones and make it all ok as in a petty hush hush?

i'm just lost. and i know the only way to heal is to help yourself, and i know you can't drag a horse to water and all that shit. but i feel like 12 still, in a womans body with a womans mind. i mean fuck im nearly 30 soon and i have nothing except the love of my mother, she's been my rock and i don;t know what to do

:/ tdlr...sorry needed to vent. can't sleep, restless thoughts and dunno how to help myself anymore

online, just a phase
a phase of over a decade, on this one game
a game i engage, a game thats safe
a game that's been there throughout the pain
i was 9 when i found you
and 22 i am still there
what will happen when your pixels fade and there is no game
did i waste 16k hours for nothing
or did i cherish every fucking moment
i am lost and i am broken
i am woken
4 years unemployed
my dog dead
my mother being beated by you daddy
losing friends
moving home
quitting school
new school
college
new phase
being 14 
feeling timeless
boom 16
18
19 creeping up
let's find a job; oh no i cannot.
apply, apply apply 4000 times
job does not come, i am numb i am numb
throughout you are here and i still play you
lost in my mind
to sanctuary of music and a numb gaming mind.
2014
volunteering
xmas
spit's in face
paranoia
15 may 15
opportunity comes
chance in a life time
8k apply and i get the job
2 months in and i crack up
i still go but my mind is all over the shot
so much fear in my head
wanting to be alive but i think back to the times i was living on 57 a week to survive
and now i earn so much i dont know what to do with it
wildfire
cutting fibres
breaking all my loose ends
i just want to be a success
but i am stuck in jersey dreams
on the same game
talking to a jersey king
not real but in my head
i can pretend and he is there
i love him
but as time vanishes
i do just slumber in my head
as i am lost.

<TEXT> childless, timid and lost.
could i face another day of torture.
i long to let go from your clutches, years have passed but you linger
all day, everyday, in my head
in the dark
at night when i slumber,
in the forest of my nightmares
walking with me in my dreams, but you are not here now.
you're still on this plane but you're battered and bruised.
and now the tides have turned and i am empowered,
but i remember the agony and i am a lost little girl.
where are you daddy? i would like to know now.
not the daddy i remember, but the daddy that doesn't exist
the one that comes to rescue mother and me, and take us to sanctuary
not belittle us with your manipulation games,
except now i'm the warrior
i work 50 hours a week and what do you do?
disengage with your fellows at your local
wishing it'de come back
do you not realise i remember the pain
do you not understand i wanted a friend
without your role, i have no bounds
im on my own, tormented by you
i wish you forgiveness and love on your way
but even though you're retired
that lost little girl still wants to play
princess and have games
but you prod and poke and torment me
tell me off
dad im 22 now, please wake up
i know you'll never change but i'm half a female
i want all of your love 
you want all of my misery
please let go and one day see
that i could be someone,
not a empty threat
why did it take till 22
to wake up and see through you
that i could be the brave one
and go beyond your expectations
how is a dad meant to be dad when he's a bully?
one day i'll let go
one day.

long before the isolation set itself;before she acknowledged the reality
of her situation
long before the architecture of the cynical lies set in?
would she no longer hold herself onto the mannequin of self doubt?
and find carefree space between her soul?
or would it all had been a facade all along, transporting herself along the road, walking to a lighthouse
to seek herself when no answer would come?

many days are lost in my emotions, i've always wanted more then i deserved because of you.

why did you hurt my heart so badly, i wish you nothing but love.
it's for the best they said, move on they said.

i long to come undone and someone change my pattern, where do i  go from here when i have been searching for years. now i understand i am on my own and no man yearns for the things i crave. i seek understanding but they see lust in other women.
i seek formation of forgiveness, yet i no longer know how to forgive.

will my butterfly whispers save my darkness
and will i become the woman i set myself to be in past's decay?
or will i become lost in ancient wounds from enemies deploy
and fall into gloomy shadows of despair

please help me from those haunted woods
let the rain fall and become a echo of a land that sets me free
and let the pain from my fallen take me home where they are ok
and i understand that they will be looked after
heaven or not
hell or not
ashes or not
despair or not
let the silence of the last noise and breaths they take and be remembered for be not in vain; i miss you so much and you're always in my memory

even yesterday for another that this world never catered for
i hope you will rest, in whatever slumber of non pain,
rest for i do not know how to care for the left behind
as i am in my own suffering.

<TEXT> tickety tock
hours lost
weeping sorrows down
frowning today
wishing away
years of childhood.
conker games
pokemon friends
innocent pretends
smiles and imagination
now todays a new phase
and i don't know where it leads
but i am vicious with the stray est of withered ends
i have wasted time
and these hours are mine
but i still have no idea where it leads
i wonder if it's worth it
that i will surrender my curses
and fall beneath the willows with old friends
give me a summer night
for i am lonely and undecided
and time isn't my friend these nights.
anxiety is my foe, but i am rustled with woes
maybe today joy will come
for i do not want
to be seventy-one
and say my life was a sore one.
please say you will come
to save me once again
to be my friend and suggest that i'm ok not ill in the head.
new horizons not mine,
barriers undefined,
just want someone to hold my hand. </TEXT>

<TITLE> exhausted but i feel guilty to deserve it. </TITLE>

<TEXT> i was unemployed since i was 18 and i was until may. 

May decided to be a month that would change my life in many ways.

i recently turned 22 and what happened in may was quite astonishing to say the least.

firstly though i want to explain my mindset which leads me to why i am so exhausted. when you are unemployed and young, you assume opportunities are going to come within 6 months. but they don't come and assume well, it's not going to happen yet, so you do what you can and live on 57 a week. you do this for 5 months and you see no difference, eventually it wears you down except you cannot escape the fortnightly signing on's to survive.

so you try to approach it differently, you wake up in the same pattern but time slugs on mournfully like a forgotten dream. sundays..mondays, wednesdays, saturdays on and on and on. without direction patterns fluctuate except the very same building to sign on to. only it gets worse as your peers start assessing the situation and assuming, well surely i'm choosing to be unemployed. i'm choosing to apply for 32 jobs a week apparently. xmas comes and you feel great the first year, thinking a new start, a new me...except by march you feel disillusioned and put on the shelf, it's as if you have a stop sign in front of you and that stop sign halts your pathway, you however have to continue living with this stop sign, so instead you compare yourself to other people, try to keep a mindset whilst surviving, but after four years it really isn't ticking the way it did on the first 3 months, by this point i was almost having a nervous meltdown every week, i had anxiety each and every day and oh, haha...i still do. 

but yes anyways

May 2015.

i'm signing on as usual. my jobsearch helper introduces me to a government job opportunity. except it isn't any opportunity, only there are 200 places and it requires a 250 word statement as a starter to even progress to the second round.

and i puit my heart on that form, i explained quite thoroughly what my situation was, not remaining negative but being honest. so honest in fact that they must have loved it because i got accepted.

only now my issue is i work fulltime but i have anxiety, anxiety of the after effects of being unemployed for 4 years and i feel very small. i had my first paycheck, my first proper one. and i feel guilty, i don't know why i feel guilty, but i feel guilty for earning a wage which doesn't feel right but i do feel this way. 

i have made friends at work. but i am so lonely. i feel like a coward and want to hide from this opportunity, but i know i must face it as there is no going back at this point. so i will succeed or get fired. i just wish i could be brave to not panic at weekends, as the little spare time i do get i am thinking about work, and not thinking this is me at home, i do not need to worry about the past. 

it's a sunday afternoon and i need to rant. as i do not want to have panic attacks in front of colleagues, but i feel so behind wheras they have all travelled the world and been in similar roles, wheras for me i  have not.   so yes i shall pity party and i don't know what i will do when this opportunity ends as it's only 2 years, i just hope i will manage.... </TEXT>

<TEXT> i was unemployed for a long-time, this opportunity obviously has changed my life but I'm not entirely sure what to do with it. necessities like rent, food and work clothes are a priority but i will still have a remainder, my mam raised me not to participate in getting debts so i have none to pay off. but I'm afraid of spending it all at once also. if anyone can understand where I'm coming from please help. 

although i would like to aim towards a holiday as i only have had one last year and that was the last one I've had in seven years.

edit; if it helps i will be earning 18k a year/ monthly payday </TEXT>

<TEXT> where to start. do i start with a number? an age to prove some subtle point that i'm existing in said year and have breathed x amount of times? i don't know.

do i say i'm an atheist to expect logical answers and no calling for "prayer". or do i say i want to sit at park benches. but when i do i feel that was pointless as it's still the same road I've looked at since 14 from moving house and nothing changes.

do i say i believe i'm bipolar and i hate mondays. lol

hi. i'm Amanda. i'm 21. it's dull but complicated. complex yet simple.
i'm lost in the world. i live with my parents, i have addictions. I've wasted my education into the ground. i'm unemployed and live on the state money to survive. it's been like that since 18. i don't see a light at the end right now, suffice to say i can only blame myself.  

i just want to admit in the space of darkness, hi world. i'm a coward to you all. you all come and go, have your road trips, adventures, someone to sleep with at night, and i envy you most, i envy courage and i envy the fighters. the ones that haven't lost their way.

i fear myself, fear the day i realize it's too late and i can't move my legs to get out of bed anymore. realize that my time is up. but i can say all this shit and where does it take me? a dodgy grammar trip to mud without focus. i'm scared. i'm tired. and I've had enough.



you ever look at somebody and think it must be so easy to be you? yeah well it isn't like that for me. for me i see people and think, are they staring at me? why are you whispering about me. are you annoyed? are you happy with life? i see a guy with a girl and their youth of love. 

i wasted my spare time and honestly don't know how to be self sufficient. i'm afraid of my folks dying, cause then i'll be alone. alone to admit i did nothing, and these people gave me love, gave me a home, but it didn't stop my imagination. that isolated feeling of numb. to not want to face my demons. 

i'm just confused without action. salt without a wound except a breakdown of unknown endings. where will i be..i just want to find peace. </TEXT>

<TITLE> sometimes i wonder, if say for a week someone else was switched with my body/my thoughts/who i am as person and see how they would react to living/ see their viewpoint of hope/depression etc. </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT>  i wonder if they would accomplish if anything at all. or make a fool to destruction because it's alien. it's not THEIR personal self. especially how they would react to criticism, adjusting to new "family/friends/memories". i suppose the big one for me would be how they would react to depression, to hope, the little things. the frustration, would they change as a person afterwards from the experience?  that kinda thing.  </TEXT>
