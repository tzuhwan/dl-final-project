<TEXT> Yeah well like I said I've seen other examples of the cold being a factor that seems to affect this and there's lots of other evidence of *general* competitive gaming being disproportionately popular in SK, but I think you're right that demographics also play a role in Saskatchewan, as I *think* we have a fairly high 20 population, as well as a very high aboriginal population, who in my wealth of experience are very into video gaming culture. It's also possible that a high average wage allows for this, though that might be confirmation bias as you could argue that you should expect lower wage places to see more gaming since gaming is cheaper than organized sports, but at the same time more expensive than going outside and playing catch. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes I agree, I'm not arguing with you that there has been a change in culture.

But the topic article of this thread is among a HEAP of evidence showing that that change in culture has affected Saskatchewan far more than other places, and so there MUST be some other compounding factor that makes Saskatchewan more susceptible to the change in culture than other places.

You can argue that that factor isn't the weather, but you cannot argue that Saskatchewan is not disproportionately affected by this change in culture.

Noone is arguing with you that gaming and staying inside are trends on the rise, we're talking about why that seems to be hitting Saskatchewan harder than other places. Because that is the topic of the original article in this thread. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You aren't wrong, but it seems you're missing the point of what we are saying. He's not justifying why video games in general are big right now, but why they might be bigger in Saskatchewan than other parts of Canada. Video games are certainly overall popular because it's easier and easier to stay inside and play but that phenomenon exists everywhere, and we're simply saying the added incentive of the cold might make kids in SK stay inside more than BC. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That is perhaps the worst fucking possible example of people hating change just for change. That place is entirely unique, and a such a hilarious landmark of Weyburn to the point that many people I've met who have never been to Saskatchewan basically only knew that buffet, and maybe one or two other things, about our province. Call us fat or slovenly for wanting to keep the *single* KFC buffet in a *single* small city, but not close-minded, as there are plenty of valid reasons someone might want to keep that, and its not even a change that would affect most people, as most SK KFC consumers are perfectly happy with the regular KFC they use most often.

I don't even disagree with you on the fact Sask is more close-minded then other places, and there are certainly plenty of people here I would describe that way. But when you hold an opinion and then someone [disagrees with it](https://xx.reddit.com/r/regina/comments/c8src1/love_the_new_gainer/espgfaw/) and you [immediately call them close-minded](https://xx.reddit.com/r/regina/comments/c8src1/love_the_new_gainer/espgkfy/) as if a FUCKING COSTUME AESTHETIC isn't the most subjective disagreement on earth, yeah that's pretty contrarian behaviour. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, because pro controllers and joycons use Bluetooth, you can press the sync button, and then open up Bluetooth connections on your phone (android only) and then sync to the controller. Now the controller is desynced from the console and you can then desync it from the phone on the phone's end and it will be disconnected from everything.

This is a great way to desync controllers because you can leave the setup and then desync them, but desyncing them from the setup side is totally okay as well.

<TEXT> there are additional pauses that are added in for broadcast ads, they are LITERALLY called TV timeouts. Its impossible to compare modern games to games pre-TV but you can tell these exist by comparing the breaks in High-Profile games where the NFL or CFL can safely run lots of ads vs Less Prolific games where the breaks decrease. </TEXT>

Your submission was removed for breaking [**rule 2d**](/r/smashbros/wiki/rules).
Simple posts asking for different characters to be added to Smash are not allowed. Threads related to the possible inclusion of a character fall under this rule as well, even if the post does not explicitly request the character. However, full moveset concepts for characters and Smash-related art promoting the inclusion of non-Smash characters are allowed.

If this post didn't break any other rules, consider posting it in the [Daily Discussion Thread](/r/smashbros/search?q=Daily+Discussion+Thread+author%3AAutoModerator restrict_sr=on sort=new t=all) or a [Discord](/r/smashbros/wiki/chatrooms) instead.

<TEXT> O, if you have PM I'd honestly suggest playing on that. It's not just a mod to make brawl more competitive and skillful but actually just makes the game feel so much smoother, plus the roster is great. And it's a smash game any casual will likely not have played before, so it'll be new and interesting, and can often trigger an interest in the scene.

Then when it comes to playing with them it all comes down to their expectations, from what I can gauge it seems like they just wanna play. In which case you should just chillout and play FFAs with them, items on as you desire, time mode (because it's just BETTER for FFAs), teams on/off as you wish. If at any point they start to get antsy for a little competition, THEN you can maybe play some sort of tournament to see who's the best. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Smashville is considered the most balanced stage in Smash 4 because the blast zones are relatively average compared with the rest of the legal stages. The moving platform slightly benefits characters for many reasons. The existence of the platform and its mobility benefits characters that can extend combos on platforms, characters with high mobility that can take advantage of movement on platforms, characters that can shark platforms easily and characters that benefit from a slower paced game. However the relative lack of platforms benefits character that have from strong stage control and characters that need to play a higher paced game where running to platforms hurts them. And none of these categories seem to receive too much benefit (except maybe the high mobility ones). It's the most picked stage for a reason, and I'm sure I'm missing plenty of them. </TEXT>

For setups we appreciate whatever you can bring, if Mike's offering a discount for a setup this time round (which I think he is), you need a full setup (TV and Console) to be eligible

The melee ruleset should be on the page, but if it isn't just go to https://bit.ly/sasksmashrules. And as for bracket progression it's RR Pools into double elimination bracket. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I deadass swear to god thought I saw the same kinda image you posted before your post but now I can't find it anymore so whoever posted it must've deleted it or it got removed in conjunction with your post by two different mods thinking the other one would stay as sometimes happens or I'm fucking on some shit but regardless I think the post by itself is fine so go ahead and repost if you want

(Also I'd recommend including something like "graphic" or "visual" to add to your title to distinguish it from other stage discussion threads) </TEXT>

<TITLE> State of the Sub - /r/smashbros Ultimate Edition - New Rules   More! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2018-06-19 20:00:00 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> #State of the Sub - /r/smashbros Ultimate Edition
##\#1: [New Rules!](http://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/wiki/rules)

Our rules have been reworded, and changed a little bit. There's been a massive influx of users and this has certainly caused myself and other moderators to look over some of our rules and realize their current version is very dated, and quite lacking. I won't bore you further, here's a TL;DR of the actual *changes* and explanations:

-Removed the "No tournament spoilers in the title rule" because it's useless (this follows a similar decision from /r/leagueoflegends). If you don't want spoilers don't go on Reddit or filter out spoiler posts from your front page)  
-Added a rule explicitly banning posts about things that happen to vaguely look like the smash ball  
-Added a rule explicitly banning posts asking for non-smash characters to be added to smash because there are **SO MANY** of these posts, and to be honest, they aren't doing anything productive and most of them are reposts. They're perfect material for the daily discussion thread instead.  
-We *are* however adding guidelines for how we'd like tournament threads to be posted. Because there are 800000 matches at every tournament we can't do a tournament-thread-team thing like other competitive subs, but hopefully these formats will help everyone make nice beautiful posts. We are aware tourney-tabler is outdated and will definitely be working on getting that updated for Ultimate's release.  

But overall, again, the biggest change is just the wording and organisation. Consider reading them all [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/wiki/rules)

---

##\#2: New Flairs!

A few of our mods have been working very hard to get the smash ultimate flairs available for all of you guys, but unfortunately it's gonna require completely redoing our flair system which is gonna take awhile. So be on the look out for that new flairing system which I've heard is going to be better than ever!

---

##\#3: Smash Ultimate and our future

Alright listen up everybody. There's a big problem a lot of people seem to have with this sub right now that has always existed but is probably worse than ever. The problem is that there are two sorts of people who visit this sub, basically competitive and casual. The casual fans are larger in number, but they come and go. This divide is stronger and harder to deal with than almost any other video game because of quite a few reasons, and it makes the problem hard to solve. In the end we have to have rules that are stricter to both sides than other subs and that also makes a lot of people mad. We try to design our rules in order to balance the sub properly between these two communities and are constantly trying to improve on that balance, but both sides need to understand that there is another 50% of the community trying to use this sub as well.

In the past week, any competitive players (as I know by the constant DMs I get from my competitive friends) will see the sub as having gotten out of control in favour of the casuals. But I can tell you based on the number of hate messages /u/DosRogers has gotten that casuals instead feel that our sub is far too strict. 

Is there a solution to this divide? Well, people CONSTANTLY suggest to us a second more casual or more competitive sub. There *do* already exist more competitive focused subs for /r/ssbpm and /r/ssbm, and these subs are AMAZINGLY well run honestly. But people still continue to come here, because many people, especially tournament viewers, are fans of the entire franchise not just one game. As for starting a casual sub and making /r/smashbros super competitive oriented, this NEVER works. It's been tried in the past, and in theory sounds great! But the problem is that once the new game hype dies off, there is just NO content to be had on such a sub, so the sub becomes relatively inactive and then when new hype comes around again, people would rather go to the sub that actually has people on it. So if there's a solution to this, we haven't figured it out or heard it, but if you think there's a way to design the sub better around this divide. The one thing we're trying to do atm is revive the daily discussion thread a little bit, and direct a lot of traffic to there and maybe start back up some those good ol' other weekly discussion threads.

So **TL;DR**: The two communities need to learn to love each other until we find a solution that actually works, and we *are* open to suggestions, but not hopeful. The casuals need to learn to love the competitive people that keep the game/sub alive all year round, and competitive people need to understand new game hype and that for most people there is nothing more exciting to talk about than the new game.

---

All of that being said, now that a week of hype and CONSTANT posting has passed, we're going to move forward with these new rules and try to be more strict on many of the things we've previously been fine with. Please take this opportunity to give your feedback on the new rules, and tell us how you think we're doing implementing rules and dealing with the influx of users, and how'd you like to see us improve in the coming months towards the release of Ultimate </TEXT>

<TEXT> Splatoon finals are at 4PM EST, 1PM PST, and the direct is at 12PM EST, 9AM PST. I don't know where you got 11 from because that is neither correct nor what I said anywhere.

Smash will likely start anywhere between 5 and 6 EST </TEXT>

<TEXT> Aww man when I was in school I don't think there's a moment I'll ever remember more than when we were playing Melee in a hotel room on a band trip and another school's band teacher who was chaperoning comes into the room, asks us what we're doing, grabs a controller and fucks us all with Falcon. Apparently he was ranked in our city at the time, and we were all Smash 4 noobs who just brought a Wii because it was easier than bringing the Wii U. There was also the time our Math sub came over to us after school and played 3ds friendlies with us and even came to a tournament later that month.

So s/o to you my man, it might seem silly or weird for you but this stuff is so awesome.

<TEXT> That's still not second person, that's third person. In the case of smash that refers to the camera POV, which can be only either be first or third person.

Second person is only really used to refer to a writing style where the author speaks through the reader's point of view. (first person writes through the speaker's pov, 3rd person some other party, godly or otherwise)

If you're talking about the "writing" or w/e of smash, then you can kinda make the argument every single game ever is "written" in second person because the reader is the one through which the lens of the story is told in some way, but also make the argument that the reader *becoming* the third party or the main character means that it is either first or third party respectively. But basically none of this really applies to video games correctly and should not be taken that way.

But the only way you could really say a game is in second person pov is if the game was based on an altered reality mirror or if you were attacking yourself. (???)

BTW I'm not an English expert in any way so I'm probably mis-explaining things and misinformed on others but yeah. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's probably a rule leftover from the FGC rulesets because I'm pretty sure in most games there you aren't allowed to switch characters until you lose, so the rule is essentially saying picking "Random" is picking the character "Random" and you may not stay the character that Random gave you but instead must stay "Random". </TEXT>

<TEXT> I too would rather listen to dudes with experience, but the opinions here get passed around regardless of who is spouting them, and so it's an issue I believe deserves addressing. From my own experience, even if a lot of members of my scene seldom post here, they read it, and they always make wisecracks at me about my seeing posts (my one smash friend literally saw me in the hallway today and asked me about it). And you are definitely right about the fact that sometimes actual evidence still gets buried on reddit, especially when it can form its mind quickly and it is way too hard for tippety top people to browse as frequently as a combination of every average redditor.

That being said I do think that even a little bit of regular use from more knowledgeable people can slowly help to change how that works. A combination of that and the ideas in reddit's head about respecting those top people's opinions, hopefully caused by seeing them more often, could lead to better discussions. It might not be true but it's my hope. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I definitely think it's possible to get most relevant or important things without reading reddit through twitter, youtube and word of mouth, and if you just want to consume the majority of content passively, I would suggest you subscribe, look at your front page and don't read the comments.

But when you say "reddit is an important source of community input" that's really what I'm getting at with the initial post. If you value that input at all I think it's important that you do your best to improve the conversation. If instead you believe reddit's input is as bad as some people claim, I don't know why you read it in the first place. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes thank you GIMR, you are definitely an amazing user. I actually totally understand the idea of hating on reddit in general, I think it is fair to consider it an inferior platform, and even jab on it in general if you believe that way.

What i'm really getting at is that giving it attention on twitter if you hate it and creating animosity in the community just doesn't lead anywhere good. If you are someone who gets tilted by reddit super duper hard, try your very best to just avoid it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, thank you for this reply. This is certainly the one big problem with reddit, is that being active to a post is more important than being credible. Obviously I want those credible sources to rise to the top, but ultimately that doesn't happen. I still think reddit is one of the best platforms for discussion though because flaws exist everywhere.

That being said I don't want to herald reddit as the be all and end-all of discussion, that's not the point of the post, it is certainly not perfect. The main point I have though is that if someone important is not using reddit because they believe it to be inherently flawed, I don't understand why they *are* using reddit. It is **of course** true that meme opinions and whatnot are more likely to rise to the top than a credible post, but if you dislike that, like I mention in the post, do your mental health a favour and stop reading. But continuing to read it and posting about it elsewhere is only a negative to the community. </TEXT>

<TEXT> tl;dr at the bottom

**DISCLAIMER** (that you can skip): Let me open this by saying that IDGAF about bayonetta, I mostly stopped caring about Sm4sh a few months ago when school started and I *finally* gave up hope of ever having the one character I ever loved re-legalized. So I don't have a side in this debate, but I still follow shit on reddit/watch the big tournaments/talk with my smash friends on discord. That's not what this is about. Also, I'm a mod but this isn't a messsage from the mod team, just a personal issue I'm having as an active user, though I know I'm not the only one tired of this. Finally I use many examples or w/e from Sm4sh in this post, but it isn't exclusive to Sm4sh, that's just the most recent example of this bullshit.

---

**How did this post come about?**  
Now, I want to make this post because I think a lot of top player's views on this community are frankly backwards, misguided and unjust, and I want to make a post that explains my feelings on that attitude along with a proposition to those top players.

**Why is /r/smashbros important?**  
Well, like it or not /r/smashbros is one of very few sites that host the fairly large smash community. There's essentially Reddit (250k subs for this and many more for the PM and SSBM subs), local facebook groups (in my experience mostly used for announcing/planning things, less so for discussion with the rise of discord), local scene/character discords (not likely used as much by top players in my experience), smashboards(...), twitch (not an open discussion platform in the slightest unless you're doing a real ass discussion panel) and twitter. Twitter is certainly the one most similar to reddit and also the one used by most people, and used the most by top players/personalities. The point is, when you shit smashreddit, you are shitting a huge portion of the smash fanbase. And I wish instead you would work **with** us.

**But first to the average redditor** I also want to say to you redditors to not do the same shit. Don't take tweets and come on here to complain about them. Go on twitter. When one platform looks at another, pulls the arguments *they* want to discuss and then talk about those arguments amongst themselves, that isn't healthy, that just encourages more groupthink. I've seen some of you being awesome like /u/Big4Lil on that rushhoursmash stream, but posts like [these](https://xx.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/7xa8ix/bayonetta_and_characters_as_functions/) or [even these kind of](https://xx.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/7xa4q7/smash_twitter_in_a_nutshell/) piss me off.

**Well what could I do**
Well, in a perfect world we have discussion in real life in a great open lively debate every week at a smash bros town meeting. But that doesn't exist. I think it's clear I'd like you to stop with the shitting on us but I think the biggest thing you could do, is actually consider using this platform and let me tell you why in 3 simple reasons:

1) **Expand your brand**
Lots of you folks trynna make a living off smash? Grow your stream? Get sponsored? There are A LOT of jims over here at /r/smashbros that read this thing every fucking day. When hungrybox first started growing his brand he commented on here a lot, and still does but not as much, and in turn got a lot of supporters here and suddenly there were more hbox twitch clips on the frontpage than even mang0. It really does help just as much as if not more than twitter since you are continually making your existence known to everyone, not just your followers. And I don't mean just make an account and start posting your stream whenever it's up, that's not the best way, I mean start commenting like a regular ass user, which brings me to my second point...

2) **Tell us we're wrong**
This one's easily the most important. Have a problem with something someone says on reddit? Fucking reply. Don't tweet about it, because guess what? They probably don't see that if they're just "some random reddit jim". If you genuinely care about people being misinformed, genuinely want the community to change their mind or to continue to love the game, use your superior top player knowledge of the game and community to tell us why we may have misconceptions about it. If you think you're gonna get downvoted, trust me, you probably won't because people respect your opinon/are jims for you here. The Mr. R tweet calling out that anti-bayo post got hundreds of upvotes. Some commenters disagreed or w/e but people wanted to hear what you had to say. If you don't think it's important for the community to stay informed you're just wrong. If people see shit (or SAY shit) like "bayonetta is broken fuck sm4sh" on reddit and noone is there to tell them they might be wrong, they're gonna believe that, and maybe stop watching/playing sm4sh.

3) **We're *just* as bad as any other platform you already use**
Like I said earlier, reddit one of few platforms smashers use for discussion, but there isn't anything *incredibly* inherently wrong with it compared to others, except maybe the absence of top players calling out the bullshit, despite the fact they read it. If you don't want to use reddit because our opinions are bad or you might get flamed, well lemme tell you, I **READ** twitter, I see the toxicity and bad opinons there too (hell I **KNOW** people who are blocked by half the people to whom I'm directing this post). Reddit is no better, but no worse. You might get called a bad name or some shit, but you get called those on twitter too, and at least on reddit there are moderators to remove the absolutely awful shit. But if you can't get over the problems with reddit, the attention that it seems to give trolls, well, just give it a break then eh?

---

**TL;DR:**
/r/smashbros is a part of the smash community thats *probably* here to stay whether you like it or not because a lot of people like or already regularly use the platform. It's a decent and rare public platform for discussion that's main problems are either not exclusive to it or can be fixed, mostly by you. If you actually give a shit about changing people's minds about anything, about keeping your game's community alive and well, man up and make an account. Or, and this is perfectly reasonable as well, just stop reading reddit. Because if you really don't like what's going on here continuing to lurk isn't going to help your mental health. Other esports pros are often times blocked from reading their respective reddits for good reason lmao.

DM me on here, discord, facebook, twitter w/e if you have any questions about reddit, or wanna discuss/argue anything or clear something up. Or better yet, comment on this post. *Or* you could tweet/stream about how I don't understand your perspective on this and I will continue to not understand and instead resent you because I probably don't follow you on twitter/twitch.

<TEXT> [Upcoming Events curated by our mods](https://xx.reddit.com//r/smashbros/wiki/events) (there *are* upcoming events if you click into the wiki through the sidebar or on the link I just put there)

[Liquipedia](http://liquipedia.net/smash/Portal:Tournaments) is a good place to check if you ONLY want to see majors.

[MIOM's When's Melee Articles](http://www.meleeitonme.com/) are good if you want to see ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING melee happening every weekend.

But overall nothing super big until march when there's the Arcadian and Full Bloom 4. Other than that there's an upcoming [Arizona regional](https://smash.gg/tournament/esports-arizona-talking-stick-resort-2) and a fairly big [Swedish Tourney](https://smash.gg/tournament/phoenix-blue-smash-championship) </TEXT>

<TEXT> That doesn't change anything, Ken Mkleo Choco and Aba are the only seeds that Smashgg shows for sure because of their predicted placements, after that there are a bunch of ties so we have to find seeds based on winners matches with the known seeds (ie 5th seed would play Aba etc). Freezie put all the right matches but has messed up the order of some of the ties later on. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wait... either something's wrong or I'm crazy. If MKleo is 2nd seed he should play the 31st seed, Shogun (according to you) in Winners 32, but he doesn't. Because when we reference seeding, that typically (and also does according to smashgg, the website these brackets are on) is defined by people's projected paths in winner's bracket, and has nothing to do with their loser's path. So I'm pretty sure a lot of this is wrong...

While S4 viewership has likely dropped in the last couple years, comparing G5 with G4 is comparing 2 very different tournaments that are just at the same time of the year. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The biggest reason most would prefer it is likely that it's wired, meaning a lack of latency and just overall less hassle. It's impossible to say what controller is arbitrarily the best, and so people use whatever they are comfortable with, but those two reasons plus the fact that it has been a constant controller for smash since melee are why it's the most popular. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Super Smash Bros. Melee is the best game ever made in generations

I was going through a lot of stuff as an engineer. My popoffs were small and I just didn't have any interest in doing stuff. I skipped work often and barely went to meetings. And not to mention this asshole named Plank who owned me some money and slept with my girlfriend. That son of a bitch.

So anyways I quit my job because I wasn't showing up most of the time and my boss just did not care. So I spent my days dwelling away on my stream in the deep cycles of for glory.

I would just go and play videogames by myself, being totally antisocial. I had a wii u and I often played Smash 4 and other games. However, none of these made me interested really. Then, one day that all changed.

I was bored so I was going through the coolrom directory when I come across this game called "SUPER SMASH BROTHERS MELEE" I never heard of the gamecube console before but the concept looked interesting to me. I decided to purchase the game and immideatly I was fuckign hooked/

The game is fucking amazing jigglypuff is so unique and different and theres so many different foxes its amazing. I never play friendlies most of the time against other people and this helps me improve my skills. WHAT AN AWESOME GAME.

It really helped with my mood and I decided that if I wanted to start going to tournaments for smash bros I would have to clean up my act and start going to work again. So now I make $$$ off smash and everything is amazing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah it seems to try and compensate for not being able to take 20% CDR in runes anymore, making alot of kayles opt for lucidity boots. Basically this is telling us to take berserkers instead and nerfing the extra damage we would've gotten for not having to buy lucidity. Whether or not that'll be how it works out is yet to be decided. </TEXT>

Also these posts are practically all the exposure a majority of smash communities get so it's good to let them have that every so often. </TEXT>

For instance when we posted our local PR two people commented saying they didn't know we had a scene, but lived here and were gonna check out our locals, plus the artist got a ton of positive feedback that encouraged him to keep up the good work. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I understand why they did it for this generation though becasue 1. it was Smash 4 so the "for" just kinda worked and 2. The same game was on two consoles so the versions could be differentiated by, well their only difference, the console itself. However the two versions could be united by still being "Smash 4". </TEXT>

Also speaking of my own region I think it might be more appropriate to call us "[Prairie Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Prairies)" since you're (assuredly fairly) not including BC and including MB. (but that might all be my opinion)

<TEXT> i understood your criticism, it was just wrong

And that goes RIGHT back to my original critisism of you making positive statements without explaining yourself. Unless of course your explanation was "nope that's not why", in which case, that is not a response to my criticism, that's just repeating your point of view in the debate. I asked you to address my original criticisms that explain why your tone is highly condescending, and you answered by saying "you wrong tho!". 

my first comment did not contain ANY inflammatory language

I know all this. If it did contain that, it would be removed, I already said "you not doing anything explicitly 'wrong'." I am simply trying to argue with your point that people are downvoting you because of your name, and addressing that by my criticism. You can't just say "people downvote me because of my name" and be more right because you keep repeating it, especially after I pointed out examples that are clearly to the contrary. I've seen your comments before, I've seen them get heavily downvoted, and in my opinion it is because of the way you write which I very clearly previously explained. You even said yourself that you think it is because of the way you wrote in the *past*, which again in my opinion hasn't changed all that much. 

the fact of the matter is OTHER PEOPLE took it as arrogant or condescending.

OHHH So you admit your tone is the reason people downvote you, not your history. Now, you can say it's only "other people" taking it as arrogant and condescending, but when it's a consistent trend it prolly means the tone of your text *IS* arrogant and condescending. That is the point in tone in text afterall, to communicate to the people reading what your attitude is by your diction and syntax. </TEXT>

<TEXT> See here's your problem dude, I criticized you a lot in that comment, and instead of taking any criticism or talking about any of that, you took the two statements I made at the start as to why your comments aren't *especially* agregious or rule-breaking and talked about those. And you didn't even mention the fact that I even slightly questioned one of the things you said, you just took "I mean you're right about everything" with no context. I explain plenty why you got downvoted, which has nothing to do with you not doing anything explicitly "wrong".

Then you end by blaming people downvoting you, "based on my previous tones and comments" when I very clearly explain why you were getting downvoted for your **current** tones and comments. There is clearly not some massive vendetta against you man, your helpful and nicely written comments today ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/7kbl6m/final_destination_and_battlefield_will_be_legal/drdok3h/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/7kbl6m/final_destination_and_battlefield_will_be_legal/drdrlkc/)) don't get downvoted, because they're good comments.

And why does it matter if it's just a friend? That has nothing to do with the point I'm trying to make, which is that the overall sentiment of that last statement shows your condescending attitude towards everyone else, and is likely the reason you got some downvotes. You could have been pinging fucking /u/MetaCavern69 and it would have had the same effect. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Umm, I mean you're right about everything (save maybe the Metal Cavern thing) and you aren't openly insulting people, but I'm guessing people downvote you/think you're an asshole because of the way you write. It sounds stupid but when you can make up your own inflection for people (as is true on the internet), it happens.

Like, your very first comment is very short and succinct, with no further explanation of any points you amke, and you write as if everything you say is the god given truth that cannot be questioned. "FD would have been banned a long time ago", here you make a factual statement instead of a normative one on something that is definitely an opinion and that prolly makes it seem like you are a know-it-all. Plus you don't even go into detail about why that statement might be true, which to most people would probably not be obvious.

Then "there is no such stage as 'Meta Crystal,'", instead of answering his query on this one you just point out a silly mistake without applying it to his comment at all, even though I'm sure you're aware what stage he meant. 

Then you end your comment by publicly pinging a well known 64 player, whilst also implying that you think the comment above yours is funny, most likely assumed to be because it's stupid/uninformed, when it was basically just some guy wondering/asking a question, not even making any outright statements you disagree with like "modded FD should be legal". Plus if you're gonna send a friend funny shit from dumbois on reddit like me who don't know anything about 64, do it through DMs, otherwise you're just asking for downvotes. </TEXT>

QA cancels too practical imo. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Please vote ARMS into Smash Summit 4 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-25 04:56:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Alright so now that the candidates are announced I just want everyone to know why I think ARMS deserves to be in Smash Summit 4:

1. ARMS is relatively new and has been on the comeup as of late. Really noone payed attention to ARMS until the last couple of weeks but already ARMS has made waves and qualified for voting. Just imagine what ARMS could do with the exposure from Summit

2. ARMS has a great personality and is quite known for their hilarious memes and wacky personality

3. ARMS has a playstyle like no others. HAVE YOU SEEN ARMS' GAMEPLAY FOOTAGE. They're crazy, wacky and yet still this successful, I wish we could see more unconventional play out there like this.

Pls vote now on [https://smash.gg/](https://www.generosity.com/fundraising/evo-2017-player-vote-arms) remember that just like last time you can buy your way to victory </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hype! Hopefully this shows their commitment to Smash 4 being run better than last year as well as a reconciliation for last year and acknowledgement that we're important as 2nd biggest game in terms of attendance

Melee isn't tho????????????????????
---

This does unfortunately mean that melee isn't, which is certainly a strange decision considering their viewership is higher than everything but SFV and they are a far more accepted game in the FGC but I guess we taking turns now? The fact that Blazblue and potentially ARMS will be on Sunday over Melee is kinda fucked

Also Joey was talking a lot about diversity in Top 8s and seemed really excited about that so that might be part of his reason </TEXT>

E: Lol people complaining about these like wtf did you expect from 1 round of pools with 4 people making it out of each pool. Just because you don't know names doesn't mean its not an upset. Most of the talent at this tourney is local or relatively unknown (hazmatt was a first seed and he's #10 on the NE PR). Imagine your local #10 losing in first round of pools at a local monthly. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Removing text from an intro sequence </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-07-08 04:18:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was wondering how to, if at all possible, one might go about removing floating text from a video like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4z16n-3eU ab_channel=LittleHouse). I want to change a lot of the text for a gif and have no idea where to even start with changing it other than completely covering up the old text. Is there any way to do this in Ae? I'm still learning Ae but I'm pretty confident using it so far. </TEXT>

<TITLE> What's your guys' ZeRo number? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-06-28 22:45:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In melee people often talk about an [Armada number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number), because he's so good and rarely gets upset, which is how many tournament wins you are away from beating Armada. For instance n0ne beat M2K who beat Armada, so n0ne's Armada number is 2. Well since ZeRo has been at the top of Sm4sh for awhile now, and now that he's lost a few times so it's actually realistic, I thought it'd be fun to figure out your ZeRo number! I'll start.

So my ZeRo number is 6! Have fun! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In 20XX, professional Super Smash Brothers Melee player Mew2King announces his retirement from the ESPORT to follow his doubles partner Zeros career as a Super Smash Brothers for the Wii U and 3DS player. However, it becomes evident that he is not as skilled in Super Smash Brothers for the Wii U and 3DS as he was in Super Smash Brothers Melee. M2K is assigned a publicist, the bumbling Zer0 to make his new career less bumpy. Elsewhere, in outer space, an intergalactic amusement park called VGCBootcamp faces dwindling popularity, so its owner, Mr. GIMR, sends his diminutive minions, the Nerdlucks, to capture the Low-Tier-Heroes as new entertainment. The Low-Tier-Heroes live in an animated world hidden in the centre of Battlefield, but are unable to listen to the Nerdlucks' threats and challenge them to a game of Super Smash Brothers Melee to try to win back their freedom.

However, the Nerdlucks steal the talents of Super Smash Brothers Melee players Mang0, PPMD, Leffen, Armada      and Hungrybox, leaving them incapable of playing. The Nerdlucks absorb the talent, transforming into the gigantic Monstars who easily intimidate the Low-Tier-Heroes. While playing Brawl with BobbyScar, TafoKints, and Zer0, M2K is sucked down a hole and is recruited by Axe to help the Heroes win against the Monstars. M2K agrees to help, but sends Axe and AMSA the Red Yoshi to his house to retrieve his Super Smash Brothers Melee gear. The two have a difficult time obtaining the controllers thanks to M2K's pocket fox, but his sponsors help them out.

Meanwhile, Zer0 has been digging out the ICs chaingrab to find M2K, but spots Axe and AMSA leap down another one and pursues them, reuniting with M2K in the Heroes' world and joins the Low-Tier-Heroes. Another new recruit is Kage The Warrior, a skilled Super Smash Brothers Melee player whom Axe falls in love with. The day of the match arrives, but the first half is dominated by the Monstars, leaving the Low-Tier-Heroes unconfident. Zer0 eavesdrops on a conversation between the Monstars and GIMR, learning of how they gained their talent and informs M2K. Axe and M2K convince the rest of the Low-Tier-Heroes to fight back, and the first half of the second round allows the characters to take the lead using Fox. GIMR decides he wants M2K as a new attraction, and makes an agreement with him that he will become said attraction if he loses the match, sparing the Low-Tier-Heroes.

To ensure his victory, GIMR has the Monstars play dirty and injure all of the Low-Tier-Heroes save M2K, Axe, AMSA, Kage, and Zer0. Zer0 becomes the fifth player and manages to take a stock, but is literally JV4ed by the Monstars and is removed to love nessa. The referee, Mr. Wizard, informs M2K unless the team gets a fifth player then the game is forfeit. BobbyScar appears and volunteers to be the team's fifth member. In the final seconds of the game, M2K counter picks FD and manages to use cartoon physics to extend his sword and take the last stock. Scar retires from the ESPORT, and the Monstars blast GIMR to the Moon in a rocket when they realize they don't have to take his abuse anymore. M2K convinces them to give up the stolen talents and they are welcomed to stay with the Low-Tier-Heroes.

M2K and a recovered Zer0 return to the surface, the Nerdlucks dropping them off at M2K's next TR4SH local. Later on, the two visit the incapacitated Super Smash Brothers Melee players and return their talent. The players invite M2K to a four person free-for-all match but when he declines, they question his loss of talent. In a move mirroring his actual comeback in 20GG, M2K returns to EVO to reprise his Super Smash Brothers Melee career.

<TEXT> Ya, we get it. Xpecial leaving was a big deal, but it was a tough time and an emotional thing, I'm sure he doesn't love being constantly reminded of it, I mean it never seemed like he was very happy about the leave. This last interview was like 30 seconds long and all he said was basically "If I was on TSM I would do better."

EDIT: [Link of the last interview for the interested](http://www.twitch.tv/riotgames/b/544465785?t=5h43m56s)

EDIT 2: I'm talking about the pregame, prerecorded interviews, THIS POST HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE OUTCOME OF THE GAME. </TEXT>
