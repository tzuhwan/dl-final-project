<TEXT> Are you using Spyder in the Anaconda suite? If not, I would suggest you do. Very easy to check your work. Could be how you valued/coded the threshold. Or first try adding , inplace=True after axis=1 in the line beginning with return: 

     return df.drop([col] , axis=1 , inplace=True)

 I'm not sure though. Good luck. </TEXT>

<TEXT> \#I made a fictional df to show a solution to what I think you are asking.

    import pandas as pd 
    import numpy as np
    
    df = pd.DataFrame ({'Age' : [21, 22 ,23 ,33 , 22,33],
          'TestScore': [70, 88, 55, 55,55,55],
          'TimeInHours':[1,1,1,1,1,1]})
    
    df
    Out[]: 
       Age  TestScore  TimeInHours
    0   21         70            1
    1   22         88            1
    2   23         55            1
    3   33         55            1
    4   22         55            1
    5   33         55            1

\#then I looked at the unique values for each variable with df.nunique()

    df.nunique()
    Out[]: 
    Age            4
    TestScore      3
    TimeInHours    1
    dtype: int64

\#So there are 4 unique values to show age, 3 for test score, and 1 for Time in hours

\#Now to eliminate variables that have more than 3 unique values I input the following

    for col in df.columns :
        if len(df[col].unique()) 3:
           df.drop(col,inplace=True,axis=1)

\#Output shows

    df
    Out[]: 
       TestScore  TimeInHours
    0         70            1
    1         88            1
    2         55            1
    3         55            1
    4         55            1
    5         55            1

\#As you can see the for loop dropped all the columns with more than 3 unique values--in this instance age.

\#so if you want to drop columns in your dataframe that have greater than 200 unique values you can use this as a reference to do so. I tried to make this as clear as I could but if you have any questions feel free. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT>  The seller is a used car dealer in my area. It snows herethis causes rust damage on most cars. The dealer gets his inventory from out of state. He essentially acts as the middleman for purchasing used cars with little to no rust. I think its smart. Regardless the vehicle in question is:

1999 Chrysler LHS Sedan

Listed Price: 5,999

Body: SEDAN 4-DR

Engine: 3.5L V6 SOHC 24V

Trans: 4-Speed Automatic

Drive: FWD

Ext. Color: Burgundy

Int. Color: Charcoal

Mileage: 61,000

Features: Air Conditioning, Power Door Locks, Cruise Control, Leather Seats, Alarm System, No Accidents, Southern New Jersey Vehicle, Power Steering, Power Mirrors, Driver Air Bag, Power Seats, Climate Control. Chrome Rims, Anti-Lock Brakes, Alloy Wheels, Tilt Wheel, Rear Window Defroster, One Owner, Power Windows, Passenger Air Bag, Key-less Entry, Heated Seats

No Rust

60 Day or 3000 Mile Limited Warranty

Thats how he has it written on his site.

Heres what happened when I went to test drive it:

I went to test drive it today about 45 mins before his close of business.

When I went to test drive the vehicle:

Visually:

Interior Immaculate. The inside condition was flawless. The exterior was flawless.

The engine: looked flawless. I even checked the belt for tightnesswas fine.

The Drive:

Smooth. No bad noises or anything. It glided across the roads just fine.

The brakes seemed to require more pressing than Im used to in terms of distancewhereas it took more pressure from my foot to feel the brakes breaking. I dont know if thats because they are like that on Chryslers or if there was something wrong.

I also put the gas almost to the floor and couldnt really tell if there was any struggle. I didnt do it for long, only about a second or two, and it seemed fine.

At one point I put the steering wheel all the way to the brink and didnt hear any abnormal noises. My current car whines a little when I do that.

I verbally offered him $5,300 for the vehicle. He skeptically asked me if I was going to need a loan. It seemed he was not going to agree if I needed a loan. Once I told him Id be paying by certified bank check he agreed.

I wanted to review the documentation first, so I used that as an excuse to get out of there before signing any legally binding documentation. I only had about 5 mins before he was going to close. I test drove 2 other cars and didnt want to stay any longer than I had to for the day. Regardless, I never sign anything unless I read and understand it as best as I canwhile not an attorney I have above average knowledge in legal processes and documents.

Im slated to purchase the vehicle tomorrow.

Based on its condition the car seems like it was owned by an elderly individual that drove it around for general errands and doctors appointments. He said he bought it from a dealer in New Jersey who got it on a trade in but didnt want to bother trying to sell it. Based on the low mileage and condition I almost think that hes telling the truth. My guess is someone passed away and whoever inherited the car traded it in.

The last used car I bought was a 2003 Alero with 70,000 miles for $7,700. I drove it for 8 years with no major disqualifiers. In my area rust will kill your cars chances of passing inspection.

Im not locked into any agreement. I have signed nothing. A handshake is legally worthless so I can bow out at any time tomorrow morning if I need to.

Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My landlord gave me a loadable cash card for laundry. I used it for a year without issue. One week I loaded 20 dollars onto it. A few days later I went to do my laundry and it presented a 'ERR' message. I went to the office to solve the issue. They told me, "sorry that's too bad. Here's another card. No we wont refund you. Good luck." I felt very scammed but excepted my fate and keep trying to find a way to get my 20 bucks back... </TEXT>

Looked down from my fourth floor apartment and saw 2 people having sex in a vanI could see it through the windshield and I only saw the person on top. I wasn't sure if it was consensual I called the cops in case it wasn't. Usually I never call the cops but in this case for the greater good I did. The cops took \~20mins to show up and the van was gone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm going to experiment with this regardless but I think the 'controversial math' doesn't account for resistance (Ohms). Less resistance creates more current, thus allowing more heat, leading to more vapor. So a hit from a Novo: the square-root of 16 watts / 1.2 ohms = 3.65 Amps (Current)

 #x200B;

If you did the same for a Morph: Square-root of 16 watts / .25 ohms = 8 amps (Current)

The hit from the Morph would be almost 200% more powerful than the Novo in terms of current while using the same wattage...

So more heat ... and more vapor... </TEXT>

<TEXT> If the Coils are made of similar material couldnt we still estimate how much current it would take to equate a similar experience by looking at the difference between the 2 coils Mass? 

So to calculate it right could you estimate: If the Morph coil is 2x the size of the Novo coil it would require twice the current? Could you just double the Watts from 3.33 to \~6 Wattsthis would double the current. Thats assuming electricity would travel through the material slower because of the Mass difference

Thanks for the response btw </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was in Las Vegas for New Years of 2012 and I started talking to this older lady. Everyone at the club I went to was pretty nice. I'm from the east coast so I'm not used to people being so friendly. 

Anyway, we were talking about little small talk things and the normal stuff you might talk with someone about. 

That is until she told me that they were watching her. 

I ask, "wait what do you mean they". 

She says, "the government, they're out to get me" 

I quickly realized she was nuts and couldn't resist putting my index and middle finger to my ear as if listening to a microphone and said "she knows". 

She dipped out pretty quick.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm very confused. Was this inflatable thing that is caused by inflation because inflation could be good inflation or bad inflation but inflation that is fun may be inflation fun or not inflation fun but no one seems to be having inflation fun\-\-except Mr. Wacky for he is having lots of inflation fun.  </TEXT>
