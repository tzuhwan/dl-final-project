<TEXT> You could say something like, "I've been feeling really overwhelmed (or whatever) lately and I've been hurting myself, and I'd like to talk to someone about it." You could also write it down and bring it in- read it to them, or just hand it over and let them read it. However it comes out will be the right way. Be honest about how often, but if you're not suicidal emphasize that you don't want to kill yourself or anything (unless that's not true... definitely speak up about it). I'd advise against showing your tools or bringing them to school period because they might consider it bringing a weapon to school and you may be suspended. Be prepared for them to tell your parents because they will, but don't let that stop you from getting the help you need and deserve.

If you're not ready to tell your parents about the self-harm, you can just talk to the counselor about the stuff that's triggering it (like maybe school is stressing you out or you've been feeling down). You can even ask what things they share with your parents so you know exactly where the line is. In my experience, parents often react poorly but it's usually because they don't know how to help or didn't see it coming. It might be intense for a little, but it does eventually die down. Good parents love their kids and just want them to be okay. It's scary to tell them, but also safe. They want to help.

Know that many school counselors don't offer regular counseling. They're a great resource to get you connected, help with school, and to intervene during a crisis.

If you were to see a counselor and get a diagnosis, you might also qualify for a 504 plan or IEP. If school is something that you struggle with due to depression or anxiety, you can get accommodations like private room and extended time for tests, note-takers in class, early access to power points, tutors, maybe even be allowed to take a break if things are too much (it all depends on your personal needs and symptoms).

<TEXT> A lot of areas have face to face groups. Some even serve dinner or have coffee before the meeting starts. Here's the [webpage](https://www.celebraterecovery.com/) where they have a group finder. It is faith-based if that's cool with you, but I've met people who go that aren't really religious. Most 12-step groups have a "higher power" but CR names theirs. Just full disclosure:) </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not worth it. Yes our bodies are temples, we belong to God, and we should honor Him in that. When it comes to self harm, I think it's more that God doesn't want us to hurt ourselves and wants us to take our pain to him. He understands our pain and has compassion for us. He knows and we know that self harm isn't healthy because it doesn't really fix the problem. It's just not sustainable. Can you talk to your pastor about it maybe?

Maybe check [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FHYI3kdK_g) out.

Also there is the [Life Recovery Bible](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/life-recovery-bible-nlt-stephen-arterburn/1102466937) that helped me a lot. They use it in Celebrate Recovery, which is a faith based 12 step program that has groups for self harm (assuming the meeting is large enough- sometimes they're smaller and combine issues). 

Might help to check out this free [SH workbook](https://us4.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=f01aa0f56ab012b6ef8891f48 id=198cd8d027) by therapist Kati Morton. Even if you aren't actively self-harming, if you're dealing with urges it might help you work through some of that.

<TEXT> Definitely. Lots of people go for lots of reasons. Not everyone there has addiction issues. Some go just to talk about difficult things going on in their lives. I continued to go for support and to keep my recovery in check, so that I was always working on myself and had a group if I started to slip or struggle. The 12 steps can apply to a lot of areas in life and is kind of built into the program. But you work through them only if you really want to. Otherwise it's more of a support group.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don't go off without your doctor's help.

I was on that for a few years and it made me absolutely ill when I came off. Dissociation, suicidal for months, sick like I had the flu for 2 weeks with body aches, tremors, and abdominal distress, crying all the time, and the worst was brain zaps which lasted about 4 months after I discontinued. I was at the lowest dose they make, 20mg, when I quit taking it and it was hell for weeks and felt like there was no end in sight. Nothing I tried helped, no supplements or herbal bs (and I tried a lot), but to lay on the couch and pretend I wasn't there. Only time passing made me feel better. My aunt had a similar experience coming off this med. Not to mention there have been huge class action lawsuits over it. 

I've heard of people actually breaking the capsules and counting out the beads to titrate the dose even slower, but don't do that without talking to your doc about it and getting their approval. Absolutely call and let him know of any withdrawal symptoms you have. 

Not trying to scare you though. Everyone's body is different and you won't have the same withdrawal symptoms as I did. Might not be as bad. But it does pass eventually. 

Be aware that you might be feeling better and that your anxiety has improved /because/ you're medicated. Going off can trigger rebound anxiety and depression. It might be best to wait until it's a calm time in your life (not an important time with applying abroad).

Whether you continue to go through with it now or decide a later date might be better, I wish you all the luck and a speedy recovery.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd start applying for other jobs before quitting (list the managers that like you for references). Once you're hired at the new place, give them a start date two weeks out and put in your notice at the other. 

You could also tell your mom you're looking at other jobs because this place isn't working out and she might not be upset if you've got a plan in mind. She might feel differently about you staying if she knew your boss was being like that and how it was effecting you. Worth talking to her about it before deciding. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Doesn't hurt to talk to someone and let a professional assess what the problem is. It really helps to get someone's outside opinion, you know? Like having a sounding board. Talking to someone about what you're feeling doesn't mean you're attention-seeking or whatever. Even if it is hormones, it's easier to go through when you have someone supporting you that you feel comfortable opening up to about these things. You could talk to the school counselor or a teacher, or ask your parents if you can see someone.

<TEXT> Meds can help. Sounds like a similar situation to when I was in college and I thought that if I didn't finish, my life would be over and I'd have no future. But I also felt like if I continued, I wouldn't make it out alive. Seemed no matter what I did, the end result wasn't good. Turns out the best decision for me was to drop out, and I was surprised when the world didn't end. I had to prioritize my health because my life was more important and the rest wouldn't matter if I wasn't around to see it. (But the right decision for me, may not be the same for you). 

I'm curious about what therapies you've tried. I'm diagnosed with MDD among other things and didn't find any relief for years even with medication until I tried EMDR. Between that and finally being on the right medication, I've seen improvements.

Also be aware that you can get genetic testing done to make the process of finding the right med go quicker. 

If you were to see a psychiatrist, you could ask about what things might effect your employment before they prescribe you anything. If you've seen a therapist and already have a diagnosis and that was in your background check, I don't see how getting treatment for that diagnosis would disqualify you but Idk your career. The truth though is that many people have more than one path in life, more than one career. You adapt.

<TEXT> I get depressed and anxious about this too. I've found it best to do what I can with what's within my control and to not follow so closely about whatever is going on. I no longer follow the news because as humans we were never meant to be so overexposed and aware of all the bad and worrisome things going on. It was making me sick and paralyzed with fear. Disconnecting does not make you a derelict. I'm responsible for me and my household and my children. My husband and I are starting to homestead, I recycle, I'm making switches to reusable products. We're also looking into building a non-traditional house (cob house, earthship, or potentially yurt) over the next 5 years.  I'm focusing on what I can do and rest knowing that God will redeem the mess we've made of creation. But it is my responsibility to be a good steward of the things in my reach. Lead by example and let any purchase you make be a vote for sustainability.

Accept the things you cannot change, change the things you can, and know the difference. 

I'm wondering why you feel you wouldn't be happy even if the problems were solved? Maybe the depression talking?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Does your school offer something like an IEP (individualized education plan) or 504 plan, or something similar? These both help you get access to accommodations to make school fair for you. Stuff like early access to power points, note takers in class, extended time and private room for exams, being allowed to take a break if you're struggling etc. Is there a guidance counselor available at school to talk to about that?

When I was struggling to finish high school in 10th grade, I switched to an online charter school and that helped a lot. I went on to college but due to my anxiety and depression, began struggling again. Couldn't concentrate, couldn't follow through, just stayed in my dorm room or literally hid from my professors and cut myself. I was smart like you but I wasn't able to finish and felt like failure, like life would never be worth anything because I wasn't worth anything. I had my worth wrapped up in GPA and a diploma. I thought I'd never be happy or fulfilled.

Turns out not finishing was the best thing for me and it took many years to see that. It's worth it to stay alive.

Idk what mental health options you have in the Philippines, but maybe check out therapist Kati Morton on youtube. I know you can also get a few free sessions at [7cups.com](https://7cups.com) and [betterhelp.com](https://betterhelp.com) with a licensed therapist.

<TEXT> Keep in mind that just because it's listed as a side effect, doesn't mean you'll experience it, especially starting at a low dose and letting your body get used to it. Also what works for one person might not for another since every body is different. All meds have crazy things possible for side effects. Often mild side effects may just go away on their own once your body adjusts, but always call your doctor and let them know if you're experiencing anything you're worried about. It's a bit of trial and error to find the right med combo. Usually leaves people with bad stories they are more than willing to share, but you never hear enough about the successes (and there are success stories). 

It might be your anxiety that's ramping up and causing all the worry about side effects. Ironic, yeah? Being anxious about medication that can help your anxiety... don't let that stop you from taking something that could help.

You could ask about genetic testing for medication. They can actually narrow down what meds might work better with your chemistry and are less likely to have adverse reactions. Because you're on medicaid, idk if they'd approve it, but can't hurt to look into it. </TEXT>

I'm not sure it will ever go away, but the difference is that now it doesn't have such a hold on me, that negative voice isn't so loud, and I know how to manage these feelings. Hope you find something that works for you. Keep fighting.

<TEXT> I was on an antipsychotic when I wasn't dealing with psychotic features, for off-label use. I have a friend who was in the same boat, so I don't think it's unheard of.

That said, if you're in the US you can ask any therapist or psychiatrist if they will work on a sliding scale, which is income and (in)ability to pay based. Look around online and see if there's someone you think you might like, call their office, do a phone consultation, get a feel for them, explain your financial situation, etc. It gives you more options than seeing the students at a free clinic. And honestly I would get a second opinion and insist on seeing the psychiatrist, not a NP.

Needing medication does not damage the validity of your word. It's your body, your decision. You should feel comfortable with the decisions being made and the medication prescribed. Or if you're a little uncertain, you should be able to lean on the trusting relationship you've developed with your doctor. If you don't want to take a specific med for a certain reason (ie. you're concerned that it has addictive qualities, you can't tolerate the side effects, whatever), let them know.

My doctor lets me take smaller doses and work up to the prescribed dose. Sometimes I'm able to do that between appointments, other times I don't quite get there and it takes a little longer. The point is, she knows I'm doing this and is okay with going at my pace. You could call the office and ask about it.

Also maybe check out some of these vids on finding a good therapist. You shouldn't feel judged by the person you're opening up to. It should feel like they're on your team and like you click.

They probably gave you a diagnosis and just didn't tell you what it was. If you're on welfare, they need to in order to "justify" treating you. It's the same way with insurance companies. It's okay to ask what your diagnosis is. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a word written on my ankle and another on my thigh, and finally after many, many years I no longer identify with the words etched into my skin. But I still have to look at them. Sometimes it breaks my heart for the kid I was and the things I went through, other times they stand out as angry Accusers even when things are going well, challenging my recovery. 

Be kind to yourself. Talk back to that negative voice in your head. You're not proving anything to the person by affirming what they said, and it only serves further self-abuse. I heard some singer say, "How does it end when the war that you're in is just you, against you, against you? You've got to learn to love your enemies, too."

Leave the words for your journal or your art or your songs sung in anger or hurt, not your body. If you have a therapist, bring the words to them. Also find some better friends to surround yourself with. Not saying you should cut (no pun intended) that person out- but the people you're closest to should lift you up and allow you room to be yourself, just as you are, with the understanding that we are all a work in progress. So what if you're a wreck? Anyone pretending as if they have it all together is fooling themselves. Immature? Everyone has areas they need to grow in. Doesn't matter who or how old you are. Everyone is on their own path at their own pace and anyone who judges others for that needs to examine the log in their own eye before pointing out the speck in another's. And if we're always focused on comparing where we're at with others, we'll never be okay with ourselves. If we're always thinking about our defects or faults, we'll never be able to build on the positives.

You're enough. You're allowed to be immature and a mess.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Absolutely talk to God about it, but also it sounds like your pastor just didn't know what else to say... are you seeing a therapist?

Take some breaths, put your tool somewhere out of reach or in another room. Try writing what you're feeling- whatever is going through your head. Get out all of the loud, angry, sad, hurt thoughts. Give your hands something to do and express it on paper, not skin. 

Talk back to your self harm voice. Tell it to f off. 

Make a (warm, not too hot) cup of tea and just breathe it in. Hold the cup tightly. Feel your feet on the floor. 

Watch a funny movie.

Pet your cat. 

Text a friend even if it's about something else completely. 

Tell yourself if you still want to cut in 5 minutes, you can. When the 5 is up, start over and see if you can go another 5. Sometimes it's just about waiting for the wave to pass (and it will).

If you're in the US you can always text HELLO to 741741 when you're in a crisis to get connected with someone. 

You could also try any and all of the things on the CalmHarm app. And I know therapist Kati Morton has a free sh workbook on her website Katimorton.com you could try. 

If you haven't heard of Celebrate Recovery, that might be something to look into. It's a free faith-based 12 step program and they have a group for self harm. I found the support there invaluable.

My mom was very similar to yours and wouldn't let me see a therapist either. I wish I had known then that I had other options. She didn't listen even when my primary doctor said I needed it. It was very difficult and I had to hold on to the hope that I could get the help I needed as soon as I went to college (and I did). 

I'd keep bringing it up with your mom and letting her know you're seriousand you would like to talk to someone. Sometimes we have to scream until we're heard.

<TEXT> It doesn't hurt to meet with them and tell them you're apprehensive about medication and would like to try alternatives first. They can't force you to take it. It's totally your decision. Maybe they'll have some suggestions of other routes, different therapies, good therapist referrals, etc. Or if you're concerned about side effects, you could ask for genetic blood testing to find medications that are more likely to be a better fit. When I start a new med, I ask to take something that I can cut into tiny doses to start and work my way up to the full dose. It helps avoid side effects. 

Have you looked into a medical cause? Worth getting a thyroid panel done and also checking to see if you have any vitamins/mineral deficiencies. 

You could try a naturopathic doctor or nutritionist and let them adjust your diet. If we're putting garbage in, we get garbage out. 

Other things to consider might be acupuncture, yoga therapy, music, writing, or art therapy, floatation tanks, negative ion therapy, ketamine, rTMS therapy, biofeedback, support groups or Celebrate Recovery (a free 12 step program that has a group for depression... I found the support and approach there invaluable). A lot of alternatives sound like a bunch of crunchy bs, but don't let that keep you from being open to trying different avenues. Talk to your doctor about all the options. 

I know my depression often demands my attention and focus, sometimes like a toddler throwing a tantrum. Other times it's like music in the background setting the tone. In both cases it helps me to put my focus on someone else by doing something meaningful or helpful. Gets me out of my head. I get so wrapped up in my own narrative that it's refreshing and releaving to be intentional about someone else's experience and making the world a better place, as much as is within my power. 

Though I never suffered a big trauma, EMDR has been really helpful in my journey with anxiety and depression. Like you, I never felt like I had been traumatized, but there are certainly things I get stuck on and EMDR lets my brain reprocess and heal.

You can ask what things your therapist breaks confidently for and to who- that's totally an okay thing to do. 

Be aware that you don't have to go to a clinic. You can ask any therapist in the US if they'll work on a sliding scale which is income and (in)ability to pay based. It should give you more options cause you can look around for someone you like. 

Don't give up on it. You deserve to heal.  </TEXT>

I would tell your therapist that's how you're feeling, which will give them a starting point and let them know that they need to move slowly.

<TEXT> She's just being a kitten. Cats in general are most active at drawn and dusk- keep in mind their internal clock is different than ours. You're doing everything right. I found it helpful when we got out kitten to put her in a small room at night with her toys and litter box (and nothing she could damage, like curtains). Wear jeans and discourage her using your hands as toys. As for the litter, my box has a grate at the bottom so the pee goes through to a pee pad in a tray underneath. The pellets might not be as great for litter boxes that don't have that feature, as it's not a clumping litter, so you can't really scoop it. We've also used the tidy cats pure nature which clumps for our regular box and our cat likes it. Plus it smells nice when you put it in. It's pricey though. But you don't have to replace the whole thing every time, just scoop and refill as necessary and change completely once a week or two. Same with regular clay litters, which are cheaper. 

Also, it sounds like after all of this, you should get a kitten yourself  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Are you in the US? You're old enough to set up your own appointments. As someone else said, you do not need parental consent to see a therapist (although I'm unsure about prescriptions, but that's something you could ask your therapist).

Check out some of these vids- they tell you how to go about setting up your own appointments, what to expect, what stuff they'll share with your parents, etc. Also be aware that you can ask any therapist in the US to work on a sliding scale, which is income and (in)ability based, to make it affordable for you (if you don't want to use your parents insurance). Many places also have government funded mental health centers. You could look around online for something like that, or call up your previous therapist's office and ask for a referral.

<TEXT> Get as far away from that relationship as you can, now. You're not crazy. Wondering how much longer you can do this before you kill yourself is your body's intuition knowing this isn't right and saying it wants out. Listen to it, you need to break it off.  I had an abusive boyfriend in high school and he threatened to kill himself if I broke up with him. It was a lot of the same stuff- making me take the blame, isolating me from friends, etc.  Don't be afraid to let your parents know what's going on. Even if you've been distant, they love you and want what's best for you.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's really scary... I think your best bet is to talk to your parents about it. Maybe not like in a "Hey, did you take my blades" kind of way but more like, "I've been struggling with this for a few months and would like to see someone for help," kind of way. They might already know and may mention that they found them and then you'll know what happened (but even if they don't mention it, you wouldn't have to worry about your aunt or housekeeper telling them). Maybe they are waiting for you to come to them, or to find more before confronting you.

<TEXT> That's your depression talking. It wants to keep you isolated and in it's grasp, so tell it to shut the hell up. You've got a ton of great qualities and are no less worthy and deserving of love than anyone else!

I've struggled with anxiety and depression since I was very young, and dated throughout my teens. It was a mess. One guy had depression, too, and we bonded over it. We were always trying to "save" each other... it really wasn't healthy and actually became codependent and abusive. I thought whoever I was dating had to also struggle with mental illness because no one else would understand or be able to love me. That wasn't true.

I took a break from dating for a while after that relationship failed (as they usually do anyway in your teens). Then I met a guy who saw me as person before he saw the mental illness. He recognized that it effected my life, but that my disorder wasn't *all* of me. He saw there was more and helped draw that out, while remaining compassionate to my experience and struggle. Our relationship wasn't always about my depression and me being sad or anxious. He didn't "save" me (I had to work on that myself, and I did that by learning to manage my disorder in therapy... something I still do regularly). We had a lot of fun together and enjoyed being around one another. We got married. I was never comfortable or confident around guys I liked and somehow that just didn't matter once I met the right person.

I will say that it is hard to be in a relationship with one or both of you struggle. When both of you struggle, it can be even more difficult to work out whose issue are whose, and some days neither of you are able to be there for the other because your own stuff is out of control.

When one person struggles, it can definitely effect the relationship and you have both to work really hard on communication. Sometimes I feel like a burden or guilty because a lot of the responsibility falls on my husband when I'm not doing well, but relationships aren't 50/50 or 100/100. Sometimes it's 30/70 or 60/40. But the thing is that there are times when he needs support and I am to help in different ways and to be there for him, and the roles reverse. It also helps for him to have his own support system outside of me. He is responsible for his own stuff and mental health, too, and even though he doesn't have a disorder, sometimes he needs extra help. He'll even see a therapist from time to time. Most importantly he never makes me feel like a burden and he certainly doesn't think of me in that way, even when things are really tough, even when he's angry or upset about something.

Having a mental illness doesn't mean you can't be loved, or on the flip side, that you are incapable of loving other people. It just means that you have an extra responsibility to take care of yourself (which honestly is something you should be doing anyway, whether or not you're in a relationship). That might look like therapy, self-care, building a support system, meeting with friends, remembering or learning how to have fun, knowing when to say no, reaching out when it's too much, and having a plan in place in case there is an emergency or if you ever get really sick and need to go inpatient.

Take advantage of the time you aren't in a relationship to heal and to grow so that when it happens (and it will if you want it to) you've got a head start and are fully able to enjoy the experience. Take care:) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd look for opportunities to bring it up, like if they're watching a show on TV and a character is anxious or sad about something (this is something you could even pick out ahead of time to watch together with the intention of pausing to discuss) or if you overhear them playing and someone calls someone else "crazy." Maybe one of their favorite bands has someone who struggled with mental illness (ie. Tyler Joseph from Twenty One Pilots, Demi Lovato, Zayn Malik, Selena Gomez) and is using that experience to speak out. Maybe they're reading about it in a magazine, or maybe they have a friend who is acting out at school. You can use that to start the conversation and then bring it closer to home. "Have you ever noticed mommy gets sad sometimes or angry for no reason?" Keep it age appropriate, don't overwhelm with stats and explicit details, and be sure to include reassurance and hope. What things are you doing to take care of your mental illness? You could talk a bit about self care, seeing a doctor, things that help etc.

Emphasize other places your kids can for support if you're having a bad day. Let them know they can always ask questions, it's open for discussion, they don't have to be afraid to bring it up. It's no one's fault- the brain is part of the body and it can get sick, too. Everyone gets sad sometimes but depression is when it doesn't go away and it effects your daily life. Explain some of the symptoms that might effect them and remind them it's never something that they did to cause it. I also want my kids to know I'm happy to set them up with a therapist if they want someone outside of the family to talk to (and they can help pick the therapist- it's important that they like them too).

If you're in therapy, you can also see about bringing them in for a family session to discuss it.

<TEXT> I'm just like this. What helped was asking my doctor if I could cut it into smaller doses to start, and then work up to the dose she wanted me at. I was already prescribed the lowest dose, and would cut it into quarters. It didn't do anything at first, and helped me get over the fear of side effects (because I didn't experience any) or being allergic to it (that fear was just my anxiety talking). Ativan is nice because it isn't as fast acting as Xanax and takes about an hour to actually kick in so you don't feel suddenly relaxed (and then startled by the onset of feeling this way so quickly). It's more gradual, and it makes you feel like you can cope with upcoming stressors. I find it really useful.

It can be addictive, so talk to your doctor about taking the lowest effective dose and only as-needed. But it's not like you'll be addicted the first time you take it. You just have to make sure you're using it as prescribed and not upping your dose or taking it more often than you're supposed to. It's okay to ask your doctors these questions, too, and let them know you're worried about taking it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maybe consider getting into therapy yourself for support. It might encourage him to do the same, and if it doesn't, you'll at least have a sounding board and someone to talk to about what's going on with your boyfriend and your relationship.

<TEXT> Look into poodles or wheaten terriers. But like was mentioned, it can add to your stress. I got an ESA. She's a lab/pointer mix from a rescue. They told me she was great, had all these wonderful qualities, good with kids, friendly, good with cats. I got her home and it was a nightmare. She was highly territorial and went nuts running from one end of the house to ther other every time a car or person went by and you couldn't get her to stop. She wasn't leash trained and I'm little and agoraphobic, and I couldn't control her on walks. She's aggressive to people on bikes and mean to our neighbors, threatening to bite if the come any closer. We can't have friends in our house. Not to mention they never told us she had chronic allergies that need expensive medication. I would cry and cry because she wasn't what I had hoped and only added to my anxiety, and she and I never bonded. We kept her because my husband fell in love with her in the quiet moments, and now we're spending money we don't have on private training for aggressive behaviours (which is helping, but taking time).

A smaller dog would've been a better fit in my case. They're more managble cuddly anyway because they fit in your lap. Bigger dogs need exercised an hour a day and plenty of mental stimulation.

Make sure you spend time with the dog before you adopt it. Meet it several times, ask to take it for a walk and get a feel. 

I hope you find the right fit for you! </TEXT>

She has a ton of vids about trauma, abuse, bullying, PTSD, C-PTSD, psychosis, finding the right therapist and therapy (EMDR is great for truma), etc. Maybe it would help clear some things up. There is also a book called The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel van der Kolk about trauma and how it effects us. Waking the Tiger by Peter Levine is apparently good too.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maybe you should check out the counseling center on campus if you haven't already. They can offer individual sessions or might have support groups to help you get to know others in a similar situation. If you're diagnosed, you can talk to student support services about getting accommodations to make school fair for you (things like private room/extra time for exams, note takers in class, early access to Power Points, tutors, etc). If your campus counselor sucks, you can always ask them for a referral for an off-campus therapist.

Some other things that help me in the winter are planning a vacation somewhere warm if possible, even if it's short, getting outside even if it's cold, opening the blinds to let the natural light in, surrounding myself with "warm" things (cozy blankets, hot tea, springing the extra money to keep the house a few degrees warmer, pictures of warm scenery), and putting on my shoes when I first get out of bed. That last one is hugely important because it helps me set the tone and keep my schedule. If I don't, it's incredibly difficult to get up and moving and the whole day is lost. It also helps my depression in general to use a weighted blanket for sleep and to set up regular things to do with friends/family- grabbing coffee once a week together, going for a walk after dinner with my husband, taking the dog out, etc.

Hope you find what works for you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Are you in the US? Can you talk to the school counselor, a favorite teacher, another family member you trust like your grandparent or aunt, or someone like a youth pastor? Antidepressants generally don't work on their own, anyway. They just keep our heads above water while we work on the rest in therapy. When parents don't want to help or don't think we need it, we have to keep speaking up until we're heard.

To get medication you need to set up an appointment with a psychiatrist or your regular doctor. Most will not prescribe you anything unless you are also being seen regularly by a therapist for treatment. This is because therapy alone or medication with therapy have the highest success rate.

Idk how old you are, but you have options. Check out some of these vids by therapist Kati Morton.

Going to the hospital won't help unless you're actively suicidal and need admitted (absolutely go if you're unsafe- you can call another adult or an ambulance to take you). If you aren't in immediate danger, they'll likely refer you to a counselor and/or psychiatrist and won't prescribe you anything.

You can ask any therapist to work on a sliding scale if you have to pay for it yourself or can't use your parents insurance. Many places also have government funded clinics. If you're having trouble finding one, you can call any therapist's office, explain your situation, and ask for a referral to someone who would be able to help.

You can also [chat](https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/chat/) or call the crisis hotline (you don't have to be suicidal to call and get support) 1-800-273-8255. And you can always text HELLO to 741741. They'll both be able to connect you to the help you need.

I hope something here helps! </TEXT>

<TEXT> If she's doing it for attention, she obviously needs it. Sometimes people who struggle with one addiction (ie. drinking) can try on other ones (ie. cutting). If you're under 18, encourage her to talk to the guidance counselor, a favorite teacher, her parents, a youth pastor, etc. If you're over 18, encourage her to set up an appointment with a therapist. You know from experience that it's better to get help early on. It's also okay to set boundaries and tell her that you're not in a place where you can talk about this with her right now, but that you want her to get the help she needs and to be safe. You have to protect your own recovery, too. Also congrats on 3 months- that's amazing!

<TEXT> Hey so sorry you're going through this... I know it's hard when we dream of one thing and the world tells us no, and there's nothing we can do about it. Of course, hopefully things will work out when your test result comes back, but if they don't, it's okay to take time to grieve. Be angry, be sad, feel lost, hurt, scream. Cry. Get it out (it's okay if it doesn't happen overnight). When you're done, don't let it stop you from dreaming a new dream. Don't come up with a Plan B; come up with a new Plan A. Sometimes when we have nothing left, what we've really been given is a blank slate on which to create. You said you want to help people and you sound very passionate about making a difference. That's a wonderful quality, know that there are many, *many* avenues to get there. It's not over yet.

Listen carefully whether or not you get your dream: You are enough. Right now, as you are. You are worthy. You deserve to be here and to take up space and to be who you are even if you don't know who that is yet. You have intrinsic value and worth that isn't based on works. You're allowed to take time to figure yourself out and try different things and be different people. You're allowed to walk down multiple roads. It's okay to wander. You're allowed to be wrong and to fail. Remember happiness is a learned skill and you aren't somehow condemned to feel unhappy or unlucky your whole life. You aren't at fault or to blame for being human or feeling (or not feeling) certain things, for other people's actions and decisions, or for things that out of your control. You're allowed to be happy and okay with yourself, to heal, to be self-compassionate. Tell the hateful voice in your head to shut the hell up with the abusive self-talk. 

Keep fighting.

Also if you aren't already, get yourself into therapy if at all possible. "How does it end when the war that you're in is just you, against you, against you? You've got to learn to love your enemies, too." It sounds to me like you were struggling before this happened, and you deserve to feel better and good about yourself.

<TEXT> I would look into grounding techniques. The 54321 grounding game works well for me. Also if you're not already seeing a therapist, maybe look into seeing someone who specializes in trauma or somatic experiencing, as dissociative disorders and not feeling "real" often are linked to trauma. 

Therapist Kati Morton and Dr Alexa Altman did an excellent series together about trauma and grounding. Kati also has several vids on dissociation and how to deal.

<TEXT> Are you in the US? If you are and money is the only thing keeping you, you can ask any therapist to work on a sliding scale which is income and (in)ability to pay based. Some offices do pro bono if you're willing to see someone working on their license. Or you could always as for a referral to a practice that will work with your budget. There are also government funded clinics in most places, where you may qualify for a certain number of sessions free. 

And of course there's always therapist Kati Morton on youtube. Not the same as seeing someone in person but she has a ton about anxiety, depression, PTSD, trauma, therapy, etc.  </TEXT>

As for college, it's not for everybody. Maybe do a semester or take a few classes at the community college until you figure out what you want to do. That way you don't make the expensive mistake that I did. Many students go not knowing what they want to do, and that's okay. You can go in as an undeclared major and get a feel for what you like. Most change their major at least once anyway. But if you try school and aren't sure it's for you, that's okay too. Maybe you'd enjoy working a skilled job better (honestly some make more money than getting a BA), like advertising and design, or something with computers. Or maybe you need a gap year to focus on your mental health and figuring out what you like. Might be good to talk to your guidance counselor- they can help you figure these things out. There are also tests out there designed to identify your strengths that you can do on your own, like Strength Finder 2.0.

You likely are good at many things, but just have to give yourself a chance to uncover and indulge them. When you feel like you have nothing, what you really have is a blank slate on which you can create. Keep searching.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Is there a school counselor or teacher you can talk to and explain the situation? I know in the US you can set up an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) or a 504 plan, which allow accommodations to make school fair for you (stuff like private room/extended time for exams, note takers in class, being allowed to take breaks as needed for panic attacks, etc) and it can make the whole thing more bearable. I struggled through my high school years and switched to cyber school halfway through. It wasn't until college that I learned the school could have helped me in these ways. 

Only to a point though, as I had a similar experience with the struggle to even get there in the mornings and would've rather died and so I skipped a lot. That's when you need to just hold on until you're able to get the help you need, possibly medication. 

Keep fighting. Also maybe check out therapist Kati Morton on youtube in the meantime. She has a ton about depression, suicide, self hate, school, and therapy.

Hope the waiting list goes quickly. Take care. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Idk where she is located in NC, but maybe look into [Monarch](https://www.monarchnc.org/). You don't need insurance to be seen there and I've had a good experience with them. There may be other government funded clinics in NC where she wouldn't need insurance, too, if you look around. Or you can call any office and ask if they have any suggestions for organizations or other clinics. You can also ask any therapist in the US to work on a sliding scale, which is income and (in)ability to pay based.

Psychosis itself isn't a diagnosis, but usually a specifier that goes along with something like schizophrenia, schizoaffective, bipolar, psychotic depression, etc, all of which are serious and may need a higher level of care. If she needs a higher level of care, they'll be able to refer her once she's been seen, or if she's at risk of hurting herself or someone else, she should go directly to the ER.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You can ask any therapist in the US to work on a sliding scale, which is income and (in)ability to pay based so that it's more affordable for you. I'd also look for mental health clinics in your area- many government funded clinics offer a reduced rate or even a number of sessions for free. If you can't find any, call any therapist's office and ask if they can refer you to somewhere that will work with your budget. They might also be able to suggest free support groups for anxiety. Something else to consider might be group therapy, which is often cheaper than individual sessions. Some practices even do pro bono, meaning that they offer free therapy if you're willing to see someone who is working on getting hours for their therapist license. They're usually still in school or just out of, so they often have a lot of fresh ideas and techniques.

And there's always therapist [Kati Morton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9r5TmwTM_A list=PL_loxoCVsWqzYEpSwo3dspzwjkZ46Wb5M) on youtube. You can ask her questions under her vids as soon as they're posted on Mondays and Thursdays. She tries to answer as many as she can in the first hour. She also has a website [katimorton.com](https://katimorton.com) and does livestreams on Patreon and you can ask questions there, where you pay as little as $1/month to have access to it.

<TEXT> Also get your thyroid checked. Seeing a regular doctor is a great starting point, and if everything comes back normal, you'll be more likely to get a diagnosis with a therapist. Keep in mind that if you are seeing a therapist regularly, they'll have to give you some sort of diagnosis to use for your insurance anyway and it's okay to ask what it is.

Maybe check out some of these vids

<TEXT> So sorry you're going through this. I experienced something similar with my panic disorder and I felt so trapped, like things would never get better and I would always be sick, even if there wasn't anything physically wrong. Sometimes I still feel that way when it flares up but it'snot nearly as often as it was. It lasted about 4 years before I found the right help and started to get some relief from my symptoms. I needed the right combo of meds and a patient psychiatrist, the right therapist (I had been seeing someone who was better than not seeing anyone but wasn't really helping, and then I found a psychologist with a PsyD that was far more helpful), and the right therapy (for me it was EMDR). 

I hope you're able to find what works for you soon. Maybe some of these vids will help?

<TEXT> I'd see a trauma therapist who specializes in EMDR. EMDR is a therapy most often used to treat PTSD but more and more is being used for other disorders and traumas. I tried many other therapies and have found the most help in my recovery with it. Worth a shot. 

Even if we've been out of school for a while, I don't think it's ever too late to deal with the things that hurt us. If we were overwhelmed and didn't have the tools to cope then, it makes sense that we'd still be struggling now if we haven't found a way to heal that.

<TEXT> I also have panic disorder with agoraphobia and I know it's really hard to find a good fit with this. For me, I struggled to go to new offices and so I was reluctant to try different therapists. The only thing that helped was to call ahead and have a phone interview with the therapist to kinda get a feel for them them. If I felt comfortable on the phone, we could progress to in-person. Your therapist sounds like a dud. My psychiatrist says should know by the 3rd or 4th appointment if you click. Definitely check with your insurance for others in your area, or ask the one you're currently seeing for a referral. Ultimately, I found a trauma therapist with a PsyD who specializes in EMDR, which is typically used for PTSD but is being used more and more for anxiety disorders, among other things. The right therapy in combination with the right medication (which also took a while to find) has helped me a lot. Another route to take might be online therapy for starters, somewhere like [betterhelp.com](https://betterhelp.com) or [7cups.com](https://7cups.com).

If you're diagnosed you can receive accommodations- stuff like early access to powerpoints, extended time and private room for exams, note taker in class, etc. Might also be worth looking into getting a tutor for your math class early on, so you can process at your own pace.

<TEXT> Hey, I'm so sorry you're going through this. Trauma can really mess with us, and I don't think you're a bad person. I think you just had enough and that you had been dealing with it for a long time.

As Christians, we shouldn't hold on to self-hate. Christ came and died for all our brokenness and shortcomings. When you've sinned, talk to him about it, tell him you're sorry and that you want to turn from it. Ask him to help and to show you how to go forward. Remember God is patient, loving, forgiving, and unlike any earthly father. He is not angry with you when you come to him. Christ forgives us and does not hate us but instead loves us- who are we to despise who God loves? We may still struggle but it's okay to keep bringing these things to him, every time for as long as it takes. To believe in Christ and what he's done for us is to never have to fear burning in hell because we are covered. He's paid the price and welcomes us in. That's it, it's finished. 

I'd also caution you to be aware of misplaced guilt and shame. Sometimes it is not our own, but others sin, and we mistakenly take it upon ourselves as if it's our fault or responsibility (it's neither). Sometimes we aren't really angry with ourselves, we're hurt, and angry at the wrongs other people have done to us. We are of course, responsible for our own actions. But I think Christ knows that when we react to people who have abused us, even when our reaction is sin and he despises sin, he sees that it comes from a place of deep pain. He is also compassionate and feels for us. He wants us to heal from the hurt, and from the sin, and he wants justice. 

Romans 12:19 "Vengeance is mine," says the Lord, "I will repay." You can trust him to make all things right in the end, and rest knowing you are covered under his grace. His pardon doesn't give us permission to keep sinning, but it does give us peace when we have sinned and are eager to repent. 

I don't know what country you're in or if you're a minor but I'm wondering if you're able to get into therapy? 

I have a few resources, if you're interested. They do come from the USA, but can still help. Some may not apply to you, depending where you're at in the world.

<TEXT> Look around for doctor's offices online and find someone close that seems nice. Call their office, a receptionist will answer, and ask if that doctor is accepting new patients and say you would like to set up an appt. If they aren't accepting new ones, you can see another doctor at the same practice or look around. Ask them what you need to bring (insurance, ID, etc). You can also look for clinics, which may have a longer wait but might be free or low cost if you don't want to or can't use insurance. You could also go to somewhere like an urgent care and pay upfront. If your worried about parents finding out, ask what their confidentiality policy is.

A lot of times offices have the new patient paperwork on their website that you can print out and bring with you so you can take your time filling it out instead of rushing to do it in the office. You can skip questions you don't know. 

They will ask for your insurance and whose name the insurance is under and probably their date of birth, and tell you if there is a copay. 

Be aware that your parents will receive an explanation of benefits in the mail a few weeks later showing that the insurance card was used. But you could opt to not use insurance. 

When the nurse calls you back, she will take your blood pressure, temp, and ask why you're there. Then you'll wait a bit in the room and the dr will come in. 

The doctor might order bloodwork to check basic things like thyroid. They will either have you schedule a follow up appt or call you with any test results. 

Hope this helps! </TEXT>

There's also a book called The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel van der Kolk if you haven't read it. It really dives in to how trauma effects the body. Also might be worth looking into EMDR to treat your PTSD, if you haven't already. 

Hope something here helps. Good luck at your appointment! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I get like this, too. If you're in the US, you can ask any therapist if they'll work on a sliding scale. There are also clinics where you can get a certain number of sessions for free. I'd ask your pastor if they have any resources they could point you to. Our church was able to help my husband afford his sessions. Some churches have licensed therapists on staff, others offer free pastoral counseling (which has it's limits since they aren't trained in mental health necessarily, but can still be very helpful).

Maybe some of these vids would also help?

I also want to recommend [Celebrate Recovery](http://celebraterecovery.com), which is a free faith-based program. I personally found it really supportive. Lots of people there with depression and struggling to get through life, easy to relate to, but very encouraging. If you do give it a try and find you don't like that particular meeting, try a different one because they're all a little unique and some are a better fit than others... just depends on the people. I attended for over 4 years and it changed my life- not that the depression is all gone, but having that group and knowing there was always someone to talk to made the difference.

And you can always text HELLO to the crisis text line, 741741. I've had good experiences with their listeners.

Hope something here helps. Keep fighting. </TEXT>

<TEXT> F26, 110lbs, 5'4";, buspar, synthroid, hypothyroidism, generalized anxiety, non smoker, no rec drugs, not pregnant

Yesterday evening I was sitting on the couch, stood up, and as I walked a sudden ripping/stabbing pain in my lower right abdomen had me stopped in my tracks. It went on for about 30 seconds, then went away.  I went to lay down and thought it had passed, but it did it again and came in waves. This time it didn't last as long. But then the area started to feel like when you're developing a side stitch, not exactly painful, but uncomfortable. It felt full and the skin didn't feel right, like a burning sensation. This feeling hasn\\\ #39;t gone away and it's been a full 24 hrs.

I went to urgent care yesterday and they evaluated for appendicitis, but said that wasn't likely. No intense pain when they pressed or if I jumped. They suggested I take a preg test to make sure it wasn't anything to do with that, and that was negative. Said it was likely gas.  

But it doesn't feel like any gas I've ever had. The pain has been consistent and in the same spot since it started with the aching, and the skin burns and hurts to touch. It wraps from the front near the hip bone, around the side, to the back just above my butt. I couldn't wear pants today because the band hurt the skin. 

I do have other unrelated symptoms that my primary suggested I get tested for MS (we\\\ #39;re waiting to test until I get insurance). Could this be related to that? I get a lot of tingling in my face, pain in legs and arm, and have double vision.

Any input is very appreciated  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't really have any suggestions on how to make a grown man take medicine he doesn't want, and a therapist can't prescribe medicine anyway (he'd have to see a psychiatrist), but it might be worth considering to get into therapy yourself. It sounds like a very draining situation and having an outlet might be good for you, as well. At the very least, they might have some pointers on how to best support your husband.

<TEXT> Go check out your campus counseling center, or find a therapist off campus. If being gay wasn't something you've thought or were concerned about before, it could be something triggered by the stress of going through a big transition. Things like [pure "O" OCD](https://www.intrusivethoughts.org/ocd-symptoms/pure-ocd/) can cause intrusive, unwanted thoughts, which can be sexual in nature. Doesn't hurt to get a professional's input.

It sounds like your therapist isn't a great fit for you and it might be worth looking around. If your insurance won't cover further sessions or let you see a new therapist, you can ask any therapist (at least in the US- idk where you're at) to work on a sliding scale.

might help clear some stuff up.

I personally experienced something similar at that age and do not consider what happened in my situation abuse or abnormal. "Normal" is a spectrum and some of us fall in the outer range and that doesn't necessarily mean anything bad. However, that doesn't mean it's the same for you.

That said, the feelings it left you with sound confusing, difficult to understand and work through. If you're at all concerned or bothered by what you went through, talk to a therapist, even just to ask if it was "normal."

<TEXT> Idk where you're at in the world, but there are support groups like [Celebrate Recovery](https://www.celebraterecovery.com/). It's faith based, but lots of people go for lots of reasons, and I found they actually have a specific group for self harm, among other addictions. You're not the only adult going through this- there are many of us out there. It's just that it's talked about less and less the older you get and media tells us it's only teenage girls who struggle but it does not discriminate. 

Self harm is not sustainable. It will never be enough. It starts small but be aware that it *does* escalate the longer we do it and becomes so entrenched in our neuropathways that it becomes a physical addiction that is very difficult to break. It's like walking the same path in a forest until there's a groove in the ground and you can't go any other way because it's so deep. The longer you do it, the more serious consequences it can have because it doesn't actually help or fix the problems.

Also it sounds like you need a rest. You're tapped. If that's going to hospital, then go. If that's finding someone else to step in and help out with your mom for a week while you head on vacation, do it. Or maybe you need someone to help out more often even when you're there- maybe it's too much to do it all yourself. Maybe rest is telling your father you love and support him but he needs to be at least looking for a job or another living situation with the goal of not staying there permanently, or helping you with rent and utilities, speak up. Say no. Take time off work. Put yourself first. You have to take care of yourself before you're able to help others, like putting the oxygen mask on yourself before assisting the person next to you on a plane. You're important, too. You have needs, too.

<TEXT> Idk what country you're in, but maybe you could set up your own appointment with a therapist? At least in the US you can do this if you're parents aren't helping or if there's good reason to leave them out of it.

Also maybe check out some of these vids?

[Talking to Parents](https://youtu.be/nQYdqAuoDko?t=3m14s) (I would add that it might be worth acknowledging that you have been given so much in this life and that you don't want to waste it, but you're struggling, the thoughts won't go away, and you need help). It seems like you have an idea of how they'll react (mom saying you're ungrateful, brushing it off, screaming at you, etc). Know that if they do react this way, it's not you. It's how they are and you know that's how they are with others, as you said your mom is a nurse and reacts similarly when a patient is experiencing mental illness. You're not doing anything wrong, it's not some personal defect, and you're not at fault for going through this.

When I was 14 I had been talking to the father at our church, and he was the one who told her I was struggling and started that conversation (with my permission), which was easier for me. She didn't want to hear it but did get me into a psychiatrist, which was better than nothing and I was grateful. However, I was medicated for years before getting therapy on my own as an adult, as she swept my depression under the rug and didn't want to acknowledge that I needed actual therapy growing up.

My mom had a bad reaction when she found out I was self harming when I was 18. She was angry, upset, didn't really understand, and immediately whisked me off to my psychiatrist because she didn't know else how to help me. But her anger faded after a week, and eventually things returned to normal.

It's been a long time since then and now we're really close, and I was still able to get the help I needed eventually. All in all, it was worth the risk. Sometimes your life is more important than the fear of how others will react. Your parents love you and just want what's best for you. (Unless your parents are abusive and it isn't safe... I'd suggest talking to someone else if you think they'll kick you out or abuse you).

<TEXT> F26, 5'4", 108lbs, white, hypothyroid, anxiety, Synthroid 50, Buspar 15 (3x daily). No rec drugs, non smoker.

My doctor tells me I'm a hypochondraic when I brought my concerns to her because of my anxiety diagnosis, but I haven't felt well in years.

It started with a burning in my stomach 4 years ago, the skin even hurt to touch, and over the weeks, the pain became so bad I went to the ER. They gave me a GI cocktail which helped and referred me to a gastro who put me on Carafate without diagnosing what was causing the pain. I tested neg for h. pylori and a barium swallow showed nothing. The pain seemed to migrate from the center of my stomach over to the right side. An ultrasound was ordered, but showed nothing unusual. The only thing that helped was to hold an ice pack on it. I'm not sure if it actually helped or not, but it made me feel like I was at least doing something. I also needed the pressure on it to sleep.

Soon after starting the carafate, I began experiencing dizziness and ringing in my ears. It felt like I was being knocked back and I often collapsed though I never lost consciousness. As I started to regain strength after collapsing, I'd often be thrown into panic, thinking I was dying. But this always came after the episode, never before. I'd be back on my feet in 20 minutes, often exhausted from the whole ordeal.

I asked the gastro if the collapsing and dizziness could be related to the carafate, and they said no. So I went to my primary doc and he started running tests. Holter monitor, EKG, stress test, glucose test, regular EEG, neurologists. I was experiencing a vibrating sensation, as if a bar went from one side to the other and was struck with a tuning fork. I stayed inpatient for a week for a v-EEG and was found to have "irritation" in my frontal cortex which was abnormal, but not enough to count as seizures. By this point, I was collapsing 2-4x daily and could hardly get off the couch. They suggested I get a tilt table test for POTS and that it was a combination of anxiety, POTS, silent migraines, and non-epileptic seizures. POTS was later ruled out and ll my labs were normal.

My primary at the time said I had anxiety and hyperacusis, since overstimulation often set these things off and my ears bothered me constantly. I wore earplugs for regular conversation and at work because it helped me to feel less dizzy. This whole thing went on for over a year. As my stomach started to improve, I quit taking the carafate. The less I took the carafate, the less dizzy I became and the less I collapsed. However, I also quit leaving the house. My independence shrank to none because it wasn't safe for me to go anywhere alone in case I fell and hit my head or became sick. My panic attacks were becoming more frequent, but seemed either entirely separate from or followed after collapsing.

As I became more isoalted, the less panic I experienced and by this point the collapsing episodes had faded to almost never. I felt okay if I was on my bed and not doing too much. Eventually I sought therapy and was diagnosed with major depression, panic disorder, and agoraphobia.

The stomach pain stopped eventually, occasionally with my side flaring up. When it flared, it felt like my ribs were out of place or burning. Sometimes the pain was lower, above my right hip. It ached, feeling like a developing side-stitch and the skin burned. I'd take a few days of carafate and the rib pain would pass and I'd forget about it again. The side pain eventually fading on it's own as well.

One night I sat in bed with my husband and it felt like the skin halfway down on my left inner thigh was being peeled off, an area about 2x3in. The pain radiated down to my knee. The next day we were supposed to be moving into our new house and I was unable to stand as the pain was made worse with any kind of weight. This lasted at this level for a few days, and then I started getting muscle cramps in the same thigh but the pain was now just an ache, like having pulled something. The pain came and went. Never bad when I was seeing a doctor, naturally, but would flare up in the car on the way home.

Months passed and this lingered with some improvement. More recently, I've been experiencing the same pain in both legs, same area. It keeps me up at night, coming in waves. Heat helps some. I also get cramps in my foot that feel like stepping on a lego. Sometimes there's a spot above me knee cap that burns and I can't touch it.

About two years ago I had an episode of face numbness, which was written off as bells palsy, but has continued to come with increasing frequency. I can still feel it, but less-so than the other side. It's only the right half of my face, sometimes the bridge of my nose. Other times I get tingling in just the tip of my nose or chin, and sometimes my tongue spasms.

Around the same time I developed vertical ridges on my fingernails, that almost look like little beads of wax.

I've also recently had pain and burning sensations in my back along my shoulder blades and down my left arm. This went away (though I did get seen at the ER and they confirmed it wasn't heart related).

6 months ago I developed double vision in both eyes. It's vertical and text sort of sits on top of itself, and happens even when I cover the opposite eye. It's worse when I've had a busy day and when I squint my eyes, but it's always there to some degree, especially noticeable with text and bright lights (like stop lights or neon). My optometrist said my eyes looked fine and that a change in prescription might correct my symptoms but I've had my new glasses a month and it's just as bad as it was before.

My thyroid is managed and TSH is normal.

Tonight the pain in my side near my appendix has returned. It felt like something ripping, and the skin again with the burning. Then it went away, and several minutes later, returned with a dull ache that came in waves. I went to urgent care and they said it wasn't appendicitis. Thanks, guys. That helps.

I've also been feeling a bit dizzy again as of late, but it's short-lived (gone in a few hours or by the next day), comes with ears hissing, and seems to happen if I miss a dose of or am late taking my Buspar.

I'm tired of always feeling sick and like nothing is ever right. I'm 26 and have wasted my youth. I think about never having kids because I already feel like shit and this is the best I'm ever going to feel, right? I've spent the last few years being told it's all part of my anxiety disorder (though, ironically, my psychiatrist disagrees). That would be fine and make sense if the symptoms went away once my anxiety was being treated (and it is- now I rarely have panic attacks, my medication has helped hugely, therapy is going well, and I'm getting out more). But it kills me that every symptom is minimized because doctors see my anxiety and think that's the cause of everything.

I do not have insurance, I don't know what to do. I can't just go around to other doctors. And honestly, who would listen? And even if they did I couldn't afford more tests. I'm tired of being in pain, if it's not one thing, it's something else, and sometimes I just want out.

Idk what I'm asking. You can't diagnose me. And I don't want to be worried with what-ifs of scary diseases. I guess I just want someone to say, hey I hear you and maybe this isn't all in your head. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You've gotten a lot of great input but I just want to add that there's a ton of videos about [self harm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2dtBmPOTh0 list=PL_loxoCVsWqxUuzhjHu7Ra_UyKd4tEde2) (and depression, anxiety, trauma, how to find a great therapist, just about any question you could ask, etc) by therapist Kati Morton that are worth looking into. Might give you some insight on how to ask about it with patients.

Her website [katimorton.com](https://katimorton.com) also has a free SH workbook under the merch tab. The TWLOHA website is okay, but I've always felt it romanticized mental illness. I know the intent with the story is to encourage you to be there for others, but it made me feel like I needed a group of cool friends to "save" me and that wasn't going to happen. I'd also recommend texting HELLO to 741741... the crisis text line (assuming you're in the US). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hang in there. Some seasons are longer than others, but they do pass, and when the help isn't helping you just have to ride it out and keep fighting. Keep looking for things that might help and try everything- there is always something else to try. I would also look for other supports outside of therapy and parents, like talking to a teacher, guidance counselor, or coach. You could ask your therapist if there are any support groups for others in similar situations, or maybe try attending something like [Celebrate Recovery](https://www.celebraterecovery.com/), where lots of people have been through what you're experiencing.

<TEXT> I had anxiety from a very early age, MDD starting around age 11, and was suicidal throughout my pre-teens and teens. I never thought I'd make it out but I did. I mean I still struggle with mental illness, but I'm happy I'm here, and I'm continually learning new ways to manage it.

Medication is tricky and can take several tries before finding the right one. I was medicated at 14 and didn't find the right one until my mid 20s and it was really rough. Don't lose hope if the first one doesn't work out. 

It sounds like you're doing everything you can to help and support her, and I'm glad you're seeing a therapist yourself for support. I wonder if your therapist knows of any parental support groups for others going through similar situations?

Idk if these videos would be helpful or not

<TEXT> Idk what that meant for you, but when I dream about self harm it's usually at a time when there's a lot going on and my subconscious is working out ways that I could deal with it, whether I've been having urges or not. It's a bit like intrusive thoughts in real life- just because you think about something awful doesn't mean you want to do it, that you're going to do it, or that it has some deep meaning. 

One thing that helps is to imagine a new ending to the dream and focus on that. I had a dream that a roommate walked in on me while I was cutting and was a huge dick about it, but to calm myself down when I woke up I imagined him reacting in a way that was more compassionate.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Biblical headcovering isn't sexist. It's about order, not oppression, and being like Christ who is, in a sense, under the Father. The argument that long hair is a cover doesn't make sense because Paul talks of a second covering- what then would he be referring to, if not a fabric cover? Covering is a silent witness and testimony, and a way to meditate on Him whenever you wear it because you feel it and it reminds you, the way praying with a lit candle might help draw your focus and keep your mind from wandering. I started covering my head in my late 20s. I feel like I'm putting on my identity in Christ and being more of who He created me to be when I cover. 

There's a exegetical book called Head Covering: A Forgotten Christian Practice for Modern Times by Jeremy Gardiner that goes pretty in depth on the whole thing (though I don't agree with the whole book, it certainly has some wonderful insights).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hope it helps her. It took me many years in therapy and 12 step programs to figure that out, since I had spoken harshly to myself since I was very young and it had become so ingrained that it was automatic. I know it can be difficult as a spouse to hear your SO say these things about themselves and to feel like no matter what you say they aren't able to hear how wonderful and valuable they are. For me it came from a place of trauma and frustration, and though I had therapists say I needed to practice self-compassion before, it didn't click until I was in the right kind of therapy. I had tried lots of things but EMDR therapy has helped me more than anything to heal the traumas. Whatever is causing your wife to feel this way about herself, I hope she's able to overcome. It's nice that she has a supportive hubby! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ugh... maybe you could tell her you changed your mind and would like to see someone? Parents can be a little near-sighted and miss these things unless we say something. They just don't always know how to help so we have to tell them. Seems like if you wait for her to ask again, it could be a while or possibly never, and you deserve to get the help now.

I wish I would've said something when I was in school. Having supportive friends is great, and you can still open up to a coach, but finding a good therapist is soooo helpful. You don't have to worry about it ruining the relationship with them because they know how to handle it and it's safe to talk about anything.

<TEXT> Talk back to it. If you say, "I hate myself!" Immediately put your hand on your chest and follow with something like, "No, I love myself. I am kind and I'm trying my best." Or when that voice starts getting loud, instead of saying you hate yourself out loud, try telling that hateful voice to shut the hell up. You've got plenty  of great qualities, you just have to give them the room and a voice.

Also something weird that I found helpful was to keep a picture of my 4 year old self around. I wouldn't tell a child I hate them. I wouldn't tell the girl in that picture that she's a bad person or that it's all her fault and she's garbage. It honestly helped me develop some self compassion and to quit verbally abusing myself.

Hope you find something that works for you. Keep fighting.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This makes so much sense. I've felt similarly when seeing a grad student or young therapist because they're too close to me, and are in a place I wanted so badly to be (and almost was).  It's not so much a feeling of jealousy as it is a painful reminder of the things mental illness has taken from me. 

So I don't see therapists younger than me right now. Just like I wouldn't see a therapist that I was attracted to, because it would be distracting from the things I'm really there to work through (but maybe this is something you really need to work through).

Absolutely talk to her about it, but if you feel it's preventing you from opening up or getting the help you need, you might want to consider finding someone else who is a more neutral fit. You can still work through this feeling with another therapist, it just won't feel so raw and difficult. 

Also just want to say that a lot can change in your early 20s. 4 years is still quite a difference in such a transitional time. Everyone is on a different path at a different pace and what's right for one person might not be for another. You may have had more adverse experiences to overcome, or other complicating factors, than she did that kept you from being where you'd like to be. It's not because you're a "loser."  </TEXT>

<TEXT> What about the campus counseling center? If you're diagnosed, you can get accommodations for school, stuff like note takers in class, early access to powerpoints, extra time and private room for testing (this one helped me because I'd see other people finishing their tests and turning them in and I'd panic because I wasn't done yet and felt nervous about standing up when I finished), consideration for missed attendance, etc. 

It also helped me to walk with a friend for class or have them pick me up on the way. Mornings were especially hard and it made it easier if we stopped to get a coffee or breakfast first so all the focus wasn't on going to class and how much it sucked. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What about the campus counseling center? They could hook you up with a therapist or maybe they offer groups for depression and anxiety (and it's okay to go to these groups because everyone there is feeling the same way, paying attention to their anxiety and not yours).

If you're diagnosed, you can also get accommodations for school, stuff like note takers in class, early access to powerpoints, extra time and private room for testing (this one helped me because I'd see other people finishing their tests and turning them in and I'd panic because I wasn't done yet and felt nervous about standing up when I finished), consideration for missed attendance, etc. Or maybe you need to consider taking a medical leave for a semester or dropping down to part-time instead of carry a full courseload while you get your anxiety under control.

Having anxiety doesn't make you a failure. Your worth is not counted by the number of friends you have or measured by your GPA.

<TEXT> Could you be having sleep paralysis? If you're not sleeping well, maybe when you think you're awake you're actually drifting in and out and it's causing the hallucinations and paralysis. 

I struggle with sleeping and feeling anxious at night, too. I got a dog and it really helped, and having white noise like a fan, table top water fountain, or something soothing like classical music on low works for me. If you're a person of faith, prayer can be really useful. If you were a kid, I'd suggest making [Monster Spray](https://www.prettyprudent.com/2011/01/baby-kid/monster-spray-2/). 

Also, idk if you're in treatment but have you tried [EMDR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhaWIVK6ERI)? It's great for traumas. Other things to try are [TRE](https://traumaprevention.com/what-is-tre/) and [Somatic Experiencing](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-intelligent-divorce/201503/somatic-experiencing). Check out some of these vids- they might have some helpful insights/suggestions.

<TEXT> If you're diagnosed with depression, you can receive accommodations to help make school fair for you- stuff like extra time and private room for exams, note takers in class, early access to power points, etc. I'd encourage you to see the counseling center on campus. 

Know that college isn't for everyone- that's okay. You can  take a medical leave for a semester, or indefinitely, and always go back. It's better leave before you get weighed down with student debt if you know you're not going to be able to finish (trust me here). You could always try taking part-time classes, too. No one says you have to do it 4 years anyway. You know what's best for you.

<TEXT> If you're hurting yourself on purpose at all, it's self harm. "Small/shallow" cuts do not mean your problems are any less serious, so don't feel like you have to let it escalate for it to be valid. Honestly I didn't even know why I was doing it when I first started, but it quickly became everything and swallowed up my identity. I used it when I was sad or numb or anxious, even when I was happy at times. My reasons constantly changed. Sometimes I didn't even need a reason.

Be aware that it *does* escalate the longer we do it and becomes so entrenched in our neuropathways that it becomes a physical addiction that is very difficult (though not impossible) to break. It's like walking the same path in a forest until there's a groove in the ground and you can't go any other way because it's so deep. The longer you do it, the more serious consequences it can have because it doesn't actually help or fix the problems. 

When I quit cutting after 14 years, it even made me physically sick and I developed psychogenic seizures because I never learned how to process my feelings. I never thought it could be like that, or that it would go on for so long. Please get help as soon as you can if you aren't already.

I know this is an info dump, but I hope something here helps. Also please make sure you're taking care of even "minor" injuries. Clean with cool water (hot water leaches chemicals from pipes), apply neosporin/ bacetracin/antibiotic ointment, cover with bandage and chance the dressing at least daily. This helps them heal quicker and prevents infection and reduces scarring. Never use hydrogen peroxide on wounds because it damages healthy tissue. 

Please take care. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ohh I feel this... it creates so much stress... that constant fear that you're going to be found out or exposed, and that the only coping skill you have will be taken away, you'll get in trouble, or that people won't understand and react badly. You feel desperate to protect your secret. That's how I felt anyway. It's awful.

<TEXT> Sometimes I get urges out of nowhere and the thing that works best for me is to externalize it. I pretend it's this annoying neighbor putting in his two-cents, and I tell him to shut the hell up and mind his own business. Don't give the occasional urge too much merit because sometimes they just pop up. Thinking about it doesn't mean you have to act on it, and you even said you know you won't. 

Might be good to do some extra self-care though. Connect with a friend, watch a funny movie, go for a walk. Check in with yourself to make sure you aren't hungry, angry, lonely, tired, or overwhelmed because all of those can just make it worse.

I suggest [avoiding harm-reduction techniques](https://www.talkspace.com/blog/2017/06/time-retire-self-harm-alternatives/), like holding ice or snapping rubber bands. Those are okay when you're trying to minimize the harm you're already doing as you step down into healthier coping strategies, but can be a slipper slope back into active self harm if you've been a long time without it. There's also the CalmHarm app you can try.

I also love watching [Kati Morton](https://www.youtube.com/user/KatiMorton) vids when I need a positive outlet to work through my feelings. Hope something here helps. Take care! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I lost someone in my family to suicide and it's been 24 years and the pain is still felt. I know you said you're not really interested in therapy, but maybe check out some of these videos below to see if it sounds like something you can do. You don't have to have the right words and it's all at your own pace. No one will force you to share more than you want to, or to be open and vulnerable unless you're willing. You don't have to want to change to start therapy, you just have to not like where you're at. 

It sounds like if you had the choice to be happier and to be more productive and to feel more purpose, you would absolutely choose it. Depression isn't your fault. It's not some personality defect. You're not choosing to be "lazy." It's a disorder, and it's treatable. If you have a cold, you take medicine. If you break a bone, you go to physical therapy. Why is this different? The brain is an organ and it can get sick, too.

<TEXT> You can't make anyone do anything they aren't ready or don't want to do- you can't "fix" other people. You're not responsible for her actions and she will keep finding ways to hurt herself, even if you hide all the knives and razors, because it's not really about the cutting. Cutting a symptom of a bigger problem so as heartbreaking as it is, don't get too focused on it. The best thing you can do is learn about it and support her by encouraging her to seek professional help, make sure she's got access to proper wound care like bandages, gauze, neosporin, butterfly strips if necessary, and that she knows when it needs medical attention for infection or stitches, and do your best to model other coping strategies and try new things together. Talk about the things that are stressful in her life if she's open to that. Remember to have fun and laugh because that can go a long way in helping to heal. When you look at her, see her before you see her scars. She's not her disorder.

<TEXT> My mom did the same and it was because she wanted to help and didn't know what else to do. It was so irritating and I would get angry when she woke me up before leaving for work (though, to be fair, I tried to sleep in until everyone was gone and I had the house to myself). She also nagged relentlessly until I sat outside in the sun for 10mins a day to get some vitamin d. It didn't make much difference, but helped her feel like she was doing what she could. When she was on me about staying in my room and being isolated, I eventually figured I could go be depressed and anxious in the living room and it wasn't that big of a deal. Didn't really matter where I was, I felt the same. It was just more annoying to be around others, but if I could tolerate it for an hour they'd leave me be.

One thing you might try is telling her you plan on spending time with everyone after dinner (or whatever). Kinda meet them in the middle. Set time for yourself to be in your room, set some time to appease them by getting out of it. At the very least, they'll get off your case about how "you're always in your room." </TEXT>

<TEXT> The friends I made freshman year weren't the ones I had in the end. Things change and people grow quickly in college. People make new friends with new semesters and new clubs/activities and new roommates. You're not too old. It's more about being intentional and making the effort to stay connected even as your courseload and schedule picks up. Try inviting a classmate you hit it off with for coffee or waffles. Make it a regular thing every week or two. Join the gym. Find an extracurricular. It's easiest to make friends when you already have something in common to talk about like a paper you both have to write, or whatever extracurricular interests you. Or if you go see a movie, it's super casual and not a lot of talking. Go on walks. Make small talk with the people serving you lunch until they recognize you. You'll find you can have friends everywhere you go. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You can ask them exactly what stuff they'll break confidentiality for, and then if you're uncomfortable sharing about your self harm, you can just talk about the stuff that's triggering it.

Be aware that some school counselors don't do regular therapy, but are a great resource for support and you can use them as a stepping stone to get the help you need and deserve.

Telling parents is scary and unbelievably uncomfortable but since they love you, they want what's best for you. They might react poorly because they don't know how to handle it, but all that eventually settles down and you're better off because then you can get actual help. But your parents might also actually surprise you and be really supportive. Either way, it's worth absolutely it.

If you get a diagnosis, you can get accommodations for school if your disorder is effecting your ability to focus and learn. A school counselor can help you set up an [IEP](https://www.understood.org/en/school-learning/special-services/ieps/understanding-individualized-education-programs) or [504 plan](https://www.understood.org/en/school-learning/special-services/504-plan/understanding-504-plans) to make it fair for you.  Accommodations for depression might be having a note taker in class, early access to powerpoints, private room and extended time for tests, tutors, being allowed to take a break/step out for a minute if you're overwhelmed in class, or even be allowed to record the lesson so you can look back at it later when your better able to focus.

<TEXT> Maybe you should see someone for support yourself. It can really help having someone outside the situation to bounce things off of. Consider setting something up at the counseling center on campus, or look around for someone else you like. You can't help her if you're tapped, and setting the example might encourage her to see someone eventually, too.

<TEXT> I'd be more afraid of killing myself than asking for help. You don't have to die to end the pain. Depression is treatable, people recover, and there's so much help available. Please reach out. My family lost someone 24 years ago and it's still felt. More recently, we lost a kid at church and the community was broken. But even more than staying for others, stay because you deserve to get the help you need. You deserve to heal and to grow and to see the good days that are coming for you.

<TEXT> I'm sure people have suggested things to you over the years, but I'm wondering if you've tried EMDR? It's usually used for PTSD but more and more is being used to treat anxiety and depression (especially if you have a history of trauma). I felt like things were over, like I'd tried everything and nothing worked, until someone recommended it to me.

I missed out on a lot of things growing up due to trauma and mental illness, never learned how to be independent or take care of myself, and have been very isolated. Now I finally feel like I'm getting my life back. I see a trauma therapist with a PsyD who specializes in EMDR.

<TEXT> Write down what you want to say and bring it in. I do this all the time and it's so helpful. Sometimes I use it to reference while I talk, other times I just let them read it and ask questions as they go. If you don't know the answer to something they ask, say so. They can't tell anyone without your permission, including your mother. I would talk to them about what their rules for confidentiality are from the start, and tell them you have a hard time believing it.

I know that at least in the US, if you have a diagnosis, you can get accommodations in school. Things like early access to powerpoints, note takers in class, private room and extra time for exams, record lectures, etc. It can really take some of the pressure off and make education fair for you. It's also okay if you need to take a medical leave for a semester or two while you get your mental health under control. It's also okay if you have to leave altogether... college isn't for everybody and you can do something else.

I hope something here helps. Please please stick with the therapy once you find someone you click with. These things get worse if left untreated and you deserve to be healthy and happy. Take care!

<TEXT> You can ask any therapist in the US to work on a sliding scale which is income and (in)ability to pay based. In your area, there is also [Northside Behavioral Health Center](http://www.northsidebhc.org/) which works with low-income. At the very least, they might be able to give you a referral to someone in your area that can help. Another option might be to try a church if there is one you like, and ask the pastor for any resources. Some churches offer free pastoral counseling, others have professional licensed counselors on staff, and if they don't, they'll have local resources to point you in the right direction.

<TEXT> If you're under the care of someone and know when it's time to head back for a booster session in therapy, then I don't see any reason why you and your partner can't have kids. If you're putting in the work on yourselves to make sure you're healthy (or at least you're managing your mental health), and you're able to watch out for signs of developing disorders in your children, you're doing everything you can to set them up for success. You deserve to have a family as much as anyone else. 

Mental illness runs rampant in my family, but I'm not going to let that stop me and my therapists agree. I plan to have my kids accompany me to family therapy when they're old enough every now and then for a "check up," to set the example by allowing open discussion of mental health and feelings as is appropriate for their age, teaching healthy coping skills and boundaries, admitting I'm wrong when I'm wrong, and to let them know that if they want to see someone and talk to someone outside of the family, I'm happy to set that up.

<TEXT> I never saw a school counselor, though I really wish I had back then. But now I have a good friend who is a high school counselor. He never acts fake or writes you off and just wants to help his students succeed and to be safe. They generally don't provide regular therapy but are trained to be the stepping stone to get you the help you need.  If you're feeling suicidal, you need to reach out. Even if you aren't quite there yet, but things are getting worse, it's worth all the uncomfortableness and uncertainty to speak up. Because it's treatable. You could also talk to a favorite teacher if that's easier. 

I've been in therapy for many years, starting my senior year of high school. I sooo wish I would've talked to someone at school when I first started struggling in 7th grade. Around 8th grade, a youth leader at my church talked to my parents (with my permission) and told them I was depressed. I was rushed off to a psychiatrist and medicated for years before ever getting actual therapy. Medication might have helped if I was seeing someone to work through the other stuff. A good psychiatrist now would never allow that to happen and would insist on therapy with the medication, because you're most likely to feel better and improve when you do both.

If had known all of the help that was available, I would've spoken up sooner. I was terrified of my parents finding out, how they'd react, and I didn't know what a therapist could and couldn't tell them. 

If you're diagnosed, a school counselor can set up an [IEP](https://www.understood.org/en/school-learning/special-services/ieps/understanding-individualized-education-programs) or [504 plan](https://www.understood.org/en/school-learning/special-services/504-plan/understanding-504-plans), which takes some of the pressure off and makes school fair for you (you get accommodations... things like extended time or private room for exams, more time to do homework, being allowed to take a break from class if you're overwhelmed, early access to powerpoints, a note taker in class, etc... depends on your needs)

My parents reacted poorly, but after a while things settled and it was all okay. They just didn't know how to handle it and felt they were at fault.

A therapist will break confidentiality if you're going to hurt yourself or others, or are engaging in risky behavior but don't let that stop you from getting the help you deserve. Your life is more important than people finding out and reacting badly or judging. You could also just talk about the things that are triggering those feelings if you aren't ready to be so forthcoming.

<TEXT> Ask him what he needs. Sometimes that means quiet understanding and a bit of space. Maybe it means noticing that he's not up to doing the dishes, so you do them without mentioning it. Maybe it means watching a funny movie together and not talking about it. Maybe it means helping him externalize the depression by recognizing that it's an unwelcomed roommate who has overstayed his welcome, and it really has nothing to do with who your partner is.

If his depression is overwhelming you, maybe consider seeing a therapist yourself for support.

<TEXT> It could be a lot of things. Depression isn't always purely biological. Sure it could be brain chemistry, or a hormone imbalance like hypothyroidism. But you might have more environmental, social, or spiritual causes than your friend. Honestly, antidepressants are just meant to hold our heads above water while we work on the rest in therapy. There is no magical "fix" and the pills aren't meant to make you "happy." Whatever is causing your depression, talk to your doctor. Maybe they can adjust your medication or add in a new type of therapy. Sometimes it takes a while to find the right combination. What works for one person might not work for another. Everyone's journey is unique.

<TEXT> Set up an appointment with the campus counseling center for starters. Or, go off campus to find someone. Depression is treatable. Also if it ever starts to interfere with your studies and you've been diagnosed, it's something you can get accommodations for (things like private room or extra time for exams, early access to power points, note takers in class, etc). If depression had a "reason" it wouldn't be a disorder- it doesn't discriminate and everything could be going "right," and it can still effect you.

<TEXT> I joke about it all the time, especially with friends and family. It helps me externalize it so it's not this big, heavy thing in my head. It's more like an idiot roommate I have.

There is a line though. You have to watch for when you take self-deprecation too far. You don't want to talk badly about yourself or use pointed humor in a way that's verbally abusive to yourself. Used inappropriately, it can quickly turn into negative self-talk. And certainly don't joke about other people's specific struggles, even if they joke about it themselves. "If the person on the gallows makes a grim joke, that's *gallows humor*. If someone in the crowd makes a joke, that's *part of the execution."* You'll find some don't think your jokes about your depression are funny, but many will if they identify with it. For those that don't, don't take it personally and respect the fact that they are uncomfortable (probably for a reason). And for those that laugh along, you're in good company! </TEXT>

If you're in the US, you can make an appt directly with a psychiatrist, doctor, or therapist. Most psychiatrists will require that you're in therapy along with taking medication, as this is the most effective.

I've taken beta blockers to help my anxiety, but also found other medications that work well. You likely won't find the right fit on your first try. It's a process. Others have said to see a doctor *and* a psychiatrist, and that's always a good idea. Things like thyroid disorders and hormone imbalances can cause anxiety so you'll want to rule any physical cause out. 

If you use your mom's insurance, she will get an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) in the mail 2-4 weeks after your visit. It will only list that you went to the doctor and used the insurance but will not give details of the appointment. If the doctor prescribes you meds and you don't want to share that with your family, you can use a discount site like [GoodRx.com](https://GoodRx.com) to afford them without using your insurance (and be sure to ask your doctor for generic).

Keep in mind that meds are a good way to put out the fire or take the edge off, but they don't fix you. They work best in combination with regular therapy. In many cases the right therapy on its own can be just as effective as medication.

Even if your parents laugh, I'd still talk to them. Let them know you're serious. It will make going to appointments less stressful because you won't feel like you have to hide it. There's no shame in going. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Like others have said, if our cup is empty, we can't pour out for others. You need to take care of yourself, too. And it's even okay to take a break from being that person for your friends. You can say something like, "I'd really like to be there for you right now but I'm also struggling and need to step back for a minute. Let's plan to catch up and talk another time." It's okay to set boundaries for yourself and others. 

Maybe check out therapist Kati Morton on youtube. She's got a lot of good vids about helping friends and how to take care of yourself.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> What about getting into regular therapy? You could ask for a second opinion about your OCD or look into Autism Spectrum Disorder. You deserve to get the help you need and depression is treatable.

<TEXT> I know you've gotten a ton of suggestions here but I also want to recommend something like 7cups.com or betterhelp.com. You can do counseling online with a professional and I think both of those have a free trial period but I'm not sure they treat minors. There is also the textline (text "hello" to 741741) which is available to everyone in the US 24/7, or suicidepreventionlifeline.org which you can call or chat. You dont have to be standing on a ledge to use those services. 

You could ask your dad if you have health insurance, say you've been feeling off and want to try talking to a therapist, and maybe he'll take you. Also if you're able to drive, you can set up your own appt with a therapist. When you talk to them over the phone to set it up, explain your situation, ask if they'll work on a sliding scale (you don't have to use your insurance). If they see reason for keeping your parents out of it, you don't need their consent to go. 

If your parents refuse to help and it's the only way to get the help you need, you can also report them to Child Protective Services for neglect in not getting you the vital help they are obligated to. http://www.okdhs.org/services/cps/Pages/default.aspx. but teachers are also mandated reporters so if you have a favorite teacher or again, the guidance counselor, you could explain what's going on and they should be able to guide you in the right direction. Doing this might result in you getting removed from the home for a time and staying at your dad's or another relatives, while they make sure it's safe, but honestly with your mom's choice of men, it doesnt sound like it is. 

If you're able to pick a therapist, I'd look for someone who specializes in trauma. 

Okay, I think that's all I've got lol. Please take care! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Make an appt with the counseling center on campus. Even if its not clinical depression (though it sounds like depression to me), it sounds like you could use someone to bounce things off of. 

Also be aware that if it starts effecting your ability to participate in school, you can get accommodations. So like for diagnosed depression, you might need early access to powerpoints, a note taker in class, a private room or extended time for testing, tutors, etc. It can take some of the pressures off and make school fair for you.

So like for depression, you might need early access to powerpoints, a note taker in class, a private room or extended time for testing, or more time to do homework, etc. It can take some of the pressures off and make school fair for you. Same with an IEP, here's a link that explains more and talks about the differences.

There's a ton of stuff on her channel about depression, suicide, self harm, etc. and it's worth taking a look around to get a better understanding of what your gf is going through. It's great that you want to support her and are asking others who have been there what might help.

Another idea is to get therapy yourself. Someone outside of your relationship to bounce things off of, who can offer tips and input on how to support her and keep you and your relationship healthy while you walk through it together. </TEXT>

I know it's really hard to talk about, but they can't help if they don't know what's going on. Sometimes it's easier to talk about stuff in therapy if you write it down and bring it in. You can give it to them or read it yourself. You deserve to get the help you need. Also know that sometimes it gets worse before it gets better because you're actually dealing with your stuff. That's okay. When I started getting the right help and making progress, my SH urges and depression got worse. My therapist said it's part of the process and happens to a lot of people. Just be as honest as you can.

You can also tell your therapist that talking about it stresses you out and maybe you could work on some skills to bring your stress down in session before you get to that point. It's okay to let them know if they are moving too fast and let them know you need to go slower. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For me, I know it's not sustainable. It gets worse the longer you do it and it's never enough. Also it was really hard work to understand why I was doing it in the first place. Reasons like seasons, they constantly changed. Self harm doesn't just bury your problems. It isolates you. If you hide it, your secrets keep you sick. If you don't hide it, it makes others fumble for words. It can impact your job, your relationships, and your health. My cuts were never "dangerous," but after 14 years I tried to stop and developed psychogenic non-epileptic seizures because I never learned how to cope in a healthy way. And what's more is that I got so wrapped up in self harm because it was just something I had always done, that I couldn't picture my life, myself without it. It stole so much of my time and thoughts and I'll never get that back, and it tricked me into thinking it was an intrinsic part of me and without it I wasn't myself. 

That said, there was a time when it got me through some shit and it served a purpose when I didn't have any other way to deal. 

Ask yourself why you need it. What is it really doing for you? Do you want or need people to see? Do you use it to communicate to others? Why don't you feel guilty, why aren't you bothered, why are you okay with it being a part of you? Has it become your identity?

No one can make you stop. And honestly you don't even have to want to stop to get help- you just have to not like where you're at. If you're not there yet, you're not there.

You have a couple options for being self-pay. You could go to a clinic, where you might qualify for a certain number of free sessions with a psychiatrist or therapist, or sessions at a reduced rate. You can also ask any therapist in the US if they work on sliding scale, which is income and (in)ability to pay based. I've had psychiatrists who charge $100-175 per session. I've had regular therapists who charge up to 100, but anywhere from 25-65 if you're on sliding scale. Medication prices vary but if you use a discount card like [GoodRx](https://www.goodrx.com/), many are inexpensive. I pay $3 for my anti anxiety meds. You can ask your doctor for generic.  </TEXT>

And it can take a few sessions to build the trust you need to open up. But remember they've heard it before and won't be shocked or anything. It's totally okay and safe to tell them.

Also idk if these vids would be helpful?

<TEXT> So sorry you're going through this... Maybe check out therapist Kati Morton on youtube. She has a ton on [Narcissistic Personality Disorder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjaeBMseW3o) (not saying that's what your husband has, but just what came to mind) and vids on being married to someone with mental health issues, how to make sure you're seeing a good therapist, etc. It's a great idea to see someone for support yourself. They won't be able to diagnose him without seeing him, but could definitely help you cope and maybe give you a direction to go in or an idea of what you're dealing with.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maybe while you're waiting for the money, there are things you could do to help develop the skills in addition to the sucky job that would suck less and help you feel more motivated and productive, like working at Tractor Supply, Home Depot or a military surplus store, part time where people know things. Or volunteer at a farm to learn how to care for chickens or goats or whatever (I had an acquaintance who had a farm and she let me come over to learn how to clean a coop, basic skills, etc). If you look ask your local extension office or parks and rec office, they may offer free classes or have contacts who could help you learn organic farming- maybe something like a community garden program. Look at it as practicing for and learning about your new life. Your sucky job is just a means to an end. Take comfort in knowing that you won't be there for ever and that it's helping you get to where you want to be.

Idk what your plans for off-grid are, but maybe there is an alternative way for you to do it. Like building a [tiny home](https://news.central.edu/2015/01/tiny-home/3239/) or [small cob house](https://www.treehugger.com/green-architecture/farmer-hand-builds-cob-house-for-250-dollars.html). I've seen [people](https://www.treehugger.com/sustainable-product-design/cob-house-built-for-less-than-3000.html) do that for under 3k. Obviously you'd need land but land can be cheap depending on what you get and if you're on wheels, you can have an off-grid lifestyle anywhere while you're saving up for a permanent place.

All the best. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm always having a mid-life crisis because I never know at which point will be the middle. 

Best to just assume that your 20s are for trial and error, and realizing that what other people are doing may not be what you need to do. No one is on the same path or going at the same pace, and that's okay. Try different things. You don't have to figure it all out all at once or even get it right.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I see two sides to this. You're right in a way- giving up can be a choice, and it's YOUR choice. But if it's your decision, and "only decided by whose life is at stake," it's your responsibility to do the deed. Other people value life, and assisted suicide for mental illness should not be legal because you're putting someone in the unforgiving position to do it for you. But on the other hand, suicide is not really a choice because if you're seriously considering suicide, you're not of sound mind and therefore the decision shouldn't be yours to make because you can't make the right one for yourself. 

Mental health is treated differently because it's *treatable.* There is always hope, always something new to try. And when it's not about curing it, it's about learning to live with and manage it. I had someone in my family commit, and it doesn't end the pain it just passes it on. It's been 26 years and it's still felt. Recently, we had a kid at church take his life, and the whole community was broken. While you're living, share your burdens with the people who love and support you. Depression and anxiety are not and do not have to be terminal. Suicide is preventable. The moment passes and there are steps you can take to heal. 

If you're considering taking your life, please reach out for help. If you're unsafe, go to the hospital or call an ambulance. Call a hotline or in the US, you can also text 741741 for the prevention line.

Be aware that it can take time to find the right med (or combination of meds) for your chemistry. It's a lot of trial-and-error. Don't give up just because one doesn't work. Remember that meds don't "fix" you- they just keep your head above water while you work on the rest in therapy.

Also don't be too hard on yourself. It takes time to find a job after graduation, and the first one you find might not be the one you stick with. All that matters is that you're working any job, even at the grocery store. It's easier to get one when you already have one, and having a routine and a reason to get up and moving helps with depression. Maybe you need something "easy" right now while you're trying to get healthy, instead of looking for your career which can be overwhelming.

Idk what your degree is in, but maybe there are some lower-totem jobs in the field you could aim for, where interview pressures aren't as high but that allow you to keep your toe in so there aren't huge gaps in your resume. Like if you've got a BA in psych, working as a wrap-around/TSS, or volunteering at a center. Or if you're into something like engineering or tech, working somewhere like BestBuy. There are also great jobs that will hire as long as you have any degree, like UPS. Look for that stepping stone until you find the job you want. The longer you avoid their calls and going to interviews, the more you'll build it up in your head and the more anxious you become. Just remember, if you don't get the job, you never have to see them again so it doesn't matter if you said or did something stupid. 

My husband worked for a while at a minimum wage job until he found one in his field. And as it turned out, that job wasn't a good fit and he left after a year and is now doing something else while he recovers from burnout, before diving back in. Your path doesn't have to be linear. Give yourself a break and room to breathe. 

Fight the urge to stay in bed as best you can. Even if it's just moving to the couch, or take a quick shower (or splashing water on your face), and make sure you're not eating garbage. Garbage in = garbage out.

Anyway, I know this is an info dump but I hope something here helps. Take care! </TEXT>

<TEXT> If depression had a "reason" it wouldn't be a disorder. It doesn't discriminate.  Medication actually works for some people, but don't feel pressured into it if you want to try everything else first. Be aware that it doesn't "fix" things or make you  "happy"- it just kinda gets your head above water so you're able to work on the rest in therapy.

<TEXT> There's a ton of tips in this playlist by therapist Kati Morton

[anxiety](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9r5TmwTM_A list=PL_loxoCVsWqzYEpSwo3dspzwjkZ46Wb5M)

For me, some things that help are:

Deep breathing exercises  


54321 grounding game -

Name and describe 5 things you can see right now (blue lamp, square pillow, empty water bottle, wet, green grass outside, etc)

4 things you can feel right now (bare feet on cold floor, chair on back, tongue on roof of mouth, etc)

3 things you can hear right now (air conditioner running, people talking in next room, clicking on keyboard)

2 things you can smell right now (cup of tea, candle, nothing)

1 thing you can taste right now (gum, lunch, nothing), or name 1 good thing about yourself (I am a compassionate and understanding person)  


The Alphabet Game -pick a subject like TV Shows, Animals, Books, whatever, and name things in that category starting with A. You can do this one with a friend to distract you, alternating turns/letters.  


Watching a funny show

Listening to calming music (I personally like cello and piano) or try watching Moving Art on Netflix. Nothing fast paced or anything that gets you worked up.

Try putting something heavy on your lap, like a weighted blanket, pillow, your fat cat, or backpack.

Chewing gum or sucking hard candy can also help because it activates your social engagement system and calms your nervous system.

Write down exactly what you're feeling

If you're worried about something specific and it's interrupting your ability to focus on whatever you should be focusing on, give yourself permission to think about it at a specific, later time like after dinner or during study hall if you don't have anything else to do. Set a time limit though, like 15-30 minutes. During that time, allow your mind to think as much as it wants about it. Knowing you've set time aside to worry later can help you focus now.

Coloring in children's coloring books (not adults, I find this too stressful lol) or doing word finds.

Let your friends or family know ahead of time how to help during a panic attack... you might not want 50 people crowding you or may be unable to answer all their questions of "What can I do????" in the moment. You might only be able to answer yes/no questions, or need something like a bottle of water to hold, a quiet place to sit, or your medication if you have any. Maybe it would help for them to breathe with you or rub your back. Or maybe you want to be left alone until it passes.

Create an emergency self-care kit (there are tons of ideas on pinterest and youtube)

I often have to do more than one of these things to calm down:)

Hope you find something that works for you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Therapy is for everyone who wants to work on themselves. You don't even have to be depressed to go, so never mind what your family thinks. That said, it sounds like you're finding it helpful and if you need it, you need it. It's great that you know what you need and are taking care of yourself. You're right- depression really doesn't care what your life looks like and it doesn't discriminate. If it had a reason, it wouldn't be a disorder.

Maybe some of these vids are worth checking out

There's also a ton on that channel about unsupportive parents, trauma, anxiety, etc. Sometimes I take stuff from the vids that I relate with and write it down to talk about in real-life therapy. It's helped me in recovery.

I hope after you get the letter, you continue to do what's best for you no matter what anyone else says. Honestly, you don't even have to tell them you're still going. Take care! </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is no "normal" and it's impossible to compare your experience to those around you. Everyone has their own stuff they are going through at their own pace. It my seem like everyone at school is happy or like they have it easy but no one is that way all of the time and everyone has shit going on that no one else knows about. It's okay to feel lost. Teen years are good for that because you're figuring yourself out. You're asking some really tough questions, and I think that's great.

I always felt like my high school experience was less than or lost. I missed out on a lot of the things my peers did because I was sad and anxious and isolated, and many supposed milestones flew by that I never reached "on time."

People told me that college would be the place for me because I would gain independence and a clean slate and the people there are kinder. In many ways, I found that to be true. In other ways, not so much... a new place, new people didn't magically fix me or the things I was struggling with. That said, I did find a lifelong friend. 

But the things that made my life worth living were found outside of school, and it took many years of hanging on (and therapy) to get there. It gets better the more you live. Not because life doesn't have problems anymore, but you find you can handle them and when you can't, you know where to go for help and support. 

"How am I doing in life?" You're doing just fine. It's okay to be where you are, to be sad or anxious, and to want things to change. A lot of people struggle with similar issues. 

Maybe check some of this stuff out

<TEXT> I've had a lot of therapists and they are not all created equal. Some were more professional, some lacked appropriate boundaries, some practiced a type of therapy that wasn't a good fit for me and didn't meet my needs. When I found a good one, the difference was progress. I used the videos below to gauge what a good therapist was and once I knew what to look for, it made things so much better!

<TEXT> I got married at 19, my husband was 21. We had been together a couple years. In the beginning, I often felt like I didn't fit in with my peers and like I was somehow "older" because we were the first and only to be married for several years. We were at a different place in life than those around us and it was difficult. That said, I still feel we made the right decision for us. And honestly I already felt married in my heart before we said "I do." Getting married doesn't make you lose your youth- you get to have your youth together, growing together.

Having struggled with depression since I as very young like you, I've also felt the pain of wasted youth. It kills me to think of all that time spent hiding in my room. What helps the most is to know that nobody has the "perfect" childhood. Sure, my experiences were very different from my friends, and I didn't do a lot of the things I was "supposed" to. I missed out on a lot. But as I grieve the loss of my childhood, and work through the things that are left in its wake, I'm finding that it's not all lost. There are certain things I can still learn to do (ie. work towards independence, drive a car, find some solid friends). It's also pushed me to work on myself more than most people have at my current age, and so I feel better equipped for years to come. And the pain that I've experienced has made me a more compassionate person.

Depression doesn't go away when you get married, so I hope you seek treatment if you haven't already. It can strain your relationship whether you're married or not.

If you're over 18, your parents don't have to know. Even if you're on their insurance, it will just show up that you went to the doctor, not what they said or what you went for. You could also just not use the insurance and find someone who will work on a sliding scale which is income and (in)ability to pay based (you can ask any therapist if they'll do this). You can use something like GoodRx to get the medication if it's too expensive. Meds don't magically fix you though. They just kind of get your head above water while you work on the rest in therapy. They work best together. Hope something here helps! Take care. </TEXT>

No matter what happens, know in your heart that your worth isn't tied up in your sexuality, marriage, or anything bad that anyone does to you- it's not your fault. You are strong and resilient. I pray for your safety and that if you should find yourself married, that your husband is kind and decent, and that he sees these broken things in society and wants only wants what is truly good for you, putting your needs ahead of his own in selflessness. I pray you're given every opportunity to be who you are and who you want to be.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Casually reach out to her, say you miss hanging out together, and ask if she wants to grab coffee. Keep it light. If she agrees, have a laugh and talk about some of the fun things you used to do, inside jokes, etc. Treat her like a normal person (because she is). Ask how school is going, what plans she has for upcoming breaks. Share what's been going on with you. Let her share the more serious stuff with you as your friendship redevelops, which could take some time, as much as she is comfortable and be prepared to listen and to walk with her through that, while maintaining healthy boundaries.

Once you've sort of re-established your friendship, you'll be in a better position to encourage her to get the appropriate help if she hasn't already. Also take time to learn about the issues she's experiencing, know the warning signs of [suicide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfDruc0QDCc list=PL_loxoCVsWqzYD-ue_O7E1ju2qPEFbv05) and [self harm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2dtBmPOTh0 list=PL_loxoCVsWqxUuzhjHu7Ra_UyKd4tEde2) (there's also a ton on that channel about families, trauma, finding a good therapist and the right type of therapy).

If at any point you're worried she's in danger or her life is at risk, contact the student counseling center and give them a heads up.

Above all, just be a friend. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Please reach out and get yourself some help. Suicide doesn't end the pain, it just passes it on. I lost someone in my family this way and it's been over 20 years and it still hurts. You deserve more and so do those who love you. Also lost a kid in my husband's youth group last year and I'm telling you it's not worth it. Depression is treatable, trauma can heal, and life can be so full. Stick around to see it. Keep fighting.

<TEXT> Our dog hated taking Prozac and it it was always a struggle to get it in her mouth, much less to swallow it. We tried putting it in the wet version of her food but she'd spit it back out. She wouldn't eat it in cheese. What worked for us was to smother it in a lump of peanut butter and smear it back further on her tongue. She loves peanut butter and can't smell the pill through it! </TEXT>

<TEXT> hey, try putting one hand on your chest and one on your stomach and taking a few deep breaths. Focus on keeping the hand on your chest still and moving the one on your belly. In for 4 counts, hold for 4, out for 4. You can count your breaths if it helps. 1 on inhale, 2 on exhale, and keep going up to 10, then start over. Breathing like this forces your nervous system to chill out. You're gonna be okay.

Something else that might help if you're diagnosed with depression is to talk to your school counselor, therapist, or parents about setting up an IEP or 504 plan. You can get accommodations for depression like having a note taker in class, early access to powerpoints, private room and extended time for tests, tutors, or even be allowed to record the lesson so you can look back at it later when your better able to focus.

Going off of what aerdn said, you could try a bullet journal. Write down one or two key words/feelings in the moment to save for later and tell yourself that you will think about it as much as you want at a certain time, like during free period when you have nothing to do or from 7-8pm after dinner. That way you're not trying to squash the thoughts, but giving yourself a better, more appropriate time to think about them.

And maybe look into a [Panda Planner](https://www.amazon.com/Panda-Planner-Gratitude-Productivity-Management/dp/B075B2FZN5/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1535411096 sr=8-1-spons pi=AC_SX236_SY340_QL65 keywords=panda+planner psc=1) </TEXT>

<TEXT> If he loves you, he'll be supportive and understanding. Try not to beat yourself up about it, either. Rlapse doesn't negate or somehow make invalid the time you went without it. 7 months without it is amazing- you've come so far! You haven't lost all that time and you aren't starting over from square one. Instead, relapse highlights areas we still need to work on. That's okay. Don't be too hard on yourself and don't forget that recovery is a process, not perfection, so keep fighting. Hope you feel better soon, take care! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm sure you're being overly critical about your appearance, but love your body for what it does, not how it looks. Love it because it protects you and heals itself and is always fighting to keep you going. Love it because it gets you from one place to another. Love it because it's your home and because through it you can reach out to others. Love it because if your friend hated their body, you wouldn't tell them to die since you know their body isn't the only thing that makes them beautiful. Love it because all bodies are good bodies, and you have as much right as anybody else to be here in this world and to take up space and to look how you look and be who you are.

And I really encourage you to get into counseling if you aren't already. Call the hotline or go to the ER if you're unsafe.

<TEXT> Lol I feel this and I'm in my late 20s. I used to think people a year or two older than me were so much wiser and together and more human than those my age and younger because they lived in a world that was totally different and all the drama had subsided. The younger you are, the more you feel the age differences because you're in a period of rapid change and growth, and it's so obvious behind and before you.

Occasionally I look at people in their 30s or people who've had children or careers like they're "real adults" and I'm still somehow a kid because my experiences have been different than theirs for a number of reasons. If I let it, it can drive me fucking nuts- makes me irritable and hate everyone just for having the audacity to be themselves. But the more I grow, the more I realize that high school never really ends- there is drama and immaturity everywhere you go. It just looks different. However, you are responsible for you. You make the decision to be empathetic and compassionate and inclusive. You can do that at any age. Maturity isn't a number.

With that in mind, I find it easier to be friends with people older than myself or whose lives are different (not better) than mine, without feeling like I'm less than and without wishing I was them. I spent a lot of time wishing my years away when I was in my teens and now I'm starting to see how silly that is. I also felt I never fit in with my peers because my childhood experiences had made me "grow up" a little quicker than others. I wanted so badly to be around people who were in a similar place as I was, and that was often found in those older than me. Makes me think of that song When by Dodie, "Oh it will be over, and I'll still be asking when." 

It's incredibly easy to look down on the people we've been before, or to be discontented with where we are because we wish we were somewhere else. Don't forget that everyone is on their own path, going through their own private shit that you don't know about, and growing at different rates. The best thing you can do when you're irritated with someone's immaturity is to set the example of what is right and good. Not in a pretentious way, but with the understanding that everyone is doing their best where they're at. You're not better than they are, just as someone older isn't better than you. Be the one who helps them up. And if your 20+ year old friends dismiss you or don't value you because you're younger than they are, they aren't that mature.

And for heaven's sake, don't hate yourself for things that are beyond your control. This is your only chance to be 19 so do it the best you can. You're right where you're supposed to be and that's enough.

Sorry this is long. I've been thinking a lot about it lately. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Have you tried the campus counseling center? They might have support groups for this because a ton of people go through it. Keep reaching out and trying to make friends. Even if it's just someone in class you're working on a project with- ask if they want to grab some coffee with you or whatever. Join some groups on campus, hang out at the gym, or participate in any activities your dorm is holding. It's easier to start making friends while everyone else is also trying to get established. You'll settle in as the semester goes on. Hang in there.  </TEXT>

My guess about self harming when you're bored is because sh can really take over and become an addiction. So even when there's nothing going on, it's kinda ingrained in our thoughts and behaviors.

<TEXT> Talk back to that voice cause it's telling you a bunch of bullshit. Uni could be really good, so what if you didn't start with everyone else. Nobody is on the same path and you did what you thought was best for you at the time. You didn't know how it was going to work out. Plus if you had gone knowing that you didn't want to be there, you wouldn't have learned much anyway. At least you know that's what you want to do now.

And uni isn't everything. If you don't get it, you'll be alright. It doesn't mean your stupid or that your life isn't worth anything. It just means you'll find those things elsewhere and that your life will be different than what you planned (but no one's life goes as planned and everybody ends up somewhere different than where they thought they would). 

Ignore the people who look down on you. You ever hear that Dr Suess quote, "Be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind"? The only time anyone should look "down" on you is if they are helping you up. They shouldn't be looking on you with their ego, criticisms, and judgements. If they do, their opinions don't matter.

You made a mistake on your application. It happens. You didn't do it on purpose. You still want to go and you're working it out and you said it- it's getting fixed.

Mental illness is a real thing that really affects your life. You're not lazy or disinterested, and you're certainly not a failure. You're doing your best. It makes sense that didn't go out and get another job right away after the last one was so hurtful. You needed a break and some time to build yourself back up, to heal. That's okay! It's okay. You're okay. You have so much value, whether or not you go to uni, whether or not you're working. You've got stuff to offer. It's just that right now, maybe your mental illness is keeping you from doing and being all the things you want to do and be. 

Keep fighting. I hope you're able to get some help and that you're seeing a therapist?

<TEXT> Also just want to add that I'm speaking from experience. I saw the same therapist as my roommate throughout college and it was a mess. My fiance and I saw the same therapist for couple's sessions, and that was good. But even married, we see separate therapists. It's healthier. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Only see that therapist if you're doing a couple's session with your fiance. As others have said, seeing them for your own private therapy would come with some risks and questionable ethics. You need your own therapist. One therapist doesn't fit all. They might be a good fit for your fiance, but you'll have different needs and you should find the right therapist for you. You could certainly ask for a referral though!

<TEXT> Could you apply for SSI instead of SSDI? You don't have to meet a certain number of credits for SSI. Get a disability attorney from the start (they don't get paid unless you win), and know that it can take 2-3 years before you see any benefits.

Also, maybe a full shower is too much right now. Aim smaller, like splashing water on your face in the sink, or maybe you get in the shower but don't actually wash anything. Just get wet while you stand or sit there.

<TEXT> I struggle with this, too. I find it helps to pick something small to do, like cleaning off the coffee table/one small surface, or sitting on the porch for a few minutes. I tell myself that I don't have to feel like doing it or even enjoy it, and that once I'm done I can go back to sitting on the couch. I usually find I don't want to go back to the couch once I'm up and moving. Also helps to put my shoes on because then I feel I'm ready to do stuff. Or set up regular dates with friends, like maybe your friend comes over after you're done at work and you go for a walk around the block together, or out for coffee or waffles. Doesn't have to be a big thing. For me, it helps if my friend is understanding that I may or may not want to talk about whatever's going on in my head. One thing for sure, I know that I'm not going to feel better if I keep doing what I'm doing- sitting on the couch or laying in bed. Insanity is doing the same things over and over expecting different results, right? That's the cycle.

Maybe check out some of Kati Morton's vids on [depression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUJ4j6_ypE0 list=PL_loxoCVsWqzZv5mmk-Xw4IvoHRzc7ki4)? Hope you find something that works for you. Keep fighting. </TEXT>

I'd look for a therapist (maybe someone with a PsyD) who specializes in trauma, EMDR, or somatic experiencing. 

If you're in the US, you can ask any therapist to work on a sliding scale which is income and (in)ability to pay based. 

[Getting help with money issues](https://youtu.be/x_fFWXVRTV0?t=6m16s)

[Getting help when funds are low](https://youtu.be/wV9fjktyjfo)

Maybe check out the book The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel van der Kolk which talks a ton about trauma but in a way that's easy to understand. There's also Waking the Tiger by Peter Levine, and The Courage to Heal Workbook for Women and Men by Laura Davis.

<TEXT> Yes. If gender is a social construct and something we are able to identify with, I can't imagine cats feel the same way because they don't sit around talking about whether or not they feel their gender identity matches their assigned sex. Cats aren't people. They're genetically whatever they are. Also, they aren't making the choice to be "fixed." And even if they could make the choice, it doesn't mean they aren't still whatever gender they were. Women have hysterectomies and men can get snipped, but still identify with their assigned sex. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When my urges get really bad I picture them like a wave that peaks, but then passes. And I'm just bobbing along with it. I know that sounds cheesy but it honestly helps me. Just because I feel like cutting doesn't mean I have to act on it, and thinking of it like that helps me put some space between feeling like I need to cut and actually doing it. The more space between the two, the more in control I am because I get to decide what's best for me instead of my disorder taking over and doing whatever it wants. 

Other things that help are 

the CalmHarm app

distractions like a funny movie (or if I'm feeling safe enough, a movie that addresses mental health because I can relate to the characters and that helps me feel less alone), same thing with music

writing exactly what's going through my head and what I'm feeling

having an [Ugly Cry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFkLxF4MEgI)

getting together with my friend (sometimes we talk about it, sometimes not, depends on what I need)

asking myself if I am Hungry, Angry, Lonely, or Tired? because I know my urges get worse with all of those things 

Watching [Kati Morton](https://www.youtube.com/user/KatiMorton) on youtube or livestream, or talking to people on her [website](https://www.katimorton.com/)

<TEXT> Staying off the internet when I think I'm dying is a big one for me because I'll spend hours looking up symptoms. Distractions are good, like talking to a friend or watching a funny movie. Writing down my symptoms to talk to my doctor about at our next appointment helps me to stop obsessing over it in the moment. Breathing exercises. It also helps to remind myself I've felt weird things before and have survived so far. 

Idk what therapy is good for this specifically, but I've tried talk therapy (with DBT and CBT), mindfulness based stressed reduction (MBSR), and EMDR. The EMDR therapist I'm seeing specializes in trauma, which is where my health anxiety comes from, and has been the most helpful in combination with the right anti anxiety meds. But I know it's different for different people and can come out of other disorders like anxiety, depression, or OCD. Are you working with anyone already?

They'll probably talk to your parents, but don't let that stop you. It's worth it to get the help you need. They might also refer you to a therapist outside of school because school counselors don't provide long-term therapy for mental health.

Obviously talking to a counselor and joining a depression support group on campus

If you're diagnosed you can set up support services like extra time and private room for exams, early access to powerpoints, note takers, etc. and that can really take the pressure off.

Find a study buddy or tutor to keep you accountable. Just someone to sit in the library with while you work on your stuff and they work on theirs. 

Also might be worth mentioning that depression can be caused by thyroid problems so get it checked if you haven't. It's really common and an easy fix.

I also found it helpful to post index cards  around my room that talked back to my negative self-talk/depression voice. Stuff like, "My GPA is important, but it's not my worth." Or I am statements like "I am resiliant and resourceful; I am kind; I am enough; I try my best." Or "Process, not perfection."

Also write your notes out and tape them to the walls (or if you're in a bunk, tape above you) so while you're laying sad and staring into the Void, at least maybe some of your exam questions will sink into your subconscious. 

And know when things are too much and you need to put your health first. It's okay if you have to step back for a year or take a lighter course load. Not everyone is on a 4 year path. That's fine! </TEXT>

If you're worried about him, you can call the hotline and talk to someone and they'll have resources and an open ear to offer.

Also EMDR is gold standard for PTSD if he hasn't tried it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Most people ignore it and don't say anything once your scars fade to white, even if they're raised. If they ever do ask, you don't have to answer because it's none of their business, or you can say something along the lines of, "I had an illness when I was younger that left me with them but it was a long time ago and I'm better now. Thanks for asking, I appreciate your concern," and then switch the subject. (You can also say something along these lines to children who ask).

The only time it really effects things is at work when an employer feels it's unprofessional, which is reasonable, so they might ask you to cover up. It can make customers uncomfortable because they don't know what to say or even if they should say something and gets in the way of business. But I've found it really depends on the job and the boss. Some don't say anything at all as long as you're alright. Customers might glance but generally don't say anything.

When people do say something, you teach them how to talk to you about it. If you're uncomfortable talking about it or don't want to for any reason, say so. And then redirect the conversation to something more appropriate. Mostly they're just concerned or curious. Know what you're okay sharing and what you aren't, and only share if you want.

Scars are just skin. It's my skin and I love it for what it does. It heals and it protects me, and that's beautiful. A burn victim isn't (or should never be) shamed for theirs. Why should I be shamed for mine? Because I did it to myself? No. I went through something, too.

Wear what you want, and if that means you want to cover, that's okay! It doesn't have to mean you're hiding or ashamed. If you're hot and you want to wear shorts or a bathing suit, do it! Skin is not offensive. Eventually you get to a place where you're okay with yourself, whatever that looks like. And also the more time that passes, the more you heal and grow, I've found the less you think about them.

Wish you the best. </TEXT>

A good therapist isn't going to tell you you're being an angsty teen. It sounds like you've got some real stuff going on and it's worth looking into so you can feel better and get the help you need. Even if it's not clinical depression or whatever, they can still help you get to where you want to be. All that matters is that you don't like where you're at and how you're feeling, and that you're open to working on yourself:) </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I'm depressed, I actually like it when my friends talk about their struggles with me. It makes me feel like they can relate and also like they aren't trying to "protect" me by distancing themselves. 

I have a limited tolerance for friends sharing how happy they are with me though. It really depends. It can be nice to be reminded that there are things to look forward to, especially if it's something we're planning on doing together. But if it's like shoved down my throat that everyone is happier than me and living fuller lives, it reminds me that I feel fundamentally broken. So it can be a fine line, but it's less likely to upset me if it's someone I care about who I'm close to. But if it's bitches on Facebook posting about how much fun they're having and how #blessed they are, I'll pass on that.

Everyone is different though. Maybe it's something you could just ask your friend and talk about it the way you did here. Let them know you're unsure of how to act because you want to be as supportive as you can but aren't sure what would make them feel worse. Just because they're depressed doesn't mean you can't be honest and real. 

Hope this helps. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, are you in the US? If you are, you have a few options. You could see the therapist on campus and specifically ask about the things you're concerned with (confidentiality, things you've heard about their counseling center, etc) and see how they address it. Only share with them what you are comfortable sharing until you know you can trust them. They may give you a referral to someone outside of campus. You can also see any therapist and ask for a sliding scale if money is an issue. Idk about resources outside the US, but there are online options like [7cups.com](https://7cups.com) and [betterhelp.com](https://betterhelp.com), both of which have licensed therapists. There's also Kati Morton and her community. She has vids on [anxiety](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9r5TmwTM_A list=PL_loxoCVsWqzYEpSwo3dspzwjkZ46Wb5M) and [depression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUJ4j6_ypE0 list=PL_loxoCVsWqzZv5mmk-Xw4IvoHRzc7ki4), as well as tips on [how to get through school](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoGMyW3TwAY) while dealing with mental health issues. She does livestreams where you can ask questions (and you can ask in her comments on vids when they are first posted- she answers as many as she can in the first hour after it goes up).

If you're not in the US, here's some stuff about [NHS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D5s9TNq1Q8)

If you are able to see someone and have a diagnosis, you can talk to your school about student support services. They can provide accommodations to make education fair for you. So stuff like getting extended time and private room for exams, note takers in class, early access to power points, early registration for classes, tutors (which can help keep you accountable even if you don't actually need the help) etc. Your school probably also has support groups for depression and anxiety. If they don't, you can find those off campus through sites like [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) or try something like Celebrate Recovery (which is a faith-based 12 step program, though many people go for many reasons, and they offer a variety of support groups).

One other thing that helps is to start making friends as soon as you get there. Everyone is awkward and trying to get established, so it doesn't feel as difficult as it might once everyone is a bit more settled. Having friends and remembering to make time for fun and self-care will go a long way in helping your mental health.

Good luck and I hope something here helps. Feel free to message me if you want to chat! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't want to discourage you, but just want to say that cymbalta didn't really help me. I was on it for 3 years. And coming off was an absolute nightmare... there have been many lawsuits about it because withdrawal is more common than they say. But it's also more likely the longer you've been on it.

But different medications effect different people, differently. So what didn't work for me might be the perfect fit for you. It's all trial and error until you find the right one. Another route to go might be to ask your doctor about genetic testing to see what meds will work best with your specific chemistry. Just a thought. Hope you find what works for you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm going through something similar and have found EMDR therapy really helpful. It's great for trauma and might be worth looking into if you're able (you can always ask for a sliding scale if things are tight). Also have you talked to your doctor about feeling like the meds aren't helping? They might have another option or you could try genetic testing to find something that's more likely to work with your specific chemistry.. hope you feel better soon. Keep fighting.

<TEXT> Wow, so sorry you're going through that! That was wayy to abrupt to just spring it on you like that and not even allow you to process and prepare. I encourage you not to give up altogether though. You might find another therapist you like, maybe someone with fresh ideas to help. It sounds like she wasn't helping you as much as you needed anyway, considering you were still struggling with breakdowns and all the same problems. There should've been some evidence of real growth. Ask the school therapist if she will see you at least one more time to process and support you while you look for someone else. Tell her you feel like she pulled the rug out, though you understand the policy. Also maybe check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkKnbJasr38) on how to cope with an abrupt end to therapy. You have every right to be angry that she did that.

If you decide to reach out to someone else and keep trying, it might help knowing that the therapist you were seeing can send your records over to the new one, and they'll look it over before seeing you. You can catch them up to speed real quick and don't feel like you have to reprocess everything you've already worked through. Therapy goes where you want it to- you're in charge of what you want to talk about.

<TEXT> He needs help. Talk to him about seeing someone to get support for being made at himself and feeling responsible for the bad things people do to each other. I wouldn't emphasize that he's experiencing delusions or psychosis (whether it's drug induced or not doesn't matter- sometimes drugs can trigger these things and they still need treatment because they don't go away, and be aware that your boyfriend is prime age for developing schizophrenia). Let a professional work that out. Emphasize that they will listen and believe his experience, because they will.

If you choose to continue dating him, you might want to consider getting support yourself if you aren't seeing someone already. These things can get a lot worse, and it's good to have someone to bounce it off of who is outside of the situation and can offer insight. </TEXT>

If you're officially diagnosed, you may qualify for accommodations like a private room and extended time for exams, note takers in class, early access to power points, etc. It takes some of the pressure off and gives you the extra support you need. Also here's a vid on [managing mental health in college.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoGMyW3TwAY) I also found it helpful to attend a support group at Celebrate Recovery, which is a faith-based 12 step program, but lots of people go for lots of different reasons and I found the support there to be invaluable.

I don't know any inpatient facilities in Texas personally, but EMDR is gold standard for PTSD and many therapists who work with this also work with addiction. They will be able to refer to a higher level care facility if needed. If she doesn't have insurance, you can ask any therapist if they will work on a sliding scale, which is income and (in)ability based.

<TEXT> I don't think that's what Tyler Joseph meant... Maybe check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6WaMQ7q0EE) about finding a good therapist. Or maybe you need a different type of therapy, like [EMDR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhaWIVK6ERI) (a lot of people who struggle with addiction also have experienced trauma, and it's really an effective therapy). Might also be worth looking into genetic testing if you feel the medication your psych is giving you isn't doing shit. It can help narrow down something that might work better with your chemistry. 

It's great to be honest about why you're doing the things you are. Hope you're as honest with your therapists so they know how to help. You deserve real recovery and if what you're doing isn't working, keep looking until you find something(s) that is healthy that does work. It's out there. 

Killing your mind is about killing these broken things that ultimately are unsustainable and damaging, and instead letting your resilient self grow. Beyond defeating bad ways to cope, it's about finding the root and addressing it head on. Keep fighting.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I dropped out of college due to mental illness and have often felt similarly. It's like everyone is moving on and I've been passed by. But the truth is that everyone is on a different path and you're not obligated to do things at the same time as other people. Where you're at is okay and if you're not happy there, get some help so you can get to where you want to be. People usually have more than one career anyway and nothing is set in stone. And a lot of people our age don't get married until their 30s. You'll find it when you're ready. Keep fighting. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My family lost someone to suicide and I'm telling you it absolutely will effect your family the rest of their lives, and I've seen it from the outside too and how it doesn't effect just families but whole communities (a kid at church). It will devastate them. It doesn't end the pain, it just passes it on. Plus things really do change when you get older. You heal, and you learn more ways to cope, and life is somehow better even when it's hard. Then you turn around and help someone else going through a similar situation so that they can hold on until they make it. Stick around for the good days because they're coming for you, and it's worth it. 

Maybe check out some of these videos.

<TEXT> Same here. To bed around 11, up around 2-4 and back to sleep between 4-6, awake at 8. I tell myself I'm just naturally a biphasic sleeper but honestly I think it has more to do with me not having a job or regular schedule, and laying around the house all day being depressed. Like maybe I'm just not exerting enough energy to sleep through the night. It used to bother me, but I started feeling more rested after I accepted it as normal for me at this point in my life. Hope you find an answer.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Relapse doesn't negate or somehow make invalid the time you went without it. You haven't lost all that time and you aren't starting over from square one. Instead, relapse highlights areas we still need to work on. So keep fighting, and remember recovery is a process, not perfection. Aimark42 is right in pointing out that self harm is a symptom, not the problem (though it certainly complicates things). It's okay if you aren't ready to stop. You'll get there. You don't need to want to stop in order to start healing- you just have to not like where you're at. You're mom sounds very understanding and would probably just want you to be honest so that she isn't out of the loop. She knows it's difficult and that relapse happens.

<TEXT> Sounds like even when you're being "kind" to yourself, you aren't really being kind. You're berating yourself for feeling the way that you do. You're not using your depression as an excuse- that's a lie your depression is telling you to keep you in it's grip. You've got something real going on, deserving of real self-compassion. Would you tell a friend struggling that they are using their depression as an excuse and that they are actually just a snowflake who is incompetent and can't follow through? Of course not! 

In both of your options here, try talking back to the depression. It will feel like lying to yourself at first, but that's just because it's what you're used to telling yourself. Eventually the healthy voice gets stronger and you find what you're saying back is really true- that you're not weak, you're resilient. You're doing your best where you're at. You're accepted by the people who matter most.

Overcoming depression, as you obviously know, isn't just a matter of willpower. Sure it plays a part, but there's so much more going on here because depression is a real disorder. Remember recovery is a process, not perfection. Keep fighting. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This time they'll already have the information. You could also call ahead to make sure and let them know you're uncomfortable with them asking those questions at the check-in. Honestly, I've had plenty of panic attacks in the waiting room (and in the exam room, and in the car). Ask if there's a quiet (private) space you could sit, or if it's okay to wait outside. Taking someone with you can help too. Some offices have let my husband check me in (something else you could ask ahead of time). That receptionist sounds well-meaning, but telling you to "pull yourself together" was a poor choice of words. 

The worst that could happened already has, and you survived! No one who saw or heard thought anything of it because everyone is so wrapped up in their own narrative. Let them stare- you'll never see them again anyway.

<TEXT> I had a hard time finding the right treatment for my anxiety... it took years. Finally I found the right medication with the right therapist with the right therapy, and I'm finally on the road to recovery. Maybe check out Kati Morton's vids on YouTube. She has a ton about what makes a good therapist and how to find the right therapy and level of care for you.

Medication is tricky because it's also trial and error. If you decide to go that route, ask if genetic testing would help speed up the process by narrowing down something that will work with your chemistry. 

Also keep trying different types of therapy. I tried talk therapy, group therapy, a 12 step program, cbt, dbt, and mbsr. Eventually I was referred to a trauma therapist who specializes in EMDR. It's typically used to treat PTSD, which I don't have, but more and more is being found to help with other disorders. I didn't think I had trauma and so i wasn't sure it was a good fit but i was wrong. I've struggled for the last 15 years and am glad I didn't give up because I'm finally getting real help and seeing real progress. I don't expect it to fix all of me, but it gives me hope that there are still things out there. Keep trying. </TEXT>

It's kinda the same idea psychologist Peter Levine talks about in Walking the Tiger, that in nature animals discharge tension and trauma by shaking it out. I think Bessel van der Kolk talks about it too in The Body Keeps the Score.

Also EMDR therapy is worth looking in to if your therapist doesn't specialize in it.

And since you're an adult, you can get counseling anywhere and your parents don't have to be involved. Even if you're on their insurance (if you're in the US), they'll only send an explanation of benefits but can't share why you're seeing someone or any of the details. If they ask you about it, just say you wanted to talk to someone. No big deal. </TEXT>

"I would really appreciate some extra support" or "I need you to know I'm safe and not suicidal and will come to you if I need more help."). If they start asking too many questions, tell them you're not comfortable talking about all of it with them and will talk about it with your therapist, but that you just wanted to keep them in the loop.

<TEXT> You could call the suicide prevention line and ask what to do in that situation. They might be able to help. The police will likely just do a wellness check but it doesnt hurt to ask. If you're seeing someone for your PTSD and depression, you could also get their input. If he's at immediate risk with the means to do it, obviously call the police or an ambulance. 

I had a boyfriend who threatened himself when I broke up with him and it was very intense. Of course it was a different situation and he was living with his parents at the time, so I called his mother so they could keep an eye out. 

Also just gonna mention EMDR for trauma is really great if you haven't tried it. 

Hope things smooth over soon. Take care! </TEXT>

<TEXT> So sorry you're going through this. My understanding is that when we experience trauma and the brain gets overwhelmed, it sort of pulls the ripcord and is like "I'm outta here," which protects us in the moment but it makes it hard to recall later. If you've seen the movie Inside Out, trauma is like one of the core memories getting dropped and splintering off all over the place. It isn't stored the same as regular memories. Instead of being one cohesive memory, you have bits and pieces all over the place that you might stumble across from time to time and are otherwise unaware of. Have you considered trauma therapy or something like EMDR? 

Also there's a book called [The Body Keeps The Score](https://www.amazon.com/Body-Keeps-Score-Healing-Trauma/dp/0143127748/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_3?_encoding=UTF8 pd_rd_i=0143127748 pd_rd_r=309fdc89-a0c3-11e8-9945-2f4179e16a7b pd_rd_w=0MHG2 pd_rd_wg=u9wop pf_rd_i=desktop-dp-sims pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER pf_rd_p=1475879231140687736 pf_rd_r=29HE6NFK16RX3BQDW26R pf_rd_s=desktop-dp-sims pf_rd_t=40701 psc=1 refRID=29HE6NFK16RX3BQDW26R) by Bessel van der Kolk that is really good and worth a read.

<TEXT> Ask about genetic testing for antidepressants. It can help find which drugs work best with your chemistry faster than trial and error (otherwise it can take a long, frustrating time to find what works for you- it took me years!). Also keep in mind that meds don't make you "happy." They keep your head above water so you can work on the junk that's underneath it all. You're the one doing all the really hard work, and needing medicine to give you that initial boost isn't a cop-out. While depression can take the rug out from under us, remember that happiness is a learned skill.

She's a therapist on YouTube with a ton of helpful videos and resources, a really supportive community and website, and she does livestreams where you can ask questions. You can also ask under a Monday video when she first posts (she answers as many as she can for the first hour). Lots about depression, suicide, self harm, parents and getting help when parents aren't supportive, etc. Just something that might help until you're able to get help on your own. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Try sleeping somewhere else. Sometimes a change of scenery can help, like sleeping on the couch instead of in your bed. Sleep with a nightlight or the light on or with your pet. Sleeping on my back makes it worse for me so I try to avoid that. Sometimes the best thing i can do is to accept that I'm in for a rough few nights (for me, it usually comes in clusters). Do what you can to ease stress in the day. If it continues to persist, see a sleep specialist. Also I think therapist Kati Morton has a vid on this that might be worth looking in to. Hope you find something that works for you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry your dad is being like that... How about something like tech school where you learn a skill? Or an online charter school? If you're in the US, you could also ask your guidance counselor about getting a 504 plan plan or IEP. If you're diagnosed with any mental health issues, they'll help you with accommodations to make it better. They also offer accommodations at college. Keep fighting and save your money so you can get your own place when the time is right. A degree will absolutely make things easier later in life so if it can be helped, I'd encourage you to stick it out. Also I really hope you're seeing a therapist? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ohh I feel this! Some things that help me are to tell myself, "I'm not going to all the dirty dishes that have piled up, but just put away the clean ones." Or, "I'm not going to clean the whole living room, but the next time I go out to the kitchen, I'm going to grab the trash off the end table." It helps to acknowledge that it's okay to  not feel like doing something, but then do it anyway. I can be unmotivated and annoyed and switch the laundry over at the same time. Feelings don't always have to match actions.

Also this sounds weird but putting my shoes on changes my whole day. Same with covering my head (like a bandana or something). It makes me feel like I'm in Getting Stuff Done mode even if at first I feel like lead, stuck to the couch. Keep fighting.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I don't think younger posters' problems are any less serious, but what I hear in your post is that you're in a different place than many here and want to find people who are in a similar situation. 

Depression in someone dealing with adult responsibilities can look very different, effecting different parts of their life than depression in someone who is in their freshman year of college (or high school). Each has a unique set of circumstances and stressors. Maybe your struggles are in the context of being more settled in life (maybe you're married), rather than going through a period of transition (like a breakup). Or maybe the culture has changed so rapidly that you can't relate to people who are submerged and on the frontlines anymore because you're over it, and your identity is already established instead of forming. Maybe you're needs are different and what you're needing is a community of like minded people to build you up, rather than a place to vent and wallow and shout to the void that you're hurting. Maybe you're looking for deep connection and the internet isn't even the right place to find it.

Without knowing the whole story of people's lives, some posts come across as dramatic or over reactions. Not that either of those aren't legitimate places to be in (sometimes we need to be dramatic or over react because no one is listening or our tank is full). No one's pain is greater or lesser because pain is pain and everyone has different levels of resiliency so it's impossible to compare, but sometimes you need someone who has been down a similar path so that you feel heard and like you're not going crazy on an island all alone. 

You could create all sorts of caveats and I wouldn't call it "gatekeeping." I've only been on this subreddit for a few months but it seems to be a catch-all. Which in some ways is good because you can help pull others up who are where you've been before. Ultimately we're all dealing with the same monster here. But I definitely feel the struggle of what you're talking about.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had a small, flat red spot on my knuckle that I thought was maybe a bug bite or maybe I washed my hands too much (which has caused me to have red knuckles in the past but this spot was so small it didn't seem like that was the issue). It didn't look like a typical bug bite for me, and it didn't itch or anything. Plus I don't really go outside often so it seemed unlikely to be something like a misquote bite. The red spot lasted 4-5 days and now the redness has gone away completely but there is a hard lump in it's place. It's been about 10 days since it turned into a bump. No other symptoms, no fever, no rash (my husband had lyme several years ago so I've seen a bullseye).

<TEXT> Not to discourage you or tell you what to do, but I had a terrible time with duloxetine. Being on it didn't help much, but I stayed on it for over 3 years anyway because I figured something was better than nothing. But coming off was a [nightmare](https://www.drugwatch.com/cymbalta/side-effects/). I was sick, initially with flu-like symptoms and cold sweats that lasted for over a week, and then brain zaps that continued for 4 months. The makers for Cymbalta don't have an established protocol for discontinuing the drug safely, and they misrepresent the number of people who experience withdrawal claiming that it's about 1% but you'll find thousands and thousands of testimonies and lawsuits that say otherwise. I have been on other antidepressants but never had another experience like it. Make sure you do your homework before taking anything. That said, you can always ask for genetic testing to see what medications work best with your body chemistry. Hope you find what works for you- everyone is different. </TEXT>

There's nothing wrong with you- you've had other stuff going on that took the forefront. The right woman isn't going to judge you for it. Seems immature of your family friend to even ask- something you'd expect in high school or college, but you're an adult and it's really no one's business. Not everyone is on the same path or does things at the same time anyway and that's okay!

<TEXT> I was on duloxetine for a long time and coming off was seriously hell. I had to taper slowly over months and months with my doctor's supervision, and then when I finally stopped taking it I experienced flu-like symptoms (which lasted over a week) and shocking sensations whenever I moved my eyes from side to side (lasted 3-4 months). Having loved ones to support me while I laid on the couch sick for days, unable to take myself to the bathroom or get up and make something to eat, was really helpful. I also tried to sleep through the withdrawal and when that wasn't working because I couldn't sleep, watching favorite movies to distract was my go-to. In the end, I was glad for it to be over. Other antidepressants I've had no problem coming off of. Hope it goes well for you! </TEXT>

One thing that has helped my husband when he's depressed is to invite him to do small things (ie "Hey, I'd love it if we could just go for a short walk down to the end of the block after dinner." or "Can we stop for ice cream on our way home from getting groceries?") I try not to guilt him into doing anything but also don't let my fear of him feeling bad stop me from expressing things that need to be said or trying to help. It's also helpful to externalize the depression. So instead of saying something like, "When you spent all day playing video games it made me angry," try something along the lines "I had a hard time when depression came into our family and now it's everywhere- it's running our relationship and it's important to me to do something about it together." By putting the blame on the depression and not him, it can help reduce some of those feelings of guilt. He isn't his mental illness, and separating them and putting the blame where it belongs can highlight that he's not at fault.

Maybe check out some of Kati Morton's videos on [marriage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwauQN_3WIk) and [depression](https://www.youtube.com/user/KatiMorton/search?query=depression). Hope things get better soon.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You can ask any therapist if they will work on a sliding scale, which is income and (in)ability to pay based. Most therapists reserve slots just for this. There are also free clinics in most cities you could look into. Don't make yourself sicker just to get the help you need if it can at all be avoided. </TEXT>

You're role isn't to "fix" her or be her therapist, but just to be her friend and walk with her as she heals. Be encouraging and genuine, building her up by pointing out her worth (ie. "I'm so glad you were able to come along and help us with \[volunteering\]. \[Name something she did well and how you appreciate the help\].") without being patronizing.

<TEXT> Please reach out and get the help you need. Call Samaritans, go to A E, whatever you have to do if you are unsafe. These feelings are treatable, recovery is a real thing you can have, and the thoughts won't last your whole life even if it seems that way right now.

You'll certainly never be in a relationship if you kill yourself. You deserve to have deep meaningful relationships and love and good friendships, and those things are out there. Keep looking and you'll find it. Honestly no one cares how old you are when you have your first girlfriend or lose your virginity. I had friends in college who didn't have their first girlfriend until they were 26 (they're married now). They felt similar to you. Not everyone is on the same path or does things in the same order. Anyone who mocks you is childish and not worth your friendship. 

Keep fighting. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey sorry you're going through such a difficult time right now... reading your post felt like re-living my high school experience. Have you talked to your therapist about wanting to be on meds but your parents not allowing it? Once you turn 18 you won't need their permission. Hang in there.

I went through several therapists and felt like it wasn't enough. It can mean a few things: Maybe you need to see them more often or need a more intensive level of care, maybe you aren't "clicking" as well as you'd like to, or maybe the type of therapy offered isn't a great fit and you need something else.

I have anxiety and depression and found talk therapy was better than nothing, but didn't realize a lot of my issues came from trauma. I was eventually (years later) referred to a [trauma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8oDU3dy7Xg list=PL_loxoCVsWqyg4x9m6VqUfz0PmYaZIR0p) therapist who specializes in EMDR, which is different from talk therapy. It's most often used for PTSD but more and more is being used to treat anxiety, depression, and little "t" traumas. Not saying what's right for me is right for you, nor implying you've experienced trauma, but that EMDR is worth looking in to. 

Hope something here helps. Keep fighting. </TEXT>

DBT is great for BPD and for symptoms needing emotional regulation but it might be better to start with something more general.  You could have an eval done at a DBT center and ask if you're a good fit or if something else might be better. They'd be able to refer you to someone else if need be. You could also go to the DBT center if your mom insists, but get a second opinion from the counselor on campus (honestly, I'd start with the therapist on campus but that's just me). It's your treatment. You deserve to get the help you want. Hope it goes well!

Also depends where you live. If you're in the US, you can see any therapist and get an evaluation done. If you're in the UK, you'll likely need a referral. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Whenever I'm out, I find myself scanning arms. Sometimes I just want to say, "I get it! You're not alone!" It's hard because I feel connected to them and they don't even know. But I think the best thing to do in those situations is to treat her like you would want to be treated. It's tempting to glance at her arms and empathize with and project your experiences onto her, but see her first before you see her scars. Be friendly and ask how her day is going. Make small talk about weekend plans and things you're looking forward to. If you see her regularly enough and you develop a bit of a connection, invite her to see a movie or out for coffee with you and your friends. I'm not saying ignore and minimize what she's going through, but remember there's more to her and help draw it out. Kind words and friendly faces can go a long way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you're in the US, you can ask any therapist if they will work on a sliding scale which is based on income and (in)ability to pay to make it affordable. Many will. There are also free clinics out there, so have a look around. You deserve to get the help you need.  Maybe look into a therapist who specializes in EMDR. Someone who specializes in grief or trauma. There are also groups like Celebrate Recovery or GriefShare, which are free to attend. CR is a 12 step program that has support groups broken up into issues, ones specifically for depression and life issues. Anyone showing up to work through their struggles is not unfit. There are always food stamps, WIC, and other organizations to help afford/supply food. Look around and reach out. 

I lost someone to suicide when I was "too young to remember." That's total bullshit. She will feel it her whole life and she'll be broken. You do not know that her life will be better without you- that's a lie your illness is telling you. Your daughter needs you. Don't pass your pain onto her. Get help. Be there to see her life, be there to set the example, be there because you love her and no one should grow up with a piece missing if anything whatsoever can be done about it.

<TEXT> Maybe check out some of the videos about self harm and depression on therapist kati morton's YouTube channel. She also has a free workbook on her website to help at Katimorton.com. Obviously don't call her out in front of other people, and if she doesn't want to talk about it, dont force her to or keep bringing it up. She'll talk about it when she's ready. Encourage to get the help she needs... whether that's talking to parents or the school counselor (even if she'snot ready to talk about the self harm, she could still talk about whatever is going on that's triggering it). Just keep being her friend, let her know you're there for her, and know that having someone you can talk to and even have a laugh with really helps. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I saw the campus counselor my entire time at college. She was so wonderful. The school didn't think anything of it because it's confidential. When I was really struggling with my mental health, she was able to advocate for me and get me accommodations for class. For a time I saw a grad assistant who was practicing under the counselor and that wasn't a great, just because they were so new and inexperienced. But it wasn't all bad either. The GA was friendly and had a lot of fresh ideas to help me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Consider trying a community college for a year or two. You might find you really like it because it's nothing like high school. If you're diagnosed with depression you can even get accommodations through student support services (things like extra time on exams or a private room to take tests, early access to power points, note takers, etc), and most campuses have a counselor available to students. Then you can transfer to a 4 year program if you feel it's right for you. Kinda like testing the waters but without as much pressure or commitment. Or, take a year off to get the help you need with your depression and focus on recovery. It's treatable, and when you feel like you have nothing what you really have is a blank slate with which to create. Then you'll really have something to write about. But don't do nothing, as tempting as it is. Whether you go to college or not, things can't stay like they are forever. There are better days ahead. Be here to see them. Keep fighting. </TEXT>

Not saying you're therapist is "bad" but maybe she's not the right fit for you anymore. It can happen when you've been seeing the same person for a while. You could also bring it up with her and express your frustration just like you did here. Maybe it's something you can work out and she'll have some suggestions. You deserve to get the help you need.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sure thing. My roommate and I went through something similar. Some things I did to help her were setting up a regular time every week to go for coffee or waffles or take a walk to the park. She was often up nights and so I tried to be quiet when she was sleeping during the day, but sometimes she wanted me to wake her up by a certain time for a class. We went to CR together, which helped us maintain healthy boundaries. While she was working on her stuff, I worked on my own. Sometimes she didn't want help and I had to respect her space. Sometimes she was still irritable even when I picked a calm time to talk. Try not to take it personally if this happens and just continue being a friend as best you can. Make sure your own needs are getting met, too. It's okay if you need to step back.

The scariest part was when my roommate switched from being casually suicidal, saying she wished things would end and expressing how stressful things were, to being actively suicidal. Look it up and make sure you know the signs. Alcohol can make it worse. My roommate didn't struggle with alcoholism (though I knew others who did) but she began practicing how to tie a noose with a rope from one of her climbing courses. She didn't know I saw it in her room. I immediately talked to the school counselor who took it from there and got her the support she needed. My friend's roommate became isolated and one day left his apartment without a coat in the dead of winter, no wallet, no ID. They found him months later. Some times you miss the signs.

And know it's okay to talk to someone for support yourself. Counselors deal with this a lot on college campuses and they might have tips and tricks to help navigate it. Plus it never hurts to give them the heads up about a struggling student (they'll only break confidentiality if there is a serious, immediate risk of danger). Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Have you tried talking to her about it when she's feeling alright? Maybe something along the lines of "hey I noticed this happens a lot and I'm not sure how to handle it... what do you need from me [within reason of course - you're not responsible for "fixing" her] when you're going through a difficult time?"

If you guys are also friends in addition to roommates, it's okay to have a heart to heart and let her know how you're feeling, too. But I'd advise against doing it when she's in a mood or throwing too much at her in one go and causing overwhelm. maybe suggest you do something fun together to ease the stress, or maybe encourage her to get connected with the counseling center or student support services (if she is diagnosed she could get accommodations to help her grades). Or if she's interested in other support, like going to AA or Celebrate Recovery, you could offer to go with her. 

There is also therapist Kati Morton on youtube who has a lot of info and resources on just about any issue you might have (depression, alcoholism, mental health and school, supporting and talking to people you care about,  etc). Anything she hasn't covered you can ask under a Monday video (she hangs out in the comments for the first hour after its posted). It's worth checking out.  Hope you find something there that helps! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I try to remind myself that those movies aren't real anyway. Not everyone has a "typical" high school experience. A lot of us were depressed, alone, and anxious. A lot of us were outcasts. So in that way, I feel like I fit right in. It's actually pretty normal. I found my best friend years later outside of high school, and I've never been a party person because of the anxiety.  So what? We aren't all destined for the same timeline or experiences because our stories are as individual as we are, but that doesn't mean we can't still find ourselves a friend group to hang out with, or have our first relationship, or whatever. Happiness is a learned skill and we can practice it. We can get back some of the things we lost.

I missed a lot of milestones... driving, prom, graduation (I finished school, skipped the ceremony), trying new things, having fun... I had to take time to grieve the things my mental illness stole from me and my childhood. It's okay to feel like you were robbed. I grew up under a weight. Eventually I came to a place where I didn't feel I missed out so much as I feel my path is just different, and that's okay too. It's made me more compassionate and I really feel for the underdog. Even so sometimes I wish I could've had the things I was "supposed" to have. Movies remind me of that, too, and it makes me sad. But I had something else and I'm finding the things I wanted then, now. It's okay. Just means there are things to look forward to.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Call around to different psychiatrists and ask, let them know it's urgent and that you've had a recent attempt, and you'd like to get in asap. They usually have space for urgent appts. Otherwise, many schedule 2-4 weeks out which is probably about the same as trying to get in at a new doctor's office. But a psychiatrist will have a wayyy better knowledge of which meds might fit you best. They'll likely prescribe something at the end of your first appointment, after you finish your assessment, and you can get it filled right away. Sometimes it takes a few tries to find the right medicine. If you want a faster route to finding a medication that's a good fit, ask about genetic testing.  An an ER visit would likely get you a referral and if you're admittted they might put you on meds short term (which is stupid because most take 4-6 weeks to become fully effective, but an ER can at least keep you safe if you're feeling suicidal again... go if you need to go!). If you've never had your thyroid tested, that might be worth looking into as well since hypothyroidism can cause depression and it's pretty common. 

I'm sure you've heard this but, meds work best in combination with the right therapy.

<TEXT> If you're in the US you can call around to any therapist and ask if they are willing to work on a sliding scale, which is income and (in)ability based to make it affordable. The clinic sounds like a good place to start. Let them decide whether you're a good fit for their services (if they think someone else might be more appropriate, they'll refer you). They'll do an intake appointment where they ask basic questions and get you talking about whatever brought you in. If there are things you definitely want to remember to say and are afraid you'll forget or get side-tracked, you can write them down ahead of time and bring it with you. You can also ask any questions about how the whole thing works.

Different clinics do things differently, obviously. But mine had me see a therapist for intake assessment, then a psychiatrist, and then set me up with a therapist they thought might be a good fit for me (not all at the same visit though). If you don't click with whoever you end up seeing, it's okay to ask for referrals. It took me a few tries to find the right one and once I did, it made such a difference!

It's great that you're considering getting the help you need and deserve. Keep fighting and good luck:) </TEXT>

<TEXT> F in mid-20s with hypothyroid, taking synthroid 50, buspar 15 3x daily. I've had pain in my lower right abdomen for the last 3 years on and off. It's in the same spot and doesn't move around but comes in spurts, lasting a few seconds at time, and will continue for a couple days and then go away completely only to come back again a week or two later. Feels achy, a spot about the size of two quarters laying next to each other. In the past I've had undiagnosed stomach pain and was on Carafate but it's been a couple years since then and that was more to do with my actual stomach and was a totally different feeling. I've had ultrasounds of my appendix and ovary and they're fine. Sometimes I'll put a heating pad on it but it doesn't really help. Any ideas? Am I dying? </TEXT>

<TEXT> This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhaWIVK6ERI) is a good overview. It's typically used to treat PTSD (big "T" trauma) but more and more it's being used for people who've experienced little "t" traumas, anxiety disorders, and many other issues. A nice way to think about EMDR, if you've ever seen the movie Inside Out, is to imagine one of the memory orbs shattering and splintering off all over the place. EMDR uses bilateral stimulation of your brain to replicate REM sleep. It's sort of like the characters Sadness, Anger, Fear, etc going around finding the pieces and putting them back together so you can process the trauma and heal.  

I found a trauma therapist with a PsyD who specializes in EMDR so I see her for both regular talk therapy mixed with EMDR sessions. She uses tappers that buzz in my hands along with headphones that alternate tones. It's really strange at first but you get over that pretty quickly lol. She has me focus on a negative experience or thought and my mind starts to bounce around from thing to thing as the buzzers and tones go back and forth. Then she'll stop and we'll talk about whatever came up- a new memory, a feeling in my body, a word I got stuck on, etc. Sometimes it gets intense but you're always in control and can stop whenever you like, and the therapist uses techniques to help you cope. When you look back over the session, you can kind of see things coming together and making more sense and you don't feel so overwhelmed or triggered by it. 

There is also a great book that talks about EMDR called[ The Body Keeps the Score](https://www.amazon.com/Body-Keeps-Score-Healing-Trauma/dp/0143127748/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1532805707 sr=8-1 keywords=the+body+keeps+the+score) by Bessel van der Kolk, which again focuses mainly on PTSD seen in veterans, but I found I could relate to a lot, and it explains how EMDR works in the brain.

I've also heard [Waking the Tiger: Healing Trauma](https://www.amazon.com/Waking-Tiger-Healing-Peter-Levine/dp/155643233X/ref=pd_sim_14_4?_encoding=UTF8 pd_rd_i=155643233X pd_rd_r=7b6a72a4-929b-11e8-9203-a799349ec03c pd_rd_w=OmwwJ pd_rd_wg=BwNCm pf_rd_i=desktop-dp-sims pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER pf_rd_p=2610440344683357453 pf_rd_r=N9W6WNRNT9093PWC151W pf_rd_s=desktop-dp-sims pf_rd_t=40701 psc=1 refRID=N9W6WNRNT9093PWC151W) by Peter A. Levine is worth the read, but haven't gotten to it yet myself, as well as [The Courage to Heal Workbook](https://www.amazon.com/Courage-Heal-Survivors-Sexual-Anniversary/dp/0061284335/ref=sr_1_2?s=books ie=UTF8 qid=1532805877 sr=1-2 keywords=the+courage+to+heal+workbook).

It still effects me because I cant go anywhere alone or listen to music with both headphones in. I couldn't call it abuse or harrassment cause nothing really happened, he never touched me, and felt I was in this gray zone. But it was still violating in a way I can't explain. I felt threatened and unsafe. I can't imagine what it would've felt like if I lived with the person doing this. Might be good to get into therapy with someone who specializes in trauma...  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's so easy to put pressure on yourself to have everything figured out but the truth is that no one really does, especially in your 20s. If you're living with your parents, it's okay, that's where you're at right now. Do whatever you can to move forward. I even moved back in with parents after I got married... talk about feeling like a child. It's hard. And I know how easy it is to shut yourself in your room. Start with small manageable changes. You don't have to do it all at once. It's good to write stuff out the way you are cause it can makes things more clear. If anyone read it in real life, I bet more would be able to relate than you think. Anyway. Keep fighting. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's no surprise that the urge is getting stronger as your depression is "lifting." More likely it's just burying it or creating a distraction and isn't really making the depression "go away." As others have said it "works" but at a high cost, and it's not sustainable. The self harm just gets worse and worse and will never be enough. Not to mention it creates so much secrecy and everything in your life suddenly revolves around it and it's all you ever think about... you lose yourself in it.

<TEXT> Not a doctor but can definitely relate. I passed out for the first time around 13 and then continued to have episodes like you describe, especially on my period. I find it helps to know my limits (ie heat makes it worse, have to stay hydrated). And when I can feel it coming, I'll sit or lie down, drink some water, and tense my leg muscles which sounds weird but is apparently supposed to help. Also deep breathing is useful because it calms your central nervous system, which plays a role in vasovagal syncope. Doesnt hurt to get checked out by a doctor though! It could also be something like POTS. Hope you find something that works for you:) </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's the same test as Porencephaly mentioned, done inpatient. I feel for your son. It's so hard when doctors don't have the answers you're looking for, things keep coming back negative, and you just want to know what the problem is so you can get a start on dealing with it. Tests are exhausting in themselves, especially when you're young and scared.

Try to keep his spirits up by finding new activities that are fun to replace the ones he's used to (like making art instead of watching TV- do science projects at the kitchen table, make youtube videos with his friends, or if he's into super heroes he could create his own comic, read, etc). My seizures got to the point where I was afraid to go anywhere, do anything, or try new things, and all I could manage was to lay on the couch and cry. You've gotta help him fight that because it can make you sicker. You sound like you're doing everything you can do help him and to find the answers. I hope you've got support for yourself, too. Hang in there. Wish you both the best. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been on many medications over the years with little success. I never had horrible reactions but experienced things like headaches,  nausea, and dizziness. With one medication in particular, after taking it for 3 years with no improvement, I had intense withdrawal symptoms. But last year I was switched to yet another medication, and finally started feeling relief. In combination with the right therapy and therapist, the right medication has helped me improve. I never thought it could help. It just took time to find the right one for me. Of course this whole process could've been sped up if I had known there is genetic testing available to help narrow down which meds might work better with your body chemistry. Good luck to anyone on this journey, and to those who decide to look for alternatives to medication altogether! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Idk how things work in the UK but you might benefit from EMDR or seeing a trauma therapist. EMDR is not traditional talk therapy and helped me when other things seemed to not work (like mindfulness based stress reduction, cbt and dbt). It's typically used for PTSD but more and more research is finding it can be really effective for anxiety disorders, depression, and trauma. Some studies even show it effective when working with addiction. Worth looking into if you're able. And I'm sure you know this but therapy works best in combination with medication. It took me over a decade to find the right med for me but I'm so glad I stuck it out. Also I liked Celebrate Recovery (CR) better than AA because they name their Higher Power, if that was your issue with it. Some people I attended with weren't Christians but everyone was welcome and the support was invaluable. 

Keep fighting. Hope you find something that works for you.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not a doctor but maybe look into getting a video-EEG. When my first one didn't show anything, the v-EEG came back abnormal. I had elevated brain activity (but it wasn't enough to be epilepsy and didn't correlate w my seizures). Ultimately I was diagnosed with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. Considering how young your son is, whatever is going on with him is probably different bc PNES is often caused by trauma. But still look into the v-eeg bc it's more accurate, done over a few days to a week, and will give the doctors a fuller picture. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Keep it simple. Tell them 1)what you're struggling with 2)how long it's been going on and 3)what you need from them (set up therapy for you, ride to appts, etc). They might have questions. Keep your answers to the point but it's also okay to say you're not comfortable talking about all of it and that you just wanted to let them know so you can get help. 

If they aren't supportive, don't give up. There are ways to still get help like talking to your school counselor, maybe a youth pastor if you're religious, favorite teacher, or even depending on your age and where you live you can still set up therapy for yourself as long as you're able to get a ride, pay for it, and have discussed the reason your parents are staying out of it. 

You can also check out therapist Kati Morton on youtube. She has tons of vids and resources on depression, parents, getting help and finding a good therapist, etc. Her website has a really supportive community and she does livestreams from time to time so you can ask questions (or ask under a Monday vid on youtube as soon as it's posted- she answers as many as she can for the first hour). 

It's great that you're doing what it takes to reach out and get the help you need. Keep fighting! </TEXT>

Test the waters without overwhelming yourself. Maybe your uni also offers an online componant for certain courses that would take some of the burden off.

<TEXT> You'll need a bunch of techniques. The fact is, nothing works like cutting and it often takes several things to curb the urge. Most often I use urge surfing (https://portlandpsychotherapyclinic.com/2011/11/riding-wave-using-mindfulness-help-cope-urges/) along with expressive coping strategies, like writing down what I'm experiencing, talking to someone I trust, or singing songs that match my feeling at the top of my lungs and maybe having a cry. Getting outside, even to sit on my porch, helps in general with my depression and sometimes with urges bc a change of scenery can interrupt whatever is going on in my head and gives me a bit of space between the urge and the action. Also therapist Kati Morton's free SH workbook. (https://www.katimorton.com/sh-workbook-vol-1-sign-up/). Hope you find something that works for you! </TEXT>

Idk what country you're in now, but maybe look for friends outside of school. Maybe a yoga (or whatever you're into) class. It gives you something in common with the other person from the start and you know you'll see them on a regular basis. Or maybe a church youth/young adults group if you're religious. Find something fun to look forward to, like the Twenty One Pilots concert (it's really easy to make friends there bc everyone has anxiety haha). There are people out there who don't care how much money you have. Keep looking. Senior year is hard enough because everyone is in a period of transition or has a really close knit groups of friends who they've known for years, and I can't imagine having to adjust to a new place in addition to that. You're not alone. Hope things get better soon! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have bad anxiety too. Twenty one pilots ERS was the first big thing I did while recovering from agoraphobia. Crowds are terrible, the noise is overwhelming, and it's chaos. What helped me was to get [these](https://www.amazon.com/Etymotic-ETY-Plugs-Fidelity-Earplugs-Standard/dp/B0015WJQ7A/ref=sr_1_4_a_it?ie=UTF8 qid=1531921406 sr=8-4 keywords=earplugs+for+concert) earplugs, aisle seats (you can step out if you need a breather), and to have someone with me who could take charge. Bring family, bring a friend. I had to use a wheelchair to get to my seat as I often pass out in crowded spaces, and doing so gave me a bit more room than others and I didn't feel like I was being pressed in upon as much. I still had a panic attack but avoided passing out because I was sitting down.

You can also contact the venue ahead of time and ask any questions you have (where do you go, what can bring with you like bottled water, find out where EMS will be if you're having an emergency, etc). Check maps and photos of the venue to get a feel for it and kinda figure out where you'll be sitting. If you're on medication, take it. And get a hotel really close by if you have to travel any amount. That way if it's all too much, you have a place nearby to go. Plus it really helps at the end of the night when everyone is trying to get out of there and your bed is right up the street. When the concert is over, don't try to be the first to leave. Wait it out.

The thing that startled me the most was how everything was so loud I could feel it vibrate in my chest, but after a minute or two it was really exciting and with my earplugs in, it was tolerable. Enjoyable. I even took them out a couple times lol. Many people in the clique struggle with anxiety and depression so you're in good company. Everyone around you is on your side and happy you came despite the challenges you face. We're all there because TOP means something deeply personal in our lives, and we're all there for the shared experience. Close your eyes, take a few deep breaths- it's like you're in a dream. You're safe, you're alive. There are still a lot of days I'm not able to leave my house. But I'm going this year... I hope you do too! You won't be disappointed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sometimes I imagine I'm dreaming again (making up a better ending of whatever crappy dream woke me up) and somehow it just helps. Also praying if you're into that... it puts my mind at ease because then I'm talking to someone about whatever is racing through my head. And it worked for the disciples xD Works for me. Another thing you can do is keep a pen and paper next to your bed and write down the stuff you're thinking about. That way you know it's safe to stop thinking about it because it's not going anywhere. Kinda like putting it in a Pensieve.  And I might be too old for it, but I sleep with a stuffed animal. Also when I have a nightmare I invite my cat to cuddle on my chest. It's also helpful to not look at the clock. The more I check the time, the more anxious I get and the harder it is to sleep. Best to just accept that you'll fall back asleep eventually and get the rest you need. Even if it's not tonight, sleep is coming. Hope you find something that works for you.

<TEXT> You might be overthinking things a bit, because honestly most people experience these things at some point. Maybe anxiety is tripping you up, or maybe something like ADHD. Or it could just be who you are. There's nothing wrong with any of that. I'd caution against falling into the misguided belief, though, that there is only one kind of intelligence and one way to get there. And while it may seem like you're friends are excelling and that certain things come easier to them, you might only be seeing their highlight reel. Everyone has areas that are difficult for them.

I think what you're really asking is, How can I be exceptional? How can I be better than my parents? Absolutely do your best! Study your ass off. Try mnemonics like the [memory palace](https://www.wikihow.com/Build-a-Memory-Palace) or experiment with different [learning styles](http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml). See if there's a mentoring program you could participate in for college students to connect with high school. Check with your guidance counselor about getting (or being) a tutor. Make up silly raps about whatever you're learning with your friends. Surround yourself with people smarter than you because they will pull you up. But quit comparing. You're enough as you are. Life isn't about being better than others or striving for perfection. "The stone that sits on the very top of the mountain's mighty face doesn't think it's more important than the stones that form the base." (Stephen Schwartz).

I attended both a community college and a "good" college and I'm telling you it's not the end all be all. Sure, you can go to a great liberal arts school, a prestigious university even, and get the grades and prove yourself. I'm not knocking it- it's a solid future full of promise. But you can also go to a community college or tech school and make a better living than some professions after earning a BA. You can pick a career path that you know doesn't pay well and be challenged in ways you've never thought of.  You can even drop out but never stop learning about the things that matter most to you. Sometimes the most difficult lessons are those learned through unconventional means. Your worth isn't tied to your GPA, whether it is high or low. What really matters is your authenticity, passion to learn and grow and give, and humility in doing so. That's what makes you intelligent.  You can have all the information and still be an idiot. Aim for more.

It might be a good idea to explore why you feel you need to "go far." What does that even mean? What does it feel, look, sound like? How will you know when you're there? Whose standards are you measuring by? What if it doesn't go as planned?

Also scoring on the SATs was different when your mom took them, so that's not as low as it seems.

Okay, I'm stepping off my soap box. I think it's great that you want to be the best version of yourself. Keep it up:) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Of course it matters. Child-on-child sexual abuse is a big deal, and it absolutely impacts you later in life. It's amazing that you're starting to speak up about it and I hope you're able to find the right help (like a [good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6WaMQ7q0EE) therapist who specializes in trauma and abuse, or EMDR).  There are books out there that might be worth a read... The Courage to Heal Workbook by Laura Davis is a good start. Also there is therapist Kati Morton on youtube who has many videos on abuse, depression, anxiety and trauma recovery. Acknowledging what happened to you is in no way looking for an excuse. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Urges can flare up when there are stressful things going on. If you haven't cut in a while and are starting to notice more urges, look around and see what might be underneath all that, and then address the need as best you can. I get more urges when I'm hungry, angry, lonely, overwhelmed, or tired. If I can identify what's causing it, I can take steps to deal with it in a better, more sustainable way. I would argue that recovery is more about building up resiliency and healthy coping skills (and continuing to seek new coping skills as different things can work at different times) than it is about willpower. It's okay to acknowledge, "I feel like cutting today," but know that you don't have to act on it.  It's a process, not perfection. Keep fighting because the urges get less and less over time and when you do about it, it's fleeting. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey sorry you're going through such a difficult time right now... Call around to different therapists and ask if they will work on a sliding scale, which is income based and takes into account financial hardship to make it affordable. Many will. Also check for clinics, as some are able to provide a certain number of sessions for free. At the very least, you could ask them for a referral to other resources for support. Meetup.com often has support groups. If you're religious, check with your church or whatever to see if they offer pastoral counseling. There is also therapist Kati Morton on youtube. She has a ton of vids, resources, and a very supportive community.  You can ask her questions on livestreams and under Monday videos (she replys for the first hr after posting).

<TEXT> I hit a wall in treating my GAD and depression after many years of trying all kinds of therapies and medications. It felt like talk therapy was better than nothing but that it wasn't really doing much to help me feel better. My therapist referred me to someone who specializes in EMDR,  which is typically used for big T traumas and PTSD but also has been shown to help little t traumas that have accumulated (like being raised in a dysfunctional family or having a lot of overwhelming things happen at once). They are using it more and more to treat things like anxiety and depression because it helps your brain heal itself by using bilateral stimulation, simulating REM sleep. EMDR has been a miracle in my life and is definitely something I'd recommend looking in to. Hope you find something that works for you.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm so sorry you're going through this. Have you considered getting [therapy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6WaMQ7q0EE ) yourself? It sounds like you could use the support for your own well-being. I know your days are long already, but maybe having an unbiased sounding board outside of the situation would give some clarity and help you find a solution. They might have resources you could pass along, too, like support groups (not therapy) for mothers with depression or postpartum where she might connect with others in similar situations who understand what she's going through.

If it were me, and obviously I don't know your situation and what's right for me might not be for you, but I would consider moving even though it would mean family would be further away. It sound like it doesn't do much good to have them nearby as it is because she is isolating herself anyway, and it could potentially relieve much of the burden you're feeling with living in such an expensive area. No one is obligated to stay in one place their whole lives, and it might be a solution for this season.

You clearly love your wife very much and will do whatever it takes so far as it is within your power to keep your marriage together. Keep fighting.

And remember that the cringes and pulling away aren't really your wife, it's the disorder.

Take care. </TEXT>

Name and describe 5 things in the room you can see right now (coffee table with ring marks, tall lamp, green grass outside)  
Name and describe 4 things in the room you can feel right now (feet on cold floor, back on firm chair)  
Name 3 things you can hear (air conditioner running, cars passing)  
Name 2 things you can smell (cup of tea, chapstick)  
Name 1 thing you can taste, or 1 good thing about yourself (gum, "I'm a kind person")

Also it helps to do something with my hands, like hold a hot cup of tea or cold glass of water. Tea is nice because the smell is also grounding. Taking my shoes off and putting my feet on the floor. Playing with play-doh. Petting my cat. And I like it when my husband rubs my back or asks me simple, grounding questions to keep me in the moment.

<TEXT> Self harm is such bs... it doesn't even work and no matter how much you do it, it will never be enough. And sure, it might "help" or "feel good" for a second, but in the long run it just buries whatever you're feeling and it comes out later. Self harm literally changes the structure of your brain and the longer you do it, the more difficult it is to undo. I started cutting young, and continued for 14 years. When I stopped, I didn't know how to cope and I lacked the skills to deal. Self harm messed me up in unexpected ways in addition to making me isolated, straining relationships, and scars. I developed a conversion disorder where I would have psychogenic/dissociative seizures. I hope you get help as soon as possible, get into therapy if you aren't already. It's good that you feel horrible about it because that's the healthy part of you trying to protect yourself, knowing it's not a path you really want to go down. It's not worth it. Here's a free [workbook](http://katimorton.us4.list-manage2.com/subscribe?u=f01aa0f56ab012b6ef8891f48 id=198cd8d027) on how to stop.

Psychiatrists can prescribe meds if necessary, but typically that's all they really do, so also look for a therapist who specializes in trauma, preferably someone with a PsyD (not just a masters) as they often see more cases of people with multiple personalities and similar disorders, and will be able to identify what your friend is dealing with. Also check out therapist Kati Morton on youtube.

<TEXT> I had a boyfriend who self harmed in front of me. He was very ill and not in a place to be dating but I thought by dumping him it would only make things worse. But the truth was that he needed serious help that I couldn't give, and us being together was toxic for both of us. He was manipulative and controlling and hurting, and I was codependent. 

He wanted me to understand what he was experiencing, and I think it came from a place of self harm as addiction, like someone who "enjoys" recreational drugs might insist you give it a try and see what you're "missing out on."

Either way, I suggest seeing if he'll get into therapy. If he won't, go yourself because a therapist will be able to tell you what's normal and what's not. Also check out therapist Kati Morton on youtube. She has a ton of vids about depression, self harm, addiction, and even emotional abuse that might help make things more clear.

Ultimately I ended things with that guy (and it was bad), and wish I had done so sooner. Please take care. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It might be worth looking into what resources your school offers- maybe check out the counseling center on campus? I bet they have support groups in addition to therapy. If you're really struggling you can also see about getting accommodations (private room for testing, note takers, extended time on exams, early access to powerpoints, record lectures, etc) which can relieve some of the pressure. Also check out Kati Morton on youtube. She has a lot about depression, anxiety, ADD, how to get through school, and a very supportive community. And if school doesn't work out and you decide it's not for you right now, you can always take a medical leave, no shame. Hope you feel better soon! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I got married the summer after freshman year of college and was in a similar situation. I don't really have any advice, just my experience. While I did have thoughts about maybe jumping ship, as you put it, it wasn't an option for me. I knew the problem would follow wherever I went because it was internal, not coming from something he was doing. It isn't his responsibility to make me happy all the time; I have to make it for myself and he is there to share in that happiness and purpose with me. Eventually I saw that thoughts of leaving him were just my brain and disorder playing out other scenarios in attempt to find an "easy" fix (that's not to say divorce is ever easy, it's definitely not, but just that it seemed a very cut and dry solution). I've also come to understand that happiness is a learned skill that doesn't come naturally to all of us. It can take healing and practice.

I kept getting sicker and sicker, and eventually made the painful decision to leave after three years of trying because I needed to put my health in front of my education. But I was desperate and felt my only options were to drop out or drop dead, and I didn't really want to die. This isn't the best path for everyone going through mental illness in college, of course. We're all different. But I don't regret it.

What made the difference for me was finding the right support. We went to couple's therapy, and I was in regular individual therapy on campus, plus support groups for depression and anxiety, and I attended a free 12-step program called Celebrate Recovery that had a hugely supportive group of women who understood the place I was in. Look for local resources.

It's hard place to be in, trying to balance school and work and marriage and financial struggles, and then to add something like mental illness can make it absolutely overwhelming. But there are people out there who can relate and can walk with you as you go through this.

To ease some of the burdens we faced with money, we signed up for food stamps, qualified for HUD housing (idk if you're in the US or not...). These things really helped us. We also took advantage of Income Based Repayments on student debt and fucked up our finances doing that- putting off student loans, and now we're drowning in them and my husband has had difficulty finding work in his field and I'm unable to work. It's literally the cost of another house payment. Throw whatever money you can at those early on because it will save you so much in the long run. If you skip your morning coffee, put the money aside to throw at the debt. If you get refund checks each semester, take what you need for books and throw the rest at the debt.

It's great that you're trying to work from home to help out as much as possible. It shows you're doing everything you can and have what it takes to make it.

There's a book called The Money Book for the Young, Fabulous, and Broke by Suze Orman which was filled with solid advice we chose to ignore. And check out A Tree Grows In Brooklyn by Betty Smith from the library. If anyone knows the struggle, it's Katie Nolan. And of course, there's therapist Kati Morton on youtube.

Even when it feels like you're trapped and drowning, you're not alone. Feel free to message me if you want. I swear I don't always write a novel and I'm happy to listen if you need to vent. Hope things get better soon3 </TEXT>

If they think you could benefit from medication, they'll refer you to a psychiatrist since they can't prescribe. Therapy and meds work best in combo together, but meds aren't for everyone. And if you find the first therapist you see isn't a good fit, don't be afraid to keep looking. Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know what's wrong with me. My whole life I've felt like there's something wrong, but could never place my finger on what exactly. And I've been doing EMDR therapy for months now. It's stirred some things up that I wasn't expecting. Idk how to deal with them and it's making me feel worse (though my therapist said it will get worse before it gets better). I'm tired of feeling like something is intrinsically broken within me. I'm tired of feeling like God has passed me by, though I'm sure that can't be true. And I'm tired of feeling like there's a thick piece of glass between me and everyone else- like I can see them but not feel them?

Though I've gone 4 years without it, since things have been getting worse, I find myself cutting when I feel sick. Stomach aches, dizziness, pins and needles, my face going numb, random pain in my body.  I feel out of control and my doctor says it's all my anxiety but I struggle to believe it. Idk what I'll do if I start having seizures again. I just want this part of my life to be over. I want to heal.

I'm not sure I'm making sense. But I just wanted to put it out there I guess bc I feel like most people don't get where I'm coming from. Thanks for listening. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey sorry you're going through such a difficult time right now. Look at Elijah in 1 Kings 19:4-14. He begged God to die, but God had compassion and instead of condemning or shaming him for the way he was feeling, took care of his immediate needs, knowing that Elijah felt things were getting to be too much. God will do the same for you if you let him. There's something inside of you that wants to keep fighting, and I pray you lean into that. It's worth it to stay alive. Elijah wasn't the only one to go through that of course- a lot of [others](https://www.crosswalk.com/faith/spiritual-life/7-bible-figures-who-struggled-with-depression.html) did too. One of my favorite passages when I'm feeling this way is Psalm 42 because it's easy to relate to, and I've found the Life Recovery Bible to be invaluable when I'm feeling like I've had enough. 

Also here's a video on creating a [safety plan.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfDruc0QDCc) Please stick around. There are better days coming and you deserve to be here for them. Remember God works all things for good. I hope you feel better soon. </TEXT>

Not to mention it literally changes the structure of your brain so that the neural pathways associating self harm with whatever positive thing you're getting from it are super deep and difficult to undo.

<TEXT> Medication isn't a cure. It's meant to just pull your head above water so you can work on the underlying cause in therapy. It also typically takes several weeks (like 4 to 6) before you reach therapeutic levels in your brain because it has to build up. So if you felt better immediately it might have been a placebo effect (though side effects can certainly be felt right away). I was on Zoloft as a teen and am not sure whether it caused my suicidal thoughts or if I would have had them anyway. But it's a risk you take with almost any SSRI if you're under 18. It can take many tries to find the right one for you, and it often takes a long time to figure it out. Maybe check out therapist [Kati Morton](https://www.youtube.com/user/KatiMorton) on youtube while you're waiting for the right help. She has a ton of videos on depression, suicide, relationships, therapy, etc. You can ask questions in the comments on a Monday video right after it goes up and she spends about an hour answering as many as she can, and she does livestreams where you can ask questions too, plus a very supportive [community](https://www.katimorton.com/).

<TEXT> Family usually just needs to know a few things- what you're struggling with, how long it's been, and what you need from them (maybe just their support, or something like rides to therapy). When you do decide to let them in, don't feel like you have to tell them everything. Like you said, it's okay to keep it clean and simple. It's even okay to tell them straight up if they're asking questions you don't want to answer, that you're not comfortable talking about all of it, but that you just wanted to let them know what's going on. Anyway. Hope today goes well. It's great that you're taking time to focus in your health.  </TEXT>

And if you have 30 friends, and each goes out one day a month with some outer circle friends, takes a pic, and posts it, all you'd ever see is people out enjoying life which can make it feel like you don't have enough going on. But it's not reality.

<TEXT> I go to a 12-step program called Celebrate Recovery that has a group specifically for self harm (faith based, but all kinds of people go for all kinds of reasons). I was surprised at how many adults have been through this and the support has been invaluable. I never thought I could talk to another adult about it without judgement or feeling embarrassed. No one there ever said one word about attention seeking and no one ever shamed me for struggling with it. Outside of my group, I talk about self harm with my spouse, one close friend, and to my therapist. I don't talk about it with other family, but I don't feel I need to because I have good support in other places. I hope you're able to find that eventually, too. 

As far as attention seeking goes, my thought is that if someone were doing it for attention, then it's clear that they aren't getting the attention they desperately need (and everybody needs it).  But whenever I have heard someone say something along those lines, it's because they don't understand. But their ignorance doesn't change what you know is true, and you're not obligated to justify or explain yourself to anyone unless you want to.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It doesn't discriminate based on age. Some are lucky to heal relatively early on. Personally, I've found is that self harm still happens in adults but it just gets talked about less the older you get.  Your reasons and methods might change to accommodate your adult life and maintain secrecy, and you experience greater amounts of shame than in youth. Most (but not all) of the help is aimed at teens. But don't let it get you down. You're not alone and it's still possible to recover.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So sorry you're going through this... don't give up all hope on pregnancy. It can still happen, and there are things like IVF and IUI that can increase your chances. Might be good to get in to talk to a fertility specialist. Idk what stage endo you have, but some women are able to still get pregnant on their own despite the diagnosis. Keep trying.

 I've also struggled with fertility (I'm in my 20s too) and have decided that if it happens, wonderful! But if it doesn't, it's not the end. I want a family, and we'll get it one way or another. I remind myself that what's important is that we find our way to each other. Whether I bring them into the world or not won't change my ability to love and care for and raise the children God gives me. Even so, it's hard watching people get married and start families right away while my husband and I haven't been able to and it's been years (I married young). I cry every time I go to the mall or park and see mothers pushing strollers or helping their little ones to walk. It hurts.

I don't have any great ideas, but I hope you take time to grieve your diagnosis and all that it means. Cry, be angry, whatever you're feeling. But don't beat yourself up for relapsing. It's a very difficult situation and more than you can handle. And relapse doesn't negate or somehow make invalid the time you went without it. You still have all that time, all those coping skills, and you aren't starting over from square one. When you're ready you might need to find some new tools, new supports, new outlets to add to the ones you've already built up. That's okay. Maybe get in to see a therapist if you're not already, like a trauma or EMDR specialist, or find a support group (online or in person or both). You're not alone.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have that even when I'm in a good mood. For me it's triggered by stress, positive or negative. It helps me to externalize it and tell the disorder voice to shut up, calm yo tits, calm down, f off, etc. and then bring my focus to something else. Just because you think it doesn't mean you have to act on or indulge it. It's just the disorder trying to get attention. Talk back. Intrusive thoughts also usually signal that I have a need that's not being met (like I'm hungry, angry, lonely, tired, stressed, overwhelmed, whatever) and so it helps to take a minute to ask, What do I need in this moment? Sometimes I need to cry, take a break, meet up with a friend, get some rest, express the anger, make some tea, etc.

Hope you find something that works for you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don't let the name antipsychotic freak you out. I didn't think I was "severe" enough either, especially because I had never experienced a psychotic episode, but I found a low dose really helpful. I didn't gain any weight, but I was pretty drowsy (But I welcomed that because otherwise I wasn't getting any sleep). Drs usually get paid to push newer drugs and seroquel has been around a while so I don't think you need to worry. Just ask for generic. Definitely talk to your doctor about side effect concerns.

Another option if they are unable to find help this summer is to seek help on campus when they go to college. Most colleges have a counseling center and many offer free sessions or at the very least can connect you to outside resources.

There are also support groups you can find on meetup and even groups like Celebrate Recovery, which are free to attend.

<TEXT> Don't pick scabs, that makes scars worse. The best thing you can do is to keep your cuts covered and moist with something like Neosporin or bacetracin or some other antibiotic ointment, but never use hydrogen peroxide because it kills healthy cells in addition to bacteria. Keeping them moist keeps scabs from forming (which is why it's important to keep it covered and change the bandage regularly) and it reduces scaring so overall it will be less noticeable. Make sure whatever your using to cover them (even if it's a sweat band) is clean. Don't use makeup to cover them until they're healed.

<TEXT> You might be still be [disqualified](https://taskandpurpose.com/army-offering-mental-health-waivers-dont-freak-just-yet/) from joining due to a history of self\-harm. Just something I hope is on your radar. If you have a pair of gym shorts, you could wear those. If you don't want to risk getting in the water, you could sit by the side with your feet in and say you're enjoying bathing in the sun (or if you're a girl there's always your period as an excuse...)

I think it's normal for a bit of warmth if there are a lot of cuts. But if it's red or abnormally warm for more than a day or two, I'd get it looked at. The best thing you can do for your cuts is to keep them covered and use a product like Neosporin or bacetracin to keep them moist and so the bandage doesn't stick (you could also use something like Tegaderm if your skin is sensitive to bandaids). Keeping them moist will prevent a thick scab from forming, which is why you need to keep it covered. They heal faster and scar less this way, and when you go for a run there won't be much of a scab to tear open. Never use hydrogen peroxide because it kills healthy cells in addition to bacteria.

<TEXT> I've seen therapists when I was uninsured and it ran me $100/session. If you're in a tight spot financially, you can ask if they will work on a sliding scale which is income based and it will be less. But you can go on your insurance website and see who they cover, or call and ask the therapist directly what kind of insurance they take. Your employer will not know you're even seeing someone because that breaks confidentiality and HIPAA laws. 

My anxiety medicine is cheap, but it varies so much, but just because you see a therapist doesn't mean you have to be on meds (therapists can't prescribe them anyway\- you'd have to see a psychiatrist). You don't have to go into debt to get help.

<TEXT> This sounds silly but, it helps me to put my shoes on. I'm home a lot and often find it hard to do the little things. But if my shoes are on, it's different because I feel like I'm "on the move" so I wear them in the house. Another thing is to break stuff down into even smaller tasks. If I can't shower, maybe I can just stand under the water for a few minutes and not even get my hair wet. If I can't manage that, maybe I can at least use a dry shampoo and splash some water on my face. If 2 minutes is too much to brush my teeth, 1 will have to suffice. Having an alarm for meds and one of those plastic weekday pill cases helps. Maybe the only work out I get is a 5 minute walk down my street. Not feeling motivated to doing all the dishes? Just put clean ones away, or wash only the cups. Often I find once I get going, I'll finish whatever I'm doing. You could also try a [Panda Planner](https://pandaplanner.com/products/panda-planner-classic). Hope you find what works for you. </TEXT>

I hope you reach out to your school counselor because they work with this stuff all the time, or if you're religious maybe talk to your youth pastor (or whoever). Idk how old you are but you can also see a regular therapist without parental consent as long as you're old enough to really participate and get something out of it, you're able to get there, and you can find a way to pay the copay. It's definitely worth it. </TEXT>

You still have all the skills you've learned and have improved upon using. Instead relapse highlights areas we still need to work on.

<TEXT> Check out these vids. Therapy has been really helpful for me once I found the right therapist. They can't make you take meds (unless you're seeing a psychiatrist, therapists can't even prescribe them), and they won't tell you life is full of meaning. Good ones meet you where you're at, validate your experiences, and are just there to walk with you and help you get to a better place at your own pace. It's nice having an unbiased sounding board.

<TEXT> Not everyone is good at their job. I think the over saturation of psych majors is students wanting to understand themselves and attend to needs that haven't been met in themselves, whether they realize it or not (or at least that was my experience). Some go on to get their MA and some don't because it's difficult to balance your personal struggle with wanting to help others without projecting your experiences onto them. University counselors are always overbooked, or you get stuck seeing a grad student who is practicing (which can be helpful in some cases, unless you need a higher level of care).

Keep looking for the right counselor\- they're out there. Here's a good [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6WaMQ7q0EE) on what makes a good one. Look them up online and see the ratings. Figure out what you [want](https://youtu.be/IgLSbFTUTU4) to get out of therapy and express that in your intake appointment with any new counselor you're testing out. Look to see what degree they hold (PsyD vs MA) /what type of license (LMFT, LCSW, LPC, etc) /what type of therapy they do (DBT, CBT, talk therapy, trauma therapy, mindfullness based stress reduction, EMDR, etc).

It took me a many tries to find a good fit over several years. I saw some who were too old fashioned and we didn't "click", and some who were nice people and I enjoyed talking to them but I wasn't seeing the progress I wanted. I have to travel to see mine 45 minutes away, but it's worth it. Hope you find the right one for you soon! </TEXT>

<TEXT> For me the most effective treatment has been meds *with* therapy. Meds don't cure you. They just keep your head above water while you work on your shit. There are many out there that aren't addictive and so you don't have to "rely" on them in that way. If you try something and it numbs you out, you're not on the right stuff and need to keep looking. There are genetic blood tests you can have done to help you narrow down which medications might work better with your body chemistry so that you don't have to search for years. Talk to your therapist and see what they think.  </TEXT>

I need to bring some stuff with me to help calm down (ear plugs, weighted blanket or a backpack on my lap, water, headphones and calm music etc) in addition to my medications. I also make sure the people I'm going with know how to help during a panic attack (asking yes/no questions like would you like some water, is it okay if I touch you, do you need space?)

<TEXT> Hey so sorry you're going through all of this... I've also dealt with chronic illness from the time I was 22 and it's hard. A big thing for me has been taking time to grieve the loss of my health and working on accepting a new normal (it's still a process and some days are better than others). It's been a few years and I don't have any great advice but I'm here if you need to offload. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bring things you can get absorbed in. Music, movie, book, etc. If you're traveling with someone, talk to them. Let them know you're anxious but then get lost in conversation about something entirely unrelated. I didn't have a weighted blanket, but found putting something, even a rolled up hoodie or carry on (when allowed), on my lap was helpful. Also things like earplugs if the sounds of the plane bother you. Practice deep breathing exercises and count your breaths to 10 and then start over. When you get distracted, recognize it, and return to counting. Good luck\- you'll be fine!:) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ultimately it's a decision only you can make, and I'm not trying to "convince" you. I've known two people who have committed and one of them was a family member. I've seen what it does, and it doesn't end the pain. It passes it on. It's been 24 years since my aunt died, and we still feel it. Her name still comes up at holidays and family gatherings, and when at the library and there's a book she would've loved. Her diary haunts my mother's house, unable to get rid of it but can't look at it either. Her kids missed out on a mom, never met her grandkids, and the world has had stolen from it all the good she had to offer. She was very intelligent and had a beautiful heart, and she knew how to laugh. But now it's just stories from Before. It's empty. We know it wasn't her when she made that choice, that it was her illness, but that doesn't make the anger and hurt go away. 

The other was a kid, only 16, and the community was broken. 

You cannot live a lifetime of things worth doing/seeing in a matter or days or weeks or months. If you kill yourself, you *will* miss out on the worthwhile things you can't see coming. My aunt missed out on the internet, and she would have loved it (and it could've made such a difference if she had been able to find others in the same boat). There are new treatments now, better ways to manage, and more options than there were before. I'm convinced that even if she still dealt with mental illness, that her quality of life would have improved, and there were good reasons for her to stay. She couldn't see that there were other ways out and she was blinded to the support her loved ones offered.

You have purpose and are needed here. When you feel like you have nothing left what you really have is a blank slate on which to create, and no matter how bad things get, tomorrow could be the day they start to turn. Better days are coming, I swear, and it's worth it to stick around.

Maybe check out [this](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzBYOHyEEzlkRdDOSobbpvw) channel if you haven't. Lots of stuff about suicide, depression, trauma, etc. Obviously you know to text the crisis line 741741, call the hotline, 911, or go to the ER if you're unsafe. </TEXT>

I also find it helps to write it down and bring it in. That way you don't forget what you want to say."I've been feeling really anxious \[and depressed?\] lately and am having trouble with \[ work, school, relationships, whatever\] because of it." If you're there to talk about meds, "I was on \[name of medication\] over a year ago but stopped taking it because \[reason\], but would like to try again/try something else."

Just be as open as possible. They'll carry the conversation. </TEXT>

It was really isolating and in some ways made things worse (though I was relieved to be out of the abusive situation). Have you thought about maybe finishing at an online charter school?

<TEXT> Yeah, can't blame you for that. When we're in fight or flight, we can say all and do sorts of things to put out the fire. You weren't intentionally trying to deceive them, you just wanted out in the quickest way possible. It's okay.

Whenever I start to worry about what others think of me, I try to remind myself that most people are too busy with their own narratives and are thinking about themselves (and that's not a bad thing).

Don't beat yourself up over deciding to quit the internship. You have to prioritize your health, and you'll find something else that's a better fit. Are you in therapy? Working on my stuff makes me feel productive and so even if I feel like my anxiety holds me back, I don't feel trapped or helpless because I know I'm doing something about it, however long that process takes. Anxiety on it's own is such a bitch cause it just snowballs.  </TEXT>

It's such a relief to have someone else in your corner working on it with you and having an unbiased sounding board has been really helpful. They can offer tips and tricks and resources in addition to hearing you out, finding the root issues, and validating your experience, and it makes recovery move along quicker than going it alone. Another thing that worked for me was a 12 step program called Celebrate Recovery that had a group specifically for self\-harm (it's faith based, but all kinds of people go for all kinds of reasons and the support was invaluable), plus treating it like the addiction it had become changed my perspective entirely.

Now when I have an urge, it's not as overwhelming and doesn't have such a hold on me. You don't need to prove your feelings... feelings just are. To say you're struggling, is enough.

<TEXT> College is a good place for starting over. Everyone is new and looking to make friends, especially the first few weeks. It's entirely different than high school. You're freer. Join some groups, invite your roommates to eat lunch with you, grab a coffee or waffles or whatever with the guy in your English class you had to partner up with. I found people are willing to make deep friendships in college. It takes time but it somehow seems to happen faster in college because you'll have things in common. Many can relate to your experiences and you're not alone (I'm not saying open up to everyone, but once you find one or two solid people, it's okay to open up). You aren't dragging others down by inviting them to walk alongside you. Real friends will listen and care about what's going on in your life. But give them a bit of grace if they don't know what to say or how to bring it up. Might also be good to get into the counseling center right away before the semester is under way it gets busy. Many schools will do a certain number of sessions for free. They'll have other resources like support groups and ways you can connect on campus.

<TEXT> Journaling. Less pressure and stress than writing. Also making shitty art is a favorite hobby of mine. I used to think things had to be perfect and super creative, but now I feel like part of the fun is that they aren't. Now when people are over they say things like, "What the hell is *that,"* and I get to say it's broken pencils I hot glued to an old cd case. "*Why?"* Because it was fun and I was happy to do it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You could get an EKG to put your mind at ease, but it's likely all caused by your anxiety. Anxiety makes us tense, and that can cause back pain, chest pain, muscle tension, etc. It could also be your thyroid, if you haven't had that checked. But anxiety can also make us go nuts looking for something "wrong" with us when physically, we're perfectly healthy. Talk to your doctor and in the meantime, do some deep breathing \(or distract... watching comedies helps me\). Hope you feel better soon. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you were having a heart attack, it would show on an EKG. I've had a very, very similar experience and went to doctor after doctor convinced something was seriously wrong. I had an EKG, ultrasounds, stress test, x\-Rays, lab work, even a holter monitor, and everything always came back normal. It was so frustrating and I felt like no one believed me that something wasn't right. Turned out I needed a medication adjustment for my anxiety. Once I was on the right dose, the symptoms magically disappeared. Crazy what anxiety can do to the body! The next time it happened, I went back to the doctor and they did another blood test but this time it turned out my thyroid was to blame, which was an easy fix \(definitely get that checked if you haven't already\). In the mean time it doesn't hurt to focus on eating right, getting enough sleep as best you can, and getting a bit of exercise \(which can help palpitations\). Hope you find an answer and feel better soon. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh, I've never used that. Tegaderm is kind of similar though, but without sucking ooze up and I used to use it all the time cause it was see-through and you could watch yourself heal. It's used for wound care in hospitals and is gentle but waterproof and doesn't stick to cuts. It made everything heal quicker and with a bit of neosporin, kept it infection free.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Medication is hard because you often don't find the right one for you on the first try. It's a process. But once you find it, it can really help without making you feel like a zombie. That said, try everything else too. Maybe get into therapy if you aren't already. There's a ton of tips and resources for anxiety and depression \(and pretty much everything else\) on [this](https://www.youtube.com/user/KatiMorton) channel that's worth looking at. Some things that help me when I'm overwhelmed is to distract if my anxiety is out of control with something funny on TV, or give my cat a cuddle. The biggest thing for me is talking to someone about it and letting it out, whether talking on the phone, in person, or writing it down in my journal to talk about later with my therapist. Another thing I do is break down overwhelming tasks into smaller, manageable ones \(like maybe I'm not up do doing all the dishes but I can put the clean ones away, or I can't tidy the entire house but I can clear off the nightstand\). Hope you find what works for you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Please reach out to someone and get the help you need. A good friend of mine didn't have his first girlfriend until he was 27. There are women out there that don't care what your past history is \(and some will even prefer it\). For some jobs it doesn't matter what your degree is in, just that you have one. If you're in the US, UPS loves to hire people with degrees, they move up quickly, get benefits and make a decent pay. Same at places like Home Depot. Find something you like enough, even if it's not where you think you "should" be. You can always go back to school \(even community college\) and get a degree in something more useful. And student debt is terrible \(I know, I've got 80k too, I'm not working, and it's fucking ridiculous\) but if you work for a non\-profit, after 10 years you can qualify for loan forgiveness. 

Check out this [channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/KatiMorton). There's a ton of resources for depression and suicide, a supportive [community](https://www.katimorton.com/), and livestreams where you can ask questions. Find a therapist. Talk to your doctor. Go to the ER if necessary. [Get help](https://www.youtube.com/user/KatiMorton/search?query=getting+help). These feelings pass, I swear. 

It is not too late for you to start building. Not everyone is on the same path, not everyone gets where they are going in the same amount of time. You've got shit to do and things to look forward to. Stick around, keep fighting. It's worth it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Look for help anyway. Many therapists will work on a sliding scale if you ask. Or check out a clinic in your area. You might qualify for a certain number of free sessions. Anxiety can be managed and treated. Life won't always be like this and the feelings pass. Check out therapist Kati Morton on YouTube if you haven't already. She has a lot of resources and a very supportive community, plus livestream where you can ask questions.

But don't feel bad about your job. My husband graduated 5 years ago and is working 2 part times in retail, my friend graduated with a dual degree and her cna license, and is working in fast food. I'm not even working. It's fucking hard. But you find something you like in the meantime and do what you've gotta, even if it's not where you thought you'd be.

<TEXT> Usually my thoughts flare up like that when there's something else going on that I haven't addressed. Stress, trauma that's surfacing that I haven't dealt with yet, also if I'm hungry, angry, lonely, or tired. For me it helps to notice when the thoughts pop up, what I'm feeling at the moment \(other than casually suicidal, of course... there's always something else\), and then do what I can to meet the need or get the feeling out in a healthier way like chatting with a friend or journaling. It also helps to picture it like a wave that peaks, but then passes. Or to picture the thought like a cloud floating by or a leaf falling down, and I'm just observing it. Cause I know I don't really want to do it, and it will eventually pass. Hope you find something that works for you. Maybe check [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGl37V5T-ak ) out? </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are all kinds of people. You don't have to "fit" the stereotype, or like what your friends like. I went through a period when I was younger where I felt more like a guy, all my friends were guys, and I had an easier time relating to them. I wanted to be a man. But I got older and found that's it's just who I am, and it's fine. I identify as female now but I'm not really feminine and I still prefer to be around guys. There's no pressure for you to figure it out right NOW. You can take your time and let it unfold. Your real friends will still love you no matter what and will give you room to grow. Labels are nice when it comes to helping you find a community and a sense of "hey me too!" but they are a double\-edged sword. Don't let labels pigeonhole you, either. Just be who you are and the rest will fall in place. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When we rescued our dog, she ate well at first but then went through a period where she would only eat about half as much. I asked our vet about it and he said not to worry because dogs eat when they're hungry and they generally won't starve themselves. We tried everything \- mixing with peanut butter, adding wet food, even broth. It didn't really work. After a couple months, her appetite came back. Our pup also has allergies and we had to switch her food to salmon. She went through a few more weeks of not eating as much. We were also unknowingly over\-feeding her because her new food had more fat and calories but we were still feeding her 1.5 cups 2x a day like the chicken\-based food recommended. She wasn't hungry, not because she didn't like the food, but because she was full. It took us 2 months and 10 lbs before the vet pointed this out. But since we reduced her to 1 c 2x a day she's eating more regularly \(and loosing the weight!\).

You could always call the vet and see what they say. If it's the same vet you've been seeing, they might just make a recommendation over the phone or tell you what to watch out for. Hope you figure it out! </TEXT>

<TEXT> People with depression have it before they're diagnosed, and it's no less real. A cold is a cold before the doctor says it is. You're not faking, and you're not doing it for attention. You know your own experience and it's nice to have a word to describe and relate. That said, a doctor can narrow it down to a specific issue \(I'm not advocating self\-diagnosis, but I'm not against identifying how you're feeling either\). You know when something's not right. 

Disorders can be competitive. It's tempting to want to be the "sickest" there ever was because if your illness isnt the worst then it isnt anything, and your experience either doesnt count or you dont matter, and I think that's where the "unlike REAL depressed people like me" attitude comes from. But that's just a lie our illness tells us and it isn't true at all. 

Glad you're talking to your mom about it. Keep reaching out. You absolutely deserve validation.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not to downplay internet addiction, but yall are bored cause all you do is stare at screens. No wonder life seems dull. Unplug your TV so you don't get sucked into a binge. Cut socials out of your life for a year or two and you'll find you start living more. It gives you the chance to grow without constantly performing for others and comparing yourself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not an immediate solution, but can you grow a garden? You'd know exactly how it grew and could have some peace.

One thing is for sure, that you can't keep going like this and need to find something that works fast. Are you seeing a therapist/psychiatrist? I'd give them a call immediately and let them know what's going on. If you're not, make an appointment. At the very least, talk to your doctor.

I hope things get better for you soon. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a lab/pointer mix who is struggling with skin infections on her belly and between her toes. We rescued her 6 months ago and she came to us with a skin infection and on antibiotics, and it went away pretty quickly but then came back. We've tried changing her diet with strict restrictions as per the vet. No chicken, no grain, nothing crazy. Her food is mostly salmon and peas. She's on Apoquel for allergies, and it's helped a lot to relieve the constant scratching and belly/skin infections. But she's still licking her paws, and now the skin is all inflamed between her toes. I don't know what to do for her. She's miserable and we can't figure out the problem. It seems we're always having to put her on antibiotics and I hate doing that. Any suggestions?? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Congrats on 3 weeks sobriety. I took 1mg but I'm small. Didn't help my anxiety, but knocked me out so insomnia wasn't a problem anymore... but I did end up sleeping 2\-3 hrs in the middle of the day and still had panic attacks. Buspar and Ativan work much better for me. Ativan is between Klonopin and Xanax as far as fast\-acting goes. Just gotta be careful with any benzo if you're prone to addiction. Buspar is nice cause it's not a benzo. Everyone's chemistry is different though, so what works for me might not for you and you should definitely talk to your doctor if you're concerned the dose is high. Hope you find something that works for you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, I hear you. I relapsed after 4 years without it, and then started having more frequent relapses. It felt hopeless, and somehow even violent like I was being tossed about in the waves. What made the difference was that I had to quit viewing relapse as failure and just let it be. I quit counting how long it had been since my last slip up and began focusing on doing what I can in the moment I'm in. Sometimes I still relapse, but I don't beat myself up over it and I don't feel trapped anymore. Now I'm able to see that it highlights areas I need to work on. You're not an awful person, weak, or somehow less than for struggling with it. It's really difficult to overcome.

You haven't lost that time and you aren't starting over from square one. The more space you're able to put between you and the action, even if you're still experiencing urges, the better off you'll be. Eventually the urges get quieter and the struggle isn't so intense, but it takes time. Eventually it looses it's hold on you. You'll get there. It's worth it. </TEXT>

But since I stared a new med and it's been working really well, I'm back to sleeping in my room and I only ever panic about it when I'm triggered by something in the news.

But things are going better than they have been as far as threats go. It's getting better, they're making progress, they're talking it out. My mom is a prepper and she's not worried about it anymore \(believe me she follows these things closely\), so I feel like I don't have to be either.

All of our days are numbered. We don't know when or how. But we have this moment to make meaningful and purposeful and to help other people. Create purpose for yourself and do the things that matter most. 

We can't control everything. I often ask God to help me [accept the things I cannot change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcCp7488puc), the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference. 

Also please don't reply cause I have a limited capacity for talking about this stuff lol. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Buspar 3x a day has been the first medicine I've tried that actually helped \(and I've tried a lot\). I went from never leaving the house and constant fear to getting out a bit more and some of my specific fears completely vanished. I feel freer. I used to take Xanax for attacks but found Ativan is a better fit for me because I didn't like how fast\-acting Xanax was  \(relaxing that quickly freaked me out and I thought I was passing out or something cause I wasn't used to be relaxed\). Ativan is more middle of the road and I can take it before something stressful to curb an attack, but that's just me. And of course all of this in combo with regular therapy. Hope you find what works for you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had an experience and I'm not really sure what it was or what to call it because it doesn't seem to fit into any category. Like he never touched me, so it wasn't abuse or assault or even harassment, so why am I making mountains out of mole hills?

When I was 22 \(often mistaken for a 9th grader\) I went to sit at the small playground while I was out for a walk around my neighborhood. I had my headphones in and was listening to music, enjoying myself for a time and then praying for a while. So I sat on the swings with my back to the jungle gym to watch the sun set, and to the right up a small hill was the soccer field. No one else was there and I always felt safe there because I knew the street was full of families with kids, whose houses faced the playground. I was sitting still for about an hour.

When I got up to leave, I turned around and a car had pulled inside the fence that went around the field, where the mower usually goes in, and he was perched on the hill next to the jungle gym, watching me. It wasn't somewhere you were supposed to park. He was so close\-\- I could've thrown a rock and hit the hood of his car.

Beginning to panic, I went under the gym because I knew he couldn't drive there, and I started to walk in the opposite direction without making eye contact. I didn't want to make it worse or escalate the situation. He quickly backed out and drove slowly past me as I hugged the fence and my hairs stood on end, and then he turned the corner and disappeared.

I have no idea how long he was behind me or what he was doing. And I never heard him pull up because of the headphones. I shouldn't be upset about it because I was fine and nothing bad happened. But I still feel it, you know? I called my mother and when I told her what happened, she said he was probably touching himself. And my husband later told me that our county had a high rate of trafficking, and that his work had everyone sit through a seminar about it.

I don't know how to feel about it. I don't know what I'm supposed to feel. But it's stupid to still be bothered. There are creeps out there, and I should be grateful because it could've been something to really be upset about, right? *Get over it.* </TEXT>

<TITLE> thyroid and anxiety </TITLE>
<DATE> 2018-05-28 03:56:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So a few weeks ago my doctor increased my synthroid bc my thyroid was hypo but I started having side effects 5 days ago and I've been having non\-stop palpitations since then. It's making my anxiety really bad and idk how to cope. I called the dr office and they told me to go back to my previous dose but it takes a long time to get out of your system so even though my dose is lower, I'm still having symptoms and I can't stop thinking that I'm having a heart attack or something. I can't sleep bc it beats so hard and then it's all I can focus on. I'm so tired, and being tired only makes it worse. Anyone else experience something like this? How to deal?  </TEXT>
