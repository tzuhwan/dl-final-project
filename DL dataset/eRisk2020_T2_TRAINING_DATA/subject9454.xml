<TEXT> Well my friend showed me bts, but even she wasnt a fan, she just thought their music videos looked cool. And I told one of my other friends about it and she was basically like oh okay thats cool. But other than that, I normally dont tell people about it, because Im afraid as being seen as just another crazy bts fangirl. Especially since my mom seems to get annoyed every time I start talking about them lol. </TEXT>
