<TEXT> I left for college. 

While my home life wasn't as terrible as many other people experience, it still wasn't great. I never really knew the extent of the stress I was under and how much of my life rotated around their whims until I left. I was a cutter, I was suicidal, and I felt like I had no future. 

Being free is like a giant burden has lifted off of my shoulders, and I feel like I'm finally allowing myself to be happy. Sure, college is hard, but I feel like I have set goals I am striving for and only I am responsible for it, I am responsible for myself. Sure, I work some crazy hours sometimes, but it's my decision to put that upon myself. It's a freeing thing to feel in control of my own success. I am living with my boyfriend and a couple friends who provide me with an excellent support system, and my relationship with my parents is much better now that we only see each other during holidays.

 I finally feel hope for my future, and to me, I consider that an achievement. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It depends what for as certain people have specialties. I really like Suzanne Ward, NP for anything related to birth control or women's health. 

Dr. Cowgill is good too. He's kinda old but he has a really chill manner and isn't judgy at all. If he doesn't know something he doesn't hesitate to get you a specialist appt.

I don't recommend Dr. Walters, he's WIERD. I had the longest appointment ever with him because he went on the longest rant about strep throat and all the criteria in this weird singsong-y voice and I'm not completly sure he wasn't high on something. I just wanted a damn throat swab and go back to work, if I don't have strep just say so.

For appointments, you need to call in, no way around it. You can do prescription refills online though!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Being feminine is considered an insult. 
"Girly girl" or just "girl" was an insult in elementary school. Then it developed into pussy, bitch, sissy, son of a bitch, and even weird ones like soyboi (soy has estrogen, and eating soy is now an insult apparently). 

Most of us have grown up being told our whole lives we weren't as good as men, in fact, we are so bad we are literally one of the worst things to be compared to. It definitely makes you feel insecure in your own femininity: maybe you feel like you are just not like other girls and can only hang with guys, maybe you feel weird wearing pink, maybe you think that you are barred from certain things like playing Call of Duty because your teammates will get weird, and maybe you think that it's okay to be insulted because women are inherently weaker. We all experience the world in different ways, but it would be better if we didn't start thinking we were lesser than men an an early age.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So much this. My university's political discussion Facebook page has been overrun by really loud and argumentative guys (from both sides of the political spectrum!) that are very comfortable speaking their minds to each other in the most insulting and angry fashion. The women on it, however, phrase everything much more gently. Even I have to tiptoe around topics and language if I want to participate because I don't want to come off as a "bitch" or "SJW"! All of the insults (even directed towards men) all involve being feminine. It's weird because I never noticed how I was socialized to be more quiet and demure than my male counterparts, even in online spaces, until I got outright talked down to by multiple men.   </TEXT>

I can skip Thanksgiving, but it's not like I can skip many holidays or even have that many opportunities to visit because of my class and work schedule. I'm not willing to sacrifice not being with my family before a couple of them go and kick the bucket to save some money on plane tickets. 

And unless my dad suddenly becomes un-disabled and my mom starts to make more money as a part-time cashier I can't really ask them for expensive tickets. :(  </TEXT>

And then I have a lab on Monday I can't miss. :( 

And overnight busses are a cool option! If I can sleep the time away, it would make for an easy way to get up and down the state! That's a great suggestion I didn't think of.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Should a college student get a credit card specifically for airline rewards? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2018-09-29 06:42:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm currently a senior in college and have one credit card which I don't carry a balance on through a credit union, and have a FICO of 763. 

I'm in a pretty good financial position: I have no loans of any sort, my financial aid package is pretty decent, I have leftover scholarship/grants from community college that are keeping me afloat, I split rent with three other flatmates, and my parents send gift cards for food here and there. Don't get me wrong, I'm not rolling in cash and new clothes, but I can afford the occasional Chipotle and coffee before classes and that's enough for me. 


However, traveling back home for the holidays is making my wallet tremble. I live in Southern California and my family is up in the Bay Area, and I am expected to go visit. Tickets are around **$500 round trip** for thanksgiving, and I don't even want to think about Christmas! Driving up is difficult because I don't have a car, but my boyfriend does, so me going up would depend more on his class schedule and I won't be able to spend much time up there anyway. Driving seven-ten hours twice SUCKS and I would ideally like to avoid that.

There are several airline credit cards out there that offer companion fares and free upgrades, as well miles with no blackout dates, and I could certainly use the miles to visit family in-state. When I graduate I want to go to grad school, so I have no idea where in the country I will be and would ideally like to fly home over holidays, the most expensive time of the year. Having a companion fare discount would be great because I could split the difference with my boyfriend, so we both save some money! 

But then again, I'm just a college student who honestly doesn't know much about credit cards, and I don't want to be bit in the butt in the future by getting a card for the rewards. 

Tldr; Are airline cards worth it? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Last month, I adopted an adult male ball python. When getting him from the reptile rescue guy, he mentioned that he was a really picky eater. He's pretty big and honestly looks pretty old to me so that's not too out of the ordinary. 

It's been over a month, and so far he has not shed nor soiled his cage. It doesn't smell weird, and he has good temps and fresh water available at all times, plus has a giant bowl to soak in if he wants. He has pooped inside a couch when he got into it, so I don't think he is constipated or anything like that. 

Is there any benefit to replacing the bedding for a bp on a feeding/pooping strike? I keep reading these things on the importance of spot cleaning and doing a full cage gut, but if it's already clean is there a point? </TEXT>

<TEXT> She said she could be polygamist *if she wanted to*, right? If so, saying that shows that she doesn't want to. There is no reason why she would suddenly change that. Everyone goes on and on about how much you change during early adulthood but if you aren't really into polygamy/polyamory there's no reason why that should suddenly change into a sudden need. 

Besides, as weird as it is to say, it's kinda "in" to be considered openminded right now. Girls I know who made fun of me in high school for "looking like a lesbian" are now going to pride parades and posting all about it on Insta. Saying that "I could be poly if I wanted to, but I won't" is pretty much just saying "eh, I could see myself having the potential for feelings for two guys at once at some point in my life" and leaving it at that. I think you are definitely reading too much into her comment. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This doesn't sound too crazy at all. It's a interesting idea to explore different avenues to express affection for a fixed amount of time!

You bring up that you consider yourself a hands on couple. Have you ever seen signs that maybe your partner isn't as handsy as you, and prefers love communication in other ways than physical contact, or is just trying to bring in some creativity to how you express emotion? If you really aren't down to give up physical contact altogether, maybe you can get to the root of the whole "force more communication" and "establish more intimacy" issues and find a different way that you don't seem to hate as much. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You don't have a shower schedule, so you don't get dibs on the shower before your class. It was wrong of you to push her out. Like another commenter said, "you snooze you lose": if someone else is in the shower you don't get to ask them to leave. Is it really that big of a deal to just shower after your class? I have shared a shower between five girls (with no shower schedule either!) and it's honestly not that hard, because if it is occupied just find some time in your schedule to shower later, or learn to wake up earlier than you need to. This is exactly why dry shampoo and baby wipes exist. Asking someone to leave the shower because your shower is more important is very rude.

If you don't want situations like that to happen again, Katie had a great point about making a shower schedule, she seems to have a good understanding of dorm etiquette. Take her advice!


And secondly, why would they apologize more for yelling at you? You kicked someone out of the shower because you getting to class was more important to the other girl getting to class, and then said something mean about it. A text was sent, what else do you want? Your feelings being hurt doesn't mean that you weren't in the wrong, and they aren't responsible for cheering you up for a failed midterm. 

You are responsible for a failed midterm, not the dorm meeting. I don't see why that's relevant.

<TEXT> My bf turned 21 a few months before me, and it was a bit strange when he could go out with friends to a bar or buy some beer at the grocery store and I felt awkward even standing in the grocery store alcohol isles. I understand a bit of what you feel.

The thing is that most of the time, how often people go out drinking is definitely over-reported. Bars are EXPENSIVE, and drinking at home is much more common. It's also no fun to go out drinking when some of your friends (or gf) can't drink. 

Also, most people don't get blackout drunk: usually once or twice is enough to learn a lesson. Furthermore, when people are drunk, their inhibitions are just lowered, it's not like they change into completely different people. It's not like a non-cheating bf will suddenly turn into a cheating womanizer when drunk! If you trust him, I'm sure you will be okay.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm super curious to know, particularly in how common area cleaning should be split up. I am living with three other people (my boyfriend and two friends) in a two bedroom apt and things have been getting a bit gross. 

We have had two different cats live here and leave, leaving the gift of a major flea infestation, a mouse that made it's home in our oven, and most recently some ants crawling about. I'm a bit frustrated because the two girls pretty much begged my boyfriend and I to okay them getting a cat, and they bought an almost-feral cat from craigslist who attacked everyone painfully (except for me, funnily enough) and had about a million other problems (fleas, peeing on furniture, not cleaning the litterbox), and two months later ended up in a shelter. I have absolutely learned my lesson regarding letting flatmates who don't clean up after themselves getting pets, but lately their cleaning habits have been so bad that their friend (who they invited over, not me) commented on it and gave them friendly crap for it.

**If I could go back in time, I wouldn't let any flatmate who has never 100% taken care of a pet in their lives to get a cat because they are cute, fun, and "easy".** 

I'm especially pissed because they ruined having a cat in the eyes of my bf, so now he doesn't want to foster one while we live in this apartment. Understandable, because he kinda got the shit end of the stick because he bought most of the furniture that got ruined, but them not taking care of their cat has directly impacted my future goals and plans. 

I'm getting really sick of doing literally all of the deep cleaning and cleaning up after them, so I want to know what sort of house rules help maintain some semblance or order. I'm okay if people aren't super clean, but I really want to set some boundaries and house rules that benefit everyone who lives here. I don't want to be mean or bitter about it because they are actually really good friends and I got one of the girls a job at my place of work, but lately I have been driven up the wall. I am just so done with being the person who cleans up after those two girls.

Do trash schedules come in handy? How long can dishes stay in the sink? Should everyone wipe the stovetop after they use it? Please give me reasonable house rules or ideas to bring up issues because I am being driven insane by two otherwise nice people. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I recently finished my first year as a transfer! I have to say, coming from a community college, UCSD is leagues ahead in academic quality and opportunity. There are so many different things you can get to improve your future, such as lab positions and internships under world-class staff. The professors are usually pretty great (especially in the psych department!) and you don't get "busy work" usually, but work that they genuinely believe will help with the material or will help you out in the work world. UCSD has such a wide variety of classes so you can always find something to fill your schedule that will either really interest you or just look great on paper. In addition, the "cold" nature of the campus isn't even that cold in my opinion, everyone is just dedicated and focused on their future and that's what they like to talk about. We may not be a party school, but we are filled with dedicated peers that will encourage you to do the best you can out of sheer competition and honestly, it helps with building your social network here. Being simply average at UCSD is still pretty damn good!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, let me get this straight. You find out the girl you were dating has slept with other people before (particularly with those who possess the appearance of a stereotypical guy you don't like) and really enjoyed going to electronic music concerts, and you leave her for it?

You are well within your right to have "standards", but your standards are very unusual. It also speaks as to how to you value women: if they have slept with men they find attractive and enjoy themselves to cool music it's bad in some way? She didn't do any of this while you were dating and somehow knowing this about her, something that's normal for lots of women, completely changed your whole opinion of her. You're 29, what kind of girl are you looking for? An ex-nun who just left the convent? A super-strict Christian or Muslim girl who follows her faith to the T? Someone who has never felt attracted to a man until she met you?

Also, what do YOU bring to the table? If she has lots of stuff to shit-talk you with, it may be that you just have a lot of you that isn't as appealing as you think it is. Your comments make you really seem like one of those /r/redpill or /r/MGTOW guys who don't value women as people and she may have some stories that are very true and juicy, and frankly don't reflect well on you.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> She may honestly be very well lost in life, but that doesn't mean she doesn't have some stuff going on. The likelihood is that it's mostly mental though. 

Watching mental illness develop can be a bit like looking at yourself in the mirror. If you look at yourself (or Jeannie) every day, you don't see any change. However, you can't deny that the end product isn't quite what it used to be. One of the unfortunate things is that mental illness can drive friends away. Something that isn't usually talked about is that these friends are perfectly within their right to leave if the person (Jeannie) is in denial or is just plain refusing treatment. 

You are not Jeannie's keeper. You are not responsible for her well-being, only she is. It would be super nice of you to provide emotional support, but just because you two were close once doesn't mean that you are obligated to experience and be emotionally involved in her journeys. 

She could be lying, she could be telling the truth, she could be delusional. No matter what the answer is, if you don't feel that something is right then listen to your gut. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think you are a terrible person either. I think you are just a person in a terrible situation. 

Something that I think may be helpful is changing the space your mother occupies in your mind. Try treating her like a large, angry toddler who has been given too much power by everyone else. Rather than focusing on how upset you are at her choices, think of her as being a bit choiceless in it: she doesn't have the capacity to stop herself from being impulsive, her brain just isn't developed enough to play adult. Toddler's throw tantrums and manipulate, so treat her like a toddler. Patronize her tantrums. You don't have to mean anything you say to make her calm down. When she wants to know information about your life, give her the basic minimums, "grey rock" her if you will. "Downgrading" a parent who sucks at their job is something that has helped me deal with my father, so maybe it can help you deal with your mother. Do your best to emotionally detach yourself from her problems, and focus only on yours.

Also, focus on the fact that living with your mother is only temporary. Maybe your relationship will improve when you guys are apart, maybe it won't, it doesn't really matter. Focus on getting yourself to a point where you can move out and exit the situation in general. Whether it be trade school, college, certificates, or just plain ol' entry level work, putting your efforts towards something that will help you escape your situation ( and bring you the secure and undeniable knowledge that this living situation is only temporary) can bring fantastic peace of mind. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One of the most important things about moving out and "entering the real world" is learning to be your own advocate. For introverted people like you, that means you may need to develop skills to stop your opinions and feelings from being overshadowed by louder people. 

When she starts to rag on you for doing something she doesn't approve of, but doesn't affect her in any way, how do you respond? Do you just nod and say "okay" and leave? Or do you stare at her like she just came down from outer space and has twelve purple arms, but then leave without saying anything anyways? 

As frustrating and annoying as it is, some people can't take a hint: they need to be told pretty explicitly that they are being annoying and need to stop. It doesn't matter if you consider yourself an assertive person or not, you will not ever achieve a good cohabitation situation with a flatmate until you teach yourself that speaking up is okay. When you don't respond, you aren't saying "no, go away", you're saying "eh whatever" and that isn't a clear "no" like you want it to be! Assertiveness has nothing to do with being rude or being bitchy, but rather it just means that you clearly communicate your needs. In fact, you being generally quiet works in your favor: when you speak up, it means that it's important and people will listen!

If you really can't deal with her, then find yourself a flatmate who is just as introverted as you. However, having a flatmate with a  quieter or more independent personality than your current flatmate does not mean you two will get along. 

Also, just a note, but does she really harp on you about leaving the house in particular? Your flatmate may not have expected you to be home so often and maybe she wants to have some alone time to chill out. Places like coffee shops or libraries can be awesome places to work on job apps and your lack of presence at home may make your flatmate chill out a bit.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Speaking as someone who has been an insecure 17 year old girl with a super-cute boyfriend who had plenty of girls into him, these kind of THOUGHTS are normal. As long as she is just expressing it to you and not trying to force you to cut off friendships, unfollow friends on social media, etc it's not too intense of a deal. When my boyfriend and I were long distance he would tell me about a girl who so obviously was into him, but he was completely oblivious until she did something obvious like ask for his number or complement his eyes. I remember totally knowing how some girls he talked about were into him and he had absolutely 0 idea, so it was pretty stressful when he blew me off. I'm including this anecdote because she may be seeing signs that you are missing. 

I think it would be completely fair to ask her to stop telling you about ALL of the girls she is really insecure of, as she probably knows it's dumb but complains anyway. From this post, it seems that all she has really done about her insecurity is complain and doesn't pressure you to take any real action, you initiate all of the actions yourself. Stop initiating "fixing" actions such as not talking to girls on snapchat, that makes it seem like you were doing something wrong to begin with, but maybe talk to those girls while your gf is in the room and maybe even talk to her about the conversation topic so she feels less threatened. Don't be sneaky, show examples of perfectly polite conversation. She needs to learn to deal with the fact that half of the world is female and that you will have positive interactions with that half that aren't necessarily romantic. Feel free to continue having conversations with female friends, and you should definitely invite them to hang with you and your gf. If those girls have partners, invite them too! Your girlfriend needs to start seeing these girls as just other people rather than possible competition, and humanizing them is one way to do that. Her behavior isn't unusual though, for a 17 year old, just annoying and hopefully pretty fixable.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> For a lot of guys, if you don't initiate at least sometimes they may feel like you aren't into them as sexually as they are into you. I actually had this conversation with my boyfriend about initiation: he asked me to initiate more often because he couldn't tell if I was actually into sex or if I went along with it just to appease him. I was totally down for sexy stuff, I just never really initiated because I kinda defaulted to the thought of "if he's horny he'll go to me" which in retrospect isn't a great thought to have.

It doesn't matter you're a dom or sub, or a man or woman, it is a nice feeling to know that someone wants you, and when you don't show that want people can feel rejected, or like they are the only one who is interested in starting things. Gender stereotypes shouldn't really be followed but rather individual preferences.

Also, everyone masturbates. It's totally normal and sometimes it's easier to get a release that way rather than doing lots of work trying to satisfy your partner, too. </TEXT>

I was on spironolactone for months but I ended up quitting because I had to pee wayyy to much to be sustainable as a class-attending student. It made my bacne so much better, but my poor bladder had to suffer. I would take all the acne in the world if it meant I could maintain my GPA and not spend half of my class running to the bathroom!

<TITLE> [Acne] Ladies, if you even slightly think your acne may be hormonal, ask your doctor for a blood test! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2018-06-07 19:32:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> (I say ladies because I have no idea if this option is available for guys.)

About three months ago I was having an absolutely vicious bout of acne. I've always had acne as long as I can remember, and I think I've used almost every option excluding accutane but nothing would make it go away, but it getting continually worse concerned me. 

I went to a doctor at my student health clinic and I received a referral to dermatology for acne, but more importantly, he suspected that my acne may have a hormonal root. In response, he ordered a blood test. 

My blood test came back with an unusually high level of androgens. This is a "male" hormone usually found in less amounts in women. I recieved a referral to a nurse practitioner who was a legit expert in birth controls and imparted some very valuable information about it. (The nurse practitioner ruled out PCOS because it seemed that the acne was my only symptom of the hormonal imbalance, but if you suspect you have some symptoms of PCOS don't be afraid to make a doctor's appt to get it checked out!!!)

Apparently there are three main categories of birth control that work on different chemical pathways in the body. I have had a prescription for Ortho-Tri-Cyclen in the past and it did absolutely NOTHING besides make me fat, grumpy, bleed constantly, and make me almost asexual. Ortho belonged to the birth control category that the NP said would not help me out because it didn't act on the right pathway to lower androgen and she wasn't surprised I didn't have a good experience. There was two other categories (one is based off of yams!) that she thought may help: she felt that a Yasmin or Yaz prescription may be up my alley. According to the blood test I took, Yasmin (or in my case, the generic Ocella) would actually help bring my body back to normal rather than screw with it like Ortho-Tri-Cyclen did!

I found it fascinating that I could be prescribed a certain category of birth control because of my blood test results, rather than being thrown random ones to try, and thought you ladies may be interested in asking your doctor about this option. 

Along with an anti-acne regiment, my face is clearing up FINALLY!!! I've been on a very similar regiment before and it didn't work very well at all, but the birth control whipped my body into cooperating alongside it. 

[B A pics](https://imgur.com/a/8fUi6TE)

Routine: Clindamycin and birth control in the morning, Glow Recipe Watermelon Moisturizer or Belif Aqua Bomb both morning and night, and Tretinoin at night only. I cycle between like four different face washes so I won't list them, but I do wash my face morning and night.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Currently I'm still working on my B.S. in Social Psychology, but I'm really interested in a few particular nursing programs in the Bay Area which are all pretty competitive and I am really nervous about applying. (UCSF MEPN PMHNP is my dream program in particular)

I have some related medical field volunteer work. From high school I have science outreach education, animal care, and lots of hospital volunteer hours, and from college I have medical research, some therapy chicken work, and a good GPA (3.85 overall, 4.0 major). 

What are some of the most important things that you believe helped you get a leg up over other applicants? Is there some sort of prep course for the GRE that helped you out, did you do some cool volunteering thing that really prepared you? If you got a BA or BS in a non-nursing major, like future me, did you try and squeeze in some elective grad classes? 

I'm considering getting a CNA licence and/or volunteering at a hospital again, but since I've never actually done nursing admissions before I have no idea what's useful or not, and what's a waste of time! 

Please teach me your ways.

<TEXT>  Why are you talking so much about her periods? There is more to behavior than hormones. Having a period or not having a period shouldn't make someone emotionally abusive. Sex drive change, yes. Abusive tendencies, no. She DOES have control over her behaviors. Hormones are not to blame for abuse. This has nothing to do with her period, and everything to do with her. 

You two haven't been together all that long. Likely what is happening is that your girlfriend has always had this sort of response to stress, you are just seeing it now. Frankly, it's not okay to be an emotional punching bag ever. Are you willing to put up with this every single time she is under stress? What if you are BOTH under stress? Would she try and help shoulder some of your burden, or would she just turn on you and make things worse? Do you really want to be in this miserable, unsatisfying relationship forever?

I think this is just the kind of person the girl you are dating is. If you feel you are being emotionally abused, you should leave. You don't go into detail about it, and that's perfectly within your right, but don't try and minimize it because you are male. Men can get abused too, and it doesn't make you any less masculine if you leave!

Also, the cycle of abuse is just that, a **cycle**. Things will get better, and everything seems fine. And then it gets worse. And so on and so forth. The only thing you can do to make the cycle end is to break it! I really highly encourage you to seek our resources about leaving an emotionally abusive partner, such as Hotline or talk to a trusted friend, clergy member, family member, or therapist. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Does Diana tend to be this way in other parts of her life? Does she seem uncaring or unsympathetic towards beggars, people in abusive relationships, cashiers, military veterans, etc? Would you say she is "brutally honest" to the point of being more brutal than honest? If she is like that towards everyone, I think you are well within your rights to cancel your trip and explain to everyone why. Diana's comments were definitely hurtful. You message her to tell her a chronically ill friend took her own life, and that's her response? Ouch. Normally, it's polite to not speak ill of the dead and a social norm that is widely followed unless the dead person was overall horrible.

On the other hand, Diana may be projecting her own feelings way too strongly and to the wrong audience. Has she ever suffered with suicidal thoughts, and could it be possible she believes that since she got over it, everyone else didn't try hard enough? Or maybe she has experienced the loss of a close friend or family member, by suicide or natural causes, and feels resentment towards those who chose it. To be honest I have heard a similar sentiment from many people in regards to people who commit suicide. I don't agree with this way of thinking, but for many people, it can help them cope with their own lives and feelings of loss. Its not a very friendly mindset but it is common. 

In short, if this is the only thing Diana has been cruel about, then it may be overkill to completely burn a friendship. If she has a history of it, then it's probably best you cancel your trip, for your own happiness. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your family is wrong. It is EVERYONE'S business if your relative is driving drunk: how would you feel if you did nothing and continued to do nothing, and he killed someone? You don't need that kind of guilt in your life, and neither does anyone else. You clearly have a strong moral compass and know what the right thing to do is.

You should seriously contact this relative's probation officer. What he is doing is not at all a victimless crime. Even if you don't have any concrete proof, if you report it at least the probation officer would be on the lookout. You can always ask the probation officer if you can stay anonymous if you believe it would be better for you. 

Normally, it's not great to go behind your SO's back to do something, but reporting drunk drivers is something that should be taken seriously and if you feel that this would be the best course of action, it is always an option. This has nothing to do with your SO, but it has everything to do with the behavior of your relative. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wasn't allowed to go hang out with friends in school. I was given some freedom during my senior year of high school, but having those sorts of restrictions throughout elementary and through high school because neither of my parents wanted me out of the house for various reasons (help clean, study extra, too stressful for my disabled dad, etc) and wanted me on call was pretty damaging to my social skills. 

I wouldn't impose arbitrary rules on socialization just because I felt like it would be easier for me, the adult.

<TEXT> I use A LOT of caffeine daily. I know it's not what everyone usually thinks of as a drug, but it is a legit performance enhancer than can come with side effects.  I struggle with having enough energy and motivation to do my homework and go to work, so I drink coffee, yerba mate, and tea to help me energize myself enough so I can focus and do well on my tasks. 

I also drink alcohol (1-5 beers a week) in moderation and I feel like it's one of the only things that can help me relax in my free time. If not, then I feel like I'm not using my time productively and feel really guilty about it. Smoking marijuana also gives me this feeling, but marijuana leaves me feeling kinda "flat" for a few days if that makes any sense. I am one of those unfortunate people for whom marijuana chills me too far out so I don't really use it. :( </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a chick who is definitely not conventionally attractive at all (I did an /r/rateme, I'm not bullshitting you guys), there are some tricks that can kind of help you fake your way into average territory. 

1. **Smell good**. Taking regular showers isn't good enough. Shower, use a special loofah to exfoliate, make sure that your soap smell works with your shampoo smell, wear perfume, use super good deodorant, and use dry shampoo on non-shower days. Moisturizing and shaving regularly also helps as well, but depending on how much skin is showing and the season it's not necessary. I don't really eat strong-smelling foods anyway, like curry or garlic, but be warned that eating certain foods can make you smell a bit off for a bit, so they are best avoided. 
2. **Be somewhat in shape**. Being fat and ugly is much worse than being average and ugly. I don't work out, but I eat lots of salads and veggies, roughly count calories, and do lots of walking so I look good enough. I'm a bit lazy in this regard, but working out can help your appearance a lot. 
3. **Skincare**. I have pretty bad acne, bad enough where my doctor who is known for not wanting to prescribe accutane wanted to prescribe accutane. Making the doctors appointments, doing some blood tests, and filling prescriptions have helped my skin go down from angry and infected to just scarred. I'm not on accutane right now because I am terrified of the side effects, but I am on birth control, tretinoin, clindamycin gel, and have a whole fancy expensive skincare routine. 
4. **Makeup**. Even if you are a guy, makeup can seriously help. There's no shame! Pick up some no-makeup makeup tricks on youtube to learn to cover up acne and blemishes, wear a sheer BB cream to even out your skintone and make you look *glowing*, and plucking and trimming off some oversized brow hairs can make you look much more taken-care of. You don't need to be able to do fancy eyeshadow techniques to give yourself a bit of a real life Instagram filter.
 
5. **Dress to impress.** Being trendy isn't all that important, but dressing for your body is. Make sure that the clothes that fit you five years ago don't just fit you, but fit you WELL. Even if you are going somewhere like the grocery store, choose leggings or jeans over sweatpants and grab a leather jacket over a hoodie. Make sure that your clothes don't have noticeable tears or wholes, and that they aren't stretched out awkwardly. If you have a shirt that makes your stomach look pregnant and an old bra that is so tight it emphasizes all your back rolls, pick a different one for the day. Even if you only have a week's worth of outfits to pick from, wearing the same set of clothes isn't going to be noticed, but wearing clothes that are gross will be. Also, DO YOUR LAUNDRY. Wear shirts, socks, and undies once. Smell-check your jeans and leggings. If you are uncertain, err on the side of caution and throw it into the hamper.

6. **Be an interesting person**. Work hard at school, pick up a sport, get an internship, volunteer, get cool hobbies: all of these make you a more interesting and confident person, and therefore boost your attractiveness in the eyes of many people. If you struggle with depression or other mental disorders, see a therapist and work on your mental state. This will make you more successful in a lot of things! Plus, beings successful can boost your feelings of self-esteem and make you more confident, and confidence is always attractive. </TEXT>

You need to put yourself first. Right now, can you honestly say you are happy in your relationship? Is it a net positive in regards to happy emotions? Does she put in as much emotional labor as you?

<TEXT> It's totally normal to have that kind of hair! As much as the media pushes the whole clean-shaven look, there are MANY women and girls out there who choose not to shave for whatever reason. And for what it's worth, hairiness is becoming more fashionable: there are countless instagram models who don't shave and even some porn stars keep some fluff nowadays.

If you're super worried about it, just wear capris, shorts, or a backless top around him one day. He'd likely notice it, and if he doesn't seem to care or asks you about it then you have your answer. You can also use one of those electric bikini or face trimmers (Phillips has some good ones) to just trim stuff down if it's something that is bothering you. It's way quicker than shaving, just not nearly as precise or close to the skin. 

In short, most guys won't care, and if they do then they are immature as women come hairy by default. :) You have full freedom in regards to your body hair preferences and most guys won't even care. </TEXT>

I know that it's really hard to do but making up your mind is honestly most of the battle. In the end, breaking up would give her more time to work on herself and you can maintain your mental health, so keep that goal in mind when you do the unfortunate breakup.

<TEXT> Think about how your girlfriend would feel when she finds out about your feelings for your friend (not if, WHEN). She was a "cool girl" to let you sleep in the same bed as your female friend, and you develop feelings. That must sting. Sharing a bed is pretty intimate when it comes to the gender you are attracted to, and it shows your girlfriend must trust you a lot to allow it. You are betraying her trust by not doing everything you can to distance yourself from your crush. Yea, this girl is your friend, but she is also someone you have the hots for. If you respect your girlfriend AT ALL, you would nip this in the bud by cutting situations that make you "weak" to infidelity. 

How much do you think it would hurt your girlfriend that you don't love her enough to reject an advance from this friend? And not only that, but you are actually thinking ahead and decided that you would accept your friend's advances. That's pretty cold. I think you really need to mull that over, and really think about how invested you are in your current relationship. People in happy, committed relationships don't usually plan out the exact person they would be prone to cheating on their partner with. 

That's only from your girlfriend's perspective. How do you think your friend would feel about this? She sleeps in the same bed as you because she probably trusts you, and she is clear she loves her boyfriend: I don't think she would be thrilled that you have feelings for her at all. And if she is, then she isn't someone you should have ever been sharing a bed with, period. 

I know you don't want to hear it, but if you care even a little bit about your girlfriend, and if you even respect your friend, you would back off of spending so much time with your friend. Your friend is in a relationship. YOU are in a relationship. So act like it. Don't share a bed with your friend. Don't be alone too much with your friend. Don't ever put yourself in a situation where, if your girlfriend could read your mind, her heart would not be absolutely shattered. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you don't mind me asking, what culture are you two from? In most Western cultures (which Reddit predominantly is) this is absolutely an insane request by your girlfriend. I would never in a million years ask my boyfriend to call and try and convince my parents to let me go on a short trip with him, especially if I already graduated and was employed. If her parents don't financially support her, then I don't see why her parent's have any control here. She is an adult and therefore should be able to make her own decisions. 

However, for some more patriarchial cultures they may be more willing to let her go if she can prove you are going with, especially if you two have been together for that long and you are "approved" by the family. It kinda sounds like she is hoping that since her parents like you, they may feel safer with their daughter going on vacation with you because you will be around to protect her from crazies. Either that, or she wants you to reassure them you won't be planning on having sex with her on the trip.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your girlfriend is an adult and can therefore make her own decisions about what makes her happy. For many people, physical presence isn't all that important to maintaining a happy relationship. I think it is very sweet of you to consider how your future will effect her satisfaction in your relationship, and it shows that you care quite a bit, however I think you aren't really taking her feelings into account but are focusing more on how *you* feel. 

It's totally fine to prioritize your feelings on this, but it's important to recognize that they are your own and not try and trick your mind otherwise.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You are not her therapist, nor are you qualified to be one. I know that it's hard not to try and help everyone who needs it, but both you and I know that it's not your responsibility to bear her mental wounds for her. 

I think that the very fact you are questioning this and looking at it from her perspective shows that you are a good person. However, you are just that: a person. You are not some superhero or a walking psychiatrist. You can't cure her mental wounds. She needs more than that, and you can't provide it for her. 

I think that you should break up. You are only human, and you are under absolutely no obligation to make yourself miserable, especially when it doesn't even seem to make her any better. You are strong enough to care about her, so you should also stay strong enough to care for yourself. You are not her keeper. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree with the other commenter, you are definitely overthinking this. I think that she understands and accepts the difference that may happen to your relationship, and thinks it is worth it. The only question is if you realize the impact completely, by this I mean not belittling it but also not blowing it up to be way bigger than it needs to be, and if you think that you want to continue to make the effort. It makes an impact but usually it's not nearly as huge of an impact that you think it is. 

However, the person in a relationship here is you, not all of us commenters. If you honestly think that you can't juggle a job, a relationship, and schoolwork, then narrowing down your priorities is a choice that only you can make for yourself.

Situations change, people grow apart, don't beat yourself up over this. Also long distance is exceptionally taxing on a relationship and if your relationship isn't super strong and bonded to start with then it may be better to break up now to save yourself from more heartache later.

If you don't love him nor do you miss him, but you still like him, then do everyone involved a favor and break up with him.

<TEXT> 1) It's possible, but unlikely. My apt at the Village has exactly five people: one triple and one double. Each apartment seems to be slightly different. I've been to couple of my friend's apt at another Village building and they both had a whole different layout!

2) I'm fairly certain it's random. I haven't heard about anyone having special floors for certain majors, but this is my first year here so maybe I just haven't been exposed to it. They try and squeeze everyone in. There is a survey you fill out about yourself and your living preferences (overnight guests, alcohol, cleanliness) but I can't tell you if they even take those into account but I get along well with my apt mates so they might.

3) lol no. At least, not in my case. Like I said, the only time I ever met my RA was when my apt mates and I let our place get toured. Sometimes they have fun events but I'm usually too busy to go. :(

If you are looking to live with that many friends, I would really recommend living off-campus, if not this year the next. It will be A LOT cheaper and you get more space! The SuperLoop is great for getting everywhere on time.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you go to a big college, is it possible to pick up a full-time volunteer research position on campus? Those are more common and a bit easier to get than paid positions, plus it looks really cool on a resume. It doesn't even need to be in your field of study:a lot of professors/ PIs just choose people they click with during interviews. Hospitals are also always looking for volunteers and often there is lots of downtime so you can work on homework in between "chores" there. You may also benefit from picking up a couple summer classes at a community college: it's a cheap way to get an easier course load later, as well as maybe even accumulate units to graduate early.

Other "jobs" you can pick up include being a nanny for the summer (check out Nextdoor or Facebook and make a post on it offering your services) or Rover, an app for walking dogs. If you can get some small gigs, you may be able to make them stop bugging you while you work on getting a more full-time position. It's also a bit late to be applying to summer internships, most places stop taking applications around spring break. Lesson learned, next year apply earlier!

If you are down to do more studying over the summer, you may be able to work on professional certifications that can get you better entry-level jobs, like in IT or (possibly) healthcare.

You are NOT lazy and unmotivated. You are trying! It's very hard to get something that looks nice on a resume and everyone is trying to get a job for summer right now, so I understand your pain. Your parents don't understand how difficult it is to find a summer job these days because literally EVERYONE wants one. You are literally competing with college graduates for many of those summer jobs. :(

If you want resume or cover letter help, PM me! I'm a student too and I've applied to hella places and have played the summer job game before.

<TEXT> Are you in the US? If so, you should definitely talk to a teacher or trusted adult about the way he is treating you. He is very clearly not a fit parent and mandatory reporters can help you out. You say that you're good with programming and computers, right? Maybe you can contact a tech teacher, or even a friendly IT guy, that you are on very good terms with. 

In regards to the being kicked out thing, let him kick you out. Spend some time looking for homeless shelters near you. As long as you pee clean, most places would be happy to shelter you. Call them and talk about your situation: you don't work in a homeless shelter unless you genuinely want to help those in need. Even if you can't get a bed there, they may put you into contact with a kind soul who is willing to house an abused minor. More people your age are homeless than you would think, it won't mess up your life! I go to a very good university and we have a "hidden" homeless student population. Even though you live in a terrible household you still manage to be good at programming and computers: the fact that you still have the emotional energy to focus on these shows that you are a very strong and smart person, and when you are finally free of the emotional burden of living with your family you will be able to be successful. I HIGHLY recommend that you don't kill yourself because you have so much potential once you are free. You only have one more year!!! Even if you are homeless, there are many online certifications for tech you can complete and find entry level work in the computer field. You can always work up from there! You can even start working on them now if you like, /r/jobs sometimes has threads about those certifications.

You also mentioned that your father is very into Christianity. Does he go to church and look up to his priest? If you go and "confess your sins" I'd take that moment to talk to the priest about what you are experiencing: he may be able to try and talk to your father and knock some sense into him. The way he is treating you is VERY unChristian-like and if nothing else, take solace in the fact that if the religion he believes in is real he will be sent down straight to hell for his cruel actions.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Since you guys dated for a year and a half, I would say maybe six months or more? It honestly depends on the terms you guys broke up on: if really good earlier, if iffy and painful then later. That gives some time for the relationship dust to settle and to also get into the groove of single life, and also time to make new non-couple related social connections. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your grandmother has made it pretty clear that she has no intention of changing her habits, and you seem to like her in all ways but her eating noises, so to make this easier on yourself it may be in your best interests to change your habits to accommodate this issue. 

When she is eating, just leave the room/apt/house and take your food to-go on a stroll around town, or just sit out on the curb and eat under the guise of "people watching". Or maybe when your grandmother starts to eat hide in the bathroom with your phone and just pretend to have a long poop that coincidentally lasts as long as the meal. (This is a sneaky trick because some people are uncomfortable talking about bowel movements, so you may not have to explain yourself at all!) Or even play some music or tv loudly, some sort of media that your grandmother likes enough to let you drown the sound of her chewing out.

The fact that hearing those sounds brings you such distress that it impacts your life to such a strong extent makes it sound like misophonia, which can be alleviated with the help of cognitive behavioral therapy. If this is just a pet peeve and this post is mostly ranting then you are probably fine tbh but if it gets so serious that it weighs on your mind and causes you intense distress there is no harm in seeking some professional help. If everyone else is fine (albeit slightly annoyed) and you are in great distress for a minor thing, then you may be focusing on the sound too much and may need some help in how you mentally process the sounds. </TEXT>

It's not a horrible idea to contact her per se, lots of people reach out once in a while, just not a particularly good one this early on.  </TEXT>

For instance, in the US FAFSA is known to be exceptionally difficult to get financial aid when rich parents are expected to pay, however if you can prove that they are not contributing they waive that and don't include your parent's earnings.

<TEXT> Birth control pills may or may not play a role in her losing attraction towards you, but I highly doubt that is the entire reason she ended her relationship. 

I know that it's tempting to find something to blame and that the birth control just seems like a good target, but there were probably other reasons why she ended it and just doesn't really want to put them into words. 

I've experienced the whole totally losing attraction to anyone with the pill first hand (Ortho Tri Cyclen generic didn't go well with me) and I still stayed with my bf because I still felt a deep genuine love and connection. It's possible that your ex-gf realized that she didn't feel that because of the pill and liked you for many other reasons but none were just quite right to have her stay. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Apologize, and don't excuse your actions with the "it's just a bad joke and I was drunk". Apologies are never seen as real if they are simply excuses. Even if you do have a valid excuse, don't focus on it at all: you are not giving reasons for your action but seeking forgiveness. You also don't seem to care that he was genuinely offended, you should probably acknowledge his feelings and that you acted pretty terrible that night.

The fact that you did that "joke" before and nothing happened shows that he was probably trying to brush off the joke, but you just overdid it so he snapped. The joke was probably never funny to him. You also brought up that you two aren't even close. That kind of joke is more of a close friend joke, but having it come from someone that you aren't even friends with is a bit offensive. You were drunk so your brain probably threw that social dynamic norm out of the window. You can't hurt someone's feelings and "it's just a joke bro" it, it's such a common trope that it's literally almost a meme.

One of the things with offering an apology is that the other person is not obligated to accept it. If you give an honest heartfelt apology and he doesn't accept, then you will just have to deal with a bit of awkwardness. I doubt he would try and fight a guy who sincerely apologized and avoided getting drunk at parties where he was at, though. He graduates in five weeks anyway, so just keep your head down and it will blow over. </TEXT>

You should definitely expose him, not for vengeance or anything, but so that he won't groom other girls into his weird sexual incest thing and have them experience the same terrible feelings you are. You are DEFINITELY not the only girl he has done this to. 


If you have proof of indecent contact (like texts), save multiple copies in various places so that you have proof if he tries to call you a liar or someone tries to "protect" him over you. You have every right not to visit your abuser. If you are forced into it, go to the police with proof and tell them that your parents are making you visit him, so they can stop by and have a nice little chat with them. If your parents do not listen or believe you, they may believe the police. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, I get your boyfriend's perspective. It's one thing if you two ended up living together with separate bedrooms (like one person takes the living room, other takes the bedroom), those are pretty normal living arrangements in high cost of living areas, but sharing an actual bedroom with a male coworker is very highly unusual. Sharing a bedroom can be a bit more intimate with opposite genders, because you guys may walk into each other changing, doing manual sexual stuff, etc so I really understand why your boyfriend is concerned.

Also, YOU may feel absolutely certain that your coworker will never be fallible to an affair, but that doesn't mean your boyfriend is, and you should really consider his feelings on this one. Being married honestly doesn't mean all that much to many people.

An option that may work for you two is finding a one bedroom place with a living room, and one of you can take the living room and partition it off into a bedroom of sorts. It happens all the time in college areas that have high costs of living and I think something like that may be a compromise that both allows you and your coworker to have the financial advantage, but also will respect your boyfriend's feelings on the issue.

It's not about the material value of anything, it's the fact that he isn't willing to put in any effort on "your" day. Birthday gifts/cards are social norms that are usually strictly adhered to if it's for someone you care about, and not adhering to that makes it seem like he doesn't really care about you all that much. He didn't even bother to make it clear that the gifts he got you earlier were not random, but rather for this celebration.

First off, is he even fully over his ex? WHY would you even bother to send money to an ex unless it was a life-or-death emergency? The fact that he angled his phone away gave it away that he was very aware that what he was doing is wrong. He likely still isn't over his ex because that is NOT a normal thing to do. You are VERY right to be uncomfortable and that is the most valid feeling to ever be felt.

To be honest, I think he is with you because nobody else can put up with him and you seem to be having the patience of a saint. He doesn't seem to be able to take care of himself at all, as he is just literally giving money away to druggies who he is still in contact with, so if you two ever have a future you would literally need to monitor him (like a mother) to make sure he doesn't do harmful things.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not a medical researcher, but a medical research undergraduate volunteer, but the lab I am working with is studying the effects of e-cigs on mice, particularly what kind of DNA mutations it may cause. I think that's some really useful stuff to know in today's word especially with the prevalent notion that vaping is a cool and casual thing to do. Lots of us think as vaping as being only "slightly" dangerous and really not all that bad, but it has some pretty high damage potential!

Something that I find really interesting is that both the ecig and regular cig smoke exposed mice get aggressive after exposure. They are totally chill in any other situation, but something about the nicotine makes them grumpy and slightly bonkers towards their bin-mates. They have a very different response than people do! Also, the cig smoke mice reallyyyy don't like the smoke, and the ecig smoke mice don't like it either but they show noticeably less distress during exposure than the regular cig mice. </TEXT>

I don't care how my friend thinks and I don't care if she sees things the way I do, because she is my friend and I like her the way she is, but I do care enough about my living situation to try and open a path to communication where the common facilities can be used by everyone and if I let you borrow my stuff you clean it after you use it.

But if it lasts a couple of months, that's good enough for me! That's when the lease ends and my bf and I were planning on possibly finding a different place anyways. :)

She's a good friend and actually a very reasonable person, but I just don't think she's ever had to clean up after herself fully until now so it's all new to her. I was hoping that maybe a conversation may help me out, but I didn't think about the resentment part or the whole picking-sides thing, so I'm definitely going to not stay past summer.

<TITLE> Me [20F] with my soon-to-be flatmate Lola [20F], I want her to be less messy but I don't know how to say it without overstepping bounds. </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This summer, I am planning on subleasing at my boyfriend's off-campus apartment because my on-campus lease expires, as well as it would be significantly cheaper to have four people in an apt compared to the current three. Plus I would like to finally live with my boyfriend of three years, ya know? My boyfriend, both of his flatmates, and I have all come to be good friends, and his flatmates are looking forward to me moving in.

My only qualm with the apartment is that one of the flatmates, lets call her Lola, is pretty messy. She's a great person with many fantastic qualities, and is a wonderful friend, but she can't clean up after herself to save her life. She cooks and leaves dirty dishes on the counters, doesn't clean up all the food splashes she makes, if food falls on the ground she leaves it, and I don't think she knows how to properly clean dishes because whenever I want to use a utensil or a plate, chances are, it is still covered in grossness. If she has friends over for a kickback, a lot of times she doesn't clean up after them completely and there are beer cans left out for days. She also uses my boyfriend's kitchen supplies (and my cuttingboard, with full permission though) and just leaves it out dirty for a day or two because she is too busy to clean it up. If my boyfriend brings it up to her she will apologize and clean her mess, but it's always awkward to have to ask a friend to clean up, ya know?

On the other hand, I fully admit I am a bit of a clean freak. I push my boyfriend and help him clean up his place whenever it it gets pretty gross (for instance, he brought over his old mini-fridge because the communal fridge stank so bad, so I helped him clean the big fridge so that everyone could use it again). They currently have a pretty nasty flea infestation in the apartment because of a ex-roommate and her poor little cat, so I brought over my fancy vacuum to clean the carpet after WEEKS of dealing with itchy bites when I sleep over (Lola just rolled up one of the decorative carpets that housed a lot of fleas rather than cleaning with her own, albeit not reliable, vacuum). It's one of the ones were you can see what was collected real easily, and there were SO MANY FLEAS. Remember, there is no cat anymore: the fleas have nothing to eat but us so it shouldn't be all that difficult to decimate their population. I have also washed Lola's dishes several times because she filled up the sink and my boyfriend and I needed to do our own dishes and there just wasn't room, and honestly I don't think she even noticed. I always clean up after myself, both in my own apt and in my boyfriend's, and do random cleanings for my bf when he is too busy to do it himself (I honestly don't mind, he's in a really hard major and I have more free time). 

In addition, I recently found out that my on-campus apartment might be used for new student tours because we were one of the cleanest apartments in our building, so I KNOW that I am a clean person and not just full of it.

Lola is a great friend in a million and one ways, but as you can probably tell from this post, **her lack of cleaning habits bugs the crap out of me**. I'm in a tight spot because I don't live there, so I can't tell her to clean up. However, I will be living there in a few months and I really don't want to have to suddenly annoy her to change her cleaning habits and make her resent me. I also don't want to just leave her as she is with the cleaning habits, because while I don't mind cleaning up after others it's annoying when it's just ONE PERSON who makes a bunch of excess mess. I don't mind if she's slightly messy, but she's the messiest person I know! I really want to bring up her cleaning habits to her but I just don't know how to do so without offending her. 

**Tl;dr: I'm going to be moving in with Lola in a few months. However, she's very messy. She's a great friend and I don't want to offend her by asking her to clean her apartment more when I don't live there, but I also don't want to move in with her and deal with her cleaning habits. I just don't want to blindside her with my higher expectations. I want to bring up her cleaning habits but don't know how to, please give me advice.** </TEXT>

<TEXT> It takes a lot of applications, but there are a lot of opportunities available! Im actually a psych major who wants to pursue health research, and I recently got accepted to a volunteer research position that is mostly bio-based. Even if you don't think you qualify as well other other students, it's worth trying anyways! The REAL portal is one of the best ways to find internship/volunteer opportunities. Another way to get some experience is to get to know a Prof you think is great and see if you can join in on their research. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sometimes, people just fall out of love, and that's okay- as terrible as it is, you are not alone, you have nothing to be ashamed of, and your emotions are perfectly valid. Relationships take two people to make them work and when one of them just falls out of it, for one reason or another, there isn't a relationship to keep alive. It's an absolutely emotionally wrecking thing to be broken up with out of the blue, but it's better than staying in a relationship where one person is checked out.

Maybe, after some time passes, there will be a chance for you two to get together again. However, the chances are that time will probably heal both of your wounds and you both will move on. </TEXT>

I can't comment on your morals for doing in that in prison because I have never been there and can't really relate, but A) She deserves the right to know if you had sex with someone else, no matter the reason, if you are to continue to be together and B) You are putting her at risk of getting an STD if you do not. Loving someone involves being honest with them for their sake, even if it may not benefit you in the end.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If hormonal birth control isn't working for you, don't use it! Lots of women rely only on condoms, we are more common than you think. 

I only recently was able to find a hormonal birth control pill that works for me (Ocella) and that's only because I literally had my hormones checked and the doc said I should take it for medical reasons. If not for being told to take it, I would have NEVER even went near birth control pills after my past experience with them. Birth control tends to get minimized as just a contraceptive, but in reality it is a powerful medication that can really mess with you. 

I have used exclusively condoms with my boyfriend for the beginning three years of our relationship. It really is not a dealbreaker for plenty of men, trust me. You will be okay! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some of the things your mom asks for seem a bit unneeded, while other things seem pretty reasonable. The unreasonable things are phone tracking and walking into your room without knocking. The reasonable things include not having anyone over and asking where/when/with who/ how long you are going to be gone. 

If words don't seem to work, and she is squeamish with nudity and you are not, letting her "barge in" while you are changing may make her knock in the future because it made her uncomfortable enough. In regards to the tracking, you can always download a location spoofer app to edit your location or switch phone platforms (ex. Apple to Android) so that it's a lot less easy to track you. You can also just shut off your phone while you are out and say that it died without you noticing.

The other stuff, honestly, seems pretty reasonable. She is doing you a favor by letting you stay and build up some savings. You say that you feel like you are being treated like a teenager, but honestly in your mom's eyes you aren't all that far off from one. She's not telling you not to go anywhere or not to do stuff (at least, your main post doesn't mention it) so she is just concerned and leans towards overbearing, but doesn't really fully hit that category imo. You aren't living with a roommate, you are living with a parent who is allowing you to live with them for no/low rent as a favor to you. It makes absolute sense that she won't let you have people over because it's not actually your home and you are not paying (market rate, at least) rent. If you want to gain access to all of those freedoms and do whatever you want, then you should look into moving out sooner rather than later.

I reach for my Coralista boxed blush more than any other one. There are SOME sparkles in it, but its very faint and definitely not noticeable on the skin. Since it's in a cardboard box, it should be easy to depot into a palette. If you look at the temptalia review comments for it most people's problem with it happens to be that it is very sheer compared to other blush brands and I think that might work in your favor if you are searching for something buildable.  </TEXT>

I think if you already have good or decent skin it's not worth using because it's pretty finnicky and the whole peeling skin side effect is no fun, but if you have problematic skin it can be a godsend. I use tretinoin every night and I have noticed that it's been fading my post-acne pigmentation dramatically, as well as making my skin look smoother. 

My mom has been on Retin-A most of her adult life for cystic acne and she now has really youthful skin for her age, so if you are looking to use Retin-A to prevent signs of aging it will likely do it's job! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don't try and tap my shoulder if I have headphones, I have headphones in on public transit primarily because I don't want to talk to people. Also, public transit isn't the best hunting grounds for potential dates.

Don't get angry at me when I decline to give you my number after you called me really pretty, and tell me how stupid I am for thinking you were hitting on me.

Don't tell me all about your stint in prison for attacking a guy and almost killing him, then follow me off of my stop to "get coffee with me" without even asking. 

Don't sit there and talk shit about how "most women are evil whores, but you're cool" and expect me to be interested. I don't feel special, I feel weirded out. 

Overall, most of the time being asked out is a nice feeling: someone thinks I'm pretty! But the creepy people ruin it for the rest of the men/women who may be pretty cool partners, so always approach with caution and don't send off threatening vibes. Offer an avenue of escape, like "Hey, wanna grab coffee? I totally understand if you are busy/not interested though, no worries" so that we feel safe. 

The stuff I listed before of "what not to do" will probably not apply to the people reading this post, but I think it serves as very real contextual information on what women have to deal with and why we may not be that easily approachable. We won't know that you aren't that creepy guy unless you make it very clear that you are not, strangers talking to us are often lumped in as "possible threat until further notice" until you make it very clear that you are not a threat and that it is okay to say no. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wish that my mother didn't think of herself as "less then" men. In Russian/Ukrainian culture, the woman's role is to pretty much assist the male in everything and run the household, but the husband gets to make all the real decisions. She tried to raise me to "be a lady" and told me that because I was a girl I have to do all these extra things because it is more convenient for men and that it my place. If I asked her why I had to do something, she would always respond with "because you are a girl".

I wish that she knew that those kind of values aren't all that important in American society, and adherence to those gender roles doesn't really affect your life all that much. I think that I would have had a lot less stressful and confusing childhood if "because you are a girl" was not a reason for being pushed to act and be a certain way. Me being a girl should not be the reason I get to wash a massive amount of dishes at family gatherings, while my male family members get to hang out and watch football. I shouldn't have to watch the amount I eat in case I get fat (I was literally UNDERWEIGHT during high school). I wish that I got to wear makeup the way I wanted to, with fun colored eyeshadow, and dye my hair funky colors during my teenage years but I never got to because it would make me less attractive of a woman. I should not have to not be allowed to hang out with friends, because if it meant I had time for friends it meant I had time to help my family out with the never-ending list of housework and projects. Being a girl should not have prevented me from skateboarding, or getting piano lessons over guitar lessons. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What you're feeling is completely normal and valid for sure! Having people you love keep information from you "for your own good" sucks, no matter their reasoning. I don't think you should feel worthless though, your parents' past marriage status doesn't reflect on you in any way - you are still just as worthy of a person as yesterday, just with a bit more information onto your family history.

I understand where your parents were coming from though: not telling you allows you to grow up feeling more "normal", because it really is just a normal family but semantics can complicate it. They are people, and people have previous lives and stories and did things that may not have worked out. They may have intended to tell you in the future, but they may have forgotten about it or just didn't really know how to bring it up. Lots of people get married, and lots of people get remarried - your parents situation isn't all that unusual. 

In short, it's totally understandable you are upset that this information was purposefully kept from you. However, I hope that with time you come to recognize that the information that was kept on you really isn't as big of a deal as it feels right now.  </TEXT>

If he wants to help her out, he can use some of his savings or financial aid to pay her rent somewhere else rather than making you risk your stability. He can try and look for better jobs for her, or find rooms to sublet on Craigslist. He can pay for her rehab, therapist, or even just spend time fixing her resume.

<TEXT> Let's rephrase your question into: "Hey Reddit, my boyfriend wants to let his drug-using and broke friend to live with us for an unspecified amount of time, am I a bad person for saying no?". Looking at it from that angle it becomes very clear that you are making the only rational decision: saying no.

Your instincts are right, living with her is going to be very uncomfortable. Also, drugs are expensive: if she really wanted a roof over her head that badly, she would put it in front of her drug habits. There are shelters and job training opportunities she can apply for if she turns out to be homeless - she has options that do not intrude on your life. She's one of those people that is questionable but alright to keep around as a friend, but will be absolutely miserable to live with. 

Also, as the person paying for the apartment, the money used to subsidize her will be coming directly out of your pocket. That's really not an okay thing to ask of somebody. Furthermore, you already know her financial situation, so you are very well-informed at how unreliable she may be on paying any sort of rent on time. Also, once she starts to live there, it will be very difficult and a long process to kick her out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had the same experience at my CC, some of my professors went out of their way to make the class harder than it really had to be! It all worked out for me because it actually did help prepare me, but many of the professors were terrified of not preparing transfers properly so they erred on the side of caution and the extra work was really annoying at the time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As someone who went to a community college for two years (for only financial reasons) before transferring to a really good university, this has not been true in my experience. I have taken a lot of STEM classes at community college that really prepared me for where I am now. Also, most universities (in California, at least) are very clear on what classes they do or don't accept and from what schools. I had a very smooth experience transitioning from community college to a UC, personally, and I really disagree that community colleges are not worth the time. 

Community college counselors suck, because of the turnover, but they are always more than willing to show you where to find information that can better help you transfer, like required classes and transferable vs non-transferable classes. If anyone reading this is in California and is interested in going the community college - State/UC route, I highly recommend checking out Assist.org for transfer equivalency and requirement help. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I came across an ad for oneclass.com on Facebook and they were buying notes, so I decided to try them out. So far, so good!

If you are a good notetaker and use google docs/word for all of your notes, then it's very easy to upload your notes onto their system. You can also scan written notes in but, honestly, that seems like more trouble than it is worth.

You get a certain amount of coins for each upload you make (25 coins for the first 5 uploads, 75 for 6+ uploads) and you can redeem them for $10 worth of Paypal for a cash option or gift cards (1200 coins each). I have downloaded a complete set of notes for 5 classes and have made $40 in Amazon gift cards. 

The big catch to this is that you need to have a .edu email address to redeem your rewards, even though you don't necessarily need one to sign up and start uploading. 

It's easy money if you already take good typed notes, so I would recommend any college student looking for beer money to try this website out.

<TEXT> For one, dog's have much more acidic stomachs, which help prevent bacterial infections from food. Raw pork is a no, raw chicken is a maybe (didn't apply to my pup, dog allergic to chicken), and raw beef is fine as long as it is human grade meat. Boiling cooks the meat so it's perfectly fine to eat. Also people can eat raw eggs as well, we just tend not to because they are gross and slimy. 

My GSD ended up on a vet-approved raw diet because of his many food allergies and that's how he explained it to us, anyway. Dogs are pretty good at tolerating different kinds of foods as long as they are properly introduced. </TEXT>

Her SO probably thinks their relationship is great and they have been happily dating for quite a while now, but she is running around behind his back hinting at infidelity: what makes you think a relationship with her would be any different? Also, she is an EX for a reason. You should def contemplate on all the reasons why the relationship did not work out, and probably will continue to not work out. I feel like she is just keeping you around as "just in case" option as she seems content with her SO, but is very selfishly stringing you along.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You are perfectly in the right to be upset!!!

It was really shitty of your "friends" to expose you to sex without your consent. That's really gross and awful of them. 

It seems like your boyfriend was trying to pressure you into a parallel sex/group sex situation without telling you. That is super creepy and not okay. You are in your right not to participate in sexual activities! And yes, taking your top off in the same hot tub other people are doing sexual things in counts as a sexual activity.

I don't think the guy you are dating likes you as a person. He is inconsiderate of your boundaries, gropes you all the time, tries to pressure you into uncomfortable sexual situations, and doesn't even bother to keep plans with you. He thinks of you as an easy way to have sex. He's a loser, plain and simple. There are PLENTY of guys out there who aren't losers like he is. You deserve better than him. 

Also, if you break up with him and explain why, the only response you will get is "good riddance" because who the hell would be okay with his actions. They are just objectively awful. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know it's not what you want to hear, but I'm on your husbands side on this one, sorry. 

Your mother overstayed her welcome and wasn't treating you well, and she was being a terrible guest in his home. It sounds like you gave her lots of chances and help to get back on her feet and she didn't bother to take it. You were stressed about her staying and she was your "best friend" growing up, how do you think your husband felt about a hoarder woman living in your SHARED home? Eventually, your husband couldn't take the way she was acting towards BOTH OF YOU so he yelled at her. Lots of people yell, it's not exactly the world's worst thing to do. I think your mother is so used to you being a pushover that having someone call her out on it is the uncomfortable thing for her, not the yelling itself. She can't handle being the one at fault so she wants to make your husband share blame for something. 

Your mother was acting like a terrible person, and you were not stopping her. She put a lot of stress on your husband and your actions did not fix the problem. You may be used to the way your mother treats you, but your husband is not and should not have to be. 

Your husband married YOU, not your terrible hoarder house guest of a mother. I don't think he's an asshole for yelling at your mother, I think he is a normal person that snapped at a very ungrateful, unwanted, and terribly rude house guest. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Her being stressed IS NOT YOUR FAULT and she should NEVER hit you. Ever. Hitting your partner no matter how stressed you are is not okay. 
Is she going to therapy for her mental health problems? Therapy can teach her to learn better coping mechanisms for stress. 

Since she is the one who is mentally ill, it is her responsibility to manage her own health. Managing her health does not include calling you stupid and hitting you. That is her hurting you, and seems very abusive. Even if she is not vicious about it, she is taking her anger out on you and that is not okay. If she is aware of her issues and not actively working on stopping her behavior towards you then I would definitely use the term "malicious" to show her behavior. You are not a human punching bag! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your bf doesn't think that it's a bad thing when you get bit, which is pretty honestly crazy. It's not a dog problem, it's a boyfriend problem! 

 Unless he gets his ass into gear and trains his dog, the dog is going to bite some rambunctious kid or a confused stranger and then he will be forever marked as a dangerous dog and be at a higher risk of being put down. He will also be out plenty of money because he will have to pay the bills for taking care of the animal bite wound. By ignoring the dog's actions, he is hurting his own dog and himself. That dog CHASED YOU DOWN and BROKE YOUR SKIN. That's the definition of a dangerous dog right there. 

I know it's technically your bf's dog, but since you live with him you share responsibility somewhat for the dog's behavior. Start looking into dog training and get a professional in, and make your boyfriend pay for it. Also, start doing things that will make you "in charge" of the dog. Be the person who feeds him, walks him, trains him, etc so that he won't see you as a threat to your boyfriend. It's more work than having your boyfriend do it like he should be, but he seems very lazy and apathetic to the real emotional cost of owning a dog. 

Also, it's really messed up that your boyfriend's dog chased you down and attacked you, and he didn't give a shit. That really seems like the symptom of a larger problem.

<TEXT> I mean, it is your boyfriend's fault: you are right to blame him for losing the dog. However, he doesn't really seem that motivated to right his wrong and that sounds really frustrating. Everyone makes mistakes, but it's a good sign to accept them and try and fix them. I think him not wanting to do everything in his power to find the dog is a sign of bad character and very upsetting.

He put a living being in danger and didn't even do everything in his power to find the dog: that's a pretty crappy thing to do. 

I think a lot of people are going to think that you are just over-attached to a dog that isn't yours so you shouldn't care, but I disagree with them. It's okay to care and be upset! You care, and because of that you were more proactive than your non-proactive boyfriend who does not care enough to wake up and put out posters.  </TEXT>

Frankly, she is being a terrible guest and I would have a serious heart-to-heart with your roommate about getting his gf to stop harassing you. Your instinct to talk to him is right! What you want to go legally do is your business and it does not involve your roommate's girlfriend. You are nice enough to let her stay over in a place where she does not live and yet she has the gall to harass you. And for the record, not all "passionate feminists" are like this,very many are pro sex work.

<TEXT> I think you should let her go this time, as she didn't know how much it would cost. Even if she is trying to weasel out of it, it's not a lot of money to trash a peaceful roommate situation over. 

Also, it is understandable that she wouldn't want to pay because your alcohol bill is **UNUSUALLY** high for the average college apartment party. If 15 wasn't even half, that means you guys spent a minimum 30 each. 5 x 30 is **a $150 minimum.**  Did you guys buy exclusively name brand alcohol for that college party??? I can see why she would have sticker shock. Also, that's not including the cost of decorations! 

In most parties I've been to, party attendees are nicely asked to chip in for alcohol between $5-$10, usually through Venmo, or bring some booze to share. In the future that may help keep your cost down.

Next party though, make it very clear that everyone is splitting equally and if she doesn't want to pay her full share this time, her and her friends will not be participating. Also, you should definitely make it clear that it will be that costly. </TEXT>

You brought up how she was hurting you and she made it into how it was all your fault. All the things she said was because you were X, Y, and Z and she can do no wrong because she is always the victim. It's always YOUR fault, don't you see? She can't be wrong about this, you are trying to control her by asking her to stop making assumptions about you. How manipulative of you. /s

*That above paragraph was total sarcasm.* From me, a stranger in the open internet, that is what your girlfriend is coming off as. Just because people have been hurt before doesn't meant that they should go and hurt other people willy-nilly. If she isn't receptive to you talking to her, seriously try and bring up talking to a professional because her behavior is not okay.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Personally I have no issue with people bringing their SOs over. I share a room and I am perfectly fine with my roommates friends and her bf sleeping over whenever, as long as I get some warning. 

In regards to my apartment mates, I don't care if they have people over as long as they aren't obtrusive or loud. I don't even need warning if someone wants to sleep on the couch because I stick mostly to my room and the kitchen area anyway.

I sleep over anywhere from 3-5 nights a week at my boyfriend's flat, usually closer to 5. I usually get there during dinner time or after, and leave in the morning for class. I get along well with his flatmates and I help out with some stuff, like paying part of the electricity bill for a month I was over a pretty excessive amount, purchasing some cleaning supplies, cleaning dishes bonus dishes that aren't mine, and spoiling the apartment cat with fancy cat treats and playtime. I already have an apartment where I keep my stuff and pay rent, but I am okay with spending for small expenses to help make me a "net positive" to my boyfriend's apartment.

**HOWEVER** I am a bit younger than you (20) and in college, so communal living might be more acceptable to me. Also, it's kind of a given in our friend group that SOs are always welcome to stay over, as long as we all get along and everyone is respectful. If you aren't necessarily opposed to a significant other coming over, it may be okay to ask that they pay a portion of a utility bill, like electricity or water, to make up for their usage. Also, it's kind of an unspoken rule that SOs don't usually hang out at the common area of the apt without their partner.  </TEXT>

Furthermore, I have a doctor's appt coming up to talk about accutane so I want to see if I can make my skin calm down enough where I can convince myself I don't need to go through with accutane, because the side effects are scary.

Once my face chills out though, you can bet your booty I'll be back into my precious warpaint! Makeup is only fun if it makes you feel good about yourself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No wonder his girlfriend is possessive, she probably can tell he isn't exactly a faithful guy!

He just likes you because of the sex and he is trying to manipulate you. You know this, and he knows this. Just because a dude is attractive and has a sob story about his failing relationship doesn't mean he is a good person. 

You should definitely stop seeing him and tell his girlfriend. His gf probably suspects it and that's why she is possessive. 

Even if you don't know his gf, it's good to tell her because if he is cheating with you then he may also be sleeping with other women too, and putting her at risks of STDs. STDs often don't show symptoms in men, and women are often the ones who get the brunt of the physical repercussions of having them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Are guys not supposed to be interested in you or something...? 

Guys don't necessary get interested in girls because they wear provocative clothes, they can like them as people. I don't dress provocatively at all and the internet has rated me as plain and average (/r/rateme is harsh, lol) but I have still been asked out on dates and hit on creepily by weirdos. And yet, even though I dress modestly and am objectively "okay", I have a wonderful, smart, attractive, and serious boyfriend who thinks I am the prettiest girl ever. For what it's worth, I didn't really get hit on in HS either but I definitely got more attention in college. Teenage guys are shy and awkward pretty often, as girls are mysterious creatures they have never really had the chance to emotionally and physically explore, but during college they tend to gain some confidence and are willing to face rejection.

Dude 1 seems a bit like a creeper, sorry. Some dudes are just pervs, it sucks but there are a lot of them out there. Just be warned, those pervy guys often don't really care for women as people so try not to get into vulnerable situations with guys who make you uncomfortable. Dude 2 probably is somewhat into you, maybe he likes you in a relationship way or a FWB way. Dude 3 can either be into you secretly, but more likely is that he sees you as "safe" and thinks of you as a friend he can joke around with. </TEXT>

<TEXT> From this, you seem to be underplaying your own cheating. From the description you gave of your own actions, it feels like you are sweeping it under the rug and that it was justified. You believe you cheated not because it was your fault, but his fault. Am I correct?

It's very possible that your boyfriend feels justified to cheat on you because you did it to him, and didn't really accept responsibility. You made it so that your cheating was about problems in the relationship, so why can't his? He's probably thinking that if yours was okay, then why can't his be?

Honestly I don't think he is interested in being "serious" again. He put his trust in you and you broke it. He likes you enough to keep you around, but the terms and conditions of this relationship have changed. It seems like he has no intention of returning to the way things were pre-cheating, and I think that's something that you should really consider if you want to continue your relationship. 

He is also very clear on that aspect too, but I kinda feel like you want what you used to have so badly that it's hard for you to see. When he says he wants his "freedom", he doesn't want to be tied down to you, at least sexually. The very fabric of your relationship is different this time around and both of you have different ideas of how serious your relationship is.

Personally, I don't think he has any intention to stop sleeping around. You asked him to stop, he didn't. You can't force him to do it. The only thing you can really do is leave. </TEXT>

Your husband is upset that you asked him to stop abusing the *dog*, so he decided to punish *you*. Again, does that sound like a good person to you?

No. No, your husband is *not* a good person. Everything he is doing is wrong and hurts YOU, the person he made vows to. 

Is this normal behavior for him? He is acting like a pretty terrible person, and this is from a total stranger on the internet. The way a person treats those they see as "lesser" can tell you a lot about their character.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If she refuses to actually change her behavior, whether it be searching for an actual diagnose illness and treatment or simply changing habits, then are you sure she will be a good housemate? There are lots of important parts to being in an relationship and if she refuses to actually do what she said she would, then what's the point of living with her when you can't even *trust* her?

In my opinion, "sorry" doesn't cut it. She hasn't shown any effort into changing her behaviors. If it's that important to you, she should have changed. Frankly, she doesn't sound like much of an adult at all. She lets her dogs piss inside before realizing they need a potty break? It's really not that difficult to let a dog out once in a while. 

Those cats can't handle being outside on their own. Your girlfriend is literally a danger to them. Cats are cats, you can't do much to change them. People can change, but your girlfriend isn't even trying to. It's up to you to decide who and what you prioritize.

<TEXT> I am afraid to do this because I have only witnessed this once, and I am unsure if something of this nature has happened before or will happen again. Smacking used to be a way people trained dogs not to do stuff, so idk if it's even considered a crime to hit a dog that hard. There is no marks or anything. I have no proof, and if she finds out I reported her she will try and make my boyfriend's life miserable. :( 

If this EVER happens again though, I will be sure to report it to anyone who listens, evidence or no evidence, and straight up shame her in every possible fashion. I'm hoping that this was a one-time thing that she is too proud to admit that she messed up on, as she thinks of herself as an animal lover and thinking of herself as an animal abuser probably causes some confusing "doublethink" in her head.

For what it's worth, I have been providing the dog with an absurd amount of cuddles, pets, and treats and my boyfriend even ordered her a new toy. I want the dog to know that she has at least two people who will only ever be kind to her. 

I really appreciate your comment though. I think that if it was any other situation I would report it, but I'm just so afraid of backlash I'm going to hold off. Thank you. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have only seen her ever do this once, and I'm ashamed to admit I was so shocked and confused I just stood there. 

It happened so fast and the moment was so heated that I honestly forgot I even had a phone. If she EVER hits the dog again though, you can bet your booty the camera will be coming out because I am prepared. If this happens a second time, I will have no mercy and throw all politeness and tact out the window and show it all over social media and report it to the proper authorities. 

I was so shocked because she has never seemed like the person to be cruel to a dog. She's kinda mean to people, but never to animals! She's a vegetarian because she loves animals! She has a cat! It's just so mind-boggling that this happened. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If I may ask, are you mostly a side sleeper? I noticed that I was getting a lot of acne where I put pressure on my face with my pillow, because I sleep on my stomach a lot. If you are a side sleeper, it's possible that the pressure and oils that come out when you sleep mix together to form your current shoulder acne. 

To be honest I think I see extremely minimal differences in hair follicle amounts, but nothing seems to be out of the norm. People aren't symmetrical perfectly! I have way more hair on the left side of my head than my right, for instance. If clogged pores and ingrown hairs are the issue, than maybe a physical exfoliating agent like using a Salux cloth in the shower can help get the dead skin layer off and help minimize irritation and acne. The Salux cloths are really rough so I wouldn't use it on your face, but my back has peach fuzz and lots of sebum and this cloth works miracles on my bacne.

Furthermore, I noticed that a few of the zits look like they have been scratched or popped open. The zit bacteria can get on your hands and/or under your nails and spread that way. Putting acne stickers, like the CosRX pimple patches, on zits that look pop-able help keep you from picking and stop the spread of zit germs. You never know if it is or isn't the root of the problem until you try and change your habits. If the zits are itchy, you can just poke at the sticker to make them less itchy or scratch over them rather than irritating the acne itself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I used up a sample of Belief's Aquabomb and I really liked it, it's a great product but definitely a bit pricey. It played nicely under makeup and felt good on my skin. 

 I have hated with a passion every moisturizer that I've tried from Glamglow (Volcasmic and Glow Starter) because, while they are pricey as heck, they definitely put more money into the packaging and not the product. I could honestly see some of their lotions at the dollar store, they are that disappointing to me. 

If you are looking for a non-creamy lotion, you may really like Clinique's Dramatically Different Moisturizing Gel. It sinks in super fast and feels like nothing is there. It has a very light and non obtrusive scent, and the texture is very light and easy. It's a simple, no fuss gel moisturizer that does the job. I also have an acne-prone skin type and this has never given me any problems. Also it looks really nice and classy on a vanity, which is always a nice feeling! </TEXT>

<TEXT> For you, school was easy and an important part of life. When you envisioned your path to success, school was the stepping stone to achieve your greater goals.

However, some people just aren't cut out for school and your brother is probably one of them. There are other ways to get a successful life that doesn't necessarily involve education. You don't need to get straight A's to be a productive member of society. Colleges, especially Top 20 ones like yours, can be social bubbles where education is the *only* thing that can ever get you success, where everyone who doesn't go to college is seen as lesser: In the real world, that's not really true. 

If you like, you can always make sure your brother knows he has you to count on for educational help, and that you are willing to show him the ropes on how to do well in school. Don't ever put up with his rudeness and call him out on it, but also don't be pushy on trying to force him on the path you took. There are other options, like trade schools and community colleges, that don't require great grades. 

It's wrong of your parents to allow him to be so cruel to you, but is it possible that he is lashing out because he is embarrassed? That you're the "accomplished" child, and he doesn't think he can measure up so why bother? He wants to focus on athletics and social life, because those are in his comfort zone. Let him focus on those, as he's only 13, but make sure he knows that when he wants to start improving his education you are willing to show him resources. You can't force your brother to become motivated in school, but you can let him know that when he is ready for help you are there for him. </TEXT>

Your fiancee has every right not to want to do the dances if she feels she can't handle it. It is her wedding, too! She was very clear that she is not against you and your mother having a special moment but the dancing is just something that brings back sad thoughts what she has lost. Don't make your fiancee sad at your wedding. 

Also your mother was **exceptionally** rude to your wife. Have you talked to her and told her it was unacceptable? If not, it really seems like you care for your mother more than you care for your future wife. I can just picture her hanging out at the JustNoMil sub and wishing she married someone who didn't have a crazy mother who he won't stand up to.

Part of being married is making compromises. When you have the choice between happy wife/ sad mom or sad wife/happy mom, you should always pick the one where your wife is happy. If you can't do that, then maybe you should rethink what marriage means to you. </TEXT>

*However,* that isn't to say that it isn't dangerous. If you guys were just hanging out at home or with adult supervision it would be one thing, but you guys going out into town and hiking probably set your mom off. If something happened, like a mountain lion attack or an attempted kidnapping, you would not have been able to defend yourself, due to being awkwardly stuck together.

Your mom is just freaking out because you inadvertently put yourself in danger and the adults should have not allowed it to happen. She has every right to be pissed off. 

There isn't much you can do in this case, as your mom doesn't seem too mad at you. If you can get the parents to apologize and knowledge what they did wrong, even if they don't really mean it and are just saving face, your mom may still let you go on vacations with them because she knows it won't happen again. </TEXT>

The thing with any sort of drug is that it is almost impossible to quit unless you truly want to, and aggravating your health is unfortunately not all that important to her. Your sister doesn't care about her actions affecting your health, so you shouldn't care if you offend her by moving out. No matter what action you choose to take, someone is going to be upset, so you may as well make that person not you.

In my opinion you shouldn't stay with Dee. For your own health, you should probably move to a different apartment and find some new non-smoking roommates to help out with the cost. You can't really afford rent anyway, so moving will help with the financial troubles you've been having. </TEXT>

<TEXT> CALL PROTECTIVE SERVICES. Seriously. The children's safety matters more than how content you or your husband are with the outcome. When it's a question of "do I or do I not call CPS", call CPS and let them investigate.

They are there to serve in the child's best interests. For one, they rarely take children away, and if they do it tends to be because the children are living in very dangerous circumstances. In fact, they'll probably force the parents to take some of those parenting classes you've really wanted them to take. They also serve as a wake up call to many parents that what they are doing is not acceptable, and offer chances and opportunities to change it. 

On the rare chance that things are worse than they seem and CPS takes the children, they try and place them with family which makes you guys the priority guardians for the kids. Social workers don't want to send kids into the system, they want to keep them with their family because they are a pre-made support network.

Seriously, call CPS. They are literally there to protect children, and will do try and make sure that the outcome is the best it can be for them. Social workers go through extensive and specialized education to get where they are and have a passion for helping children and families, they have the ability to help foster the best outcome for the children. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Most hunters don't do it only because it's fun, there tend to be other reasons that add on that make it worth doing. Maybe they really like deer burgers, or maybe their dogs like to chew on elk antlers: there are tons of ways to have fun with hunting and not waste the animal. Most people don't do things for one reason alone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Heavily reacting and having a bad temper really doesn't scream "nice guy who cares too much", it screams "guy who can't control himself". Girls, who tend to be smaller and less strong than guys, tend to run for the hills because it means you pose a threat and you are someone to be afraid of, as what will happen when you get mad at HER? If you can't control your emotions to the extent others can, then you pose a very real and very dangerous threat.  When you work on that I'm sure you'll get better at your relationships! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here is my morning schedule! I'm 20/F and a university student.

**optional - 30-40 minutes** I take a shower every other day. This involves shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and shaving. Afterwards, I moisturize and apply exfoliating treatment if needed.

**optional -15 minutes** - Breakfast time! I need food and some sort of caffeine to be a functioning human, plus I need to clean up. On days where I know I don't have the time I skip it and get something to eat while I walk.

**10 minutes** - Brush teeth and do skincare ritual. This involves facewash, toner, lotion, and some sunscreen if I can remember. Apply dry shampoo if it's a non-shower day, and brush hair.

**15 minutes** - Picking out an outfit. I need to check the weather to make sure the clothes I am wearing will continue to be optimal throughout the day. How heavy of a jacket do I need? Scarf/no scarf? Is the building I have class in air conditioned or not? Is the walk to class short enough where I won't get sweaty? There is a surprising amount of thought that goes into this. Sometimes I am lazy and don't do this, but I usually end up regretting it at some point in the day. 

**20-30 minutes** - Makeup! I usually wear a no-makeup makeup look every day. I have uneven skin so I use a primer and that requires around 10 minutes to set, then I can apply foundation, concealer, blush, highlighter, mascara, setting powder, and setting spray. 

If I'm feeling fancy maybe I'll throw in some eyeliner or a lipstick. On the rare occasions I decide to do eyeshadow, that requires me to decide the colors I'm using beforehand, use an eyeshadow primer, wait five minutes for it to set, then add a glitter glue if I'm doing glitter, wait like a couple minutes for it to set, and finally apply and blend colors.  </TEXT>

There was a bit of a learning curve when it came to the amount of product used and application but I'm happy I powered through it.

I still won't go out and spend money on them though, free deluxe samples are my saviors. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A **primer** is indispensable on my face when I'm aiming for a flawless look. I personally really like Porefessional (mainly because I have a sample of it, lol) and use a little bit on my face, focusing mainly on my nose and cheeks. It helps the makeup not settle into my little face holes and cracks.

A **setting spray** also really helps. I use a powder to set my face makeup, and sometimes it can get a bit cakey. The spray helps it meld together! I'm currently using Urban Decay's Chill Makeup Setting Spray, which I found at Nordstrom Rack on sale. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Coola's setting spray has terrible packaging and I feel strongly about it.

Don't get me wrong, this is a great product. It has a buttload of SPF that actually does something, keeps makeup on my face, and the packaging actually looks really pretty. But THE LID. *THE DAMN LID*. It manages to leak product out, forming weird buildup on the lid and along the sides. This makes using the product a lot less luxurious and peasant than I would expect from the absolutely absurd price of $36 I paid for it. The cap also makes this product useless for travelling because it cracks so easily and rather than breaking off pieces while being usable, it creates a chain of events that slowly causes the lid to shatter and leave plastic shards everywhere. The product is pretty amazing and totally has the potential to be a cult favorite if it's packaging didn't make it so damn inconvenient to use. I wish I could repurchase this item, but for what I have had to deal with it's just not worth it. </TEXT>

And in your case, when your boyfriend looks at you he likes who he sees! He finds you worth it. He loves you!

If you want to recoup some money from it, you can always try reselling it on places like Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, Poshmark, and even certain subreddits that allow the selling of makeup.

<TEXT> You may want to lay off the medium to heavier foundations until your extreme sweating stops. Makeup primers, sprays, and all that good stuff can do a pretty decent job of helping face makeup stay put but you'll really have to noticeably cake it on, and there are no guarantees that the product will stay on. 

If you want to wear a base, wear something like a beauty balm or a tinted sunscreen, or even just a lighter foundation, as that way when it does inevitably start to come off it won't be as noticeable. You'll still have an overall skin-evening effect, but the makeup should fade away more gracefully and won't melt off noticeably. If you want to wear eye looks, wear eyeshadows closer to your skin tone and waterproof mascara, as that way you won't get black smudges under your eyes and if you get beads of sweat on your eyelids the marks they leave will be less noticeable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Relationships with someone should be a net positive. Your boyfriend should make you feel happy and secure. Right now, what does he offer you? Belittlement and disrespect. That's not much of a relationship. 

I know you're looking for a compromise, but your boyfriend clearly does not want one. It's either be bullied by his friend or not be bullied, and he chose the one where you get bullied. He values this friend over you, he may as well go date him instead, he likes him more than you after all. Why should you spend your time on someone who does not value you? You deserve a relationship with someone who cares about you. You are worth more than this!

There are four horsemen that signify the death of a relationship: Criticism, Defensiveness, Contempt, and Stonewalling. It really seems like your boyfriend is killing the relationship all by himself. </TEXT>

Your girlfriend might be a bit bummed she can't share the experience with you, but you are allowed to back out of smoking, it doesn't make you a bad boyfriend if you're uncomfortable with substances.

And just a note, since you say that you really like to keep control of your body and thoughts, you may be more at risk for getting the unpleasant side effects of smoking like paranoia and panic attacks. Only smoke if you want to smoke, because if you don't it completely takes all of the fun out of it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Reddit is an absurdly pro marijuana forum, so when so many people are telling you to stop smoking that young, you should probably listen! Also, you don't need to cut out weed entirely if you don't want to, just smoke every few weeks or once a month or so. Moderate yourself. 

Also the marijuana WILL impact your brain development. Its a drug, just like alcohol. Doing it too much too young is not good. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a 20 year old female and the thought of dating someone 16 makes me vomit.

 If one of my peers did that, I would think of them as creepy as hell and think of them as a predator, as 16 year olds are in a very different phase of life and know it or not, she can hold a lot of power over you in a relationship.

Your parents are right to separate you two. Your feelings are real, and maybe hers are too, but they just should not be for each other.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Can you visit the school's guidiance counselor? Or maybe a teacher you trust? They may be able to help you process how to cope with your mother. Focus specifically on issues where you or your sister get physically put in danger, like with the pot throwing and bringing all of those mentally disabled people over. Unfortunately, counselors can't do too much about the mental abuse but if they feel you are physically at harm they could possibly tack in on to her list of parenting failures. 

I am so sorry for what you have to go through. The level of control she exerts on you is unwarranted. Just remember, you only have 4 more years until you are 18! Study hard, and when you're older if you can prove that your mother is a whacko through text messages and such FAFSA may take pity on you and cut you loose financial aid wise from her.

Also, what place only offers one caretaker for 20 disabled people?? How was she not fired for taking a detour home?? You should definitely anonymously report that. She is entrusted and paid to take care of them, not drag them along like dogs on a leash wherever she wants.  </TEXT>

UCSD screwed up the time in my case, as I was supposed to be the 8am appointment with the movers but I ended up being the 9am appointment because the movers had someone on their list going before me. I had an email confirming my time, too. :(  So be prepared that the movers will be a bit later or earlier than UCSD tells you. The movers also offered me a ride to my new place at the village, but idk if that's their standard offer or if I just got chill movers. Other than the movers, someone at UCSD called and reminded me to drop off my old keys. Movers and phone call reminders are all I can really think of.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sell the iPhone, it can help you pay for his theft! Dumb phones do exist and are still out there, I'd recommend getting him one of those. He doesn't NEED a phone, he can always ask to borrow a teacher's or go to the office if it's an emergency. 

Also, if you want to make sure he isn't smuggling electronic time, you can shut off your router or, even better, block certain devices from using WiFi if your router allows (my NetGear does). You can find online tutorials on how to best implement parental features on your browser online. Also, if its possible, get a new card and get rid of of autofill so he can't get the chance to do it again. 

If he complains about being bored, take him to the library to pick out some books. Furthermore, make sure the parents of any playmates know how serious the ban on electronics are as I'm sure he'll try to get some time in there.

I find it terrifying that your kid managed to steal six grand and that he would have continued until he got caught. He is only a couple years away from high school! Take a GOOD look at his friends and peers, as your kid thinking theft is okay means that it's likely his friends do, too. I'm not saying he's a "bad" kid fyi, everyone was a kid who made dumb decisions at one point, but his bad decisions are worse than most and it's worth finding out who (or what)  is helping nurse those bad ideas along.  

Edit: Did you by any chance contact Apple about the iTunes use by your kid? They may be able to waive a huge part of it as the transaction was done by a minor.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The first step to realizing you have a problem is admitting you have a problem, and you did just that: hooray! Then, look into your thought patterns and see if there are a few things that are leading you to create this problem for yourself. 

I noticed that you have only terrible things to say of his girlfriend. Nobody is totally terrible, look deeply at her and think of some positive things about her, and whenever you think of her think of those good things. She is a human being, just like you, him, and me: she has flaws but also wonderful traits that make her great. She may act cold to you because she may pick up that you are into her significant other. Also, they have stayed together for a long time so obviously he likes her for who she is. Maybe she's not YOUR perfect significant other, but he likes her well enough, and he gets to decide who he is in a relationship with.

Furthermore, you said you rarely find people you like: is it possible that you're having problems finding others not because you are picky, but because you are hung up on some random guy who has had no interest in you for four years? I don't think you are giving other people a fair shake since you are so emotionally invested in someone unattainable.

Finally, do you really know him all that well? I think you are definitely idolizing him. He is a person, with his own flaws, unique traits, and preferences that nobody else may understand. By idolizing him and holding him as a standard for relationships, you're holding people to a standard that really isn't real: you are holding him out to be a perfect person and he is not. People deserve to be respected for the choices they make, and you should respect his choice to be with his girlfriend instead of you. If he was interested, he would have pursued you rather than her. Rejection is a tough pill to swallow but sometimes tough pills need to be swallowed to help out your health.

I honestly think that you could use a therapist: therapy is wonderful! You don't need to be afraid, therapists aren't the ones who prescribe you weird pills or anything - their job is to just talk things out and help you find out where you are going wrong and will be 10000x more helpful and better informed than a stranger on the internet.

<TEXT> Friendships evolve, people change. You may have both had the perfect friendship back then but now it seems like she is pulling away from you. If she is your only "primary" friend I would really recommend going out and joining some club or activity that can net you a new network of people, as that way you can find a different group of friends that value you and treat you the way you would like to be treated. The group seems to be closer to each other than you, and that tends to be a sign that it's time to find another group. It's not your fault, you did nothing wrong, but sometimes social groups do weird things that don't make everyone happy. I doubt she even realizes that she is doing this, but I think that her actions speak for themselves! High school will be over soon anyway, you have nothing to lose and everything to gain by broadening your friendship circle. I met some of my best friends my senior year of HS. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Have you politely asked her to stop telling you those kinds of things? If she doesn't know she is causing a a problem, she won't know she should change. Pick a time when neither of you are stressed or on edge, so not immediately after one of her texts or while someone is leaving for work, but rather sit her down and say you have something serious to ask of her.

 "Please stop constantly commenting to me when I work on my business's social media presence, it's disruptive to my work and I prefer to be able to focus my time on doing what attracts paying clients rather than having to defend myself. I understand you have an opinion but that is what the comment box is for under my pictures," is personally what I would say, as it's serious but not mean, however you know her better than I do and I'm sure you can find something that suits her personality better. 

While she is entitled to her opinion, someone as "old-fashioned" as her should know how to be more polite to people. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think that as long as you offer deep dishes for food and water, her beak won't set her back. I've raised a couple of crossbeaked birds and, as long as they have the dish depth, they can thrive. Also, feed crumble rather than big pellets and try to offer soft foods, like a mash made with her normal food  mixed with water. That beak defect looks pretty doable to work around, imo. In regards to the feet, I personally haven't dealt with it before, but I think that she will be okay.  Cleaning up and trimming down the foot fluff is a great idea, and also if she can't properly scratch at the ground with her toes you may want to clip her toenails once in a while. I have a couple very fluffy footed birds that don't properly wear down their toenails and cutting them prevents their nails from getting long and curly. I really like the suggestion of putting her in with smaller or younger birds, as she will definitely be bullied to the bottom of the pecking order-chickens can be jerks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really like Aerie and Victoria's Secret/Pink! When it comes to the VS, I always make sure to shop online and look for the ones that are either 100% cotton or have a high enough percentage, as all the ones in-store tend to be leftover crap that nobody wants. If I don't check the materials they tend to be that flimsy stuff that you have encountered. Aerie has wonderful soft materials and way cuter patterns imo, but their sizes run SLIGHTLY smaller than VS, not enough to size up and not enough to not be wearable, so keep that in mind. I have worn DKNY and Fruit of the Loom underwear, but I honestly didn't like either of them and they felt like they were the same exact ones as they both wore out so quickly. I tend to stick with cheaper underwear though, so I'm sure there are way better brands out there that cost more than $5/pair.

<TITLE> Is double minoring possible for a transfer? </TITLE>

<TEXT> Hi everyone! I got accepted as a transfer into the Psychology B.S. w/specialization in Social Science major, but I also plan on picking up a minor or two, if possible. My minor is going to ideally be either the business or entrepreneurship one, but a second minor would be really nice resume boost.

How feasible is picking up two minors as a transfer? I'm willing to do summer sessions if needed, I just want to know if it's reasonable and/or possible to do so.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I tried to use their three step system before, and it was surprisingly harsh. It did nothing for my acne, to be honest, and I think it just dried out my skin. I still use their moisture gel daily but the face wash stripped my skin and the toner stung and made me red, just like what is happening to you. The face wash I use sometimes for my back as it is tougher than most body washes, in my opinion. Also, I think the toner does have alcohol! It may be by a different name than you can recognize on first glance on the packaging, though.

If it's not working for you, you may be able to do a return! You can also try and supplement the light gel with a more occlusive and thick moisturizer, if you are really impressed with all the other things it's doing.

I think the Clique salesperson was talking about purging. [Here](http://www.labmuffin.com/purging-vs-breakouts-ditch-skincare/) is a source that can explain purging vs breakouts better than I or the Clinique person can. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not weird at all! 

Take this from someone who had great grades in high school and decided to go to community college to save money before transferring to a four year school. I don't regret going at all, as I saved so much money, but I definitely do recognize that I missed out on many social opportunities. Community colleges aren't really like "regular" colleges in regards to the social aspect, but you can still make friends, it'll just be much harder. I made many friends that I friended on Facebook and said hi to when we ran into each other, but there is a bit of emotional distance that is harder to overcome at commuter schools. The nice part about community colleges is that nobody knows or cares about anybody so nobody will think of you as a loser. Popularity literally does not matter, community college is for higher education and people recognize that at a level. You may run into a few idiots in the first month of your classes, but they'll very quickly drop out and you won't have to deal with them ever again. To be honest, I view my community college experience as simply time served to save money and am actually pretty content with that, as in a month I'll be off to my four year.

It's not as great as your parents are hyping it up to be, but it's not as bad as you are worrying about. You'll do fine. :) </TEXT>

If you are the entrepreneur type, you can also use your pets as therapy animals! Nursing homes are often happy to have any well-behaved pets to come in and say hi, no certification needed. I've brought my chickens and the residents loved it! This looks fantastic on college applications as well, plus it would be a very interesting story to tell your future employers in interviews. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have the absolute sweetest little 5 month old roo, however he is technically not allowed within city limits for noise reasons. I read up a bit on No-Crow Collars, which are these velcro collars for roos, that you can put on them to muffle their crowing. I'm okay with some crowing, just not the earsplitting COCK A DOODLE DOOOO that will undoubtedly wake my neighbors at 6 AM. He's not crowing loudly yet, but I predict we will be soon after he passes chicken puberty.

HOWEVER the reviews on Amazon are showing to be pretty nasty. Like, killed their rooster nasty. This leads me to really not want to try it, but since I see this recommended in a lot of websites I wanted to learn a bit more about other user experiences with them, positive or negative. 

Has anybody here tried a No Crow Collar or homemade alternative? Did it work?

I've heard nothing but bad things about Paraguard from my peers anyway so I'm noping out of it. Skyla seemed perfect for me, as its a lower hormone IUD that was made specifically for younger women in mind. 

And either way, I'm a college student from a very low income family (so low most of my college is free!!!) but getting any IUD at PP would cost me over $600!!  I heard SO MANY good things about PP so it sucks that it just isn't an option for me. :( I just really wanted to vent, I figured some of you ladies might know my pain.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> LDRs during college are extremely hard. I was in an LDR with my current bf for two years while he was in college and what helped the most was making time out of every week for a skype date and texting a bunch, all the while making sure to go have fun and make friends at our respective schools. 

Since we were busy we occasionally made handmade gifts for each other, like a little jar of notes to pick out of every day with a nice message or a joke. I have a massive amount of lipsticks, so I make little funny notes and sealed them with a lipsticky kiss, and whatever color he liked most that day he opened and read. He made me a little cookbook with recipes that we could cook together yet apart, like orange chicken or fried rice. Snail mail is also fun to do, especially when you can talk about and imagine your future together through them. I even wrote a few chapters of a crappy space zombie novel for him that I never finished - it's the thought that counts! We would also play games over skype. One game we played was a drawing contest where we would do timed drawings of random things, but we always added a bit of hilarious "flair" to it. We would have our own little countdowns until the days we got to see each other in person again.

Sometimes you're not going to feel like talking all the time over text or skype, and that's okay. Everybody needs time to go explore themselves in college and there is nothing wrong with spending a day without texting your bf or gf until late in the day, as long as there is proper warning, of course. 

LDRs are INTENSELY hard and require more effort than normal relationships. But if you are certain that he is someone who you want to be with, then why not try! It's really your decision.   </TEXT>

I also had much lighter and a bit shorter periods, but apparently that is a less common side effect. I have never been diagnosed with anxiety or anything, but I am a fairly "high-strung" person, however I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary in regards to my mental health. I went on OrthoTriCyclen birth control once and NEVER AGAIN as I became a very emotionally numb person, so pretty much the exact opposite side effect you had lol. Furthermore, spiro didn't do much in regards to acne for me personally. A few months in I started to break out with cystic acne in places I haven't before, however it did clear up my bacne a great deal. 

Just be warned that you will have to go to the bathroom A LOT. Like, crazy ridiculous amounts. I had to eventually quit using it because it was interfering with my schoolwork as I had to keep leaving the lecture hall/classroom and was constantly missing bits and pieces of lecture. </TEXT>

If so, rather than pushing for your roommate to get rid of the cat just because "it's too many cats" try pushing those issues. When you say that owning multiple cats at the age of twenty-three is excessive you come off a bit judgemental (not trying to be mean!!!

<TEXT> No, you are NOT a bad friend. I think your friends don't necessarily mean to be as rude as they are, but they probably have never struggled for money or had to budget that severely. However, they should NOT have called you a bad friend, spending money should not be a prerequisite for being a friend. If they keep pressing the financial issue, you know that they care more about those expensive activities than your financial well being, and those are the kind of people that nobody should have in their life.

Is it possible for you to explain to them, one more time, that you literally do not have the money to do certain activities? Don't feel pressured to "keep up with the Joneses", friends come and go but debt and poor financial habits can last forever. If possible, you can always white lie that you already burned through most of your savings. It may be a good idea to not discuss finances with this group of people as their definition of broke is different than your's. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Somewhat.

 I would say that douchebags who know how to save their douchebaggery for those below them in the social hierarchy, or at least have decent social skills, have the potential to succeed as those people tend to be very confident in themselves and have strong leadership/decision making skills. On the other hand, people who don't know when to turn their douchebag mode off are those people that nobody likes. 

That's my theory anyway, as correlation does not equal causation. Or, it could be that those who have fame and fortune feel confident in their place in the social hierarchy so they just do what they want.  </TEXT>

Exactly how does getting a tan lead you to believe she will cheat on you? Also, if her other friends don't bring their boyfriends along, it would be super weird to have you tag along and ruin the girls-night vibe. I have my phone on darkest all the time, specifically to save battery. Why are you trying to look at her phone in the first place? I also have no idea why you would mention that your girlfriend has had sex with two guys before you, so what? People are allowed to have their own lives before they meet their boyfriends.

You seem extremely insecure, her behavior isn't "putting herself on the market" at all. I think that you are just grasping for straws because you are jealous that other men might now be more interested in your newly social butterfly of a girlfriend rather than her extremely modest past self. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think your boyfriend is being very reasonable. You two have barely lived together, and now you want to get married just so you can get a visa? Yikes. If having a job is extremely important to you, you should get it yourself rather than making your bf take an enormous step binding you together, both legally and spiritually. 

You are well within your rights to frame it as a "marry me or I'm going back to China to work" argument, but be aware that most people will not marry their significant other's without living together for a long time. It's not fair to demand that of your boyfriend. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Is it possible to look for different jobs while you are a cashier? This will make your mother happy, as you will no longer be working a "dangerous" job, and should also provide you a source of income. Once you have a job offer, then you can quit working at the gas station. I think that it's pretty reasonable that she does not want you to work as a gas station cashier, they get robbed at gunpoint quite often compared to other stores, but it's also reasonable to make sure you have a job set up before you jump ship.

Also, are you working full time? Having only $300 in expenses should allow you to save pretty easily. Check out /r/personalfinance if you need tips to help save up for college. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm going into UCSD as a transfer student and one of the things that the school is really encouraging me to do is take my major-specific orientation in addition to the regular transfer one. I'd have to fly in and get a hotel for that time, which would cost a good bit of money, so I want to know for sure that it will be useful.

Has anybody done a transfer major-specific orientation and was it worth it? </TEXT>

For me personally, moisturizing is extremely beneficial! It keeps my skin happy by keeping it's oiliness down, as it prevents overproduction of face oil throughout the day. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Have you thought about taking her to a child therapist? Sometimes certain kids are just very high needs and can be excessively difficult, and having a neutral party who can really feel out your child and give you tailored and professional advice can be a huge boon. A professional may be better able to spot why she behaves this way and how to stop it.

I noticed that you mentioned screaming matches with your child. Do you interact with her during her fits? If so, ignoring her may help. Just say "no" calmly and move on with your day, allow her to cry it out. Yelling or acting upset can just make her more upset, which makes you more upset, and then a cycle of misery starts. If you "grey rock" her, she will eventually learn that throwing a tantrum doesn't get her any kind of attention and is useless. Remember, she is just 4. You can't argue with her because she literally doesn't have the mental capacity to understand your reasoning. She isn't some evil tyrant, she is a four year old child.

<TEXT> I think you are being overly controlling about this issue. Your girlfriend knows about this feature and understands it, and to her it does not seem like a big deal. And frankly, as an adult, she can decide how to set her own social media privacy. Snap Maps are similar to tagging a post on FB with your location. Sure, it shows your location, but if you make it willingly it's not a big deal. 

I understand that you have reservations about Snapchat and social media privacy, but you can't force her to change her privacy settings just because you feel uncomfortable for her safety while she feels okay with it. You are very well within your rights to voice your concerns, but I feel like you are looking for ways to convince her that you're right and she is wrong rather than taking into account her feelings about the issue. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I actually really enjoy Milk's Sunshine Skin Tint! Its definitely not a true foundation, more of a beauty balm. It has very light coverage. I notice that it makes my acne look much less intense and I haven't had any problems with it sticking to dry spots. It's definitely on the dewy side for sure. I have oily skin so I set it with powder and I think it looks pretty good throughout the day. Skin Food Peach Sake Powder is what I use, but most setting powders should work fine.  I feel like the oil my face makes doesn't really break up the foundation, which is a pro, but it does create shiny spots if it's hot or by the end of a long day so blotting papers are a godsend. I really like it because it hasn't caused any breakouts at all and it has SPF in it! It is a very comfortable foundation to wear because it is so light as well! </TEXT>

<TEXT> You could be very easily conventionally pretty if you switched up your makeup style a tad! I think that getting rid of the lower eye liner and making the top lid line thinner close to your inner corners would help open up your eyes, giving you a more feline look. You have a beautiful bone structure and you pull off the blonde nicely, imo. Currently you're a 5/10, average but nothing special really. You have the natural looks but I really feel like your makeup style is REALLY dragging you down. To be honest,  you look a bit trashy with the style you are trying to pull off. You could def be at a solid 7/10 if you changed up a few makeup things. Of course, I totally recognize that makeup is an art form and a personal preference, so you do you!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been reading your comments and your sister and your parents seem like REAL pieces of work. If you don't mind starting a little bit of drama, tell your HS counselor about the living conditions you are in. Having fecal matter all over the house is a cause for serious concern! Oh, and be sure to take lots of pictures as proof. This may or may not prompt a visit from CPS about your welfare. Hopefully that would be a wake up call to your parents that if they want to live like pigs they can, but they should not force you into a health hazard.

Another possible option is public shaming. Does your sister have any friends or any sort of social life? Private message your friends asking them if they could PLEASE convince them to make your sister clean up after the cats. Send pics. If there is a dude she likes, try and target him specifically. 

If you would like to help the cats (which you totally should) please try and report your sister to the ASPCA and/or local shelter for an animal hoarding situation. Call Animal Control, that's what they are there for!!! Ask to be kept anonymous, if possible.

If you want to do something productive for the cats, make or buy a bunch of litterboxes. I'm talking like ten of them, and place them around the house. 

Also your sister just sounds like an absolutely shitty person, almost as shitty as all the poop she leaves to lie around. I am so so so sorry for what you have to go through. :( It is definitely not fair to you to live in a biohazard. It is very selfish and lazy of your parents to allow you to live in a biohazard without a care for your health because they don't want to deal with your sister's tantrums. </TEXT>

What really helped for me was following my friends on it and watching what they were doing with their lives. I felt proud of these awesome people I knew growing up and having their own adventures! Social media is also a great way to connect with old HS friends if you will be visiting the area their college/work is.

Also, don't forget that HS was just a bunch of people lumped together due to area. After graduation, people leave and gravitate towards places that contain even more cool people than their high school did. I know you're sad, and it's perfectly okay to be, just remember that you can still see your friends again later if you reach out to them. You'll make new fantastic friends too, don't worry. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> One of my eyes is hooded more than the other, so maybe I can offer a suggestion. On days when I wear eyeliner, I do the line thicker on my left eye, as it is the eye I have more lid space on, and thinner on the right, as that is the more hooded. When my eyes are closed it looks a bit off, but when my eyes are open it actually looks pretty good!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Sephora perfume samplers are great! It comes with a selection of sample/mini perfumes and a certificate for a rollerball or full size, depending on the package you pick out. It's more personal than a gift card and it gives the recipient a choice to what the actual gift perfume will be. Plus, trying out perfumes can be a really fun experience! </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Best:** Milk Makeup Sunshine Skin Tint! I love this stuff. It's nice and sheer so it evens out my overall skin tone, and plays nicely with my IT Cosmetics Bye Bye Under Eye Concealer that I use on my acne. I set it with a bit of powder to keep my oiliness at bay and I have had zero problems with it. It also plays nicely with my sunscreen AND has SPF in it already.

**Worst:** I HATED the Maybelline Dream Fresh BB Cream, oily skin version. It turned orange and felt goopy on my face. I feel like I am the only one who hates it because it is pretty popular, but it just did not play well with my face. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Routine Help] What do you all use to take off your makeup? </TITLE>

<TEXT> I have recently started using Differin and the [Kirkland Signature Makeup Removing Wipes](https://www.amazon.com/Kirkland-Signature-Hypoallergenic-Facial-Towelettes/dp/B00AZNIAG8) I have used for quite a while have been making my face burn after I use it. So goodbye makeup wipes, you have served me well, but I guess it's time for me to find a new makeup removing product!

Do any of you have any suggestions for low-irritation ways to remove makeup? 

I have been going through a deluxe sample of [Omorovicza Thermal Cleansing Balm](http://www.sephora.com/thermal-cleansing-balm-P296412) which is AMAZING but there is absolutely no way in hell I am paying $110 for a fancy makeup remover. Since using the balm with this random cheap rubber face scrubby thing my skin looks feels so soft and my acne is less red and irritated-looking. 


For reference, here is my routine:

AM: splash face with water, apply a lotion and some sunscreen, put on makeup

PM: take off makeup, wash face with black african soap, apply Fresh Seaberry Oil, apply Differin

<TEXT> I have acne and I noticed that when I go on streaks of wearing most foundations, my skin gets a bit angry and breakout prone. However, when I use a light BB or tinted moisturizer, such as Milk Makeup Sunshine Skin Tint, with a heavy-duty concealer tapped onto my problem spots my skin my face looks pretty good! I get hyperpigmentation VERY easily and have red/purple spots all over my face, so using IT Cosmetics Bye Bye Under Eye on those spots helps conceal them really well.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> From the description, it is difficult to tell for sure due to the information coming from your bias only. I personally think that they were just friends. Defining a "normal" friendship is a bit difficult, as everybody has their own version of what is normal and what isn't, but I think their relationship was probably platonic. 

Hanging out with friends without an SO present is normal and healthy behavior. It's a bit unusual to have a best friend that is a girl, but it is not unheard of and it works for very many people. I am getting the impression that your ex boyfriend was friends with this girl before he started dating you, so that may be why they act so familiar with each other. 

To be honest, from this post I'm getting the feeling that you are upset that your relationship with your ex ended and you are looking for someone to blame. You don't want to examine the messy reasons why you two weren't right for each other, but are looking for one "big" reason. Not every relationship has to end from infidelity, some just end because people were not a good match, and that is perfectly okay. You two working out does not mean you are any less of a person - sometimes in relationships that idea gets forgotten.

You said that you are used to people lying to you, but assuming that you are constantly being lied to is not a healthy mindset to have. Part of having a partner is trust, and your default was to not trust. I also noticed that nowhere in this post did you mention bringing up your concerns to your ex-boyfriend. You also said that you had trust in him for the first year of your relationship, was there a big event that changed all of that? Projecting your insecurities and fears onto someone can just send you into miserable spirals of unreasonable doubt, which can cause problems of their own.

Break-ups SUCK, there is no denying that. However, don't lose sight of yourself! Don't tie up your identity with your ex-boyfriend's. Does it really matter if he had a crush on her or not? Now, you two are no longer intertwined. You are free what you like, and so is he. My best advice would be to go distract yourself with a new hobby, join a gym, take a class, do SOMETHING that will help remind you that you are your own awesome person and that having an ex-boyfriend, who may or may not be an emotional cheater, no longer should be a cause for concern. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Are you happy being dependent on each other? If so, then I honestly don't see it as something to worry about. Your partner can also be your best friend! I've noticed that most married couples are very dependent on each other, it comes with marriage.

The only thing I would really caution against is losing your social skills. In the future, there may come a time when making "friends" with someone will come in handy. If making full-fledged friends currently is difficult, focus more on making casual acquaintances. You don't need emotional intimacy with people other than your soon to be husband, but just talking and getting to know people casually might help you professionally. To work on this right now, I would ask your therapist for methods that would help you "get out there", so to speak, and strike up casual conversations with people in your everyday life. Since you said you have severe anxiety I am unsure about advice that could help, but if you tell your therapist your communication goals I'm sure he/she can offer some helpful tips.

<TEXT> If you are sure that you are polyamorous, good for you! You are entitled to that. However, your girlfriend is also entitled to expect monogomy from her partner. This leaves you two at a stalemate, one that I truly don't believe either of you can overcome. 

You two broke up those many times for a reason. Don't spend your time looking for the monogomy inside you that you don't have. If you truly care for her as a person, you would let go of her romantically and let her find someone who can give her the monogomy she craves. If you are having trouble being around this girl due to your attraction, I'd recommend separating yourself from her for a bit. If she asks, tell her that you could never be monogomous. If she asks about it, be clear that you can never be happy being monogomous: it's just not you. 

I know it's hard to let somebody go, but I think that you know deep inside that you two are not compatible. And that's okay. :) Sometimes we fall in love with people that we can't be happy with, it's just human nature. There are people out there that will be perfect for you, and people out there that will be perfect for her: you two just have to let go of each other and find them.

<TEXT> I'd say you're 5/10, around average. You're facial features aren't bad, it's just that you don't know how to frame your face at all. For instance, your hair does not flatter you. Those sideswept bangs absolutely do NOT work! Also, I think learning to use makeup to your benefit can help you look objectively more attractive, as most of the people on here see makeup as the "default" look for women.  It sucks and is super unfair, but it is the honest reality that when so many women wear it, it becomes the new "normal" standard of beauty. I can't really rate your body or suggest improvement as you didn't include any pics of it that show it clearly. I like the picture of your hair pulled back the most, maybe try out wearing that sort of hairstyle more?  </TEXT>

In summer time I really enjoy wearing brown sandals because it tends to look better with lighter-toned summer outfits. I have a pair of brown boots as well, but I don't wear them as often because they aren't very comfortable. I would wear them more often if they were comfier! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I LOVE my Timberland boots. I've had them for five years and have had them resoled once, now they are good as new! They are made of a really thick leather that protects your feet really well; I actually dropped a chunk of concrete on my foot once and my toes came out unscathed. The insoles on them are really thin and removable, I put in a Dr. Scholl's gel one and it fits nicely. You can get off-season ones for cheaper online, as usually they run around $150ish for a pair for new ones. However, they will last you many years so I'd say it's worth the splurge! </TEXT>

<TEXT> For what it's worth, I think you did the right thing. She made the decision to cheat and not study, making her class spot a waste. Not only is cheating morally wrong, but it negatively effects other students who want to get into classes she takes up because of limited seating. People like her are devalueing all the work people put into their studies and, frankly, shouldn't get the same degree that other people who completed their classes fair and square deserve. 

Also, while the professor may not be able to catch her in regards to this specific exam, he or she will now know to keep an eye out for suspicious activity in the future. So while nothing may happen to her now it may later, all because of her cheating yet again. She knows what she is doing is wrong and doesn't care, so don't feel bad about her, your "friend" made the mistake of cheating all on her own.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really disagree with you. Cheating isn't something that should be normalized. If you're not doing the work and taking up space in college, your spot should go to someone willing to put in the work and make use of the class, not left to someone who can't cut it. If she gets dropped from the program that frees up slots for other students to take when signing up for classes. Also, if OPs class is curved, the girl getting an artificially high score would negatively impact other student grades.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You are a solid 6.5/10 to me! You are definitely above average and have an avant garde look about you, although I can see how that wouldn't be everyone's personal preference so that may explain why some people rated you really low. Lots of people on here aren't fans of unnatural hair, piercings, or tattoos- anything that's not pretending to be "natural" is frowned upon here a lot. I would recommend doing a different shade of blonde if you want to stay blonde, as I think that shade just doesn't suit you, and neither does the hairstyle. Your face is great, it's just all the details that are screwing up your rating. I think an auburn would be the most flattering color on you, personally. I also think you're one of those people who's conventional looks would really go up with a dash of mascara and some tinted brow gel. Not enough to look "done up", but enough to add a little bit of contrast into your look. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would really strongly advise you not to go through with this new job! It seems super sketch. Also, if it seems too good to be true, it probably is. 

This guy is obviously very into you and wants to hire a pretty, young woman to work for him. Since he owns the company and is vague about the company and job itself, I think it's likely that he is looking for a "sexy secretary" that he can have adult relations with and/or is trying to get you to join a multi-level marketing scheme. The sexy secretary job is most likely in my opinion, but some multi level marketing people have interesting and crazy tactics. Either way, you would be "indebted" to this man, your potential boss, who is obviously offering you a job due to liking you based on appearances. I think I don't need to tell you how he would like you to repay him!

Also, if you do end up taking the job and it doesn't work out, what would you do? You'd be out of a job. You would probably have to go out and slam as many interviews and resumes as you possibly can to get a job in a short time frame, while currently you have the opportunity to take it easy and apply to a few places at a time. You have the chance to do baby steps in the realm of interviewing, rather than jumping in headfirst into the professional world of high-stakes office interviews. </TEXT>

I waited until I was 18 to get my permit after my family embarrassed my dad about me not driving.

This stuff is GREAT. It's very full coverage and you only need the *teensiest* bit to do the job, whether it be undereye circles or acne coverage. It lasts all day for me! It's smooth, creamy, and does the job: it's everything I want in a product!

**WORST**: Clinique Acne Solutions Clearing Concealer ($18)

I was really disappointed in this concealer. It dries so fast that blending is practically impossible, and is streaky as well! Throughout the day it oxidizes and breaks apart, which is weird because other products don't do this on me, plus I don't even use a primer so wtf concealer why are you such a failure? Also, it doesn't help clear acne at all. If anything, it just irritated my skin into forming MORE acne! I have nothing nice to say about this product. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If I may ask, which antibiotic are you on? I've been on Clindamycin for years and it really helped me out! I use azelaic acid and hyaluronic acid daily, and my azelaic acid as actually in the same bottle as the clindamycin (Curology), so you are definitely safe there.

I don't see how the actives can really negatively interact with the antibacterial. If you are using Clindamycin, [it works by blocking the bacteria from making proteins](https://www.drugs.com/monograph/clindamycin-hydrochloride.html) and has a whole giant list of medical stuff that it okay to use in conjunction, so you are likely free and clear of any interactions between the actives and the clindamycin. 

However, there is usually [alchohol](http://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/clindamycin-topical-route/proper-use/drg-20063064) in the prescription, so it is recommended to wait a while before applying more products, like actives I'd imagine, to avoid the risk of skin irritation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can personally attest to this working! Oil on oily skin trains your skin to be much less oily, at least in my experience. I used to have very oily skin and few drops of Fresh's Seaberry Oil every night has significantly helped with the amount of oil my skin produces during the daytime, sped up acne scar discoloration healing, and also reduced the amount of acne i get.    I haven't tried the specific product you are interested in, but don't be afraid of oil!  It has helped me, so it may help you. If that oil doesn't work, there are lots to experiment and choose from. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ukrainians just do not give a flying fuck about being racist. They will openly talk about how much they hate Muslims, Africans, Gypsies, and pretty much anyone. Nobody blinks an eye! I know we have racism in the states, but usually people aren't so direct about it! Also, it's like gay people just don't exist over there, nobody ever is out of the closet or talks about them. You never see same-sex relationships out on the streets.

Also, in Ukraine, women are expected to get married and have kids pretty early on. If you don't, your family nags the ever loving hell out of you. It doesn't matter if you go out and just graduated med school like my cousin, you will not get left alone until you find a "good enough" man for your family's approval. Here in the states I've noticed professional or well-educated women tend to have leeway in marriage age, but over there it is a get married *right now* attitude. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Coding for sure! It can count to fulfill the second language requirement in schools, or even take the place of an English Lit class. 

Lots of students already speak a second language that ISN'T French or Spanish, so giving them the opportunity to learn coding would be pretty awesome. And other students, frankly, just are going to forget all the Spanish or French they've learned immediately after the final. Why not give them something useful that will stick?

In regards to replacing English Lit with coding, I can tell you that all but one of my English classes in high school was an absolute waste of time. I took Honors Engish three years in a row, and it was useless. Absolutely useless. </TEXT>

If OP had to test into it, he may have been really familiar with that particular math he was learning in that class and did well on that part, but if he scored low enough on other kinds of math that he may not remember because it was so long ago, he could have been booted down a class. Some schools don't have the best testing systems.

**Blush**: light and slightly shimmery is the best (looking at you, Benefit Coralista!)

**Foundation**: sheer- medium coverage, satin or skinlike finish

**Bronzer**: matte, mainly because I only use it for contouring

While I love the instagram look of sharp af cheekbones, it doesn't translate to anything but brown streaks on face for me.

<TEXT> If it's for a college student, a hangover kit! A giftcard to a nearby cafe, some pedialyte, and mini bottles of booze. If they don't already have it, Cards Against Humanity is always a hit and Cyanide and Happiness just came out with a great card game. 

For fancy shmancy full-fledged adults, a basket of fancy snacks is a good option. Some expensive olive oil, truffle spread, cheese, wine flavored jelly, and a high quality bar of chocolate. Stuff that they may not normally splurge on, but still would use.

For kids, a gift card to a toy store would probably be the best. 
Nobody but the kid seems to know exactly what he/she likes, so that way the toy would be actually used. Try to avoid places like Toys R Us or Target, and go for a smaller family-owned toy store because those ALWAYS have the better toys.

For teenage girls, Sephora or Ulta gift cards are usually appreciated, or a gift card to a fancy cafe. Or even Starbucks, it's not just for pumpkin spice loving white girls!

For teenage boys, if they are into gaming find out what console they have (or pc, really) and get a giftcard either for the online store OR for a place like Steam or Gamestop. 

If you want something that is really cheap and most people would like, it may be worth checking out Pinterest and doing those mason jar hot cocoa mixes or cookie mixes, writing things on it fancily, and wrapping it nicely. It's handmade so people will like it, and it's cheap because it's pretty much food!

<TEXT> Yup! I would. I agree that both men and women are intrinsically equal. Yes, there are definitely biological differences between sexes (men on average tend to be stronger, women on average tend to have better emotional intelligence), but that does not mean that we should not have equal opportunities. 

Men shouldn't shy away from wearing pink because it's girly and unmasculine, and therefore "bad", they should have the opportunity to wear what they want. Girls shouldn't be pressured to not go into the army, as some women are crazy strong and would do fantastic in combat roles. Sure, it's traditionally a "mans job", but if you can do it just as well why should your gender be a barrier? If both a man and a woman are doing the same exact job to the same quality, then they should be payed equally! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I personally think it's fine if there is a year or two difference in age, but I personally avoid that. It's just not my thing. Once you get into your later twenties and thirties it really doesn't matter imo, but if you are late teens to early twenties those few years can make a big difference in immaturity. I personally like to date guys who are either my age or a year older/younger, as I think our life experiences are most compatible and we tend to have more similar things in common.

From my personal anecdotal experience, if a girl is dating guys who are over 2 years younger than her (HS and early college, primarily), then it's because guys her age won't put up with her crazy so she had to open the dating pool a bit.

With couples who are older, the maturity gap between the ages really narrows so it tends to be no problem. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Do NOT buy him a computer. You said it yourself, it will just keep him from facing his problems head on and while he may enjoy being lost in the world of 1s and 0s, gaming isn't going to do anything but be a temporary fix. He needs to take control of his life, and you probably enable his bad habits. 

I've been severely depressed as well, and even I think that he needs to stop focusing on gaming and really start to work on himself. He will never get better if you coddle him and hold his hand for everything he wants. Yes, you and your family should be a place of support and comfort, but he should not be able to walk all over you. If gaming is so important to him, then he can make the trek to the local library to play on their computers. If he doesn't want to, tough shit. Just because someone is depressed and isolated doesn't take away the more negative parts of their personality, like taking advantage of people.

Just because he is depressed doesn't mean you should make your life harder for yourself. You need to save the money for your masters! That is a VERY important step in your life, and you should not be giving that up for a guy who won't help himself. How can you help him if he will just bleed you dry? </TEXT>

Going into her facebook to take screenshots of a guy who "shows sexual desire for her" when your girlfriend did nothing wrong is pretty shitty. If she is talking to him like nothing happened, then she probably wants to maintain a friendship. Also, are you sure you aren't misreading his intentions? You were very vague about that, and when people are vague it tends to mean that they are hiding it so that people agree with their point of view.

<TEXT> In typical reddit switcheroo style, this is how I rejected a guy accidentally. Oops!

In high school, there was this guy I shared 5/6 classes with. As you can imagine, we weren't super close friends but we did get to know each other pretty well! 

Imagine my surprise on Valentine's day when he and his group of friends came up to him, and encircled us. He, wordlessly, handed me a really pretty lily. I was pretty confused at this point because, again, WORDLESSLY, so I thanked him and gave him a hug. I was flattered but pretty confused. Then walked away slowly, because he just stood there looking at me awkwardly and there was a whole crowd of teenage boys with their eyes on us. I had pretty much no idea what was going on.

I found out later that he wanted to ask me to be his Valentine, but once he gave me the flower he got super nervous and forgot how to talk. And me, being the awkward low self esteem bearing teen that I was, didn't get the clue that he was just as awkward as me. So I just walked away and it didn't hit me until days later that he may have liked me, but by then it was too late! </TEXT>

I've had similar stuff happen to me, with friends who turned out to have less-than-platonic intentions, and I shut it down immediately. Shirtless pics sent? Comments like "OMG stop being so cute"? Yea, that's the second your girlfriend should tell him to knock it off. You are not out of bounds if you ask her to tell this guy to stop being so flirty, because he is REALLY flirty.

I think that yes, this is cause for concern. I would NEVER put up with my boyfriend doing that to me, and I would NEVER do it to him. Flirting with people like that guy is pretty borderline emotional cheating. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Almost everyone watches porn, even girls. Do you think less of your dude friends (or yourself?) for watching porn? Because I can guarantee that the vast majority of human beings with an internet connection look at porn. Porn is just a fantasy and is a completely healthy component in people's masturbation lives. 

You are allowed to have porn be a dealbreaker for you, but just so you know it's one that isn't that common and if you find a girl who says she has never watched porn or used written porn or anything, she's probably lying. The only time porn is really BAD for relationships is if it's a porn addiction. 

And sex does not equal masturbation. Were you raised in a super religious household or are super religious? Because IMO your views on your girlfriend watching porn are unrealistic.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If she didn't bleed or get hurt that's a GOOD thing! Frankly dude, a teenager not knowing about this stuff is okay but you are a full-fledged adult. You should definitely researched how this kind of stuff works before you went and had sex with a girl that much younger than you just so you know what to expect. I think what happened is that she *researched what to do*. Also, do you think she doesn't watch porn and is supposed to be completely confused as to how sex is supposed to work? Because I am sure you are sorely mistaken if you think so. 

What I think is worse is that you, an adult, are thinking of these accusations and you really have no way of knowing. You are an ADULT, go ask her! Use your communication skills. 

Also, just a note, I really feel like you are taking advantage of this girl. You are concerned because she knew how safe sex works, was turned on, and didn't bleed? That's concerning, as it shows that the sex was only for YOUR enjoyment and not HERS. She literally just showed that she knows how sex works and how to enjoy it. You wanna know why sex didn't hurt? Because she was excited. Why didn't she bleed? I don't know man, maybe because HYMENS GET BROKEN FOR LOTS OF REASONS. Oh, and the condom? Almost every single high school offers sex ed.

Also, just so you know it's probably not a good idea to date a high-school age girl when you're 25. Congrats, you waited until she was 18 to have sex with her, barely legal yay. Do girls your age not put up with you or something? It's actually really creepy and weird, and it makes you look like a predator. The general rule for the minimum is half your age plus 7. 26/2 + 7 is 20. Frankly, this entire post is giving me creep vibes. Especially in the whole "huge step in our relationship together forever". I honest to god hope she doesn't stick with you forever, as you are a paranoid creeper OP and she has her entire college years ahead of her. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I used up one absolutely fantastic Haus of Gloi lip balm, a Stila concealer that was kind of eh, a Kat Von D tattoo eyeliner mini (that I promptly bought a full size of), and hit pan on the Benefit Coralista blush that I've been working though for three years now! I'm also superrrr close on finishing off my Skin Food Peach Sake Silky Finish Powder, which is a translucent powder I'd recommend to anyone! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bringing it up to your mother when the boyfriend isn't around would probably be the best way to go, as that way he can't interject anything that would cloud what you experienced. Bring it up gently, and tell her that her boyfriend has been controlling of you and trying to "parent" you but are treating you like some sort of delinquent, when you're not, (since she's been a singe mom for a while, that may give her a pause) to an extreme that you aren't used to. He is effectively taking away the freedoms that you've had and show that you can handle. You have great marks, do everything around the house, and are a responsible young adult: you have already shown that you can handle the responsibility of making your own choices.

I think that what her boyfriend is doing is WAY out of bounds, as he has absolutely no right to try and punish you. He is your mother's boyfriend of 6 months, not a parent, and I think he doesn't realize that. He is very controlling and I think that it's good he doesn't have kids of his own, or else they'd probably hate him for being so overbearing. You seem to be super mature and capable, so just hold on! You're almost 18! When you're 18, he would have no legal right to take away your car keys if you are on the lease and can use legal mumbo jumbo as leverage. </TEXT>

If you purchase one for a certain amount of money, it comes with a makeover, and I think the higher price tier allows for a more in-depth one.

<TEXT> Weed is TYPICALLY less harmful then alcohol, but not always. 

Sure, lots of people can live happy and productive lives being smokers, but I think Randy from South Park said that, "it makes you okay with nothing". He is completely right! A lot of teenagers (and even middle schoolers!) I see that take up smoking weed stop being interested in doing anything. Everything takes a back shelf to the whole "stoner" lifestyle. I do not think that is healthy, especially as the brain is developing. 

Also, marijuana can trigger mental problems in people who are already or are on the verge of having issues, like a panic attack in a naturally anxious person, or a mental break in a schizophrenic. I personally don't smoke because it makes me "slow" for a few days with my problem solving skills. I've heard of other people on /r/trees having this same issue as I do, and I choose not to smoke because I can't afford to have any brain sluggishness hurt my GPA.


Weed isn't physically nearly as dangerous as booze, but it still has side effects that people should be aware of!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A significant portion of the people who go on it are mentally unstable or homeless, and therefore act weird, smell bad, and like to do/say odd and uncomfortable things.

My experience on the public bus I take to college:

-guy watching porn and jerkin' it a couple seats away from me

-guy telling me in gruesome detail how his cellmate in prison chopped up a guy, then following me off the bus because "he wanted to grab coffee with me"

-crazy racist old lady yelling at a young Mexican guy for being rude when he literally did nothing but sit there

-homeless man lecturing me about his life story and how he was dropped on the head as a child, then asking me out. I'm 19, he was definitely in his 60s at least. Pretty creepy.

-An old man coming up to me, grabbing my (face) cheeks, and telling me I was adorable

-an obviously mentally ill woman ranting to herself about how meth is the third member of the holy trinity and how it is the path to salvation, so Obama needs to legalize meth so we can all go to heaven. METH. This is the same lady who was making a call to someone a week later telling them how she was making $300 a month from the government because she was pregnant.

-guy got mad because I wouldn't give him my number

-people eat on transit and don't clean up their crumbs and trash. ever.

-children touch EVERYTHING

-you know those things you push/pull to tell the driver you are approaching the stop you want to get off at? Yea, those don't get cleaned. Ever. EVER. Soooo grimy.

-sick people EVERYWHERE

<TEXT> From an athiest who went to Catholic school for about 5 years and read the bible because I was so bored of religion class lectures (what's the teacher going to do, get mad you're reading the bible when he's talking about some parable?). It was interesting in that I recognized lots of references from movies and TV and the like, but I also felt like it was trying to lead you towards a super fundie religion rather than the "lax" terms of Catholics. I noticed that everybody pick and chose which parts of the Bible to follow and believe that actually happened. Objectively, it was more interesting than religion class lecture, but I probably never would have finished it on my own as it's not really an "entertainment" book. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nah, I'm actually mad at anybody. I don't believe in fighting a pointless argument with an internet stranger who will not believe anything I say, anyway. No use wasting emotions! I do truly want to help you understand though, even if you don't agree it's useful to know what the "opposing side" believes.

And egalitarianism and feminism are very closely linked. In fact, all egalitarians are feminists, but (unfortunately) not all feminists are egalitarians. Egalitarians believe in equality for EVERYONE, race, gender, age, etc. Feminism is a subset of that which focuses on gender in particular. I am an "egalitarian" in theory, but I am also a feminist. I choose to describe myself as a feminist first and foremost because it is a word that most people recognize to mean "supporter of gender equality". However, I am for ALL equality, and so are the vast majority of feminists. 

If you call yourself an Egalitarian, then you are feminist. There's no way around it!

Feminism is an issue that is near and dear to my heart, so that is what I identify as and have had the most need for in my daily life. But you can identify with MANY philosophies, not just feminism. So don't hate on feminism!

<TEXT> I learned that my parents are people too. They lashed out at me quite a bit when I was growing up, but now I can take a step back and realize that raising a kid is difficult, and even though they ROYALLY fucked up with lots of it, I can see why they put me lower down the priority list. 

When your doctor tells you "no more stress it will literally kill you" after you spent months and many surgeries in the hospital, you REALLY stick to that even if it means letting go of being a fair parent. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was a little girl, I believed in God, prayed to him every night, the whole shebang.

Then, I got sent to an extremely wealthy Catholic school. My dad got sick and almost died, nobody cared. I was super depressed, nobody cared. My father started using me as an emotional punching bag and I came to school in tears almost every day, nobody cared. I didn't talk for a month, and nobody cared. I was bullied by the kids there, but (you guessed it) nobody cared. 

The daily prayers went on. Food drives kept going. Fundraisers for the needy kept happening. The preacher preached service, and the teachers taught goodness.  But, I soon realized that everybody did it to be impressive and look good to others (and God), but nobody ever did it out of the goodness of their hearts. 


Everybody would preach about how important it is to care for those who are less fortunate, but nobody ever practiced it, not even the adults. I learned that the people who taught me to believe in God only really cared about causes that "looked" good, like doing fundraisers. The kids who bullied me got showered in praise for helping serve the community, and were told that God was proud of them. The kids who's parents donated the most money to the church were always looked upon favorably, while I, the at poverty-level kid in my school, didn't matter.

As you can imagine, this experience really upset me. I developed the notion that, if there is a God, he isn't looking after me. So why should I bother to think about him, much less worship him? Could it be that he doesn't even exist? 

And I keep that feeling to this day.

<TEXT> If we replaced the artificial womb thing with surrogate mothers being paid for by the government, then it's actually totally medically plausible. 

And I would still be pro-choice, as I do not believe that we need more children in the foster care system. In my opinion, it's kinder to not let the unwanted children gain awareness of their bleak life than it is to put them through the horror that is our awful overcrowded foster care/adoption system. 

If we could guarantee a safe and loving home for each child, with all of the basic amenities, as well as a risk-free fetus removal for the biological mother, then I would be pro-life in this scenario. But that is just a pipe dream in our current world. :(  </TEXT>

On the other hand, I can barely tell my right from my left and can't drive just yet due to that fact. I also spent a solid hour trying to open a novice level lock in Skyrim. So....that makes me LESS smart.

<TEXT> Honestly, I don't really care. Every single generation has some sort of bad stigma to it. 

And let's be honest, EVERY generation calls the previous lazy and entitled. Maybe because, gee, that generation is literally going through adolescence and young adulthood- all big periods of growth and discovery? Personalities may not be as mature and adult-y in our age group, but that's probably because we are younger than the other generations and are still developing our values, goals, and really experiencing life in a world that is getting harder and harder to thrive in. 

Also, just so you know, Millennials have a wider age range than your title, [it actually lasts up to being born in 2004](http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/03/here-is-when-each-generation-begins-and-ends-according-to-facts/359589/)

<TEXT> When I've had crushes that I know aren't that great of potential partners, I start to train my brain to think of all the bad things rather than the fuzzy feelings. And trust me, there are bad things. Is his tongue kind of fuzzy and could use a good brushing? Are his ears filled with wax? Are his nails caked in yuck? Is he kind of a dick to one specific coworker? Does he leave the toilet at work smelling like horrible bowel movements after he uses it? Does he hold any unsavory political opinions? Does he not know how to dress well? Does he have really huge pores on his nose? Any zits? 

Every time you see him or interact with him, try and focus on all the unpleasant parts. These unpleasant parts will slowly start to make him more human and less perfect, and soon that shiny, bright, fuzzy lovey-dovey spinny aura that your brain surrounded him with will fade away and you'll see him for the regular old Joe he really is. Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Soooo what I'm hearing is that your boyfriend would rather do ANYTHING but give you his attention for ONE DAY. Why are you even with him? He talks shit about you to his videogame friends, and he probably talks shit about you more than that if his friends laughed and went with it. He honestly just seems like a miserable person to be around. 

He promised to make an effort to make this day special, and made it really more of a way for him to do stuff like venting and hanging with his other friends. From this, you really just don't seem like a priority to him. Plus that gold-digger implication would have made me walk RIGHT OUT of the restaurant, that's a pretty rude thing to say during your girlfriend's BIRTHDAY DINNER. Like ouch. He honestly put no effort after promising he would, and completely denies that his sad attempt counts as "low effort". 

Frankly, if he needs that much "venting time", let him vent to his video game pals and not you. He can go to a therapist or whatever, but his venting has gone past okay levels and if he can't keep it contained, then he shouldn't expect sympathy from you if he won't do the same for you. Next time he vents, just walk away. Seriously, just walk away. He probably won't care anyway, or will just go and complain to someone else's ear. 

Plus, you realize he completely lied to your face? He never got you a present. He isn't really required to, but social norms dictate that you normally get your significant other some kind of token. It can be a dinner, it can be a card, flowers, a "happy birthday" text message, jewelry, really anything. He didn't even do that. :(

He seems like a really shitty boyfriend and I have no idea how you put up with him. Congrats on the job offer!!! He's probably just jealous, don't let the haters bring you down. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Damn, that guy has some huge balls. Big, giant, wrinkly, balls that are somehow completely full of shit.

 And you are absolutely NOT paranoid or starting drama, like holy snapples your boyfriend literally wants you to okay him cheating on you with the girl. And it's likely that your friend had no idea about the little "friendship" your boyfriend and the gf had, and your boyfriend wanted to keep it that way so he could fuck her without ruining his friendship. Hence, his tantrum. And yes, it was a tantrum. He is acting like a child who is breaking rules but is upset that you caught him breaking them and told his parents. That is EXACTLY what it reminds me of. Your boyfriend and your friend's gf sound like really shitty people. 

I think you should tell your friend that your boyfriend has a crush on his gf. He deserves to know that his friend wants to cheat on YOU with HIS girlfriend. Plus, that way he can keep an eye on his gf to make sure she doesn't cheat or hang out with your bf. Really, those two shouldn't be friends as your bf wants to bang her. Sorry for being crass, but after reading your story I think deep in your heart you know it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Snooping isn't an OK behavior and you really shouldn't do it without probable cause, but what's done is done!

You have two choices. One is to bury it inside and let the knowledge of what you found eat you alive, and the other is to actually ask him.

Bring up his inappropriate visitations with his coworkers. First off, define "inappropriate". In a relationship people are allowed to have friends, and meeting up twice a month to hang out with people isn't super crazy. I hang out with guy friends one on one occasionally and I would never cheat on my boyfriend, I just enjoy their company as friends. Of course, I'm not the one in your shoes so I don't really know the specifics of what the girls you mention are like, but I think it is certainly worth contemplating that he has friends that he doesn't really tell you about because he *knows* you'll get upset. You snooped because you felt like it, so I don't really know how possessive you are normally, but if you do a behavior like this then it is likely that you have done other behaviors in the past to make him trust you less with knowing about his social life. But then again, internet stranger here, so I can't really judge you on one post as I don't know you. And frankly, I feel like my next paragraph is more likely.

On the other hand, if he is really turning to that particular woman when you fight, that isn't really something you want happening. If she is already out of bounds for being his friend because she is too flirty, why is being his emotional support OK? It's walking a fine line between emotional cheating, ESPECIALLY if you and your boyfriend have talked about how you are uncomfortable with her flirting. You are in a country where you don't speak the language, so you are very easy to manipulate or hide things from. It is VERY easy to take advantage of an immigrant as you may not understand all the nuances of language, particularly flirty written word. You should DEFINITELY force him to tell you about if he went or she went. And if he is willing to chat with her so, why not make him call her in front of you and mention that time they hang out? Make him ask her what her favorite part was. If he actually went out and was innocent in all but lying to you about it, then he will probably jump on this chance. If he is guilty, he will totally make up excuses why not to call/message her in front of you. Or, he could send her a warning text, delete it, and then have you read the "fake" messages.


You probably don't want to hear this, but a 24 year old guy dating an 18 year old girl is pretty off-putting. It really makes me wonder how somebody who could have been out of a 4-yr college for two whole years could date a senior in high school. Normally when guys do that, it's because no girls their age will put up with their shit. And frankly, this guy of yours is pulling some crap that the vast majority of women won't ever put up with. He may try and turn it on you for snooping, but if you found something suspicious then he is the one who committed the bigger sin in the relationship. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Please don't pursue him! He already has a relationship with someone else, and if he wants to try and make it work with *both* of you then frankly he's a scummy person and not worthy of that idolization you are giving him.

I know it hurts, and I know it sucks, but he already has a relationship with another woman. Even if he complains to you about it sometimes, that is not an excuse to go after him. He is currently with *her* and not *you*. **He made that decision and is currently making it every day they are together.**

I also notice that you say " **we** have a connection unlike anything **we** have ever felt before". Stop right there. I mean seriously, just stop that thought in it's tracks. This may be harsh, but he does **not** feel like that unless he has *explicitly* stated that to you. And if he has, then he is a crappy person for emotionally cheating on his current girl with you. Trust me, if he'll do it to her when they are going through a rough time, he will do it to you too. You can't speak for him though your current rose-tinted goggles. 

Your feelings are valid as they are *your* feelings, but it is important to remember that sometimes our feelings can go a bit ham for people that aren't really attainable. I very much so doubt that this is a "soul mate". A coworker who already is in a relationship who may or may not be emotionally cheating on his current girlfriend/wife with you is one of those people who you should **intensely** ignore/avoid feelings for. Make an effort to not be as emotionally close to him, as I seriously doubt he as emotionally close to you as you think, or if he is, then he is kind of a loser. Sorry, but that's what cheaters are. Losers. Do you really want to be with one? </TEXT>

<TEXT> You haven't shown any pictures of your skin or given a good description of your skin type, so us internet strangers can't really make a specific recommendation for you as there is just such a wide variety of products out there!

If you are super into the no-makeup makeup look and that's really important to you, a sheerer concealer like [Garnier SkinActive Anti-Dark Circle Roller](http://www.ulta.com/skinactive-clearly-brighter-anti-dark-circle-eye-roller?productId=xlsImpprod2450073) one may be a good choice for you, although I don't know what skin tone you are so it may be too light/dark.

Probably your best bet would be going to a makeup counter and getting shade matched. If possible, find a sales associate who looks like he/she has perfect but still natural looking skin, as those people often are wearing some sneaky concealer themselves! When prompted for what you are looking for, ask for something that is light-medium coverage, as most people won't notice that. Also ask them for details on how they apply it, so that way you can learn how to get the same results yourself! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I haven't tried those particular products before, but I have both the Ubame Mascara and the Sunshine Oil Skin Tint and I really like them! 

I got the Ubame mascara in one of Sephora's Lash Sampler kits, and ended up using the certificate to pick that as my full size. It's easy to use and lasts a long time on my eyelashes, and is gentle on my lashes and doesn't smudge. I wouldn't say that the mascara is the "best ever" or anything, but for how easy it is to remove with makeup remover and how little it smudges when I wear it I really enjoy it. It's a very nice deep black and makes me lashes look FANTASTIC.

Their Sunshine Skin Tint is a HUGE favorite of mine. If you have very very oily skin for sure it's blah, but if you are going for the natural look, you can just set it with a clear powder and it will last and look great a long time. I have combination skin with an oily t-zone and this is one of the few foundations I've tried that doesn't break me out or crease throughout the day.

I haven't tried the eye vinyl, but I heard it's crap. I have to say, those sets that they sell at Sephora for like $30 are a total ripoff. 

From the reviews I've read on the lip markers, they have nice colors and decent pay off but it can take a little bit of effort to make them apply nicely.  </TEXT>

Also, face oil added into your current foundation may help smooth it out and give you a glow, plus actively moisturize your face through the day a little bit.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My fave foundation right now isn't really a "foundation" but rather a skin tint/BB of sorts. Milk Sunshine Skin Tint is my absolute skin obsession right now! It's a very light-feeling product that I can use my hands to rub in, lasts all day ( I don't use a setting spray!), and takes care of redness really well. It is very forgiving with dry patches and has a very skin-like finish. I have an oily t-zone as well so I set with SkinFood's Peach Sake Powder and that keeps me looking natural and nice rather than super oily. I prefer to wear no-makeup or light-makeup looks most of the time, and this product really helps with keeping the skin part of the look natural but still improved.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Reformatted:**

 Hi y'all. I'll dive right in. 6 months or so ago I became friends with Jessica (name changed). I was a regular at the art studio she managed and when I applied for an opening there and got the job, we became fast friends. I've worked there ever since and we often work long shifts alone together. We get along very well and it's always fun; we listen to music, we paint, we have a groovy time always. I consider her to be very close to me now and she feels the same.

 A month or so ago, I moved into the unit next door to Jessica when my lease was up so now we're neighbors as well as coworkers and friends. Our place is a bit of a hippie commune. My house shares a wall with one of her walls, and we tend the communal garden together too. But moving on, here's what happened tonight:
 Jessica and I worked from 12-6. Her car is broken down, so we left work together and headed to a local venue to see some live music before heading home. We ended up drinking a little too much there, stopped at a local brewery after the show, and got even more drunk. At this point we had met up with some guys we know, one of which was in the band playing earlier.

 I think it's important to mention that I'm in a long distance, committed relationship and will be moving almost across country to be with my boyfriend early next year. However, Jessica is the opposite. She plays the field on tinder, sleeps around, and was definitely working her magic at the brewery tonight. At one point I went off in a corner to text my boyfriend while I watched Jessica alternative between a few men who I knew she'd be choosing from when deciding who to bring home. 

 Here's where shit hits the fan. Jessica, two men, and I, start a game of corn-hole. The next thing I know, I'm falling violently to the ground completely out of nowhere. Jessica had pushed me straight to the ground, completely out of nowhere. One second she was happy and tipsy, the next moment she was competing for blood and decided to shove me into the ground and I have no idea why. My phone screen is shattered, my knees are bloody, and my hands are skinned from catching myself. After she pushed me, I walked out and got to my car and left. What do, Reddit? How do I handle this sort of thing in a relatively new friendship? Should I at least get her to pay for my phone screen? Should I just accept that she was drunk and thought I somehow was fucking up her ability to get laid?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The first things I think of when I hear unexplained chin acne is hormones and allergies.

One idea may be birth control, but you are already on that. I'd keep doing what you're doing with the birth control, you should likely see skin improvement in another month or so!

With Thanksgiving recently (assuming you're American), did you eat any food you may not normally eat? Do you usually not eat meat, eggs,mashed potatoes (they have milk a lot of the time!), cranberries, anything at all? Oftentimes introducing allergens sometimes causes skin issues around the mouth, as if it touches you there it can irritate the skin. Since you cut out dairy it may not be that, but you can be allergic to other, more random, food you may not know about. Cutting things out one at a time is a good way of checking!

Just a side note, with skincare oftentimes simplicity is best. My first thought when I looked at your skin routine is that you are cleansing and exfoliating A LOT. I think you may do better if you don't use the Lush scrub more than twice a week and only wash your face once a day at night with any sort of soapy cleaning product. The AHA is a pretty high %, so maybe cut that down to a couple times a week as well, at least around the mouth. With acne, having irritated and dried out skin can sometimes be almost as zit-causing as having super oily skin! Birth control can sometimes dry out skin a bit, so leaving a little bit of natural or replacement moisture may calm the skin down, allowing there to be less redness and irritation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think this lipstick doesn't necessarily look *bad* on you, but rather just the makeup you have going just doesn't jive that well with it. From this picture, I think that the eyeshadow may be a bit to matchy-matchy with the lipstick and you may see some improvement when using a lighter, maybe shimmery eye look with this lipstick. I'm thinking pinks and golds primarily.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think with your lighter hair and overall makeup style, you don't need to go as "power brow" as you are right now. I think your color is spot-on though! 

It may be a good idea to stick with some lighter defining of the outer 2/3 of your eyebrow with an angled brush, but try not to go outside of your natural eyebrow hair line. Then, you can use a tinted brow mascara like [the NYX one](http://www.ulta.com/tinted-brow-mascara?productId=xlsImpprod11861069) all throughout to make your eyebrows look a bit fluffier and to help the ELF powder you use blend in. Ideally, this technique would tone down the boldness and sharpness of the brow makeup you are using in this pic, while maintaining the definition and shape that you seem to be going for in this picture.

You are one of the few people I've seen who can do a "natural" highlight and contour: it shows up *ever so faintly* in your picture, but enough to know that it is there and it's good it's faint, as in real life the highlight/contour tends to be more noticeable.

I think this particular lipstick is a good match for you, as the shade makes your eyes pop for sure! 

Your lashes are also to die for! They look fantastic: very healthy and long.

TLDR; Your look is overall very cohesive and well done! The only part of this makeup look that could use some polishing is the brows, which I think you may benefit from trying out a different technique to emphasize them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You know how pets can get flea dips and they turn out okay? Turns out, chickens can too -  you just have to make it yourself. When it comes to mites, lice, and all sorts of nasties, [permethrin](https://www.amazon.com/Durvet-Pemethrin-10-8-oz/dp/B007TA5QNA/ref=sr_1_4?s=pet-supplies ie=UTF8 qid=1480480181 sr=1-4 keywords=permethrin+livestock) straight-up wrecks them. Normally on forums I've always seen people mentioning permethrin powder, but liquid stuff works REALLY well, especially as you can make it so the dip is a bit more concentrated than normal. Not too concentrated though, as that can be dangerous! 

Wear gloves+goggles (seriously, do it) and dilute the permethrin to what the instructions say in a fairly large plastic tub or box, whatever could fit an angry chicken. Make sure that there is enough in there so that the liquid dip reaches up to the bottom of the chicken, but make sure the liquid level is not so high as a chicken could potentially drown or injure him/herself.

Then, after you set it up, it's time to dip your first chicken. Plop the confused bird in there and gently massage it's scaley-leg infested legs a bit. Then, lift him/her up and apply vaseline. This serves two purposes: it locks the permethrin in so it doesn't come off AND it helps suffocate the mites. Make sure to give the chicken a nice long foot/leg massage that includes lots and lots of gloopy vaseline. Seriously, if you think you added enough, add a bit more. 

After this, the chicken will likely be confused as to why it got a sudden and probably unwanted spa service, but it's for the best! Just let her run around, she might stand still for a bit before doing this though she probably has never been dipped and massaged before- no worries, it's normal.

Repeat this for every chicken, and maybe do it again in ten or so days, just to make sure no mites escaped your wrath. You should see clear, mite-less legs in no time. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have had this **EXACT** problem before!!!

Once upon a time, I had a beautiful standard size white silkie named Princess Dodo. She was named that for two reasons: one is that she was too lazy to walk up the ramp to the coop and needed to be tucked in sometimes, and the other is that, on the rare times she did, *SHE SLEPT UNDER THE OTHER CHICKENS AND GOT POOPED ON.* 

It was annoying and awful and EXACTLY what yours is doing. So, we ended up building a little "umbrella" made of wood in the corner where she slept most nights. Problem solved right? WRONG. She then somehow hopped on top of it and continued getting pooped on. No roosting ever for her :(

Moral of the story is, silkies are stupid. They are the dumbest of chickens in my experience but are worth it because they are so sweet (usually) and cute. No silkie I have ever met ever roosted, in fact, I have a coop specifically dedicated to my silkies and they like to sleep in one big cuddle puddle. It's cute and adorable, but when the silkie is integrated with the big chickens, can be very annoying.

TLDR; She's probs sleeping in one spot, build a little wooden "umbrella" over her sleeping spot. She may/may not sleep under it, but lets hope!

**ALSO** just a note, if your silkie is that much smaller than the rest, it may be better for her live in a second smaller coop/run area than the other chickens with another silkie, as they are small and weird so therefore very prone to getting picked on easily. While most silkies are either sweet or timid, big chickens tend to be assholes. I actually have a group of 3 silkies and 2 sizzle (all bantams, all teeny tiny ladies) living in their own smaller coop/run area because my laying hens would straight up maul them if they got the chance. Plus, the softer skulls and less vision makes them more prone to deadly pecking-order related issues, so it's better to play it safe.

<TEXT> Five weeks is definitely pretty young to be putting them out into the cold like that. If it was the summer it would be okay, but if it's that cold in the environment you have a high chance of many of them not making it. 

I totally get the space issue though. If possible, and if you keep your house pretty warm (and the birds aren't silkies, they SUCK at maintaining body temps), you could always just put them in a big cardboard or plastic box and keep them inside, no light needed. I think they would be old enough for that. Plus, if the walls of the box are tall enough, you can keep the chicken dust and mess down to an okay extent. The nice part about keeping them inside is that you can always just put them in more than one box, since you don't need to worry about heat lamps! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Water, water, and more water. If you think you had enough, have some more! Since you do yoga you probably sweat and work out all those muscles pretty well, but an after work out a swing or two of that precious agua might not be enough to keep your lip skin in tip-top shape. I had a similar problem when I was into taekwondo with my lips: you need a LOT of extra water to replace what you lost or used up.  Drink water throughout the day consistently to help hydrate and plump up your lips from the inside. This will prevent that pesky peeling.

To fix the peeling you do have, try slathering some lip balm (or oil in your case) on your lips and gently brush your lips with your tooth brush. Then add some lip balm or oil to your newly exfoliated lips. I think a slightly oilier all- natural lip balm, like the ones Haus of Gloi or Epically Epic make, might be easier to travel with than a little tube of oil. Aquaphor for lips applied overnight is also a godsend for peeling-prone lips! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love your brows! They look natural, yet well-defined. I think the blush is a good match for your skintone, and you did a great job making the foundation and concealer blend in with your natural skin. The lipstick has a crisp, clean line, but it's not overly crisp and too fake. The lipstick also jives well with the hair and blush!

 I really have no real CC to offer, you did a fantastic job on this look. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Milk Sunshine Skin Tint! If you build it up, it can *almost* get to medium coverage. Almost. But not bad for something that's not a real foundation! It's decent at covering up redness but not necessarily ALL the coloration, but it makes your skin look FANTASTIC. Overpriced IMO, but at least it works really well? Ask about getting a sample if you can next time you visit sephora! </TEXT>

<TEXT> All throughout middle school and high school I wore heavy black liner under my eyes. I had this one Lacome liner that I used for it that I got in a Duty Free airport place, and I kept it going for years and years. The worst part about it is that it would smudge throughout the day and I would go about looking like a very odd-looking half raccoon. On special occasions, I'd even line the top lid *gasp!* But, alas, I didn't realize my hooded eyes didn't look so hot with that look. I'd use powder to tame the oily teenage skin, which actually worked decently but not well enough!

It was eyeliner, mascara, and slightly-too pale face powder along with frizzy super-fine supposedly straight hair. Not my best of looks. Later in high school, I think Junior year, contouring became a trend and um lets just say I looked very obviously like I had a shit-ton of bronzer under my cheeks. Thankfully I outgrew this phase by the time senior pictures came around!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Milk Makeup Sunshine Skin Tint is my favorite foundation, and I have really sensitive skin with acne just like you! It's a light-medium (if that) coverage, but even though it lets some of the acne show through it REALLY decreases the intensity of it. It leaves a natural "skin" finish, has no preservatives (so it has a cool rollerball thing going for sanitary reasons), and at least with the light-yellow shade decreases the amount of red that peeks through due to active breakouts, as seen in my personal experiences and the sephora customer reviews. My skin hates foundation and most BB creams, but this beautiful tinted liquid is heavenly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Advent calendars are always a hit! If you can, you can order one or two "sampler kits" from Sephora, as Sephora is the more "luxurious" and "grown up" store and they have some exclusive brands. Then, you can get some random drugstore stuff or candy or foil samples to keep the cost of the actual thing down. You can either make your own out of cardboard if you're crafty, or repurpose one of those chocolate ones  (and you get chocolate out of this option, nom!). 

Is there a certain kind of product your daughter is really into? Like, is she really into eyeshadows, blushes, highlighters? It's better to splurge for quality (like one $50 eye shadow palette) than quantity (a bunch of blah things that look cute but won't work well). I feel like if she's really into youtube she's hella into the hype of certain products, so maybe bring up a conversation and ask what her absolute favorite makeup trend is right now, or maybe ask outright what kind of makeup she adores. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We can prove that something causes something else by experiments!

 In the "correlation doesn't equal causation" thing, what's actually happening is that you are just *observing* different statistics and comparing them to each other. You can see that ice cream sales go up as murder rates go up, but does buying ice cream cause murders? No, but something else might.

This leads into experiments. Experiment are when you **can** sort of prove that one thing causes another. (We don't really use the word "prove", but rather "supports" in relation to the hypothesis we are guessing, but that's a complicated topic and idk if it would fit into this eli5). 

So, you think that something might be causing ice cream sales and murder rates to go up at the same time. But what can it be? To set up an experiment, you need an independent variable, or a variable that you manipulate. Then, you need a dependent variable, or a value you are going to observe that you think will change. In this case, let's pretend we have a hunch that the heat is causing both murder rates and ice cream sales to rise. In most experiments, you will have two (or more) groups, where the independent variable will be different but you try your best to keep *everything* else the same. 

So, in the case of the ice cream and the murders, the independent variable will be temperature, as that is what we will be changing and the dependent variables will be murder rates and ice cream sales, as we think those will change with the temp change and we are going to be watching that. 

Ideally, what we would do is get a huge bunch of people and set up an ice cream stand and keep an eye out for murders. (let's just pretend ethics don't actually apply). First, what you would do is seperate the one big group into three roughly equal smaller groups. One of these groups will be where the temperature is low, another where the temperature is normal, and yet another where the temperature is very hot. From this, we can expect to find that in hot weather, both ice cream sales and murder rates rise. **BUT** in the other two groups, they are much lower. So, we would plug our data into some stats equation (there are a lot of them and vary on the experiment, fairly complicated stuff) and see how confident we are that the heat is causing both ice cream sales to go up *and* murder rates as well!

From running this experiment many times and seeing the outcome, we can get a sense that when the temperature is changed, other things change too! And that's how why know we "prove" how something causes something else. </TEXT>

<TEXT> From your experience, here is what I think is happening. (According to Sexuality Now 5th Edition by Janell Carroll and my human sexuality class, that's the sources on the comment I made origionally to OPs post too)

When you kegel past the point of no return, you DO actually have semen all made and ready to go, it's just kept inside of you. When the actual sperm get out of your testicles, they have to meet up with the fluids that come out of the prostate and the seminal vesticle to create the semen. So, when you orgasm when holding back the actual "expulsion" phase, you still get an orgasm! I think what's happening is that you are "tricking" your brain and body into thinking you are orgasming, but you stop it before it actually leaves your body. But like the top comment said, nobody REALLY knows what's going on up in the brain.

So, you experience the orgasm when your body and brain are "ready to go", so to speak, but since you can stop it you are left with semen that is just hangin' out, all ready to go for another round.

In short, you are manually stopping the "explusion" phase with the kegeling while getting the orgasm, and since you have semen all ready to go in there you can go again for another round. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The first step to show is having the birds for it! Purchase breeding stock from breeders, not hatcheries. You may have to do a bit of digging, and may even need to drive a decent distance or get straight-run chicks shipped. Be warned, this phase is expensive as you'll want to get some from various established breeders who breed for show standards and those birds are never cheap. *tear* :(

You can then either show these birds (as long as you give the original breeder the breeding bragging rights, of course! lol ) or breed them and then show their offspring. 

Depending on what breed you have, there are often "clubs" you can find online (like the American Silkie Bantam Club) that have the ideal requirements for the birds, appearance-wise. That's probably what you should look for and/or breed for when getting birds.

Finding the shows involves some googling! Lots of state fairs and county fairs have chicken shows, you just need to sign up in advance. They may or may not have the category you want to compete in, so it's always good to check! Also, if you end up sticking with just showing your birds and not actually breeding them, you may want to send the original breeder a message and a picture of the grown-up bird and any awards they win, they always love that!

Good luck!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh, I thought it did, whoops! Maybe this will help. Pretty much what is happening is that your brain knows what's happening as the contractions happen and interprets it as the "point of no return". Technically, the "point of no return" IS part of the orgasm phase, just the part that involves all the ejaculate being prepared inside of you. The actual ejaculation actually happens a few seconds after.

<TEXT> The male orgasm actually has two stages: emission and expulsion. In emission, there are contractions in the vas deferens, seminal vesicles, and the prostate gland. This is felt to be the point of no return.  After that stage you have the expulsion, which is when the semen actually comes out of you!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have had this EXACT issue. My body likes to drown me in sweat so i religiously use degree's clinical strength deodorant and refuse to change it and I use Nip+Fab Glycolic Acid overnight skin perfector on my armpits when they get itchy. My theory as to why it helps is that the glycolic acid "eats" away at the dead skin, and the bacteria that causes the itchiness now have nowhere to go and die off. Pretty much the same thing happens when glycolic acid gets used on the face to acne bacteria, so why would your pits be any different? Glycolic acid containing wipes have helped as well to, those come in many different probably equally as effective brands! </TEXT>

<TEXT> This may sound weird, but christmas lights. There are a lot of christmas lights out there that have timers that you can set for a couple hours of light only. If you string them around the coop they should provide enough light for the ladies to want to hang out outside.

 Just so you know, I've done the supplemental lighting thing before and once you turn off the lights, the chickens get stranded outside as they can't see in the dark well enough to get back into the coop so you may need to go outside and put them into the coop manually. Also, the lights I've used are plugged into outlets so that doesn't quite get your battery-powered requirement, but an extension cord could probably do the trick. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Today I'm trying out a solid of **Darling Clandestine Step Right Up**. It's supposed to smell like *a clean, oceanic, very unisex fragrance with notes of vanilla and tea and wood and spice.* On my skin it smells very cozy and reminds me a lot of the smell that is around the candle altars at the church my family goes to. It reminds me of a cozier version of a faint and mild men's cologne. It's a really hard scent to describe, but I really like it! I definitely feel like it is a bit medicinal on first application, but that really quickly fades into a warm, breezy unisex scent. It's a really nice and mild innoffensive fragrance that I don't mind wearing to class as nobody can smell it unless they get super duper close to me.

Today is my second day back in school after my brutal wisdom teeth surgery, so having something nice and comforting on me makes me feel a lot better.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Holy crap woman, If my boyfriend said that to me I would probably leave him without a second thought. "I think you probably should be". Like, I just can't get over that. That was a VERY horrible thing to say to a woman who is recovering from a painful MEDICAL procedure. An IUD insertion is a medical procedure. Just because it's for safe sex doesn't mean it doesn't sucks to get, requires a doctor, runs the risk of complications, and needs a recovery period.

I want you to know that nobody is EVER entitled to do sexual things with their partner if they don't want to. He's trying to use guilt against you. He literally tried to guilt you into a handjob. Not cool. Not cool at all. You have every right to be pissed off. 

I'm really hoping that he just stuck his foot into his mouth and he should apologize, as I find it hard to believe there is a guy out there who is genuinely that sexually selfish. You are 100% justified in feeling resentful. You JUST got a pokey metal thing inserted into your uterus, I think you saying no to anything that resembles sex or physical effort is perfectly justified! Not an "oh I couldn't help myself so soft and warm blah blah" but an "I'm sorry I was way out of line". He should show that he is genuinely sorry that he made that selfish statement. I think that a direct apology is probably the best bet, as that way he has to speak his mistake out loud and say what was wrong about it, rather than just realizing he screwed up and feeling bad, but expecting you'll forgive him by receiving a hug anyway.  </TEXT>

Call your sister out in public, and yes, in front of her friends. Your sister at this age does not value your mother or you as equals, but her friends are likely her world. Don't hug her. Don't be nice. Be stern. Call her out on her lies! And if her friends don't believe you, provide proof. Screenshot any messages you can! Call her out on texts. Your sister is banking on you sitting there and taking it, but you should not have to.
If your sister continues, I'd save screenshots of the conversations you have had with her and back them up. I feel like one of these days, she's going to get bored of insulting and lying to you to your face and soon is going to start telling more people these lies, and they will believe her over you.

<TEXT> I'd be furious. It's not about the "better purchase", it's about the lying. He took money that, as I understand it, belonged to BOTH of you and already was allocated, and spent it on something else.  

I'd be pretty pissed if I was in your shoes. And also, who gets into an argument with their son and buys a car??? Like, isn't that rewarding him for arguing???? That makes no sense. Call up his ex-wife and ask exactly why she needed five grand from him, because I feel like the ex wife pushed him to do it. If not, then hopefully since your husband isn't telling the full truth maybe she will. Paying money doesn't make up for not being in the son's life or anything like that. Could it be a kind of child support, or something your husband promised to buy for his son long ago that he forgot about until now? I feel like this may have been something promised to his son already and your husband forgot and was just too chicken to admit to you. 

I think that the way he is treating you right now is the symptom of a bigger problem with not valuing your opinion at all when it comes to finances. You are a partner, and should therefore have equal control over the finances as he does. My best suggestion would be to make him go to couple's counseling. If he thinks it's okay to lie to a woman pregnant with twins about where their joint money is going, then what else does he think is okay? </TEXT>

I feel like your goal here is to change him or mold him into someone that suits you better, which shouldn't be the goal of a relationship.

Honestly, you guys just don't seem super compatible anymore. People change after high school, and that's why a lot of "high school sweetheart" relationships fail: both people just shift into people that don't quite click as well as they used to. And this change may not be good for the relationship, but it's good to the people it happens to.

<TEXT> Part of growing up is learning that you don't share the same values as your parents. Unfortunately for you, you can't really give him a "moral lesson" as he'd just scoff and ignore you. I'm sorry but it's the truth. He's an adult and obviously no longer values what you think of him. You are not the morality police. His cousin did not make your son this way, your son learned to act this way through many many role models so stop blaming him and accept your son as this "degenerate".

To be honest, where he's at is fairly normal for a 19 year old who is paying low rent and making good money, plus surrounded by family who let him get away with it for so long. You really have two options, treat him as your son or like a roommate. Right now, you want him to act like the perfect son AND be a good roommate by paying rent. That's not gonna happen: you can only pick one or the other. And at this point, since you want him to pay rent, you can really only treat him as a roommate.

However, I think you can set up some ground rules. No cocaine or hard drugs in the house I think is a pretty big one! If you want to teach him a lesson, call the cops on him next time he is doing cocaine. He is an adult and can do whatever questionable choices he wants, but even acting as a parent OR a roommate it is reasonable to not want illegal contraband in the house. If he wants to go somewhere else, fine. Also, you can't really control the girls he brings home. Having sex in his room isn't something you can really punish a roommate for. I think something you may look into is drafting a lease, as that way you can have set roommate courtesy rules, such as noise rules, etc. He can go out and live his party life, just not in the house that he is subleasing from you now.

If you don't mind me asking, why don't you get a job? 300-400 USD a month is pretty low rent, even at federal minimum wage. If you pick up a job and pay that part of the rent, you'd be able to kick your son out and not have to deal with his lifestyle. Hell, even if you are on disability it may cover this. You may also want to look into downsizing to a smaller apt for just you and your husband, as if your son can afford to go out and party that much he can afford to find his own place to rent.

At this point, your son is out living his own life. You've had 19 years to parent him to not get to this point, but it's too late. The most you can do is be there when he crashes and burns out from this high-paced lifestyle.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Is it possible for you to adopt the dog? That way, you can take care of the dog and you both can be happy! He doesn't have to see the dog or do anything with her if he doesn't want to.

I think it's really sad that he isn't able to take care of it, but what's stopping you from taking over? This dog can become YOUR pet now, as you obviously love her more than your boyfriend does. And since he won't be caring for it, he shouldn't have a problem with having her around. 

Just because your boyfriend has a mental illness does NOT mean that you have to be a pushover. Like you said, you offer him compromise after compromise, but this is YOUR happiness and mental health on the line. He is an adult and it is his responsibility to manage his mental health. I am really feeling caregiver vibes from you, and it seems like you let him call all of the shots in the relationship because you are very sensitive to his emotions and needs. I feel like since this dog is an issue close to your heart, it's time to put your foot down. He may have mental illnesses, but it is NOT your responsibility to wait to his whims hand and foot ALL of the time. I have lived with mentally ill people and I know that while it seriously sucks that they are ill and that they deserve a bit of extra help, they are still human and can often get used to us bending over backwards to help on request and forget the sacrifices that we make for their happiness. It's human nature, not a comment on your boyfriend. Sometimes it's important to remind those that you take care of that you are a person with her OWN needs too. 

Even though you are not the most "damaged" person in the relationship, you still deserve to have your needs put first once in a while. And if this dog is that important to you, then make it clear you are putting her first.

Do NOT feel bitter for resenting his illness. DO NOT. Just as he is allowed to feel freely and be listened to, you deserve the same courtesy. Talk to a therapist of your own, seriously. They will be able to offer you much better relationship and dog-keeping advice than us internet people can. Your boyfriend has the benefit of having someone to lean on in times of trouble, but from what I can tell, he is your main support network and in this case he can't really offer lots of support. A therapist, on the other hand, is trained to be the best support network you can get. 

Good luck! I really hope that you end up keeping the dog. I'm one of those people who really values having an amazing pet and I couldn't imagine having to give mine up. I hope everything goes well and your boyfriend gets a change of heart. :)

<TEXT> Some people are naturally just super friendly and touchy, and that can give off the wrong impression that they are being flirty. The best way of knowing if she is into you is by asking her directly, and since she already said she wasn't interested I would take her word for that. From your description, I think she likes your company and likes you as a person, but would prefer to stay friends with you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> People tend to date those who run in about the same social/academic circles. If you want a girl who is super into physics or math, why not get into physics and math yourself and see what it's all about? You can mingle with lots of very intelligent girls in those classes! Admittedly, there's a lot of guys in those classes, but if you legit go asking to the girls in the class for help rather than trying to "mansplain" concepts you may or may not understand to them unprovoked, like lots of guys try to do, you'll stick out in a positive light with the girls! Seriously, most of them would be THRILLED that you asked for help! It is a way of saying that you find them intelligent and value them, which you obviously do as you made this post.

<TEXT> Some relationships are meant to last forever, and some aren't. And this is one of those that isn't going to last forever, I'm sorry to say. You guys are each other's "first" real relationship, but the thing with firsts is that there can be many more, and better ones! You both deserve someone who will keep you truly happy, and if you aren't happy than this "relationship" isn't a partnership of love, but of obligation. I would break up with her. :( Breakups suck, but it is better than being miserable and stuck. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, a relationship counselor sounds like your best bet here. There are lots that work on a sliding scale! If you are to continue on in a healthier relationship, then HE needs to learn to change his mindset, not you. From his actions, it's pretty clear that he doesn't respect you so I don't think that he's going to make an effort to change his "flirty nature" once you stop being outwardly mad at him. He already has it set in his mind that whatever you say doesn't matter, and he's shown this clearly with his actions. He didn't realize he had an emotional affair until the internet told him so. He didn't realize you were actually mad until you didn't let him walk all over you. I'm guessing that there are more examples of this kind of behavior in your relationship that just never had the chance to make it into this post.

If you get one thing from my post, I want you to realize that he does not value you the same way you value him. He treats you like shit, walks all over you, and blames you for his emotional affair. If this was your friend with this story, you'd tell her to get out of the relationship, right? He isn't treating you like any decent boyfriend would, and frankly, you're too young to settle for a guy who doesn't respect you as a person.

Luckily, people have the ability to change. I think that having a second "neutral" party, like a relationship counselor, telling your boyfriend that he isn't doing a good job at being a boyfriend and telling him exactly WHAT skills he needs to improve on might help your boyfriend out a lot. He won't listen to you, he probably won't listen to this reddit post if he knew about it, so why not take him to someone he WILL listen to? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Whatever you do I wouldn't go with the meatbird blend of feed, as broiler chickens aren't like "normal" chickens, they are this crazy fast-growing types of chickens that aren't expected to live long anyway, so it's made not really with the bird's health in mind but how to maximize productivity of muscle and size. Layer ration alone would still be better than a meatbird/layer mix, and fairly cheap as well! 

And if you don't mind me asking, what do you do with the eggs then? A good way to help them get back some protein without buying extra stuff is to just feed the eggs back to them! It might save you a few bucks in supplements and treats? </TEXT>

<TEXT> First off, make a deep and sincere promise to yourself that you will do no more popping! It may be tempting, but don't do it! 

Two things that have really helped me reduce scarring is moisturizing and sunscreen. Moisturizing would be especially important for you as you are a swimmer! My absolute favorite moisturizer for my skin is [Nip+Fab Dragon's Blood Plumping Serum](http://www.ulta.com/dragons-blood-fix-plumping-serum?productId=xlsImpprod11731383), but it might not be heavy enough for you alone. Try a face oil, like Seaberry/Sea Buckthorn oil (my absolute fave, don't hear it talked about a lot though) or jojoba oil. There are a LOT of different oils out there, and if you go to Sephora and ask they will make you little sample baggies of the oils you want to try out for free! Face oil sounds a bit scary to use as a moisturizer, but it actually really helps your skin out by making it produce less of the oils that trap the gunky bacteria that forms acne, plus it helps keep it nice and soft!

Sunscreen is also super important. Yes, I know, it's almost winter and the sun is almost gone but hear me out! You know that acne cream you're using? It makes your skin extra sensitive to sunlight. Plus, as a swimmer, I'm willing to bet that plenty of light reflects off of the pool and gets on your face. Sunlight makes it so that your acne scars fade slower on their own, and combined with your meds and your sport it makes it so that your scars will fade extra slow by themselves! Your skin needs a bit of help, and that's what sunscreen is for. It will block out the rays of light that will mess with your healing process, so it will help your scarring heal quicker. </TEXT>

However, I'd like to add that a translucent powder pat on in the morning would help control the shine throughout the day and help it from being so intense.

<TEXT> I'd stick with feeding the layer ration or feather fixer as their primary food source, but with the addition of lots of extra "treats" like scratch and wet catfood for the extra protein. If you have a reptile supply shop near you, you might also be able to get some live kingworms, which are FULL of protein and good fats. If live bugs aren't an option, dried mealworms work great as well!

 It's best to stick with one brand/type of food as the main food source as the nutrients there are already balanced out in the ratio that the birds need. However, since it's getting colder, there's no harm in helping the birds develop a layer of fat and get them some extra feather-growing proteins.


I think the most important issue here would be to fix the roosting issue immediately, as unless it's fixed they'd just rip the new growth off. Also, for the ladies with the bare backs, [chicken saddles](https://www.etsy.com/listing/210242140/brown-cream-protective-poultry-hen?ref=market) might help keep the damage to a minimum. Also, if there is any blood, your local feed store probably carries blue-tinted [wound dressing](https://www.amazon.com/Farnam-Blue-Lotion-Dressing-Antiseptic/dp/B000HHQ2R6) like this one! The blue tint would make the raw featherless butt area less appealing to peck at. </TEXT>

Another oil you can try is seaberry/ sea buckthorn oil! Its probably one of the only oils that I really like using on my face as a moisturizer. Fresh makes a good one but it's pretty pricey, but you might be able to find it if you live near a european ethnic market for a lot cheaper, as it's a common "healing" oil in Russian and Siberian communities. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Do you by any chance pick and squeeze out the pores on your nose? If so, stop right now! That's likely what's causing the redness and irritation. Those are sebaceous filaments and squeezing them out causes more harm than good. When I was picking at my annoying nose dots they just got red, inflamed, and infected by acne bacteria. Once I stopped and picked up a skincare routine, they went away pretty quick!

There are lots of things you can try to stop your nose from getting the sebaceous filaments and redness on your nose! There are lots of different methods and not all will suit your skintype, so it's a bit of a trial and error. Check out the sidebar for a jumping off point. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Follow what your derm tells you!!!! Like seriously, most of us people on here are more skincare well-read than your average person, but NOTHING compares to the many intensive years your derm spent learning how to do her job. Whatever she gives you she is giving you because she strongly believes it has the best chance of working out for you.

That said, and are you washing your face with a gentle cleanser? You should probably wash your face like once a day, probably at night. And The Mesoestetic Resurfacing peel booster is just glycolic acid and salicylic acid. The product seems pretty expensive for what it is, I'm sure there are other products with the same active ingredients for much less. For the glycolic acid 10% I use Nip+Fab's [glycolic fix overnight purifying gel](http://www.ulta.com/glycolic-fix-overnight-purifying-gel?productId=xlsImpprod12681125) and the salicylic acid the stridex in the red box should do the trick, but you said you've tried it but not much happened. If you use it in combination with the Nip+Fab you may see better results however. Use the Stridex first, and the Nip+Fab after. </TEXT>

If I were in your shoes, I would tell her that you really liked to spent time with her but aren't looking for anything serious or a relationship. I don't think you can avoid hurting her feelings completely at this point, but you should definitely be honest. 

Since you guys haven't actually had the "relationship exclusivity" talk I'm assuming, you kinda have an opening. I'd bring up that talk and make it clear that you like her, but you aren't looking for a relationship at this stage in your life. That way, it's more of a sneaky "its not you its me" kinda thing so it doesn't make her feel bad about herself. Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's probably them! Some people have great luck in choosing good partners, and others, like you, aren't that fortunate.

How did you meet these girls? Through a friend? Did you guys all hang out in the same crowd? A lot of times during the teen years people never really get a true opportunity to find people who work with them, as they are all stuck in the same school or town. The nice part about growing up is that your options are widening! It seems to me that the girls you dated just seem like shitty people and never treated you with respect, it could likely be an unofficial "culture" at the school or social group they belonged to. Try branching out! 

Are you in college? Tinder gets laughed at a lot, but seriously, lots of girls are on there in college towns. I'd stay away from OKcupid and PlentyOfFish due to the fact that I don't think people in your age group use it. And dude, I looked at your pictures and there is honestly nothing wrong with you, certainly not enough to deserve the self-loathing you are showing. Do you play a sport? Sports are a great way to get buddies, and those buddies often have girls they could introduce you to! Take an art class, take some fun community college classes, pick up a hobby: girls who you might be interested in might be going there!

Finally, my best suggestion would be to talk to a therapist. It sounds stupid and overused, but talking to a therapist is a GREAT way to develop some healthy self-esteem. Confidence is one of the very top things girls look for, and when you get more of that you are likely to attract girls who will value you as a person a lot more than the lowlife girls you used to attract apparently. Women aren't necessarily always attracted to the most good looking guys, there are a lot of things that play into the equation so even if you think you don't look good as the guy sitting next to you, women may see other qualities in you that they value more!

You DO deserve someone and there IS someone out there for you, you just have to go out and find her. Don't let the past bring you down, you are young and you have so many opportunities to find someone! The hardest part is to go out and do it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh god, PLEASE don't blame yourself for this loser of a guy not being able to keep his dick in his pants. HE destroyed the marriage, not you. You were drunk and he had sex with you, that's pretty manipulative. And after that one time, you dropped him like a hot potato. And since he apparently has "a habit of doing this to women new in the hobby group", you aren't the first indiscretion he has had and certainly he didn't plan it to be his last. He is a serial cheater who manipulated you into drunk sex. Ew.

He is a serial cheater. That is NOT your fault. Yes, the wife is pissed at you, but wouldn't you be pissed beyond reason if your husband turned out to be a disgusting scummy cheater too? You have a bit of blame in flirting and leading him on, but you aren't the married person that slept with a drunk woman who had impaired judgement, the vast majority of the blame for this is on his cheating ass. If you knew he was married and had a nasty habit of sleeping with single women new to the group, would you have slept with him while sober? No. Judging from this at least I think you wouldn't.

Own up to it, but make it clear you blame HIM for being a cheater. If people ask tell them that yes, you slept with him. You were really drunk and did not know about his tendency to sleep with other women. You blocked him on media shortly after and felt horrible that you slept with a married man while drunk, but he won't leave you alone and is sending you weird messages.

If you can, send a message with screenshots of the messages he's sent you to the wife. If she sees how you never responded and how into it he was, then maybe she will stop seeing you as the one who tempted the husband out of his monogamy and rather as the victim of his shittiness, like you are. And the self harm messages would rattle me too holy shit that guy is fucked up, that's just straight up manipulative.

Do you know of any other of the "new to the hobby group" girls he has slept with? Would it be possible to reach out to them and have them tell the wife that he slept with them too? That way she won't be focused on the "one girl who stole her husband" and will hopefully get it into her head that her husband is a serial cheater.

And again, PLEASE don't blame yourself. You aren't the married person who cheated with a drunk and new to the social group girl. You aren't the one who is sending someone who blocked you a shitton of creepy messages. You aren't the serial cheater. HE destroyed his own marriage. Don't be afraid to tell people that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maybe wait a week and ask him out again? Give him some time to try and glaze over the awkwardness of the situation. Confront the awkwardness directly in the text, kinda like "hey I'm so sorry about being so awkward last time, but I had a lot of fun getting to know you. Wanna try for another coffee date?"

If he says no, then don't push it. There is a BIG difference between not wanting to give up and being pushy and rude. This wouldn't be "giving up" this would be he simply didn't like you. And you can't force someone to like you, it just doesn't work! The whole point of dates is to see if you are compatible, and if he decides you're not the girl for him it's best not to go overboard in pushing for another chance, as that's a great way to make someone run away! 

Also, is it possible that he would be more interested in a "friends with benefits" situation and not the actual relationship thing? The day you met he DID try and bring you home but that didn't work out, and the one date that he doesn't want to repeat you guys didn't do the deed either.  That's kinda the main thing that jumps out to me, as the time he was the most receptive was the one time he almost got laid.

<TEXT> I don't think asking for space is a bad thing; in fact, I think it's a really good sign that you recognize that it is something that you need to work through things! I think your boyfriend's response is a bit selfish, but that's after reading how you wrote out the intensity of your need for it. It could very well be that your boyfriend doesn't realize how much you NEED it?

I would sit down and talk to him, but at a time where nobody is stressed out or fighting or anything. Tell him that you REALLY need your space sometimes, and it's not that you don't love him or don't trust him to help you bear the burden, it's that space is just something you need. If he really loves you and cares for you, he should understand that your needs do not equal his needs and will hopefully start to respect the space you need.

If you guys want a compromise, here is an idea. Before you go into your "safe space" state of being, leave your boyfriend a note saying "hey, something came up @ madeupplace with madeupperson, I'm really upset and I need X hour(s) of time alone in my room to stew on it. I'll talk to you then, K? Love you " That way, he has a bit of warning that you are upset about something and a bit of information on what it's on, as well as a timeframe that he can wait out and talk to you after. That way, he really has no reason to be angry or upset because he got warning and hopefully reassurance that you're not upset at him over something.

If he is still angry at you for needing any space at all, then no offense, but you are dating a guy who is selfish and doesn't care for your needs, only his. I don't really see why he is angry with you, as that's a bit confusing. Just because YOU are upset doesn't mean HE should get upset, that's just weird. Empathizing and sympathizing I totally get, but being upset at you for being upset? That's pretty crappy. 

I really hope that this is one big emotional communication misunderstanding! I wish you the best in figuring out what it is, cause I'm honestly a bit confused if your bf is just clueless as to how important space is to you or simply cold hearted and uncaring. But maybe you can figure it out. :)

<TEXT> I think that you are justified in breaking up. If you want to go out and have new experiences, sometimes it's best to do it without a partner and focus on yourself. You've been with him for a very long time and he may have been an important part of your life then, but things change. PEOPLE change. You've changed. 

Take it from someone who's been in a long distance relationship in college for almost two years: it's really truly not for everyone. It's HARD, makes you feel lonely, and you do miss out on the quintessential "college days" most of the time, and if you don't think he's going to be the one you will spend the rest of your life with, then there is really no point in dragging it out. Go out and have adventures! Explore life, with no bounds! LDRs take up a surprising amount of time, so now you will have the extra free time to go join a club or make some new friends, or even go ham into studying if that's what you are really into.

Try not to worry too much about his feelings. Yea, he'll be upset. It's a breakup after all. But it's not your responsibility to be the only provider of happiness to a person, he is young and will recover, and after a bit of healing time will find someone new. You are setting him free to find someone who will love him and be with him more than you can at this point in time. I promise you, you both will feel sad during and after the breakup, sadder than you've been for a long time probably, but time will heal you both and you can go on and live your lives for the better. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay first off, STOP watching those youtube videos. I know exactly the kind of ones you are talking about and they don't work.They try and give you a "psychological insight" into the way girls work and pretty much all of it is bull. You seem to be really trying to psychoanalyze every single interaction, which is probably making it worse.

My advice? Chill. There is no such thing as the "friend zone". There really isn't. If she just wants to keep you around as a friend, please respect that. If she is showing interest in you, then go with the flow. You are wayyyy overthinking things and when you freak out about every little interaction not going how you like it, you are just worrying yourself more and more over something you can't really fix or control.

If she isn't into you, she isn't into you. Don't try and force it as you'll only alienate her and get yourself branded as a creep. </TEXT>

I'm really sorry about your friend turning on you like that. :( It really hurts when someone who we think was a rock and pillar turns on us. Now that you are making it big, she is really jealous and is lashing out, which is not something a good friend would do.

I think that by trying to sue you, she shouldn't have your friendship anymore. She is lying and trying to extort you for money, which NO friend should ever do. She built you up, but I don't think she ever really wanted you to be successful, as she feels she "deserves" the success more than you. Which is, frankly, not true. YOU wrote the book and YOU published it, the words that made it came from YOUR brain. YOU made this accomplishment and now she is trying to take it from you. Would a true friend do that? No. No they would not.

Does she have any mental health issues of her own? If this kind of vindictive behavior is new to her it may be worth urging her to speak to a psychologist. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dealbreakers are perfectly okay things to have. I'm with you on the pets one, I NEED a pet in my life. I just do, no ifs, ands, or buts. HOWEVER, your boyfriend is also just as in the right with not wanting to have an animal. I think it's pretty crappy that he's being an ass about it (like seriously, those are some manipulative comments), but he is also allowed to not want to deal with having an animal.

On this sub, lots of people say the whole kids or no kids issue is a dealbreaker. If you can't agree, it's time to move on. I think pets fall under this category as well. There isn't really any possible compromise, you can't have "half of a pet", you get one or you don't. 

Personally, I think a pet would be nicer to you than your boyfriend is being now. In times of stress people show their true colors, and your boyfriend is showing that he will throw manipulative insults to get at what he wants. If I were you, I would seriously consider leaving him. Guys like that don't stay in your life very long because they just get nastier and their "once in a while" insult outbursts become more and more common, but pets? They'll be by your side as forever loyal companions. Think of how dissapointed your childhood self would be if she could see you staying with a guy who gives you shit for wanting a pet, one who even actively insults you for it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeaaaa you way overdid it. That many complements is weird and creepy, I'd probably do the same thing she did if I were in her shoes. 

The thing with a lot of us girls is that we don't necessarily WANT complements all the time. We have been socialized to know that a lot of the time when a guy is commenting on our appearance a bunch, he wants something more. And frankly, most of us just aren't that into dude constantly commenting on our appearance that much. It just feels weird and uncomfortable, like someone is hitting on you but since it's in the virtual world, you can't physically run away. So, she did the virtual equivalent, which is blocking you.

And while you may have had the best of intentions, it doesn't mean that other guys always do. Check out /r/creepyPMs! Most women get that experience sometime in their lives and when you leave a lot of messages, it kinda scares them into thinking you might be *one of those*. If you try and backpedal now, you'll probably freak her out even more because the damage is done. You have gotten the "creepy" label in her mind and if you try hard to erase it by trying to make it up to her in any sort of way, it still doesn't cancel out the fact that you got super into her and straight up left your virtual sexydrool all over her pictures in public. Coming from a woman, please don't try and fix this because you can't un-creepy creepy behavior.

In short, things come off differently in person than they do online. What you may think sounded like a joke or flirting came out to sound creepy (even to me, and I'm an internet stranger) and like you were overtly hitting on her. And this overly hitting on her public media, her "image", is a huge social no-no.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Do you have any hobbies, or want to start one? Maybe you've always thought that climbing rock walls are cool, or maybe archery is more your thing. Or maybe you want to improve your art skills and take a painting class! There are lots of fun things to try out and start, everyone started somewhere! Going to the gym, going to a club, going on hiking adventures with a group, going to really anywhere where you have a structured activity but some socialization as well will help distract you. You don't know what you're missing until you try it! Meetup.com is really good for finding in-person events that you could be interested in!

Before you look for someone else to give your heart to, hold on to it yourself for a while. Really spend some time on yourself and doing what YOU want. Enjoy being single for a bit, you have all the time in the world to find a better match for you.

<TEXT> After you get the worm problem under control (all of these commenters have some great suggestions), to build up weight once more for the upcoming winter try feeding more "snacks" like scratch and fancy-ish cat food, as well as possibly wetting down a bowl of their typical chicken food to make it more appealing to eat. That should help them hurry along to normal weight! Plus, the cat food has a lot of protein and will help your molting girls grow back feathers nicely! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Holy shit woman. I don't think you should be in any sort of relationship at all and really need to take some time to really look deeply into yourself! And please, please talk to a therapist, they will be able to help you manage your emotions much better than the people on the internet can.

You are stalking a TEENAGER. Let me repeat that. You, a grown adult, are stalking a teenager. That's pretty creepy and weird and you should really snap out of it. He's not "the one that got away" he is "the one that **ran** away"! And rightfully so! 

It's also kinda weird that you switched between a teenager and a middle aged man all of the sudden, and I think that shows a lot about how you aren't dating people for who they are, but rather just to have someone. Seriously, take a break from relationships for a while. Find a productive hobby, discover a dream job, do anything that helps you get in touch with yourself and NOT focus on other guys. He's just not into you, and you need to accept that and leave him alone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He has a girlfriend and is humoring your "chemistry", so no, it's not worth it. If he is willing to cheat on his girlfriend, what makes you think that he won't do it to you? A kiss every night is still cheating. If you REALLY want him for yourself, tell his girlfriend. I'm sure she'd leave him immediately, leaving his scummy ass all for you to have.

Personally, if I was in your shoes, I would not give it any time and do my best to distance myself from him. He's playing both you AND his girlfriend. And, if you have any morals at all, tell his girlfriend. He knows exactly what he is doing playing both of you. He gets to have sex and stability with his girlfriend, and you, the mistress, are there for just "kisses" and probably more "in time". He is a cheater and no girl deserves to be with a guy who is that bad of a person.

<TEXT> I was dealing with a pretty nasty outbreak of poultry lice at the time I was dealing with scaly leg, so I gave all of the birds flea dips using permethrin for a double whammy. I know this stuff works well on human mites (scabies) so it was likely pretty effective at killing the scaly leg mites as well. It killed all the lice after a few consecutive uses though! Wear gloves and a mask if you do this as this stuff can be pretty nasty. None of my chickens had any negative reactions to it because I diluted it a bit extra just in case it would irritate their skin.

I treated everyone's legs with vaseline for the scaly leg almost immediately after the flea dip. One person holds a chicken while the other massaged a very liberal amount of the vaseline onto their legs. Don't be shy, too much won't hurt them! Goop it on. They won't like it, but too bad. Make sure to get everyone's legs so that the mites have no new host to jump onto! This gooping serves a dual purpose. It suffocates the mites, AND it helps keep the permethrin in contact with them longer which kills them as well.


Finally, I cleaned out all of the old bedding and replaced it with fresh bedding, as well as added in a bit of diatamaceous earth and Sevin. New research has come out showing that Sevin powder can actually increase the risk of lung cancer in poultry, so keep that in mind if they are your pets. 

When doing these things be sure to wear a mask, gloves, and even eye protection! Harsh chemicals are the easiest way to kill mites, but they aren't exactly great for your health especially when you need to treat an entire flock.

<TEXT> I cannot stress enough how important it is that you quarantine her first! [Here](http://www.the-chicken-chick.com/2012/12/quarantine-of-backyard-chickens-why-and.html) is a fantastic link on how to go about doing the quarantine. 


If she shows signs of disease, it would be best to cull her as most chicken diseases are deadly and aren't like the basic colds we have, their diseases can really ravage a flock quickly. 


If she seems fine after a month or two, do what /u/Goodbye11035Karma suggested with a buddy. That will make sure that whatever the bird has isn't dormant in her and will have a chance to act out if it's one of those sneaky diseases. Plus, it will make it way easier to [mix](https://poultrykeeper.com/general-chickens/introducing-new-chickens/) her into the flock, as chickens have a tight pecking order and it will take a bit of effort to make sure she and her bud will be able to settle in okay.

Edit: Also, is it just me or in that picture of her head is there a bit of yellow discharge coming out of her nose? I can't quite tell due to the blur. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I usually ask the neighbor's kids if they could let them out/close them in when we leave, as well as make sure they have food and water. We have left the chickens in their care for two weeks one time, but when we got back the water was very very low and the run door was not closed so we don't really do that anymore. Now what happens now is that I take care of them while my parents go off on vacation, and I go on vacation with my boyfriend at a different time. 

I personally would never leave my chickens unattended for more than the time it lasts between dawn and sundown because I have silkies who are very very stupid and don't always go into the coop on their own, so the raccoons that hang out in our trees sometimes might get at them. Our run is pretty decent, but not completely predator proof. Our coop however is, so closing them in manually works best for us. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Frizelle Enos in Sebastapol** might be be able to take them off of your hands! You could ask the person who takes them to make an effort not to sell them to anyone that will fight roosters. There is no guarantees! You'd have to call and see if there is room however, the cages get filled up pretty fast. I ended up giving up a beautiful almost show quality splash silkie cockerel with a moderate case of crossbeak and the guy who worked there was really sympathetic and let me post his breeder/health/feeding history so only somebody who really cared would adopt him. He was adopted within a day! He was my special needs baby and I was visibly upset that I had to give him up (damn suburban neighbors wouldn't want to deal with any possible crowing) so the guy really tried to make me feel better about the whole thing and assured me that he would not be eaten. He was a silkie and pretty tame, so nobody would fight him, just eat him though.

I've given up a rooster to **Rivertown Feed and Country Store in Petaluma**! You'll have to call and ask if there is room however, and sometimes the people you get on the phone can be kinda rude. However, the rooster I ended up giving up was a very very very friendly little guy and the person who sold him made sure to sell him to a home that would keep him as a pet, and not eat him or anything, or else he would have adopted the little guy himself. He actually walked around the store carrying the roo, the guy just cared that much :) I was really happy with their customer service as well in person, just the people who pick up the phone can be snippy.

If you don't really care if you get cuts or anything from the birds, **Bud's Meats in Penngrove** will process them into sausages. They won't do anything else with the birds however, so no cuts or anything like that. Just sausage. </TEXT>

I gotta agree with you on the stupid bird part though.

I love them to death though, they put up with so much affection and attention from me 3 Best birds ever!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> She looks like a silkie mix or an ayam cemani mix, as other's have pointed out. 

How many toes does she have? If she has an extra toe then I'd lean towards silkie. Silkies usually have black/dark purple skin, blue earlobes, and an extra toe. They are also pretty small in stature, and this trait tends to get passed on to silkie mixes as well. I had a little black silkie barnyard mix who looked a lot like this girl except for the lack of copper around the neck.

The black gene in the ayam cemani is a very dominant trait, so it is less likely that she is a mix of that. It's certainly possible, as her face kinda looks like an ayam cemani face. But who knows, genetics can be weird!  </TEXT>

Edit: Thank you guys for your kind words! The scariest part was when I got the needle for the anesthesia in my arm, I cried a bit on that one. The entire experience of being put under was so weird, I remember waking up a couple of times and trying to talk and they did not seem happy and asked me to stop talking. It was like my vision was this weird vortexy thing where I was bouncing around from my consciousness to brown colored blankness. I woke up to try and talk while they were pulling the teeth out, that was fun. I am now on the good droogs and my face hurts, but less so. Chimpmunk cheeks for dayzzzzzzz though. The first few hours after the surgery were the worst, but now I am much more conscious. I'm pretty happy I have an excuse not to do homework or lab write ups today, I've been swamped but now I have an excuse to not do shit. Rick and Morty Marathon time!

Cetearyl alcohol can actually [be found in](https://www.google.com/patents/CA2020877C?cl=en) tretoinin cream, so it's unlikely that your tretinion cream is reacting with the cetearyl alcohol in the Cerave, as there is a bunch in the formula most likely anyways.

<TEXT> I'd use the Metrogel cream that your doctor gave you, and see if you get any improvements in the next two months or so! Metronidazole is a pretty tough antibiotic and is actually used for many various things, such as bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis, diverculititis, and of course, acne! 

It sounds like, from your description, you are experiencing closed comedones, subset of acne. They are little skin-colored bumps, most often found along the hairline in my experience. I can't tell you what they are for sure though, I'd need a picture. 

I wouldn't try and self-diagnose yourself with a fungus, if your doctor saw it and prescribed you the Metrogel he/she probably believes it to be closed comedones, and years and years of med school definitely trumps what you can find and self-diagnose yourself with on the first few pages of google. Fungal infections on skin are super super superrrr rare and it's pretty unlikely that you have it, its much more likely that what you have is just some acne. So don't fret, and trust the doc! :) Hope the Metrogel takes care of things for you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm glad the irritation is going away! As long as your skin is happy, it shouldn't matter what products you use or in what order - things work a bit differently on everybody's skin!

On a side note, does your moisturizer contain alcohol in it? If there is, the alcohol in it can react with the tretinoin on your skin and make side effects like irritation worse than if you used tretinoin alone. 

Also, looks like you're doing the correct thing with not using a moisturizer immediately after the tretinoin. According to the [FDA description](https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/fda/fdaDrugXsl.cfm?setid=357ed7c9-6ffa-45b8-94be-4d440f5a1c22), you're apparently not supposed to use any skincare products after one hour of applying tretinoin. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Product name:**  Haus of Gloi Lip Balm

**Price (range):**  $3.50 USD

**Country:**  United States, but I think they may ship internationally

**Special info:**  From their website- *Our popular lip balm begins with virgin coconut oil, smooth shea butter and includes nourishing pomegranate seed oil which provides a plush lip feel, along with antioxidants and a host of other benefits for the lips.*

**Experience   opinion:**  This product has a very oily consistency, but in a good way. I noticed that when I use this lip balm during the day I get less lip flakes, due to my lips legit being moisturized. It's vegan, smells and tastes great, comes in different flavors, and sits well under lipsticks. Also, this lip balm works well for overnight use too, as you can layer it on thick fairly easily! It's an indie product, so purchasing this supports a small business. </TEXT>

I went on it for a while for my acne. It helped make my acne go away, but it caused some stomach upset so it really wasn't the treatment for me, but for you it may work well! I noticed especially that it worked really well with red and irritated areas on my skin. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nip+Fab Dragon Blood Plumping Serum is great for this! It plumped my skin up in one use to actually make my pores look a lot smaller. Plus, it works fantastically as a moisturizer. I think the active ingredient is hyaluronic acid, which is good for keeping your skin moisturized.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I may or may not be obsessed with Ole Henriksen's Sheer Transformation Cream. If you're looking for something a bit heavier, Fresh's Rose Face Lotion is the bomb diggitiy! It's heavy enough to count as a night moisturizer on my oily skin, but not so heavy that I break out and get extra gross. I know some people may not like the brand too much, but it worked for me so oh well!

Boscia's Warming Black Charcoal Face Cleanser also is my jammmm. The bottle lasts a surprisingly long time with daily use as well.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> One of the active ingredients in epiduo is adapalene, which is a retinoid. [Here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2699641/) is a really good study talking a bit about retinoids and skin aging. It's reallyyyyy long but the existence of this study pretty much proves that retinoids are good for anti-aging. Also, this study states that diluting the retinol would have less potential side effects so what your doctor is doing is supported by current studies! You're getting the benefits of having the retinol but minimizing your chances of having issues that can come from too much of it.

Also, you may want to keep using it for longer! Anti-aging things don't cause noticeable changes in only a week, it will take a lot longer for that for you to notice it's anti-aging benefits. Especially as it is diluted!

With epiduo don't forge to use sunscreen! The benzoyl peroxide in it will make your face extra prone to sunburn. I wish you the best and hope your anti-aging routine works out for ya. :) </TEXT>

It's reminiscent of that excitement that I get when, in the summer, my family and I drive up to Mount Shasta and drive pretty far up, far enough up that there is snow piles to bounce around in. I always think of my overjoyed dog seeing snow for the first time, trying to eat it, and then running and jumping in the piles. And then afterward we get back down the mountain and it's boiling outside once more. It's a little taste of winter, but surrounded by the energy and bright-eyed and bushy-tailedness that can only be found in the sunny dog days of summer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I definitely think that you shouldn't wait to break up with him for his sake, you need to leave for your own mental well-being. If you are miserable, then there is no point in sticking around!

From your description of him he seems a bit unstable and prone to emotional outbursts, so, before you break up with him make yourself a game plan. Who is going to live where? Can you leave your lease early, and how? Are any friends able to help you get your stuff out? Do you have a place to go after you break up with him? Make sure that you have a detailed plan in place, so that when you are in a vulnerable state past you would have taken care of any messy details. Trust me, future you will appreciate it!

The actual breaking up itself is fairly simple, albeit emotionally difficult. Sit him down to talk when he isn't stressed or distracted, like after a meal or a "calm" time like that, and tell him straight up it's not working out and that you are leaving him. He may beg, he may plead, he may throw a fit, he may use guilt trips about his mental health- but remember this: **do not set yourself on fire to keep him warm!!!** Then, set that "get-away" plan into motion. 

Breakups suck, there is no way around it, but they are always for the best! I believe in you, good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Peace probably won't ever happen, at least on your mother's end. Some people are just super duper set in their ways. However, you could make her stop acting out in negative ways. First off, have you told her how rude and offensive she is being? If she continues to be rude, set consequences. 

For example, if she doesn't like the fact that your gf is going to a bbq with you? Oh, too bad, you'd rather not make your girlfriend feel unwelcome so neither of you will go. 

With your mother, don't make into a big fight. Don't argue and explain yourself, just have it be the way it is. Make it all up to your mother to behave!

The important thing is that your girlfriend knows you are on her side 100% and do not allow your mother to say things like that to her without a negative response from you.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> They are as stupid as they are cute! Its pretty easy to get them used to people and make them handleable, but you may have to "tuck them in" at night due to them falling asleep outside and being too lazy to go inside. They also don't roost in their coops, and actually sleep in a pile. They can't fly either! With a lot of the show quality ones you definitely have to trim the poof around their eyes so they have some vision, as well as clip their toenails. I really like having them though! They all have adorable personalities and are very easy to handle. Whenever young kids come to my house the silkies are always a big hit!

I think the most annoying thing to me is that i need to keep them seperate from "regular" chickens due to them being extremely prone to being bullied because of bad eyesight, small stature, and poofiness. So i have two seperate coops and runs: one for bantams, one for normal chickens. You should keep that in mind if you're planning on getting regular size chickens too! </TEXT>

BUT THEN...
I let it rest. Well, that might be a bit of an understatement. I threw it aside and didn't touch it for a month or two. 

It did the trick! No longer the perfume is has that gross, cheap candle smell. It actually smells like spiced and fresh apples now! It's a yummy scent that I would happily recommend to anyone wanting an apple scent that is perfect for fall. </TEXT>

I'm thinking that I'll do a beauty and the beast thing instead, I'll keep my fuzzy spirithood and werewolf makeup, and I'll just have my bakbakita where a fake pearl bracelet as a necklace, so she will be "Beauty". 


My friend's skunk costume for her dog is arriving soon, so her pupper will be that skunk from bambi! He's a skunk because he farts so much, lol. I'd dress up my dog and take him about town on halloween, but he's both fearful AND an asshole, not a great combo for a huge german shepherd on halloween. Ironically my chickens are better at not being so "chicken" at costumes!


I also really need to go trim my silkies' and sizzles' nails today which is gonna be an experience for sure!

On a non chicken or pupper related note, I've been CRUNCHED with homework and tests and presentations so I'm hoping to get a bunch done this week! Here's to spending halloween weekend crunching so halloween festivities will be guilt free!

<TEXT> Hang in there! IF you DO have BPD, getting diagnosed and getting treatment has the potential to turn your life around! The therapy that get's prescribed can have the potential to make those things that you do stop happening, if you let it! For instance, Dialectical Therapy really helped a friend of mine who has BPD to manage it and she now is in a happy marriage as well as studying to be a therapist. It's not a cure-all, but it teaches you different ways to see the world and interact with it- a way that is tailored to the very specific way people with BPD think of things! 

There is absolutely NOTHING to lose and EVERYTHING to gain if you bring it up your concerns to a therapist. Hell, I think it's extremely brave of you to even post this, as there is a really large stigma against personality disorders. Asking for help might be the hardest step, but I believe in you! You asked the internet as a whole for help, now all you have to do is ask just one person, who happens to be trained in ways to help you :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> You seem like you have the answer you want to hear in mind, but really, it should be the opposite. I think it is very very VERY weird that you are dating somebody that young. 

You are both in very different stages in life. You have much more power over him due to your age,. He isn't "mature" for his age, he's a normal 16 year old. Newsflash, but just because he's not an annoying ball of stereotypical teenager doesn't make him "special" or "different". Oh, and the fact that you live with his family is weird. Maybe it's not that great of an idea to put strain on your living situation by DATING someone? It's like dating a coworker, but worse. What happens if he decides that there is someone he would be more interested in dating? He'd be trapped. Pretty much every little part of this relationship gives you way more power and control and that is extremely unfair- if you truly loved him you would let him at least finish puberty before getting in a relationship with him.

And is mother knows. Why else would she be treating you like a sexual predator? Maybe you're not as sneaky as you think.

<TEXT> It's not callous at all! You are worried for her, that means you care. Just because she is the one who is technically sick does not mean that whatever she does should have no effect on you. The fact that you feel burnt out and tired means that you CARE, and that's all that is important. 


However, she is an adult- if she doesn't try to deal with her mental health issues then there is a serious problem there. Your sister is getting a lot of the "positive" attention, the "please feel better" kind from your family, but what about the less positive ones? It sounds like a psych ward might actually be a good idea for her. If there is a next time for her threatening suicide or attempting it, CALL 911. Every. Single. Time.

 Don't sign her up for one of those two or three day stints- if there is an opportunity for a two week one, that might be enough time for her to understand the severity or get the help she needs. Sometimes a person needs to hit rock bottom to want to help themselves, a decently long stint in a facility filled with professionals might turn your sister's life around. If her mental health is truly this bad, it might be time for the government to appoint a caregiver for her, as she is a danger to herself and should not be making her own decisions.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don't bother to reason with her mother- some parents favor one kid over the other an unfair amount, it's not fair but it's who she is. If she won't budge, asking more might just irritate her. 

Rather, I'd focus on being a supportive boyfriend to your gf. She's the one who has to live with a crappy mother who puts all of her effort into one child or another. Her mother probably sees her as the child who has her shit together and doesn't truly need help, even if she asks for it.

Mental problems or no, your gf's sister is an adult and is responsible to work towards her own care and not completely lean on her mother. What do you think would happen when she graduates and enters the cut-throat competitive world of art? Come crying to her mommy for more money?

 Also, if your mother continues to heavily favor one child over the other, I'd recommend your girlfriend just never bother to help her mother or do her favors. She is showing that she cares more about one daughter than the other and would rather help her than your gf. Her mother is not obligated to give her financial help, but your gf is not obligated to be a "dutiful daughter" either. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Personally I don't agree with the way you keep your dog to be out of the house and not really be in contact with people, but that's not the real issue here.

The problem is that you believe your boyfriend is lying. You can install cameras in your house if you so choose and catch him in the act, as if he was going to come clean he would have done it by now.

However, there are alternate explanations! Dog hair sticks on clothes, gets blown in by wind, or could have been there but you never noticed until you looked! Maybe the doggo got in the house when your bf wasn't there? Maybe your boyfriend DID end up letting the dog inside, but because it was pouring outside and he was whining at the door and values the dog's happiness over your hair-free floors. Also, German Shepherds are smart- REALLY smart. If he wanted to get into your house because he missed your smell or something he definitely could have!

But again, the only real way to determine is with a camera. From there, if it turns out your boyfriend is lying, it may be time to hire someone who would be okay with housesitting and not allowing your dog to come inside or boarding your dog. 

Just a note, since James lives with you, he should have just as much say over the comings and goings of animals as you do. I think it's pretty telling of the unequal power balance in your relationship and you might want to cut him some slack, I sure as hell wouldn't have the heart to leave your dog outside most of the time and not allowed to spend time inside of the main house. I totally understand that it's upsetting that your bf might be lying to your face, but I also understand why he would too- you seem to control every aspect of how the house "should be" when BOTH of you reside there.  </TEXT>

If I was in your shoes, I would end it, as you are going to keep wanting something he doesn't want to give.

<TEXT> Do you REALLY love him, or are you just not comfortable with the idea of being on your own? You seem to just want him as a fallback when things get hard, and that's not love- that's just using him. 

From this post it really seems like you've fallen out of love and if you do care at all for your SO, it might be time for you to let go of him and let him find someone who will truly love him back.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm thinking of getting some wax tarts, but there are SO MANY choices to choose from that it's getting overwhelming. 


It would be really interesting to know the community's favorite hits and disappointing misses. What did you like about them? What did you not like about them? </TEXT>

<TITLE> EpicallyEpic custom summer scent ideas! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-03-31 22:26:48 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Currently I'm preparing for the warmer months, and I thought it would be fun to make my own custom perfume scent! 

I don't really know what I am doing, and since EpicallyEpic's custom blends have SO MANY CHOICES I figured I'd hit up you ladies and gents and see if you could take a gander and tell me if something will go obviously wrong/wonderfully right. 

**Things I loveeeeeee**: Mints of all kinds, "cooler" florals like lavender, sugary baked goods, realistic fruity smells (particularly cherries or strawberries), smoke, honey, coconut, tea tree



**Things I hate with the power of a thousand burning suns**: too much fruit, too much sugar, melon, canteloupe, super-fake watermelon (real smelling kind is fine though!), lots of incense

**Ocean in the Desert** Lots of cactus flower on a background of ocean, a kick of grapefruit, and a dab of honey for sweetness (I have zero idea what cactus flower smells like but it sounds cool)

**Rolling in the Garden** Prominent notes of Mulberry and Fern with a base of White Tea and Ginger mixed with some Kumquat, with a bit of Tomato Leaf to make it more like an actual garden

**Imaginary Fancy Hand-Cream** Cherry blossom, Lemon Verbena, White Tea and Ginger, Passionfruit-Rose. Like fancy hand cream, but not on my hands.

**I Don't Even Know** Saltwater Taffy and yummy Mulberries play a prominent role on a base of yellow cake, and cactus flower works together with a smidgen of lavender to keep the sweetness within reason

**Downtown in Summer**: Saltwater Taffy, Kumquat, and grapefruit play together on streets as Glazed Doughnuts, Lychee, and Jasmine Tea waft from the shops

I'm planning on an order of one (maybeeee two if I can't make a decision between scents that will smell very different), but I'd like to know if these sound alright! If you guys have experience with Epically Epic's notes or have made your own customs, feel free to share what you got and what you think of them!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> For Christmas I'm planning on getting my boyfriend a custom fragrance from Haus of Gloi. I would love some input on a couple options I've picked out! He doesn't normally wear any kind of scents except for his deodorant, but he said that he likes the idea of a personalized scent for Christmas. He has no idea what to get so I have free reign MWA HA HA!


Smelly Goodness #1:

Top note: Bergamot

Middle notes: Eucalyptus wood and Rain

Base note: Clean musk

With Smelly Goodness #1'm hoping to get a fresh, clean scent. Something noticeable, but not crazy offensive and in-your-face. I don't want this one to be too complex and intend it to be a more of an all occasion scent.


Smelly Goodness #2:
Top note: Black tea (I love drinking it, hopefully I'll like smelling it!)

Middle notes: Coffee and leaf pile

Base note: White oak

I have no idea what I'm expecting with smelly goodness 2, just that it would hopefully all mesh together and smell good. Those notes just seem like they would mesh in a unisex-leaning-masculine way so if he ends up not liking it on him I'll just snatch that one from and make him another custom.


Smelly Goodness #3: 
Top note: Red Mandarin

Middle notes: Eucalyptus wood and chai

Base note: Spanish moss

I noticed that bunches of popular men's perfumes seem to have citrus as one of their main notes, so why not try it out! I also don't know what I'm expecting feeling-wise either. I seem to suck at picking out individual notes in fragrances and how they mesh to create one big tasty scent.

Do my guesses on their ambiance seem accurate? Do these seem like they would smell cool or warm, fresh or spicy? Help me please, I'm clueless!
