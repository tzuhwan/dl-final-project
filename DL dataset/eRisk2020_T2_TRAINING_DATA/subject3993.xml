<TEXT> I'm going to comment from an opposite perspective. I'm a young guy in an engineering technical role, where our performance is heavily determined by

* complex problem solving skills
* people skills
* intuitive technical knowledge
* ability to learn new technologies rapidly 
* ability to manage projects with multiple people and timelines while maintaining a deep understanding of the technical issues

Almost all of these are completely un correlated to age and maybe even experience. I contribute twice the value of some of my colleagues with a decade more "experience".

Why should my compensation be determined by my time in the industry? I would be pissed of one of the older people used knowledge of my salary to justify a raise because they are older than me, despite contributing less.  </TEXT>

Personally, I'm feeling happier, more motivated and fulfilled than I ever have, but there are no options for this, so I have to select the "0: no change" option.

Posts can be questions, but they can also be more like "here's how we are doing it" in case it's helpful for someone else. Even if it is "bragging" it doesn't hurt me. They are already getting some great feedback.

<TEXT> Sort of a side-track from that conversation that I've often found helpful:

I often stress to people that I truly and utterly am doing my absolute best to understand the true nature of reality. If there is a god, I want to know it. That's exactly why I spent so much time researching apologetics when I was a Christian, and now researching the history of religion, evolution, etc. All I want is to honestly understand the universe. If God exists, he should understand that I am doing by **absolute** best to find him. I would hope that counts for something.

This frank honesty usually goes a long way with whoever I am talking to.

 If I delete all my accounts from Mint and reconnect them,

<TEXT> It's about **identity** my friend. For me, It only stuck once I *identified* as someone who doesn't eat sweets. That's my mental image of myself, it's who I am at my core. That's why cold-turkey works so much better for me than just trying to moderate.

I found I couldn't "cut back" on sweets. It didn't work: invariably, someone would leave leftover donuts in the office and I would decide "Today can be a sugar day for me". Next thing you know I ate 3 entire donuts, and I'm doing it again 4 days later.

So I've gone cold turkey on all sweets: I don't eat any cake, brownies, cookies, candy, or soda. My friends know I don't eat sugar. I wrap the "not-eating-sugar" part of my identity up with other ways I see myself: I'm a weight lifter. I'm a cyclist. I don't eat sugar. etc. etc. 

I'm fully comfortable with the fact that I don't plan on eating another cookie for years. That's part of who I am. My distant hunter-gatherer ancestors never ate cookies. Why do I feel like I **need** to eat cookies?

<TEXT> Read [The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck](https://www.amazon.com/Subtle-Art-Not-Giving-Counterintuitive/dp/0062457713).  Then stop giving a fuck. Stop faking anything. Everything you wrote sounds like you are constantly adapting your words and actions based on what you think other people will react best to, but that only makes you seem fake. I admit, it's a vicious cycle, a negative feedback loop. 

Be genuine. Learn to love yourself. But that's not just a switch you can flip, you have to become a loveable person, and you will naturally fall in love with yourself. Be genuinely interested in people: just listen to them. Stop thinking about what you will get out of the conversation, be selfless. 

Another note: There's an opposite **positive feedback** loop that you want to start rolling. Think about it this way: Exercise makes you look better. Exercise makes you feel better. Exercise improves your mood. When your mood is improved, you are more interesting to other people. When you look better, you have more self-confidence. When you have more self-confidence, it comes off attractively to others. You don't crave their attention anymore. When you have more self-confidence, you feel better. When you feel better, you are more motivated to exercise and go to social events. When you go to more social events, it improves your mood. And on and on and on: they all build on each other. You have to jump start the process, force yourself to do one of these things and the others will follow.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Background**

Let's take Measles for example. Measles is caused by the Measles virus. The measles *vaccine* is actually just a mutated version of the measles *virus* with one key factor: It doesn't cause the disease! It's basically a broken version of the virus. The good thing is that your body still produces an immune response to it. Your body makes antibodies that *fit* the measles vaccine, but they also happen to fit the measles *virus. E*ven after the vaccine is long gone, your body still knows how to make these antibodies that will attack and neutralize both the vaccine *and the virus* particles.  


Now, if you are ever exposed to the real measles virus, your body can instantly shut it down: you already have all the anti-bodies to attack it. 

**Answer:** to make the measles vaccine (which remember is just a mutated version of the measles virus), we basically need to make a shit ton of the virus. Viruses work by hijacking your cell's machinery to replicate themselves over and over again, so we basically take advantage of that by growing a whole bunch of cells, in test tubes and even bigger containers, infecting them with a little bit of the virus, and allowing the virus to replicate thousands of times over. The cells we use for some vaccines happen to be chicken embryo cells, because that's the way they did it and got FDA approval decades ago. 

Many newer vaccines use other types of cells. Some even use human cells,  including a line of human lung fibroblasts which were originally obtained from of a 14 week old aborted human fetus in 1966. That's another fact that anti-vaxxers take and blow out of proportion. To be clear: some cells were taken from a human fetus in 1966. Those cells were effectively placed into test tubs where they can duplicate, and we've basically been duplicating them in labs ever since, and have a continuous *line* of cells that trace all the way back to that human.

<TEXT> It's a distortion of real facts, not just made up bullshit. Vaccines are produced or grown inside of living cells. For some vaccines, they use a cell line that originated from a fetus many decades ago (but has since just been propagated in test tubes) A main component of draino is simply sodium hydroxide, and we do use that in the vaccine manufacturing process.  </TEXT>

A big part of this is **identity.** I simply need to *identify* as someone who doesn't eat sweets. That's my mental image of myself, it's who I am at my core. That's why cold-turkey works so much better for me.

So I've gone cold turkey on all sweets: I don't eat any cake, brownies, cookies, candy, or soda.

It's an easy, concrete identity. THAT SAID, I still get sugar in sauces. I'll get wings with an asian spicey sauce which surely has a lot of sugar. I'll still eat some breads that have some added sugar.

So in effect, I've only "cut back" on sugar, not gone entirely sugar free. But by going cold-turkey / absolute abstinence from sweets, I've overcome my inability to moderate my sugar in-take.

The end result is I'm consuming probably 80% less sugar than I used to. </TEXT>

It took me 6 months to work my way through these three thousand-page tomes ([Quicksilver](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/823.Quicksilver), [The Confusion](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/822.The_Confusion), [The System of the World](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/116257.The_System_of_the_World)), but I feel like I've lived a lifetime of experience in that time.

Go into these books by treating them as historical fiction (even if they have elements of other genres). I learned 10x more about the late 1600's by reading these books than all the history classes I've ever taken. Through these books, you will see (or rather *feel)* Europe move from medieval times to modern times. In the course of a few decades, the world is modernizing with respect to currency, finance, politics, and technology. And you watch it all happen in what feels like real time.

But these aren't history textbooks, they are excellent character-driven novels. You get to *experience* all these changes through amazing relate-able characters. Some of these characters are real historical figures. Many, like Isaac Newton, are **main** characters that you get to know on a personal level. In fact, the lines between history and fiction are so blurred that I literally have no clue if some of these people and events actually happened. And that's an awesome feeling.

I think what leaves me so shell-shocked is the level of research that must have occurred in the writing of these books. Tolkien or Martin have painstaking years of worldbuilding, but all they need is consistency, not accuracy. Neal Stephenson gives the same feeling of depth about **the real world.** From obscure political rituals in England, to the genealogies of royalty, to the nuances of shipbuilding you get the feeling of immersion with the added fact that these were real places and real people (even if not real events and conversations). There will be passages where you are bored: geographical descriptions, or long-winded monologues about drama in the court of Louis XIV. You'll hear Isaac Newton and Leibniz argue about free will and determinism. But the long stretches of the journey make the final destination that much richer.

It's like the Count of Monte Cristo mixed with Robin Hood mixed with A Song of Ice and Fire, and throughout the story Gandalf the Grey is lurking in the periphery of the story to subtly encourage the protagonists towards unseen ends. There's swashbuckling piracy and crazy antics that sometimes border on the absurd, yet feel like they belong. There's heart-wrenching romance, adventures in the jungle, and medieval wars.

There are also heavy themes of mathematics, natural sciences, and finance. We get to peer over the shoulders of famous historical figures as they develop telescopes, discover the world of microbiology, explore stock markets and manipulate politicians. We get to feel the rush that it must have been to live in the age when the promise of steam engines and computers could barely be glimpsed on the horizon, when the power of the people was eating away at the power of the absolute Monarch, without knowing what would come next!

Reading these books is a long term investment, but the payoff is worth it!

Now I need to go decompress.

<TEXT> So if you scaled up a hornet to the size of an elephant, would it still be able to fly? 

If it's simply a size scaling, of course it couldn't fly. The wings wouldn't even be able to maintain their structure. Even if you magically allowed them to maintain their structure, there's no way the animal could beat them at the same speed as it's miniature twin. Even if it could beat them at the same speed, they wouldn't generate enough lift. Even if you could magically make the animal beat them fast enough to generate lift, the tips of it's wings would have to travel at the speed of light causing impossible air cavitation and nuclear explosions due to the obscene speed.

Basically there's no end to these type of hypothetical issues. Unfortunately it's a fun but incoherent question.

<TEXT> The null hypothesis is that you should minimize expense ratios, because statistics show that fund managers cannot consistently generate alpha, especially net fees.

So instead of us arguing you away from this plan, you need to put forth a good argument *for* it. From what you have said so far, it seems you don't have any clue what this fund even invests in. The only one I see here is that it's not strongly correlated with the stock market. **Why not?**

Is it because they are invested more in foreign equities? Real estate? novel derivatives? ForEx plays? Bonds? venture capital into startups? US equities with a certain sector tilt?

First you'd have to tell me a really good story about **what** they are investing in. Then you have to explain to me **why.**

And third: selection bias is absolutely rampant in hedge funds and active funds. What if this fund manager created 10 different funds a decade ago, all with different strategies. They had a random distribution of success, and they simply picked the best one, marketed it to you, and scrapped the other 9. This is so common, and it makes me super skeptical of statements like "good returns" and "half the volatility" unless I know a LOT more." </TEXT>

Their whole baseline of what normal people look like is completely out of wack.

<TEXT> Something that might help: Don't try to look for something that is as satisfying as video games. Hate to say it, but there's just about nothing that gives you the same instantaneous pleasure and dopamine hit that gaming does, except drugs. 

Go into this phase of your life *knowing* that you will be bored sometimes. Relish in that boredom, it's improving you over the long run even if in the short term it seems like you are less happy. 

Literally just get up and go for a walk. Yes it feels weird, but here's the thing. When you get back to your house after your random walk, ask yourself this "Do I regret going on that walk?" I guarantee that you will never answer yes. In retrospect, walks always seem like they were great. For some reason, it's just prospectively that we think it's dumb or lame or boring. 

Same thing with lifting weights or other cardio.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My approach is to eat fruit in moderation. I do believe that some fruit is healthy and important, but modern fruit is probably a lot more sugary (and less fibrous) due to artificial selection than the fruit our ancient ancestors ate. So for example, I try not to just sit there and binge on a fuck ton of sliced pineapple or eat 15 medjool dates in a sitting.

Blueberries and blackberries are some of my favorites: high in antioxidants and high in fiber. Plus they are expensive so that adds incentive not to binge :-) </TEXT>

<TEXT> A refinance is simply taking out a new loan to pay off your old loan. There can be lots of different reasons and ways to do this. Here's what I did:

 #x200B;

In 2013 I bought my house with a $200,000 loan for 30 years at 3.75%. By 2016 I had paid this down to $170,000, and I decided I was ready to go down to a 15-year loan, so I *refinanced.* I got a new, $170,000 loan for 15 years at 2.75%, and used that money to pay off the old loan exactly. 

So this was a simple refinance: the new loan was just enough to pay off the old loan, no more no less. If I borrowed say, $190,000 with the new loan, that would be a cash-out refinance because I would end the day with an extra $20,000 in my bank account.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some thoughts that might help you:

Human beings evolved to live in small intimate communities of \~50 people. We went on hunting expeditions where we got extended cardio exercise and bonded strongly with the band of men we went out with, our cousins and brothers and nephews. Women foraged for berries in small cliques carrying babies in a sheet on their chest. We basked in the hot sun, sweated together. In the evenings we cooked together, we gathered water together, we made crafts and built huts and fixed our thatched roofs to stop leaks. We relied heavily on one another, built strong ties of trust and companionship. We gossiped and had feuds, we resolved conflicts and made up.

All of these things have **short term** cause and effect relationships. We can see the success of our roof-patching project: the house is dry. That is amazingly fulfilling and give a dopamine hit. We finally catch our exhausted prey after running for 6 hours, and we have to kill it with a spear. There's a dopamine hit, and an adrenaline hit. The men carry back the carcass and sing war songs of victory as we bring it back to camp.

None of this shit had any grand meaning. None of it matters. But it's happy and fufilling day-to-day: you go to bed with a smile on your face, sore muscles, and peace. That's what life is about.

Research shows that aboriginal tribal societies that live in this manner have basically **zero** incidence of depression and obesity. Sources [1](https://www.madinamerica.com/2014/06/living-age-melancholy-society-becomes-depressed/), [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3330161/), [3](https://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/mental-health-indigenous-peoples-international-overview).

Not exactly sure where I'm going with this, but here are some lessons you could take from my story to see if they help:

1. Exercise. I'm absolutely convinced that exercise is helpful for a million reasons, not only for the short term endorphins when your workout is done, but it builds confidence, it improves your looks, improves your strength, and probably even helps your brain chemistry and hormones and mood. Best of all, these all become positive feedback loops of confidence building, strength building, and aesthetics.
2. Convert your long term goals into much shorter term goals. "I will exercise for 45 minutes on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday this week".
3. Make short term goals focuses on improving tight-knit relationships among a small group of people. "I will ask 2 different people to eat lunch with me this week". Being an introvert is not an excuse.
4. Find hobbies to do with your hands: take advantage of the fact that your brain is wired to feel pride and accomplishment after building, fixing, or crafting things. Build furniture, fix up a car, become a bicycle commuter and tune your bike.
5. Eat healthy. Related to #1, but also because I'm convinced that our health impacts our mood, and more directly, our gut microbiome affects our mood. Eat real food. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Alright I apologize for my aggressive comment. Maybe I realize where we aren't seeing eye-to-eye.

I assumed you were criticizing the first part of Sam's tweet:

 I don't agree with everything here, but [@BenSasse](https://mobile.twitter.com/BenSasse) gave a wonderful speech about the Kavanaugh circus and [\#metoo](https://mobile.twitter.com/hashtag/metoo?src=hashtag_click)

This is what I got defensive about. I don't give a damn if Ben Sasse "votes with Trump" 99% of the time. If he makes a good and reasonable speech, with ideas I support, than I have no problem saying "This is a good and reasonable speech with ideas I support".

Apparently you were in fact criticizing the last part of Sam's tweet, 

 We need to reboot our politics from the center

because it some how implies that Sasse is a centrist. Your facts about how he votes refute that fact. I suppose I can see why you would take issue with this part of Sam's tweet.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I stopped at the deli this morning on my way to work, to get my breakfast sandwhich on an everything bagel. Sat down at the counter to enjoy, and noticed an old guy next to me with *two* 24 oz coffees.

"You're a double coffee man?" I asked.

"Yep, one for here, one on the way home"

We get to chatting about how it's nice to spend money to support local private companies like this deli, start talking about what we do for work. Apparently he was a mason, but now he sells expensive equipment to machine shops (lasers, CNC machines, etc). He mentioned he only has to make one or two sales a year to get by, but lately he's been making most of his money **trading.**

"What kind of trading do you do? Mostly buy   hold or are you in and out a lot?"

"Actually, mostly options trading. I made $18k last month believe it or not" he replied.

We got to talking about options, I mentioned I've been dabbling, and we discovered that we both mostly sell vertical spreads. "Yeah man, can't buy naked calls, Theta will fuck you" I said. "Yup, it sure will, Always got to trade pairs to hedge your downside".

He mentioned he used TD Ameritrade, and he transferred all his and his wife's retirement savings there, *not to spend* of course, but so he could get more margin in his trading account.

The funniest thing was when he told me he got a tip to buy Nike calls early last month, and he was telling me "I actually bought some call contracts that expired the same week!". I struggled so hard to not say "Ah yeah, the good ol' FD!"

Maybe I'll bring up FD's next time I see him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's some random thoughts that might help you:

I'm convinced that human beings didn't evolve to sit around all day and be super introspective about long term goals.

We evolved to live in small intimate communities of \~50 people. We went on hunting expeditions where we got extended cardio exercise and bonded strongly with the band we went out with. Women foraged for berries in small cliques carrying babies in a sheet on their chest. In the evenings we cooked together, we gathered water together, we made crafts and built huts and fixed our thatched roofs to stop leaks. We relied heavily on one another, built strong ties of trust and companionship. We gossiped and had feuds, we resolved conflicts and made up.

All of these things have **short term** cause and effect relationships. We can see the success of our roof-patching project: the house is dry. That is amazingly fulfilling and give a dopamine hit. We finally catch our exhausted prey after running for 6 hours, and we have to kill it with a spear. There's a dopamine hit, and an adrenaline hit. The men carry back the carcass and sing war songs of victory as we bring it back to camp. 

Research shows that aboriginal tribal societies that live in this manner have basically **zero** incidence of depression and obesity. Sources [1](https://www.madinamerica.com/2014/06/living-age-melancholy-society-becomes-depressed/), [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3330161/), [3](https://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/mental-health-indigenous-peoples-international-overview).

Not exactly sure where I'm going with this, but here are some lessons you could take from my story to see if they help:

1. Convert your long term goals into much shorter term goals. "I will exercise for 1 hour on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday this week". "I will complete such-and-such minor milestone in my IT work"
2. Make short term goals focuses on improving tight-knit relationships among a small group of people. "I will ask 2 different people to eat lunch with me this week". Being an introvert is not an excuse. 
3. Find hobbies to do with your hands. Build furniture, fix up a car, become a bicycle commuter and tune your bike. </TEXT>

Whole communities get all of their food from fast food stores and convenience stores, they haven't been to a grocery story or farmers market in years. They have no clue the dangers of soda, their parents grew up on soda, their siblings grew up on soda, all of their classmates grew up on soda, and everyone around them is incredibly obese and they don't even know it's not normal.

<TEXT> I'm going to try to add a bit of nuance to the discussion to try to bridge the gap between R's and D's on this topic.

First of all, I fully agree that the combined testimony of at least these 3 women confirm for me with 95%+ certainty that the claims are true, and Kav. was a horrible sexual harasser and possibly rapist, and I would NEVER vote to give him a lifetime seat on the supreme court.

However, I also am cynical enough to realize that when one of the major two parties in power feels that they are significantly threatened, it would be possible to come up with one person that happened to have very strong credentials but whom they could *encourage* (financially) to make up stories about an opponent.

What I'm trying to say is there's a very strong incentive to find someone that would lie about this. The presence of that incentive changes the Bayesian statistics I do in my head when weighing various testimonies. In this case, especially with 3 (actually more) independent sources, it's not enough doubt to even make me consider allowing this scumbag on the SC. But it's not that hard for me to see why people would be skeptical that these are paid plants.

[These are normal every day people in my newsfeed](https://i.imgur.com/n60L10Z.png) that are skeptical. They see the incentive for evil people to pay a lot of money to have someone make up charges against a political opponent. They simply have different assumptions, they weigh the probabilities a bit differently than me because of their starting assumptions. They aren't evil women haters.

I just don't think they understand the level of confidence we should have in our supreme court justices. They should basically be above reproach, no *doubt* as to their character. Even if you couldn't convict Kavanaugh in a court of law on criminal rape charges, it's enough that we shouldn't give him a SC seat. </TEXT>

(at least the strangers). The reactions were no different than what I'd expect if I said "oh actually I don't drink alcohol" or "I bike to work": other personal decisions that are slightly unusual and counter cultural. Don't read to much into it. It's human nature to be surprised when someone is slightly non confirming to societal norms.

As for the family expectations, I'd offer the same advice by default. Don't assume malevolence.  </TEXT>

Interestingly, Pennsylvania law states the following:

 #x200B;

PA Title 75, Section 3507 (bicycles). Lamps or other equipment on pedalcycles.  
  
  
 a)Lamps and reflectors.--Every pedalcycle when in use between sunset and sunrise shall be equipped on the front with a lamp which emits a beam of white light intended to illuminate the pedalcycle operator's path and visible from a distance of at least 500 feet to the front, a red reflector facing to the rear which shall be visible at least 500 feet to the rear and an amber reflector on each side. Operators of pedalcycles may supplement the required front lamp with a white flashing lamp, light-emitting diode or similar device to enhance their visibility to other traffic and with a lamp emitting a **red flashing** lamp, light-emitting diode or similar device visible from a distance of 500 feet to the rear. A lamp or lamps worn by the operator of a pedalcycle shall comply with the requirements of this subsection if the lamp or lamps can be seen at the distances specified.

<TEXT> I definitely agree that the laws of physics are maintained, calories in minus calories out must equal calories stored. However, there is all sorts of other crazy adaptations your body can do. Did you know that there have been studies that include a controlled caloric surplus, and people's bodies adapt by burning an extra 300 or even 600 calories purely through NEAT (Non-exercise Activity Thermogenesis)? That's just tapping your feet, pacing, fidgeting, bouncing back and forth, other minor subconscious activity we do throughout the day. (Apparently this type of calorie burning is not included in basal metabolic rate) Likewise, under caloric deficit, your body can cut back on NEAT to save similar amounts of calories. And that's not even to mention the changes in actual exercise in response to caloric deficit or surplus.

So the energy balance is maintained of course, but the "calories out" is no where **near** constant: It adapts in response to the "calories in" term based on hormonal signals that effectively work as a "set point" for body weight.

<TEXT> First of all: "straight-up sugar" is what we call sucrose. Sucrose is a combination molecule made up of one unit of fructose bound to one unit of glucose.

High fructose corn syrup doesn't actually have more fructose than table sugar, it's about the same.

But either way, fructose is definitely a bad guy here. Unlike glucose, which is the main energy source for the whole body (every single cell can metabolize glucose and use it for energy), fructose is almost treated by your body as a poison. Our body has no use for it, and it can only be metabolized by the liver (just like ethanol) where it directly contributes to fatty liver disease and insulin resistance.

I'm old enough that when I was a kid, sugar was king, and people weren't as big.

My guess is people today are eating *way* more sugar and way less fat than when you were a kid, but you might not realize it.

<TEXT> Yet people complain when doctors tell their patient to lose weight.

Personally, I think most doctors are still giving the wrong advice. The past 30 years have been a massive failure in public policy: In the same thirty years that we've been advocating low fat, high carb diets, and subsidizing high fructose corn syrup, obesity rates have more than doubled.

Colorado (the least obese state) today has a higher rate of obesity than Mississippi in 1995 (the most obese state).

Calories in / calories out doesn't tell the whole story.  **WHAT** you eat influences your hormones, particularly insulin levels. When insulin levels are high, your body is in "store energy" mode, and does everything it can to divert calories to storage (fat). Over the years, your body gets used to high insulin levels, and needs even more insulin to keep your blood sugar low. This is the vicious cycle of insulin resistance: you are over-weight, but your body thinks you are starving and continues to dump energy into storage. Your resting metabolic rate goes down. You get lethargic. You don't tap your feet and pace anymore. Your body temperature goes down. you get hungry all the time.

The energy balance is still conserved, yes you are overeating, but that's because your body is in a five-alarm state telling you you HAVE to eat more.

<TEXT> Happy to join! A little bit more about me:

* Lots of moderation experience, long time mod of /r/personalfinance (13+ million subs)
* Discovered the dangers of sugar through the [What I've Learned](https://youtu.be/f_4Q9Iv7_Ao) youtube channel late last year, which led me to 6 hours of Dr. Jason Fung's Lectures on Youtube, and reading his books.
* I experimented with 70 days sugar free this spring. When that was finished, I thought I'd go back to simply "moderating" my sugar intake, but decided I didn't have the self control. For the past few months I've been sugar free again, this time indefinitely. Personally, I'm not super strict. I still occasionally have sauces with sugar (ketchup...) and bread products with some sugar, but I've completely cut out all sweets: cookies, brownies, donuts, candy, etc, all of which I previously had been **very bad** about.
* I'm especially interested in the biochemistry of health, and the physiological response to fructose. I'm a chemical engineer by training with a concentration in biological engineering.
* I think the concepts of intermittent fasting go hand-in-hand with the concepts of /r/sugarfree: both tackling the same problem of fatty liver disease and insulin resistance.

Although I view my moderation job primarily as a spam-removal job, I hope to continue to contribute to the community on the topic of being sugar free! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm rebuilding my deck, which sits about 2 feet above the ground. It's difficult to get underneath the deck, so for convenience I'd like to install the deck railing posts (4'X4's) with a self-driving structural fastener that I can drive through the rim/band joists from the outside, rather than use carraige bolts and have to get up under the deck to secure the nut on the back side. Is there anything that can do this?

I'm installing the posts on the *inside* of the rim joists. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your body probably has a very low "set point" for its target weight. You might figure out your maintenance calories, and eat above that target, but then your body compensates by burning more calories: increasing your body temperature, and increasing Non-Exercise Activity Thermogensis (NEAT): The amount of calories you burn daily fidgeting, nodding your head, moving about, pacing, etc.

[Here's some studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279077/) that when people are overfed above maintenance, their body compensates by increasing their NEAT (the amount of fidgeting, and other spontaneous minor activity) so that they burn at least another 300-400 calories through NEAT alone. They also found that people that are overfed also exercise more.

Most of this is subconscious and not controllable by you. So here's what you need to do: **Eat more. Eat more. Eat more.**  But you also need to signal to your body that it's OK to gain weight. In fact, it NEEDS to gain weight. To do this: **LIFT HEAVY THINGS.** Go to the gym. The signal to your body that it needs to build muscle will be FAR more powerful than the few extra calories you burn. It will make you hungrier too! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Can't close vertical credit spreads due to insufficient buying power, despite having the maximum possible loss held in collateral?! </TITLE>

<TEXT> I opened a single vertical credit spread (strike prices of $30 and $35) for a credit of $2.00. My account was credited $200, and $500 collateral was removed from my buying power (Max loss of $5.00 if both legs expire in the money: the difference in strike price).

The stock price has gone the wrong way, and the difference between the two option prices is now $3.00. I'd like to close my position for a debit of $300, yet Robinhood says I do not currently have the buying power! Isn't the whole point of reserving $500 of cash collateral to cover the worst case loss? Do I seriously have to wait until the options expire (looking like in the money...) and I lose the whole $500? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm 30 right now, and I'm extremely happy. Here's what makes me happy:

1. I do things with my hands that have an immediate and obvious effect on the world. I just extended my deck by 4 feet, and replaced all the deckboards. It was hard work, I learned a lot, I swore a lot, and now when I look at my beautiful deck, or sit out there with my wife drinking a glass of wine, I am deeply and truly happy.
2. I lift weights. I can deadlift 20 pounds more than I could last month. That's fucking awesome. Deep down in side that gives me some fucking joy. When I drop that bar back to the ground I want to roar with happiness. Side note: being healthy makes me happy. Not only from a logical stand point (I look better and can do more things), but deeply and innately: chemicaly. I'm convinced that being obese fucks all sorts of things up. Your gut microbiome is out of wack. Your hormones are out of wack: cortisol levels are too high, insulin levels are too high, you don't get the right sleep, etc. When your body is in the shape it evolved to be in, it helps your mind too.
3. I have a small tight-knit group of bros. we chat all day every day on whatsapp, give each other shit, etc. We play board games together, drink together, and have beers together.
4. I go on cheap vacations. My wife and I churn credit cards, so we have lots of free airline miles. We went camping in the rockies in Denver last month. It was something called "distributed camping" where the camp sites are spaced very far apart. Nothing like waking up at 6am to my wife cuddling me, walking out of the tent into the chilly dawn air in my undies and breathing in the fresh air.
5. I work a bullshit office job, that pays well. The people around me are cool, but the work is annoying. However, I have very inexpensive tastes. I've intentionally crafted my mind to enjoy simple pleasures: board games, cheap booze, etc. I've realized that things like fancy cars don't bring me the happiness that I think it will, society is downright wrong. True happiness comes from relationships, and your direct interaction with the world around you. buying a $500 watch will give you a jolt of dopamine for a day, but if it sits in a box with your other fancy watches, or just becomes "regular" for you, it won't bring you happiness anymore. But when I think back to the night two months ago where we stayed up til 4 am watching a pig roast on a spit with my buddies, drinking beer and playing dice games, **THAT** still brings me happiness. Having inexpensive tastes means I'm saving a shit ton of money. Saving a shit ton of money means I'll be able to retire early. Ideally before I'm 40 and I can be a stay at home dad and raise some kids while I work on side projects: building a youtube channel about personal finance tips and tricks, writing a novel, and working around the house.

You know what I just realized? I guaran-fucking-tee that I am way happier than my CEO, and he makes 100X as much money as I do

<TEXT> **General Moderation Philosophy**

Moderation has little to do with the subject matter itself (sugar free). It's basically a spam removal job. That said, moderators can contribute to crafting the culture of a subreddit. This should primarily be a place of learning and education. People will come with "dumb" questions. We should not belittle them. I won't remove dumb questions. I will remove comments that aggressively and unhelpfully attack others. However, healthy debate is welcome, and on a subreddit like this everyone will have different opinions that I will not suppress.

**Answers**

Do you have experience moderating subredits, online communities or similar? If so, please elaborate.

Yes, I'm a long-time moderator of /r/personalfinance , a default sub with millions of subs. I was extremely active from 2014 to 2016. removing spam in a sub like that is basically a full time job: the mod queue fills up fast. I am also familiar with automoderator functionality and light CSS for customization. Since 2016 I've gone into semi retirement as I burnt out a bit. Health is my new passion project having recently discovered Dr. Jason Fung and gone sugar free (mostly) myself. My passion for the subject will keep me interested and active.

What, to you personally is spam? What ought to be done to deal with it? How will you change rule #3 in order to be more effective and meet the users' interests?

On /r/personalfinance we took an extremely strict approach to "spam", basically disallowing *any* self promotion content. There was a blanket rule against any links to self-owned youtube videos, blogs, articles, and the like that could potentially be monetized or even simply be brand-building. We also erred on the conservative side: If someone came in and just posted a link to a blog article (even with no history), we'd *assume* it was spam.

Here I think we should be a bit more relaxed, the audience is much smaller, and there is a smaller incentive to spam. However, we should only allow links to smalltime blogs or smalltime youtube channels (The typical spam links) for cases of users who are active participants in discussion, and use a rough rule something along the lines of "no more than 1 in 10 submissions should be links to self-owned content"

<TEXT> Interesting study. Good results. This was particularly interesting: "

The strength of the relationship observed here was specific to loot boxes. It did not apply to other kinds of spending in video games."

 #x200B;

 Important Note: This is not necessarily a causal link - They aren't saying that loot-box purchasing **leads** to problem gambling: Simply that on average, people with problem gambling tend to spend more on loot boxes. Which is sort of a "no duh" conclusion, since loot boxes *are* gambling. Straight from the article: " It may be the case that i individuals who are already problem gamblers instead tend to spend more on loot boxes. There are good reasons why this might be the case. Loot boxes share key similarities with other kinds of gambling. Since problem gambling is characterised by uncontrollable and disordered spending on gambling activities, this lack of control and excess in spending may apply to loot boxes too."

<TEXT> Hello! I sent out a meeting request in MS Outlook to a bunch of people at my work last week. The body of the event contained a bunch of info and connection information for a conference call.

Now, when I open the event in my calendar, the body of the event is completely blank. However, when I talk to other meeting attendees, they can still see the content of the event. How do I restore my copy of the event so I can see everything?

**Additional info:**

* I did save a copy of the .ics file when I first created the event, and this file still has all the content. I can import this .ics file to my calendar, but then I have *two* copies of the event at the same date and time. The "original" event with empty body, (but this one tracks all the RSVPs from all attendees (over 50)), and now the new imported copy correctly which shows the event content, but doesn't contain the RSVPs information from anyone. 
* Is it possible I simply deleted all the content on my own copy, but didn't click "send update"? Is there any way for me to restore my copy from the server? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's my layman's understanding: unlike glucose, which can be used by for fuel directly all the cells in your body, fructose can ONLY be metabolized by the liver. Some of the by products of this metabolism contribute directly to fatty liver and insulin resistance. So I think it's still not optimal. That said, you very well could maintain your high sugar diet and live completely healthily til age 95. But if you want to do the best possible for your body, minimize fructose and sucrose/table sugar (which is 50% fructose).

<TEXT> Have you heard of \[Dr. Jason Fung\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKC3hiyLeRc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKC3hiyLeRc))? His comprehensive theory of obesity explains exactly why backsliding is so common, why it is NOT just a matter of willpower. Your body has biological feedback loops that cause you to have a bodyweight "set point". Your body's set point is confused: after you lost 250 lbs, your body (which had become insulin resistant) thought it was starving (although actually it was just getting healthy). As such it does everything possible to send your body weight back up: lowering your body temperature, lowering your resting metabolic rate, etc. The video series linked above blew my mind with how much it all made sense. </TEXT>

However, it was a bit nerve wracking seeing my paycheck go from $2335 down to $1317 last week!

<TEXT> I don't think there's any major concerns. There are tons of religions, cultures, and fitness groups that do some very serious fasting, which often includes greatly reduced average caloric intake. Just take a multivitamin. 

If I could make one recommendation, it would be do your caloric reduction via intermittent fasting, not simply by eating smaller, 3 meals a day. I think there's more and more evidence that your body responds differently to the same amount of calories depending on when you eat them.

[Fasting vs. Eating Less: What's the Difference? (Science of Fasting)](https://youtu.be/APZCfmgzoS0) This talks about some of the historical studies done with severe caloric reduction. </TEXT>

I also find the Bayesian assumptions in your post enlightening. Even though you said there's only a 36% chance that you get a result like this with random data, (64% chance that it's **not** random: that certain pieces are biased), you still said "we can infer that it is **unlikely** to be biased"

That's because we have a Bayesian prior assumption: That there's a really good chance tetris is effectively random. With that prior in place, this result is not enough to shift the likelihood of rigged tetris to greater than 50%.

<TEXT> You're being downvoted, but I agree. Watching[ Jason Fung's youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpllomiDMX0) and reading his book convinced me. However, you make it sound like people's actions and decisions have no impact on their weight, which isn't exactly true. I think you are just saying it's not a simple matter of "Why don't you just eat less and exercise more"? If you are already fat and insulin resistant, and eating a diet full of fructose, that advice is almost impossible to follow, and it has nothing to do with being lazy or slothful. 

I'm convinced that cutting out sugar and doing some light intermittent fasting (after dinner one day, don't eat until dinner the following day) are the main solutions.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it depends primarily on how much flexibility you have in your budget. All things considered, a 15yr mortgage only has a marginal advantage over the 30 year in terms of interest rate. If you are really stretching your budget to afford the 15 year payments, forget about it. If you are saving a shit ton of money and have lots of room in your budget, and you won't \*feel\* the higher payments, go with the 15-year. I refinanced to a 15 year loan 2 years ago (2.75%!!!!) and am very happy about it. </TEXT>

You will almost certainly want to file jointly with your wife for the 2018 year. You will be considered married for the whole year, all your income will be combined, as will all your tax liability. As such, one easy thing would be for your wife-to-be to start having more money withheld from her paychecks. In fact, it may be quite possible for your wife to have enough taxes withheld from her paychecks routinely to cover all your tax liability.

<TEXT> IMO, 97% of the problem with "sugar" is really a problem with fructose specifically. Fructose is metabolized very differently than other sugars (entirely in the liver where it has direct negative consequences causing fatty liver and contributing to insulin resistance). Also note that table sugar (sucrose) is 50% fructose.

The small bit of lactose in milk is completely inconsequential in my opinion. </TEXT>

This is a bear call spread, meaning if the share price stays below $322.50 by expiry, both calls expire worthless out of the money and I get to keep my credit of $360. So it's a bearish play.

<TEXT> "The best Magic: the Gathering pros have around a 55-60% win rate" Against other pros? No doubt. 

But against the median player?  
And I specifically mentioned the draft format. Drafting takes a lot more skill. I imagine if you put me against a pro with the *same constructed deck,*  I could probably beat him \~25%-40% of the time. But If you put a pro in a 8-man draft pool where the other 7 where average players, the pro would win WAY more than 12.5% of the tournaments.  In drafting, you have to know all the possible combinations, all the meta game, the frequency of cards, etc etc  </TEXT>

I've played enough games against lower skill players to know I can beat them 95% of the time, and I've played enough games against higher skill players to know I will lose 95%+ of the time. Settlers if Catan is similar, I've played over 200 games, many of them with highly experienced players and new players, and the new players have pretty good odds of winning.

The rest are just guess, I'm just proposing the methodology, and asking the crowd for more data. </TEXT>

<TITLE> New metric for identifying the importance of "chance" in determining boardgame winner </TITLE>
<DATE> 2018-07-17 22:49:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been mulling over a new metric for games, the point of which is to disclose how much of your odds to win is due to chance, and how much is due to skill

Take two hypothetical players, One is in the top 1% of skill and experience in the game, and the other is around the median skill level of all players of that game (someone who has played 10-20 games). Hypothetically have them play 100 matches. In how many is the expert player victorious? We can call this metric the "Skill Ceiling Rating"

Here's my opinion for some games I've played:

|Game|Number of games in which expert player beats median player (out of 100)|
|:-|:-|
|Go|100|
|Chess|98-100|
|Magic: The Gathering (Draft Format)|80-90|
|Candyland or Chutes   Ladders|50 (all chance)|
|Settlers of Catan Vanilla|55 (This is my grudge against the game: it seems to be highly influenced by early game luck)|
|Star Realms|? (I'm just getting into this game, but I'm suspicious it approaches 50)|
|Agricola|60-75?|

I can't even guess what the number is for some of the complicated modern games like Scycthe, Terraforming Mars, Dominant Species, etc. Any thoughts on this? Anyone have some guesses for other games you have played?

I particularly like high skill ceiling games: ones for which this number approaches 100. Anyone have any recommendations? </TEXT>

<TEXT> The 4 #37; rule, at it's core, says that if you keep your annual withdrawals below 4 #37; of your portfolio, you should be good. Those annual withdrawals *must already account for taxes.* E.g. if you think your living expenses will be $40k, and your taxes will be $10k, then you need to withdraw $50k per year total. THAT is what must be less than 4 #37; of your portfolio.

In other words, it doesn't assume anything about taxes. You need to treat your taxes as an expense when figuring out your withdrawal rate. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Crazy coincidences while traveling and reading? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2018-07-15 19:49:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've just had a crazy coincidence while traveling and reading for the second time. I'm not a huge travel bug, but I've been out of the country for vacation or work about 6-7 times in the past few years. Twice now, I've been reading a book while traveling, and despite the fact that the book is completely unrelated to the location I'm traveling, something comes up in the book that is *incredibly* specific to the exact location I'm at!

# First Coincidence

In 2016, my wife and I took our honeymoon to the Mediterranean. While staying in Rome for 2 days, I was reading [Moonwalking with Einstein by Joshua Foer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6346975-moonwalking-with-einstein), a non-fiction book about human memory. The book has nothing to do with Italy or Rome whatsoever.   One morning my wife and I were sitting having coffee and breakfast in one of the hundreds of plazas and piazzas throughout Rome. I have my kindle out and I'm reading my book, and I come across a passage which just so happens to mention an anecdote about guy named Giordano Bruno who was burned at the stake not 20 yards from where I was sitting in the  Campo de' Fiori. [I read the paragraph, turned my head, and looked straight at the statue that was just mentioned](https://i.imgur.com/gKJVI3l.jpg). I literally didn't even have to move my body.

# Second Coincidence

This one just happened this morning, the day after I returned from a family trip to Scotland. I'm reading Neal Stephenson's Baroque Cycle Trilogy, specifically the third book: [The System of the World](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/116257.The_System_of_the_World). These are epic historical fiction novels, which take place all over the world in the late 1600's and early 1700's. The characters travel the far east, middle east, Europe, and UK. [Suddenly I come across this passage](https://i.imgur.com/nnw51TX.jpg). And yup, you guessed it: This is the *exact* tiny little town of Glencoe (population: 374) [Where my family and I just spent a week in a cabin for a hiking trip.](https://i.imgur.com/2mbpE8s.jpg)

I'm sure this is just some type of observer bias: I read a lot, and travel a good bit. Many books refer to dozens or hundreds of unique locations, I suppose I'm bound to happen across such passages while I'm in those locations once and a while, but both times it's happened it's felt incredibly awesome, and has added a massive dose of reality and immersion to whatever I'm reading.

**Has anything similar ever happened to you?** </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I have a low deck in the back of my house, and I'd like to extend it to add some square footage. (I need to replace the deckboards anyways)

I've made some plans for the extension, but would love a quick review. These plans have me digging 3 new posts all within very close proximity, and I'm wondering if there's an easier way to do anything.

2. What's the best way to extend the existing beam? Butt joint? </TEXT>

<TEXT> The breakeven price is the share price that has to be reached *at expiry* for you to profit if you hold the option til that time. Remember, from "options 101" the price of an option has two components: both intrinsic and extrinsic value (or time value). Before expiry, the option still has some extrinsic value or time value, because there is a chance it could rise between now and the future.

So yes you could sell right now for a profit. But imagine what would happen if GE shares stayed at **exactly** $13.68 until expiry: completely flat. Although the share price will stay the same over the next 2 weeks, The option price will slowly dwindle down from where it is currently ($0.39) to its intrinsic value at expiry: $0.18. At expiry, the option will only be worth $0.18: you could exercise the option and make $13.68 - $13.50. However, that difference ($0.18 per share) is less than the premium you paid when you bought the option ($0.21). So you would not have broken even. </TEXT>

* If you run out of trash bags, the ice vendor may have spares
* Please clean up all trash before you leave your campsite at the end of the festival
* Human beings tend to follow the leader. If your neighbor sees you leave trash behind, they might think "Well, our neighbors left trash all over, we might as well leave our trash too, since staff will have to come clean it up anyways".

<TEXT> Here's my completely amateur opinion. Suicide is/was practically unheard of in native, aboriginal, hunter/gatherer societies. What is different about our society from theirs?

* Our social connections are much broader and shallower. hunter gatherer tribes have no choice but to foster deep relationships with a small group of people (50 or so). They live with each other day in and day out, and have no choice but to trust each other deeply. Human brains are wired to be social. I'm not talking about being introverted or extroverted, it's much more core than that.
* The results of our work are significantly abstracted from the work itself. When you chase a boar, spear it, gut it, and cook it, the results are instantaneous and gratifying. Dopamine is released in the brain. When you repair your thatch roof, the results are instantly obvious because you no longer get dripped on at night. When you sharpen a stick, or repair a canoe, or fire a clay pot, you see the visible output of your work, and are satisfied by it. Your hands are callused for the next few days and remind you of your success (or your failures and learnings). This is very different from working on spreadsheets at work, or ringing up groceries for a thousand nameless faces.
* We are much less healthy. We are obese and don't exercise. We eat way too much sugar. Our gut microbiomes are probably out of whack, and the past 5 years of research have shown that our gut microbiome is closely linked to mood and state of mind.
* We simply have the freedom to sit around and ruminate, which might actually be a bad thing. Our distant ancestors didn't have that luxury. 
* Social media of course. This goes back to point 1, but only compounds it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here's a question I use to get people thinking: If you are scared of earning too much to get "pushed into a higher tax bracket", just take the raise but stop working in October or November each year (or at whatever date you could "just stay under the threshold")

This question goes very much against their intuitions, but when they realize that it's effectively the same thing as making less per hour, it might get them to question their assumptions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Something that may be helpful for your understanding: Let's step away from mortgages specifically and think about loans in general. There are two main types of loans: secured and unsecured loans. 

A secured loan means the lender has some added security that their money will get paid back, usually in the form of a legal right to some of your property.

* A mortgage on a house is *secured* by the value of your house. If you stop paying the bank, they take your house. Your house is the collateral.
* A car loan is *secured* by the value of your car. If you stop paying back your car loan, they will repossess your car. 
* A credit card cash advance is not secured. If you stop paying, they have no recourse but to send you to collections and trash your credit

The interesting thing about real estate is that real estate values fluctuate. That's why typically a bank won't lend you $100,000 for a $100,000 home. If the value of your house drops to $90,000, and you still owe them $100,000, [part of their loan to you is no longer secured](https://i.imgur.com/T5AItfT.png). Typically they will only loan you up to 80% of the value of the house, so even if the value of the property drops 20%, their loan is still secured. This is where the typical "20% down payment" comes from. Now a days, it's very easy to get a loan of up to 95% of the value of a house, but you have to pay an extra monthly fee (mortgage insurance) to compensate the bank for their risk. But you *still* need to come up with that 5% yourself.

That's one way a second mortgage might come up: You can get a loan for 80% of your house price from one lender, but you don't have enough money to pay the other 20% yourself, so you get a second mortgage from another lender. Since the first lender has first "dibs" on the house if you stop paying, the second lender will probably charge you a much higher interest rate.

Another way you might have a second mortgage is much less scary: Suppose your have spent 20 years paying off your first and only mortgage. Now you have a house worth $200,000, and an outstanding mortgage balance of just $40,000. You effectively have $160,000 worth of *equity* which you can use to secure a new loan! This could be for anything: a fancy car, a vacation, to start up a business, or to put an addition on your home. So you go to a new bank and ask for a new loan of $50,000. In return, they get a second lien on your property. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  What I don't understand is the rabid, energetic anti-Musk stuff on Reddit. "a bunch of people are stupid fan boys" does not justify the frothing at the mouth you see in almost every Musk related thread.

Make sure you are correctly identifying rabid anti-Musk comments from rabid anti-TSLA stock comments.

I'm a huge fan of Musk, a huge fan of Tesla cars, and a fan of all Musk's other work. But I still think TSLA is like 10x overvalued, I have a put option *betting* that the stock price will go down, and I cheer every time the stock price falls.

That doesn't make me anti-Musk though! </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I just spent about 40 minutes going through a bunch of those studies, and I'm not convinced yet. 

Originally I was a full-on CICO proponent, until I discovered Jason Fung's work, watched his [6 video lecture series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpllomiDMX0), and read the Obesity Code. 

These links have not converted me back. First of all, nearly all of the links in /u/JustARogue 's comment are not at all about insulin resistance. They compare weight loss between a low carb and high carb diet for periods less than a year. Second of all, they use low "glycemic index" to define low carb, but the blood sugar isn't the problem. For example, Fructose has a relatively low glycemic index but has a very high insulin response.

But even that is avoiding the main point. Studies show that protein has almost the same insulin response as carbs! It's not the short term insulin levels in response to a meal that are the problem, it's the *insulin resistance* that's the problem, that builds up over years. Insulin resistance causes your body to have a higher baseline insulin response to *all food*, which promotes overall higher de novo lipogensisis. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You are definitely right! I certainly was simplifying. I think your point about "belonging to a group" is probably particularly important.

Hunter gatherers probably had relatively small tight knit communities (25-100 people), where people knew each other well, trusted one another, and relied on one another. Very different from modern society, and we should work to foster that type of community of possible. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Have you asked yourself why depression is so much more common in the developed world? I believe we can identify the reasons, and change our behavior. Here's some reasons:

* We get much less sun (and thus less vitamin D)
* We eat way more frequently, snacking all the time, so our insulin levels never drop and we build insulin resistance (which makes us fat).
* We eat way more fructose and processed carbs 
* We spend very little time moving our bodies, and working with our hands. 

Fixes for those issues:

1. Take Vitamin D supplements
2. Check out [intermittent fasting](https://youtu.be/APZCfmgzoS0)
3. Cut out all added sugar if possible. [WHY Sugar is as Bad as Alcohol (Fructose, The Liver Toxin)](https://youtu.be/f_4Q9Iv7_Ao)
4. Exercise. [WHY Exercise is so Underrated ](https://youtu.be/DsVzKCk066g)

Exercise causes all sorts of changes in our hormones and neuro transmitters. Exercise has been proven to be a pretty bad way to lose weight, but it's a damn good way to improve your mood and just generally feel better.

Sometimes when think about going for a walk, it seems annoying. Imagining it, I think about how it might be too hot or too cold. How I'd rather watch another episode of TV or play another game of whatever. But when I do convince myself to go for a walk, and I come back to my house afterwards, have I ever once regretted it? Have I ever said "ugh I wish I stayed home and didn't go on that walk"? Nope.

All of this stuff is inter-related too: health, mood, looks, and self-confidence. They are all feedback loops: When one is going well, it improves the others, which in turn improves the others even more, and so on. Small changes and improvements in one or more of these areas can snowball over time and have a significant improvement in your life

Just some thoughts for ya. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Thought of the day: On making decisions that just save a few bucks here or there. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2018-05-03 17:01:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> We are animals governed by habits, desires, and intuitions. Although we might think we can look at every single purchasing decision in a vacuum, we don't.

It's never **just** a matter of this thought on one single day: *Should I sleep in an extra 15 minutes, and buy breakfast on the way to work instead of cooking it myself? It's only $5.*

The effects of the decision we make in that situation are not simply limited to that morning alone. That decision shapes our habits, and over time our habits shape our **character**.

* Yes, the $150 sign-up bonus I got for switching checking accounts is just a drop in the bucket.
* Yes, going with the free version of Pandora only saves me $5 a month.
* Yes, making my own coffee in the morning only saves me $1 a day.
* Yes, going to a different grocery store only saves me a few cents on bananas.
* Yes, biking to work only saves me $2 a day. 
* Yes, doing this drywall repair myself only saves me $400 and costs me a whole weekend.

But these things fucking **add up**, and none of them are done in isolation. Doing one of them out of discipline, actually makes me enjoy doing the next one with a bit less discipline. Eventually, these things build up enough that it doesn't take *any* discipline, because it's actually fucking FUN to churn credit cards or repair my own plumbing leak, and it becomes part of my personality to look for these opportunities.

Enough drops can fill a bucket. Each behavior can snowball, they are positive feedback loops in the way they shape my personality, and actually mold by BRAIN to enjoy different things!

____________________

Don't ask the question "Do I enjoy biking to work instead of driving". Ask "Do I want to become the type of person that enjoys biking to work instead of driving". And then start taking the actions that will shift your personality over time in that direction. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Regarding kids: Our plan is that wife stays at home with the kids til they are ~3-5, while I (higher earner) keep working. Then hopefully I can full out retire and be a stay at home dad.

Also we plan to do public school (although homeschooling is an option). I strongly believe that the academic success of children is 95% driven by the parents, not the school. I went to the shittiest school ever, but my parents spent hundreds of hours starting at a very young age, always challenging me, reading to me, prompting and feeding my curiosity, and asking me questions about numbers and logic and cause and effect and doing puzzles together. Then later, teaching me about science and chemistry and algebra and so on.

All completely independent of my public school education, on Saturdays and through casual conversation in the evenings. **THIS**, the quality of the home life, and the way parents interact with children when they are extremely young IMO is the biggest determinate of future intelligence and academic success.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> thoughts that may or may not help you:

I've been reading and thinking a lot about diet and depression lately. Did you know that when psychologists spend time with aboriginal and native tribes, really embedding themselves and getting to know the people, they find *less than 0.1%* incidence of depression? In the western world it's at least 10 times that high. Likewise, obesity is basically unheard of in all such tribes. And that's true whether their diet is extremely high in animal meat and fat, or extremely high in fibrous vegetables and grains.

More and more I'm realizing that we are not living the lives our bodies evolved to live. 

* We get a tiny fraction of the sun (and thus vitamin D) we should. 
* We eat way more frequently than we should , snacking all the time, so our insulin levels never drop and we build insulin resistance (which makes us fat).
* We spend very little time moving our bodies, and working with our hands. Our ancestors spent all day doing both of those things. Exercise causes all sorts of changes in our hormones and neuro transmitters. Exercise has been proven to be a pretty *bad* way to lose weight, but it's a damn good way to improve your mood and just generally feel better.

Sometimes when think about going for a walk, it seems annoying. Imagining it, I think about how it might be too hot or too cold. How I'd rather watch another episode of TV or play another game of whatever. But when I *do* convince myself to go for a walk, and I come back to my house afterwards, have I **ever once** regretted it? Said "ugh I wish I stayed home and didn't go on that walk"? Nope.

All of this stuff is inter-related too: health, mood, looks, and self-confidence. They are all feedback loops: When one is going well, it improves the others, which in turn improves the others *even more*, and so on. Small changes and improvements in one or more of these areas can snowball over time and have a significant improvement in your life

Just some thoughts for ya.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Hardware] Help me decide what camera(s) to buy: vlogging + facecam </TITLE>
<DATE> 2018-04-23 15:36:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Let's start with my user requirements:

The majority of my videos are currently gaming videos with a small facecam insert. I'd like to start doing two things:

1. Occasionally during my streams, switch to a full screen face-cam (while in between games, etc).
2. Recording Vlogs or informational videos with full screen face-cams *from my computer desk*
3. Recording Vlogs or informational videos with full screen face-cam *out and about*

Currently I have a $20 logitech webcam with 720p, which is pretty shitty for full screen video. I also have a Moto G5 Plus android phone (~$200) with a so-so camera. 

So I think I want to do some combination of the following

1. Upgrade my webcam (to C920 for $50?)
2. Get a good entry level mirrorless camera such as the Sony Alpha 5100 for my out-and-about shooting. ($450-$600)
3. Upgrade my phone to something with a better camera like a recent flagship Samsung (Looks like I can get mint condition used Galaxy s8 for $440)
4. Use either my phone or mirrorless camera *as* my webcam?

One important thing for me is convenience: I'm skeptical about using a high end phone or mirrorless camera *as my webcam*, having to download apps or buy a [cam link](https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-Cam-Link-Broadcast-camcorder/dp/B0748QYPX9/) ($130?!) and hook up USB cables every time I just want to sit down and do a quick video game stream. So I'm leaning towards options #1 and #3 combined.

Any thoughts? Note: I already have pretty good studio lighting at my computer desk.

How can we be most effective here is we want to be on the same planes as one another? Is it worth buying one-way tickets there on American (wife uses miles for her ticket), and one-way tickets back on United (I use miles for my ticket?).

I know I can price out all the different details, I'm wondering if anyone has a general approach to this issue, or has found that typically it's not worth it and we should just pay cash for round trips? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think my coverage would only change if I had a car that I couldn't replace out of pocket with cash or liquid assets. But I never will, because in fact I will make my car buying decisions based on the ability to replace them with cash.

Mathematically, the expected value on all insurance has to be negative, unless you know something the insurer doesn't.

I believe by current liability coverage is 100k/300k. 

Eventually I will get some umbrella insurance on top of that, once I accumulate more investments outside the shelter of retirement funds.  </TEXT>

**Phase 2:** Have ~2 kids over the next 4 years. Wife stays home. Single income.  Savings Rate: 30-40%. Target portfolio at the end: ~$800k-1MM.

**Phase 3:** Wife goes back to work, I stay at home, raise kids, make the home, and work on side projects. Savings rate: 10%. Basically wife's income will be just enough to sustain our expenses, while our portfolio accumulated up to this point can just sit there and grow. This may last 5-15 years depending on markets, wife's enjoyment of work, etc. Our current "FIRE Number" is about $1.6MM, with lots of room for adjustment. 

All dollars in today's dollars. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a noob so I might be wrong here, but I'm not sure you get it. 

Robinhood is not interfering with the put contract. As a put holder, you still *fully* maintain the right to exercise the option: to sell one hundred shares of LFIN stock to the option writer for the strike price. But in order to do that (to sell someone the shares) *you have to own the shares to sell*. Robinhood is not getting in the way of you exercising your right to sell those shares: you just have to figure out how to actually get those shares in order to transfer them to the option writer! Robinhood is not **obligated** to lend the shares to you in order for you to exercise your option.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi everyone! My buddies and I love playing Civ 6 and Endless Space 2 and Total War games against one another, but the time these games take (6 hours +) is just too much. We are looking for a good strategy game that can go to completion in a shorter time. 

It doesn't have to be a 4x game, but we do like turn based games. It doesn't *have* to be turn based, but things like Starcraft 2 just rely so much on micro and we'd rather not have the game depend so much on physical mechanics. 

Other games we like: Defcon, Don't Starve Together, XCOM 2... </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm in a similar boat, also a newb but maybe slightly less so. Forget about what RH is showing as the value of your contract right now. Contracts aren't trading at all, so that value is meaningless.

The halt will be lifted before 5/18, and after it's lifted, LFIN shares will hopefully be worthless or close to it. 

Your contracts will then be worth about $10 each. I'm not sure whether there will be volume to actually sell the contracts, but you can just wait til expiry and *I believe* your broker will exercise them for you: buying 100 shares per contract in your name (at $0.01 a piece), and selling them to the option writer (at $10 a piece).

You make $1,000 per put option, minus the price you paid ($275).

If we had puts expiring *before* the halt is lifted, we might have been screwed.

<TITLE> Is the expansion of RobinHood options creating an imbalanced market with opportunity for option sellers? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2018-04-05 19:21:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Robinhood is starting to open up their commission-free option trades to a wider and wider audience. You've got tons of posts here and at /r/wallstreetbets of people with small ($5,000 accounts) looking to strike it big by buying options.

RH only allows *selling* cash covered puts and covered calls. For many stocks, you could only sell a single option contract if you have $5,000+ of cash or stock respectively, to cover it. 

Will this result in an imbalanced market, with more people who want to buy options than those who can sell? Is this an opportunity for option sellers?

Or is Robinhood just a drop in the bucket that doesn't even matter? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just as I seek to optimize my personal finances and my happiness, I'm always interested in how to optimize my health. For most of my life I was a "Calories-In, Calories-Out" guy. And the fucked up thing is that since I was pretty fit, it came from a place of egotistical superiority. *Come on guys, if I can exercise and restrict my food intake, so can you. Why the fuck is everyone so fat?* - My mindset.

This all changed with a specific analogy that Gary Taubes used on [a podcast](https://samharris.org/podcasts/what-should-we-eat/)^1. He shared the example of a person who, over the course of a couple years, developed a 50 pound fatty tumor. Let's suppose this individual went from a body weight of 150 to 200 lbs with the growth of the tumor. Would it be correct to say "They gained 50 pounds because they ate more calories than they burned"? Of course it's *correct,* but it obviously isn't *helpful* at all. This person has a **serious hormonal disease** which instructed their body to divert massive amounts of calories to storing fat in their tumor. This left less energy available for daily life, so they ate more to make up for it! 

This simple example was the lightbulb that made me realize there is more to diet than calorie balance, and started me on the track of researching the impact that various foods have on our metabolism/dietary hormones like insulin, leptin, ghrelin, etc. The "What I've Learned" Youtube channel and the video [Why we get Fat AND Hungry | (Biology of Weight Gain   Low-Carb )](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHaCKudtVi0) was the best primer for me, and his later 3 videos ([1](https://youtu.be/LPxIssabhTc), [2](https://youtu.be/f_4Q9Iv7_Ao), [3](https://youtu.be/olEMIohTgzQ)) really helped me focus on sugar (fructose specifically) as the main culprit of high insulin, insulin resistance, and thus obesity.

After discovering this video, I sort of spontaneously decided I would try to go 75 days without added sugar. I'm currently on day 72! Now, I haven't been perfect. I've still had some sugary sauces on meat, but I have had **zero** sweets (Candy, brownies, cookies, cake). I work in an office environment notorious for having leftover donuts and brownies placed in common areas: free sweets to binge on. As a relatively fit guy, I often had a mental battle: (*I went to the gym this morning, so I can have one donut, right? ... ... Ok so since I already had one donut, I might as well have a second. It will just be a cheat day for me*). Using up my willpower in this internal argument every day was exhausting, whether or not I gave in. 

I was surprised when I committed to go sugar free that resisting sweets got *easier*, not harder. I now *identify* as someone who doesn't eat sugar. The argument was stopped before it even started.  

"Hey subject3993, want a donut?"  
"No thanks! I gave up sweets for 75 days!"  

I'm only 3 days away from achieving my goal, but I'm definitely going to continue this lifestyle. I wasn't even doing this for the purpose of losing weight, but I dropped from 185 to 178. I'm not sure if I *feel* different. Maybe better, maybe no change, maybe placebo. I definitely don't feel worse, even though I haven't been lifting weights and exercising as much (had wrist surgery and it's been cold).

**Advanced learning:**  
Just yesterday, someone forwarded me a series of video lectures by a Doctor Jason Fung (listen on 2x speed!) called [The Aetiology (Cause) of Obesity](https://youtu.be/YpllomiDMX0). This is by far the most comprehensive one-stop shop for everything I've come to believe about obesity, diabetes, their causes, and how to fix them. And right at the core of it is the massive amount of fructose and other refined carbs in the western diet, plus the constant snacking and sustained insulin levels. Feel free to check it out! It makes great listening while driving, the visuals aren't that important. I don't think sugar is the only culprit, rather the core issue is *everything* that leads to insulin resistance and high serum insulin. But sugar is probably the largest and easiest target, and also has some unique issues (addictiveness).

Good luck to everyone in your journey to be healthier! I hope this was helpful or interesting!

<TEXT> Hey man, it's a good post but to be honest, since I discovered the concept of FIRE in 2014, I've been much **happier** than before. This is the opposite of what would happen if your hypothesis were true (delaying gratification and happiness *now*, in the hope of more happiness by not working in the future).

What I've found is that the concepts of FIRE doesn't require any "intense effort" at all. It's greatly reduced my stress, improved my health, improved my joy and wellbeing, **and I haven't even retired yet!** (I still have a long way to go!)

I don't have time to fully explain why all these things have happened, but fundamentally it comes down to the fact that I have realized I have control over my life. I've become mindful of my own emotions, and the fact that modern society is wrong (or lying) when it implies certain things will make us happy.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a great paper! It certainly doesn't support any of the claims of your friend however. In fact, it adds additional data that shows how octopus fit very neatly into a small group of other cephalopods who very clearly ARE related (in a Darwinian sense: they share a common ancestor) and have evolved a neat trick to edit RNA.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a bit of a strange post. You are saying things that seem so outlandish to me, that I don't even know where to start. You didn't source anything at all so I don't know how to tackle this. Maybe your friend is mistakenly referring to this discovery from 2015? [High levels of RNA editing in Octopuses](https://www.sciencealert.com/octopus-and-squid-evolution-is-officially-weirder-than-we-could-have-ever-imagined)

I can tell you this much: There is *no* "extreme controversy" about **whether or not** any particular organism evolved. Have you read this? [Evidence for Common Descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_of_common_descent). There are so many hundreds of completely independent observations that add more and more layers to the incredibly robust stack of evidence that all life on earth is part of a single large tree of common descent. Every single species is related to every other, and every single year (as we sequence more and more genomes), we add even more evidence. There has never been a single incident of a genome that doesn't fit neatly with this theory. 

For the cephalopods (like Octopus), [we have a lot of mitochondrial DNA data](https://academic.oup.com/zoolinnean/article/161/3/573/2732055) which has allowed us to develop a very accurate family tree. For example, we now know Octopuses are more closely related to [Vampire squid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire_squid) than other squids. There are hundreds of research articles like this, if even a single one uncovered anything that *hinted* at octopuses "not arising by Darwin's laws" it would be the biggest deal in science in over 300 years. The entire scientific community would erupt, biology departments at university would shatter, nobel prizes would be awarded, and we would have to rework 300 years of phylogeny, genetics, geology, and everything we know about the development of the entire planet.

<TEXT> Well, I just *did* get about a $1/hr raise, in my annual review at my job. I can't really compare how "easy" that was to saving $160 a month, which would in fact be quite easy. I could cut that out of my food budget at the drop of a hat. 

Another comparison: I'm at the point my youtube channels earn me about $160 a month. That's taken a hell of a lot more work than it would take to save $160 elsewhere, but is more fulling. 

Final thought: saving $160 a month in expenses is even better because it saves you $160 of already taxed money. Earning an extra $160 a month is reduced by taxes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's about personal identity. You need to get to the point where you identify as a person who doesn't eat sweets.

You rarely see vegetarians slip up and give in to meat cravings, have a small strip of beef jerky, and then binge on a Brazilian BBQ. Why? because it goes against the very core of how they identify themselves. They are simply not meat eaters.

To harvest this power, you must identify yourself as someone who simply doesn't eat sweets. I'm sort of new to this sugar free community, and I was never super addicted. But I spontaneously decided to give up all sweets in early February, and it's actually been really easy for me. Now, I only committed to doing it for 75 days, but now I *identify* as someone who doesn't eat sweets. I casually told my work colleagues this when they offered me donuts. My wife and friends all know it. "subject3993 is not eating any sweets". Even if they laugh and give me shit, they know i'm serious about it. 

I still eat fruit, and even allow sauces with sugar in them when I eat prepared food elsewhere. But It's been a hard, cold-turkey abstinence of true sweets. No cookies, cakes, brownies, soda, or candy at all. 

Make sure you have something that you CAN snack on in the cabinet. If your cabinet is the spawn of satan, and you are tempted to reach for the cookies, all you have to do is divert your hand to the left and grab the almonds. or open the fridge and grab the baby carrots. Keep a 24 pack of seltzer water cans in the fridge.  </TEXT>

I actually discovered minimalism through the [early retirement community](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/). Although having a boring corporate job isn't as glamorous as living a hardcore hobo minimalist lifestyle, it's allowed me to earn the big bucks while spending very little. Currently at a net worth of about $500k at age 30. I'm hoping it let's me retire for good and never have to work a day in my life again after age 36 or so.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Forgetting about FIRE, just from a basic personal finance standpoint you should absolutely put a stake in the ground that **we only go down to one income if that income can sustain our expenses and a minimum "normal" (non FIRE) savings rate of 10%**. And use the conservative minimum income. Do not assume the side business makes *any* profit until it is demonstrated for 12 months. 

I think the answer to this is to look for drastic expense-reducing options. Moving and halving your housing expenses, cutting vehicles, etc. etc.

Also **Why the Frick do you have outstanding credit card debt?** Please tell me this is at a 0% promotional rate. You realize that $15,000 of credit card debt at 20% APR costs you **$3,000 in interest a year**? There are a ton of options here that would be a million times better than maintaining high interest credit card debt:

1. Liquidate ETF to pay off CC debt
2. Draw down from emergency fund ("savings") to pay off CC debt
3. Take a home equity loan or HELOC at 5% to pay off CC debt

I don't say this to criticize you, but more to light a fire of motivation under your ass: You are *currently* at a mid level average /r/personalfinance situation, on track to maybe retire at 65 and maintain your current standard of living. Going down to 1 income with your current expenses is going to put you behind even the average American. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Great job! Congrats on the progress and experience. You are killing it and have made massive gains in a very short time, and are better off than 99% of your peers who were in the same situation as you a decade ago. So this is just a minor comment if you are looking for optimization (and a comment for other readers):

I picked a moderately aggressive approach with just mutual funds and have averaged 11.6% since 2009. I just look at Morningstar ratings and pick the best rated in each category. My strategy isnt rocket science.

~~Note that a flat stock index like that S P 500 has had an annualized return of over 15% in the same period. This mirrors [the research that has been confirmed again and again](https://institutional.vanguard.com:443/VGApp/iip/site/institutional/researchcommentary/article/InvResLowCostIndexInvesting): actively managed mutual funds do worse than passive funds, mostly because of the impact of expenses.~~

**EDIT:** I don't know what I was thinking when I wrote that, definitely comparing apples to oranges. Even I'm not 100% equities, not sure why I assumed op should use the s p500 as a bench mark.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Kitchen Stuff

There are many *many* kitchen gadgets that will save you time doing a very particular narrow task. spiral Apple peelers. electric water boilers. lemon zesters. Garlic presses. 

I'm very tempted to get these things all the time, because I value my time. But the problem is you don't make decisions in a vacuum. It's never just *Oh, this lemon zester is so small, and would be really handy. What's the big deal?*. It's more like *If I make this decision for the lemon zester, I know I will use the same logic for the panini press, the vacuum sealer, the egg boiler, etc.etc*. Stop the ball from rolling down the slippery slope. Do things like your grandparents did, with a set of sharp knives, some cookware, some measuring cups, and a mixer. Do it with the full knowledge and awareness that some cooking tasks will take a little longer, **but it's fucking worth it**.

<TEXT> i think you have a good question, you just asked it in a really derogatory way.

IMO it all depends on your definitions. Some people use of the word "spirituality" includes simple mindfulness meditation, without any assumption of supernatural phenomena or religion. Personally I don't like using the word spirituality for such things, because it's confusing. I'm a strict naturalist, so i don't call myself spiritual. But some do, and that's ok. I also have no clue who Shoeless Joe is, and he could very well espouse religious mumbo-jumbo, but you could ask the question nicely.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> "successful" is relative :-D

/u/8zach4 I've got two channels. One I started in summer 2016 for video games. Got lucky with a viral video in October 2017 and now have 1.7 million views an 9k subs. Currently it earns me about $150 a month from Adsense (but almost $700 in the peak month for the viral video)

The other channel started in 2014 and is mostly focused on personal finance tips and tricks. it's been a slow steady grind but I'm up to 1k subs and 400k views. it earns me $80 a month from AdSense and amazon referral links.

IMO, to be successful you have to have a perfect combination of charisma, videos few other people are offering, and luck. It's a saturated market, only the best will make it. Even where I'm at, it's all only earning me a couple grand a year.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> One of my favorite quotes by Ben Franklin:

There are two ways of being happy: We may either diminish our wants or augment our means (either will do, they result in the same); and it is for each man to decide for himself, and do that which happens to be the easiest. 

If you are idle or sick or poor, however hard it may be to diminish your wants, it will be harder to augment your means. 

If you are active and prosperous or young and in good health, it may be easier for you to augment your means than to diminish your wants. 

But if you are **wise**, you will do both at the same time, young or old, rich or poor, sick or well; and if you are **very wise** you will do both in such a way as to augment the general happiness of society. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I spent a lot of time messing around with spreadsheets a few years ago trying to calculate what my effective return on extra mortgage payments was given that I was paying PMI. The crazy thing is that it's not a flat rate. Let's say you have $30,000 left to go over 5 years before getting rid of PMI. If you just put $1,000 towards it, it might allow you to get rid of PMI in 78 months instead of 80 months. That's not a huge return.

But once you are a lot closer, (say, you only have 2 months left of PMI), you could put $1,000 down and instantly get rid of PMI. Paying $1,000 to save $360 in two months is over 100% annualized return!

So the math is complicated. But I can tell you this: Every dollar you put towards your mortgage while you have PMI has probably at minimum a 5%-6% annualized return, possibly much **much** more as you get closer. I would focus nearly all your surplus extra money on that.  </TEXT>

If you said, "The 7.62 is heavier than the 5.56 so it falls *more over a given distance* 

it would be correct. The problem is that the word faster implies the heaver round falls more in a given unit of time. It doesn't. But it does fall more for a given unit of horizontal distance. Sorry for being pedantic. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I always assumed sights were designed to appear as if the bullet was coming from the sight

They are, *at the correct range*. If firing at a target at 100 meters through a sight set for 100 meters. At other ranges though, it becomes offset. The extreme example is standing in front of a box. You can hold your rifle so that the barrel sticks directly into the box, while the sight clears the top of the box and is aiming at the target 100 m away. Now, if the box weren't there, you would hit your target. But at 6 inches away, obviously the sight and the barrel don't match up.

In real life this is obvious, but it's tricky in games because you have less Proprioception and sense of the position of your body and gun in the virtual environment. Different games handle this in different ways, some by making the bullet come out of your sight or your eyes, and others opting for frustrating realism that results in you mistakenly shooting boxes and railings right in front of you even thought your sight was on target </TEXT>

<TEXT> I haven't had a TV for 8 years. 

You know how phones and tablets have apps? You are probably aware that you can get Netflix apps, and HBO apps for phones and tablets to watch shows. Well, there are lots of devices that allow you to do the same thing with a TV. Amazon Firestick (like the Roku, which I use) is basically a small computer with WiFi and an HDMI-out port instead of a screen. So you plug them into an HDMI port on your TV, and you can access all the apps on them from your TV, including Netflix or whatever else you want. 

I'm very happy with my Roku.  </TEXT>

Last year I bought a *brand new* Moto G5 Plus for $179, and I am very happy with the decision. The tradeoff is that it has a worse camera, but faster / snappier operation (that's just anecdote, haven't actually compared processors). But I can't believe how cheap it was.

A common tactic that the scammers use once you give them remote control of your computer is to put a start-up password on your computer. This effectively locks you out of your computer, and they can then convince you to pay them to unlock it. 

This start-up password is called a "syskey". The streamer in one case actually successfully guessed the syskey password the scammers used to lock his computer.

NOTE: the streamer isn't actually allowing the scammer to take control of a "real" computer, it's what's called a "virtual machine", a simulation of a Windows operating system running inside another computer. </TEXT>

* Reduce food expenses
* cut HSA contributions
* consider moving to cheaper housing (Easier said than done in NYC i know)

I also wanted to say thanks for coming with such a well prepared post and concrete numbers! 

Although balance transfers to 0% cars would be a great tip, you must be introspective about your own willpower and psychology and the ability to handle additional credit. Your track record indicates this might not be wise, ask your girlfriend to give her honest assessment. 

Final tip, read about mindfulness and stoicism. It's amazing how much of a fulfilling life one can lead when they focus on fostering relationships with people, and exercising your body and mind. Give up video games, give up TV (at least for a while), go for walks, and eat healthy. You'll find you have more time to cook, and you'll be happier and probably richer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Unfortunately I can't really relate to a lot of the withdrawal stories on here. I'm a pretty healthy guy, good body weight and I exercise, but I ate a decent amount of sugar and would binge on sweets. I sort of randomly decided to try a 75 day sugar detox 40 days ago, and it's going really well. I haven't had a single sweet or sugary drink this whole time, and haven't had any negative mental effects. I was actually surprised at how easy it was:

Previously, someone would bring donuts into work. I'd think, *I know it's not healthy, but fuck it, I'm skinny and I went to the gym this morning* and I'd eat a donut. Then I'd be like *well I already had 1 donut, if it's gonna be an unhealthy morning for me, I might as well have another!*

Ever since I committed to no sugar, it's so much easier. I **identify** as someone who doesn't eat sugar. Someone brings in donuts? Oh, no thanks, I don't eat sweets. I don't have the internal struggle, the decision is already made. 

Although I have been very strict about sweets and sugary drinks, I haven't been able to fully give up sugar in cooking. I still occasionally have a BBQ sauce or a salad dressing with sugar in it, but I'm sure I've cut my sugar intake bu 80%+ </TEXT>

<TEXT> I heard that I need to diversify my portfolio

This advice is to diversify what stocks you own. You already do that by holding a *single* broad US index fund. 

 if one index funds get hit, that other index funds should be able to balance it out.

This doesn't even make sense, since VTSAX, VFFVX, and the 2060 funds effectively have the same underlying holdings. So if one "gets hit", (because we have a broad US stock price correction), they will **all** get hit. Now you are correct that VTIAX does give further diversification because now you hold an index fund of international equities. 

Just pick your target asset allocation (x% US stocks, y% international stocks, z% bonds), and attempt to meet that target with as few low cost index funds as possible. You could do this very well with *nothing* but a target date fund, or just with three funds: VTSAX, VTIAX, and VBTLX.

Have you ever looked at the underlying holdings of a target date fund such as VFFVX? It is literally just a fund of funds that holds various percentages in the other funds you already own.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm looking to book a property in Scotland this summer for a family vacation. I'm communicating with the host through the tripadvisor messaging platform. This property has 2 reviews, and the same host has another property with 30+ reviews. (posted by same trip advisor account)

In communication with the host, he requested payment of the deposit (half the booking price) via bank transfer. He has not asked us to sign a contract. None of trip advisor's payment protection policies will cover us unless paying through their system. 

I fully understand that this *could* be a scam, and that I would have no recourse to get my money back. It seems like for that to be the case, someone would have had to hacked his account, as it's a 6 year old account with good reviews. I'm trying to guage the *odds* that it's a scam. The communication I've had with him is similar in writing style to the review responses posted under his account.  After googling, it seems like Bank transfers are a very popular way to make payments in the UK. 

The bank account info he gave me is for a UK bank.

**EDIT:** we decided it wasn't worth the risk, especially since this was an international week rental for 10 people. We offered him an extra 20% if he sent us a quote through the tripadvisor payment system... *and he did it!* should have lowballed a bit more. Looks like this guy is legit, but im glad we will have the payment protection. </TEXT>

Fructose has been my main target. I think using the common term "sugar" does everyone a disservice: minor changes in molecular structure make all the difference for many substances, and lumping glucose and fructose together as a single substance (sugar) might be just as bad as using a single name for Adderall and Methamphetamine (differing only by a methyl group).

I'm curious to see more research on the ill effects of fructose. Just browsing the [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fructose) article, it appears that it's not attached to much research about insulin resistance or weight gain.  </TEXT>

Seems like yours is normal. echoing everyone else: interest rate shouldn't matter at all, because you should pay your statement balance in full every month, thus remaining in the grace period, thus never paying a dime in interest. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Money is fungible. I make $100k, my wife makes 46k, and we keep our spending below 65k per year. So we are living off less than half of our combined income. That's what matters. We don't intentionally ensure every single dollar my wife earns goes towards savings, that's crazy and doesn't even make technical sense since a dollar is a dollar is a dollar. 

I think you need to first step back and figure out your overall approach to money once you marry

1. The "default" is that the money you each earn is your own individual money, and goes into your separate accounts for spending as you please. You agree upon a defined amount that you both transfer to a joint account every month, from which you pay all joint expenses.
2. The "default" is that the money you each earn is your shared money, and goes into a single shared account. You may also agree on a set "allowance", that you transfer to your own private accounts each month, or just earmark in your joint account for personal spending.

We went with the latter approach. [I wrote it up here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4i68p8/my_experience_with_mad_money_a_flexible_way_to/) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, this issue really only came up for buying a house. Nearly every other expense imaginable, (including replacing cars, emergency flights for funerals, new HVAC system) I could fund by drawing down from my normal emergency fund (~$20-30k), then letting it build back up.

When I bought my house in 2013 I just put 5% down on a $263k house, so down payment and closing costs were  $20k. I simply borrowed 10k from my dad so I could keep some of my cushion, and paid that back to him within a year. Over the course of 2 years, I also made significant extra payments towards my mortgage so I had 80% LTV by 2.5 years of ownership, and refinanced to eliminate PMI.

So honestly I simply haven't ever had to deal with the question, and can't imagine a scenario in which I would. Sorry if that's not helpful, its quite possible the size of down payment you need is just way more than a normal emergency fund, but I thought i'd just share my experience. </TEXT>

Wasn't too bad, and this year I used [1040excel](https://sites.google.com/site/excel1040/home/download) to help do the math. Some fucking genius basically recreated the entire tax code in excel. it's amazing, and so much easier than commercial tax software. 

Despite my complexity, I'm only getting a $190 refund federal, I owe $130 state, and owe $22 local. Pretty much hit the bullseye. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is the main difference to consider, other than investment options:

If you take the money out of the plan to your Roth IRA, you can withdraw before you are 59-1/2. You may have to pay some tax on the withdrawal but at least you have that option. See Mega Backdoor Roth and Access To Your Money Before 59-1/2.

If you convert within the plan, the money is locked up until you reach 59-1/2, terminate employment, die, or become disabled. Of course if you leave your employer and you rollover the Roth 401k to a Roth IRA, you are able to withdraw before 59-1/2 again.

<TEXT> "Car Insurance" is not just a single product. 

It it's most basic, it could be one or more of the following lumped together:

**Liability Insurance**: What pays for damage to other people's cars and health if you hit them

**Collision:** what pays for repairs to your car if *you* fuck up and hit someone else's car or a pole

**Comprehensive:** What pays for repair or replacement if your car is stolen or damaged by fire, hail, etc. 

Only the first one is required. Each type of coverage will have their own deductible as well, and you can choose a higher deductible (which is basically less insurance, a lower monthly premium) but forces you to pay more out of pocket when you make a claim) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Have you ever seen those crazy pictures of people with 50 lb benign tumors? Over the course of the time they grew that tumor, let's say, 3 years, it would be absolutely technically correct to say "This person grew a 50 pound tumor because they ate more calories than they burned".

However, although it's correct, it's not *helpful*. Of course, if they simply at an average of 200 calories less every day for the past 3 years, they would have maintained their weight instead of gaining 50 lbs. They would still have grown a tumor, slightly smaller, but the tumor would have been sucking energy and calories the rest of the body would normally use, and they would have had low energy and loss body mass every where else in the body.

The fact of the matter is that since their body was shuffling so many calories towards tumor creation, they were hungrier and increased their overall food intake to make up for it.

This analogy is important, to consider the fact that the tumor is a result of some hormone signalling gone wrong. Their body was using a bunch of their calories to synthesize a massive amount of lipids, and shuffle them towards the tumor site. It's a hormonal issue. 

Like wise, it's quite possible that the massive consumption of fructose in obese communities in the US is causing a hormonal issue, of a different scale but similar result as a tumor. Their insulin levels and leptin levels are all out of whack, so when they eat a large portion of those calories are used for fat creation instead of energy. Then, they have low energy and are hungry, so they eat more. 

So yes, they are eating more calories than they need. But they do that because they are hungry, and they are hungry because their body is incorrectly signaling *store all these calories as fat!*, and it's doing *that* because they eat so much fucking Fructose! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think this is what he's saying: Building the habit of extra $500 in monthly expenses is setting that up as your lifestyle, and the assumption is that expense will continue in retirement.

You could double the number of mass shooting deaths, or half it, and it wouldn't have a noticeable impact on total homicides. Each one is absolutely horrific, and I don't meant to be trite.

<TEXT> I feel you, and I can't blame you for feeling this way. It's so shocking, random, and just downright *unfair*. However, our response is not entirely rational. 

We don't rationally prioritize our worries based on the true probabilities of bad things happening. You are much better off using that worry and anxiety every single time you sit behind the steering wheel of your car, since you are over 100 times more likely to die in a car accident than a school shooting. You ask all those "what if" questions from the feeling of helplessness. But you are equally helpless if a person runs a red light and T-bones you. 

This may not fully help, because we are emotional beings, but it helps me to understand little bit. Cheers, and thanks for training up the next generation.

<TEXT> Isn't this the sunk cost fallacy?

Just imagine you are an alien consciousness that has just today been immediately transposed into your human body, and your human situation. Your responsibility? To get as much well-being and happiness out of the next 60 years. What do you do?

(Hint: in this scenario, just like in real life, what the human host did before hand to get you to the current spot doesn't really matter. All that matters is making the best of where you are at today). 

Here's a question for you about your hikes. I want to hear about your mindset when you prospectively think forward towards the possibility about going on a hike, vs after you finish a hike and you think backwards. Here's what it's like for me:

**Thinking forwards, considering a solo-hike**: *Hmm. I wish I had someone to go with me. It would be good exercise, but I think it will be lonely. I guess I'd rather stay home. Plus, it's a 30-minute drive to get to the trail-head...*

**Looking backwards after just finishing a solo hike**: *Whew! That felt good. It was nice to get outside and get some exercise. It would have been nice to have a friend along, but do I regret going? Do I wish I had stayed at home? Absolutely not!*

So when you consider getting out of your comfort zone and doing things like going on a hike, going to the gym, etc, think of how *Future-You* will feel. Do it for them, even if *Present-You* doesn't feel like it. 

__________________________

I used hiking in these examples because the great thing about exercise is that it can literally change your mood. Changing your mood and becoming a happier person can lead to positive feedback loops all throughout your life. Get more friends, be more confident in your body, etc etc. I get a lot of motivation from the ["Exercise Out Of Depression" subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/EOOD/top/?sort=top t=all) even though I don't consider myself depressed at all. </TEXT>

___________

**Edit**: I'm going to use my soapbox to talk a bit more about a few of the replies claiming that you can identify patterns in the way the dealer rolls the ball or spins the wheel. I haven't studied this, but I don't think you realize that this system is a great example of [chaos theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory). Even tiny differences in the force to push the ball, or the force to spin the wheel (say, 0.01% difference) will result in *drastically* different end states of the system (which number the ball lands on). Especially when you take into account that there will be variation in *both* those aspects, *plus* the ability of the ball to hop around chaotically as the spinning slows. Likewise, the operator doesn't start the wheel at the same place every time. One commenter even claimed that identifying such pattens is "especially useful when casinos have a list of the 10 or 15 previous numbers that hit at each table."

**No it's not**. Even if what you say is true and there are subtle patterns, it would take thousands of trials before the subtle trends could be statistically distinguished from randomness.

I suggest everyone read up on both types of the [Gambler's Fallacy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749597884710752) .

**Type 1** is one most people think of: the mistaken belief that rolling a black is more likely after a long streak of reds. 

**Type 2** is a conclusion that you've identified a pattern or a trend in results, a biased wheel or operator, when in fact the results and any apparent trend are purely random.

Finally, you may be overlooking the fact that displaying the most recent results on a screen is an indication that the casino is tracking every single roll. I'll eat my shoe if the casinos aren't running algorithms on the results, and will immediately pull **any** operator or wheel from the floor that exhibits even a hint of non-randomness. Remember, *it is precisely the fact that the roulette wheel is a reliable random number generator* that the casino maintains it's edge which is worth hundreds of millions of dollars. </TEXT>

I mean, why not take it to the extreme? You could have just as easily spent $20k on a ring, taken out credit card debt for it, and be sitting here saying "*it was definitely worth it for the way it makes her feel. She probably catches a glimpse of the ring 100 times a day. She gets commented for it at least once a week and it makes her ecstatic every time.*"

How do we draw the line, except by actually considering the marginal utility each additional dollar gets us? (where marginal utility is defined as additional happiness provided by the extra dollar)

[There are very formal tests](https://www.1040.com/tax-guide/taxes-for-families/who-can-you-claim/) for *whether* you can be claimed as a dependent or not. You can read through these tests for yourself and determine whether you can be claimed as a dependent (in which case you can go ahead and file), or whether you can't be claimed as a dependent (in which case you can go ahead and file). You don't need to wait for anything.

That may not solve your immediate problem though. You need more money. You need to get a second job, get more hours, or work physical labor gigs that you might be able to find through craigslist. Also sell shit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm glad you are asking this now and not in two months! Sounds like you could use a little background info on how exactly taxes work, and what tax refunds are. I wrote this as a super basic introduction to US taxes, and it should help you ask more specific questions. 



#**How US taxes work**

In the US, we owe the government a certain amount of taxes, mostly based on the amount of income we make each year. Unfortunately, the tax we owe is also influenced  by many other things. For example, how many kids you have, whether you paid student loan interest, if you donated to charity, or if you stashed away any money for retirement.

Because it's so complicated, we have to calculate the tax we owe each year *ourselves* and *tell* the government how much it is. There's not really any other way it could be done: We are the only ones who have the full understanding of all of our financial situations. In order to do this, we fill out a *tax return*. It's a two page form called [form 1040](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040.pdf) where we spell out all of our details and calculate the amount of taxes we owe. 

However, the government realized that letting people wait until April of the following year to pay all of their taxes would be a *bad* idea. Many people spend all of their money as soon as they make it, so when tax time comes around many people would be unable to pay what they owe.

#**Tax Withholding**

Because waiting until the end of the year would result in all sorts of problems, the government decided it would be better to collect a bit of the tax we owe all throughout the year. They do this by requiring all employers to "withhold" taxes from everyone's paychecks. That way it never goes into our bank accounts, so we don't mistakenly spend it all before tax time. The important part to realize here is that the amount of taxes *withheld* by our employers is **only an estimate** of the actual tax we owe. Our employers only know some things about our financial situation. They know how much we make each month, and we tell them some basic facts on the paperwork you fill out when hired (Form W-4). But they don't know other things, like how much you contribute to an individual retirement account (IRA), whether you have a home loan, etc. In fact, some things that affect your taxes big-time *aren't even defined yet* at the time you get a paycheck in the middle of the year. If I get married on December 31st 2017, it affects how much tax I owe on the income I made throughout the **whole** year of 2017! So as you can see, there's no way this withholding performed by our employer can always be accurate.

That's why we have to "true-up" with the government in April of the following year. We fill out form 1040 with *all* of our details and determine how much tax we actually owe for the previous year. We also list down how much tax *we already paid* through the withholding on our paychecks. If we paid too much throughout the year from our paychecks, we get a **tax refund**. But if we paid too little throughout the year from our paychecks, we will owe the remaining balance. 

#**How to "do" your taxes**

Although the tax return form is only two pages (at most), any individual line on that form can have *many* pages of instructions on exactly how to figure out the number for that line, and in some cases you actually have to include attachment forms called "Schedules" that provide additional information on how you calculated your entry. This is where all the tax software comes in. Tax software acts as an "interpreting" layer between you and the raw 1040 form. It will ask questions in common English in a logical manner to understand your situation and basically fill out a 1040 form *for you*, and any attachments that it determines you need. See the [Tax Filing Software Megathread](https://redd.it/7r0tvv) for your options.

Hopefully this knowledge helps you better understand what goes on at tax time! It's very basic and glosses over many nuances and caveats, such as the treatment of "self-employment" income, which I did not cover. However it should give a baseline for you to ask further questions </TEXT>

<TEXT> This post includes a lot of incorrect assumptions about how taxes work. First of all, bonuses are *not* taxed more than regular income. They are simply have more taxes *withheld*.

<TEXT> So I did some digging. Vision care for my wife and I costs us **$345** per year. It covers an annual eye exam and one pair of reasonable glasses a year, with some small copays. 

But believe it or not, my employer-sponsored health insurance actually covers an eye exam once every 24 months. So my wife and I can just get an exam every *other* year for free (covered under healthcare plan), and buy cheap glasses online for like $30 when we need them. 

Am I missing anything here? Worst case I pay ~$110 out of pocket for an eye exam on the off years. Also, all eye-related emergency issues or injuries are covered by my health insurance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I recently upped mine to $10,000. My philosophy is only to insure the things that I cannot replace out of pocket. AKA have as little insurance as possible. Why? Because they wouldn't be selling me the insurance unless on average, they take in more money than they expect to have to pay me out in claims: enough surplus to pay for all their overhead and make a profit. I'd rather self insure.

It all comes down to what you can afford. Remember, it doesn't only matter in the case of a complete loss (house burns down). For me, if I have $7,000 of wind damage to my siding, I have to cover it entirely out of pocket because it's less than my deductible. That's a risk I happen to be willing to take.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You should never directly reference aspects of your personal budget in negotiations, including your commuting costs. The only appropriate way to bring that up would be to ask if they provide relocation assistance such as a moving stipend. It's possible that they offer this as a sign-up bonus which you could use or not use to move as you see fit. 

If you want to negotiate a salary raise, it must be based on your experience, the value you bring to the company over other candidates, etc. Or you can simply offer a "take-it-or-leave-it" such as *Thank you for the offer, however $45,000 is the minimum salary I can expect based on other opportunities*. You'd better be prepared for them to call your bluff and rescind the offer in the worst case though. You are right, you really *don't* have much leverage. Just accept the job, work hard for a year, then renegotiate.

<TEXT> Just to clarify, the tax reform applies to tax year 2018. Right now, you should be preparing to file you **2017** tax return, so the new law shouldn't impact what you claim on your 2017 return. However, You are correct to ask if it affects how you set up your tax withholding with your employers for 2018 through form W-4. It doesn't significantly affect it: Ideally, if the number of allowences and information you used on your W-4 for 2017 resulted in significant over-withholding, it probably will do the same thing for 2018.

I would recommend attempting to get your withholdings set correctly so you don't give the government such a large interest-free loan every year. There are two good ways to do this: Simply walk through the W-4 form line by line, including the "two-earners" worksheet if it applies to you.

Alternatively, you can use the [IRS Withholding Calculator](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/irs-withholding-calculator) once it becomes available in the next few weeks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Totally spit balling here, but my *guess* is that the only reason this matters for your actual tax return is to determine whether or not you are eligible to take a deduction for traditional IRA contributions. This deduction has an income limit *if you are covered by a retirement plan at work*

If you did not take this deduction (or would be eligible to take it anyways despite having a retirement plan at work), than this won't affect your tax return at all, and you wouldn't need to amend.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just remember there's an income limit for the ability to take the tIRA deduction. for 2017 it's a MAGI of $62,000. If you are maxing out your 401k, you should be nicely under that, just keep it in mind.

Also, when calculating your marginal tax bracket, don't forget the standard deduction. For 2018, it sounds like you will have $18,000 in 401k, and a $12,000 standard deduction. That means your taxable income is no more than $37,000, which is actually below the 22% bracket line.

If you actually are in the 12% bracket, I'd definitely go with Roth. in the 22% bracket, it's a bit of a coin flip. I wouldn't yell at you either way :-D

<TEXT> And people are surprised at how varied our political opinions can be. The people living in these two areas live *such* incredibly different lives, it's amazing that we are as similar as we are. This is a generalization, but **the people in the rural north-western area** are incredibly independent. They rely on small communities and deep close relationships with a few people. They live off the land, deal with wild animals, and have to repair their vehicles themselves. Trucks and firearms are some of their biggest tools. Firearm ownership is deeply ingrained in the culture, and is one of the primary tools for sustaining life as they know it, for food, recreation, protection (of property, family, and pets) from wild animals, and dealing with pests. Meanwhile, **the people in New York** are almost like sub-components of a massive super-organism: *the city*. they run into and interact with a thousand times as many other people each day than the first group. Their primary tools are the arteries of trains, elevators, and sidewalks. Cell phones, laptops, the internet, taxis and Ubers. 

No wonder our opinions on taxes are different. The latter group relies on an incredibly expensive public infrastructure paid for by taxes. The former uses barely any public services other than county roads. No wonder our opinions on guns are different. No wonder our opinions on regulation of financial transactions are different.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok well you didn't do anything actually **wrong** and won't owe any penalties or fees. However I think some of your assumptions were incorrect, and you didn't do things optimally

We wanted to be taxed at withdrawal with the lower rate, not as we were putting it in.

Unfortunately, you *were* taxed as you were putting it in, since you didn't get to deduct the value of your contributions. traditional IRA contributions are only "tax deferred" if you get to take the deduction for them. You paid income tax on all your money, including that which you contributed to the IRA. If you left the money in there until retirement, you would also then be taxed on the earnings at that time.

Ideally you would have immediately converted from your non-deductible tIRA to Roth IRA each year you made the contribution (this is the so called "backdoor Roth contribution), because once the money is in Roth, it grows entirely tax free.

As for form 8606: you probably should have been filling out each year, just to record your non-deductible contributions. double check your past year returns to see if your tax software may have done this for you. It's important to keep track of your basis (the portion you've already been taxed on) in your IRAs so they aren't taxed again when you withdraw or convert to Roth, that's why you fill out form 8606. 

Unfortunately I can't advise what do to if you mistakenly never did this. I would probably just go through my old records and find my total basis and include it this year. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think we need some more details. First, a parent plus loan is always in the parent's name. I highly doubt it is actually in your wife's name. 

Second, the answer also depends on the details of how FIL "tied it in" with his mortgage. Here's my guess what happened:

FIL had a mortgage and a parent plus loan in his name. At some point, he "re-financed his house", meaning he took out a NEW loan, paying off the old loan in the process. It sounds like in this case, he probably paid off in entirety both the old mortgage *and* the parent plus loan. The parent plus loan wouldn't even exist any more, it's paid off. And now dad is just left with a bigger mortgage.

You need to get these details ironed out. Whose name is/was the parent plus loan in, and does it even still exist?

Based on my assumptions, I don't think the interest is going to be deductible. How would you even calculate how much of the $600 is interest? </TEXT>

In the US, we owe the government a certain amount of taxes, mostly based on the amount of income we make each year. Unfortunately, the tax we owe is also influenced by many other things. For example, how many kids you have, whether you paid student loan interest, if you donated to charity, or if you stashed away any money for retirement.

Because it's so complicated, we have to calculate the tax we owe each year *ourselves* and *tell* the government how much it is. There's not really any other way it could be done: We are the only ones who have the full understanding of all of our financial situations. In order to do this, we fill out a *tax return*. It's a two page form called [form 1040](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040.pdf) where we spell out all of our details and calculate the amount of taxes we owe. 

However, the government realized that letting people wait until April of the following year to pay all of their taxes would be a *bad* idea. Many people spend all of their money as soon as they make it, so when tax time comes around many people would be unable to pay what they owe.

#**Tax Withholding**

Because waiting until the end of the year would result in all sorts of problems, the government decided it would be better to collect a bit of the tax we owe all throughout the year. They do this by requiring all employers to "withhold" taxes from everyone's paychecks. That way it never goes into our bank accounts, so we don't mistakenly spend it all before tax time. The important part to realize here is that the amount of taxes *withheld* by our employers is **only an estimate** of the actual tax we owe. Our employers only know some things about our financial situation. They know how much we make each month, and we tell them some basic facts on the paperwork you fill out when hired (Form W-4). But they don't know other things, like how much you contribute to an individual retirement account (IRA), whether you have a home loan, etc. In fact, some things that affect your taxes big-time *aren't even defined yet* at the time you get a paycheck in the middle of the year. If I get married on December 31st 2017, it affects how much tax I owe on the income I made throughout the **whole** year of 2017! So as you can see, there's no way this withholding performed by our employer can always be accurate.

That's why we have to "true-up" with the government in April of the following year. We fill out form 1040 with *all* of our details and determine how much tax we actually owe for the previous year. We also list down how much tax *we already paid* through the withholding on our paychecks. If we paid too much throughout the year from our paychecks, we get a **tax refund**. But if we paid too little throughout the year from our paychecks, we will owe the remaining balance. 

#**How to "do" your taxes**

Although the tax return form is only two pages (at most), any individual line on that form can have *many* pages of instructions on exactly how to figure out the number for that line, and in some cases you actually have to include attachment forms called "Schedules" that provide additional information on how you calculated your entry. This is where all the tax software comes in. Tax software acts as an "interpreting" layer between you and the raw 1040 form. It will ask questions in common English in a logical manner to understand your situation and basically fill out a 1040 form *for you*, and any attachments that it determines you need. See the [Tax Filing Software Megathread](https://redd.it/7r0tvv) for your options.

Hopefully this knowledge helps you better understand what goes on at tax time! It's very basic and glosses over many nuances and caveats, such as the treatment of "self-employment" income, which I did not cover. However it should give a baseline for you to ask further questions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Target Date funds are great because they give you the ultimate in diversification all in a single fund, and the Vanguard ones have extremely low fees, similar to what you would get if you tried to achieve the same diversification by picking multiple funds yourself.

Do they have one for each year?

They usually have one for every 5 years, but even that doesn't really matter. Until you get to within 15 years of retirement, they are basically all the same. The target date 2065 fund has the same asset allocation as the target date 2060 fund.

How much should i be putting in per month to live comfortably, at retirement ill be making $120K-$140K.

15% of your income.

I'd recommend doing your investing within your 401k if you have one and within an IRA or Roth IRA before just going with a normal brokerage account. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm going to give you a super basic starting point that will probably help you better understand things that you read later. Often it's not presented this way, but I think it's the simplest way to give a good foundation.

#**How US taxes work**

In the US, we owe Uncle Sam a certain amount of taxes based on the income we make each year. Unfortunately, the amount of tax we owe is calculated based on a lot of different factors. Not only how much money you made, but also things like how many kids you have, whether you paid student loan interest, and if you stashed away any money for retirement.

Because it's so complicated, *we* have to calculate the tax we owe each year and *tell* the government how much it is. There's not really any other way it could be done: We are the only ones who have the full understanding of all of our financial situations. In order to do this, we fill out a *tax return*. It's a two page form called [form 1040](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040.pdf) where we spell out all of our details, and using that form calculate the amount of taxes we owe. 

However, the government realized that letting people wait until April of the next year to pay all of their taxes would be a *bad* idea. Many people spend all of their money as soon as they make it, so when tax time comes around they would have to deal with lots of people being completely unable to pay their taxes. 

#**Tax Withholding**

Because waiting til the end of the year would result in all sorts of problems, the government decided it would be better to collect a bit of the tax we owe all throughout the year. They do this by requiring all employers to "withhold" taxes from everyone's paychecks. That way it never goes into our bank accounts, so we don't mistakenly spend it all before tax time. The important part to realize here is that the amount of taxes *withheld* by our employers is **only an estimate**. Our employers know *some* things about our financial situation. They know how much we make each month, and we tell them some basic facts on the paperwork you fill out when hired (Form W-4). But they certainly don't know other things, like how much you contribute to retirement accounts, whether you have a home loan, etc. In fact, some things that affect your taxes big-time *aren't even defined yet*. If I get married on December 31st 2017, it affects how much tax I owe on the income I made throughout the **whole** year of 2017! So as you can see, there's no way this withholding performed by our employer can hope to be exactly accurate.

That's why we still have to "true-up" with the government in April of the following year. We fill out form 1040 with *all* of our details and determine how much tax we owe. We also list down how much tax *we already paid* through the withholding on our paychecks. If we paid too much throughout the year from our paychecks, we get a **tax refund**.

For example, there's one line on form 1040 that asks for your self employment income. But the government wants to see how you calculated that income, so you have to describe it in more detail on Schedule C. 

This is where all the tax software comes in. Tax software acts as an "interpreting" layer between you and the raw 1040 form. It will ask questions in common English in a logical manner to understand your situation and basically fill out a 1040 form *for you*, and any attachments that it determines you need.

<TEXT>  I want to get myself a nice car when I get home without blowing most of that money.

If you don't want to blow most of that money, that means you want to keep at least $15k. So you have $15k to play with. You are also $5k underwater on a current car, if it were me I would at *least* want to get neutral on that loan. So I'd be looking for private party sales (craigslist) around $10k of 3-8 year old fun cars. Here's some specific examples in my area that would be good:

* stick shift Scion FRS premium with 70k miles for $8,500.
* 2010 BMW 328i 3L engine w/ 49k miles for $9,990
* 2014 VW Jetta for $8,200
* 2011 Scion TC stickshift for $6,900
* 2011 BMW 328i wagon for $9,400
* 2012 Dodge Charger for $8,000

etc. etc.

Buy one with cash.

EDIT: Not sure why I interpreted that you wanted a "fun" car, you just said "nice". There will be hundred of similar cars that are extremely reliable in the same price range, Toyotas, Hondas, Nissans, etc etc. </TEXT>

Even if you average 5% returns over the long term, if you have a couple of *down* years right after you retire, it could destroy your chances. That's why the 4% rule is more conservative, it accounts even for retiring right before a dip. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I also like using Mint and using my credit cards daily for all purchases. I just have my credit cards set up for monthly autopay on the due date. I don't quite understand why you are concerned with letting the balance build up *as long as you pay the full statement balance by the due date*. This strategy is the most simple, saves the most time, and still results in $0 in interest ever. 

With mint, you "count" the expenses when you charge them to your card. These are the transactions that get categorized. When you pay off the credit card bill monthly, that's just a "transfer" in Mint. 

This strategy gives you full accounting of all your expenses, on the day you actually made your purchases, and doesn't double count anything. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The whole reason we get tax forms from our lenders is because mortgage *interest* is tax deductible (and PMI may be too? I forget).

You'll get form 1098 from your lender. You'll probably get one for 2017, but it will probably list $0 as the amount of mortgage interest paid, unless you also paid "points" on your loan to get a lower interest rate when you closed (which is basically pre-paid mortgage). 

But remember, mortgage interest is an *itemized* deduction. If you don't have enough itemized deductions in a year to exceed the standard deduction, you can ignore them all together. Since you bought so late in the year, you will probably have very little mortgage interest paid. Additionally, at closing, you probably paid a small amount of property taxes for the pro-rated portion of the 2017 year that you owned the house. This amount of property taxes is also an itemized deduction, but again might not get you above the standard deduction. I don't believe you get a form for this, you would need to determine it from your closing documentation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Although this is true, I think it can lead people into a mental trap.

I'd rather pay $8k cash for a used car than borrow $20k at 2.74% just because I can leverage that money into the stock market.

That leverage only pays off if your two scenarios are borrowing vs not borrowing *on the same total price*. The trap is due to the fact that you forget that it usually leads to buying a more expensive car.

<TEXT> Hey I know it's a late reply, but figured I'd pitch in. I have mostly solved this in my life by simply being introspective about what makes me happy. By thinking of the happiness of "Future me" instead of just "present me". By thinking:

*How would I feel right now if I wasted less money over the past year and exercised more? I'd be pretty fucking happy. Well "Future-Me", 1 year from now looking back, would feel the same thing. So maybe I'll give Future-Me a present and actually get my shit together*

I still binge, but I'd say I binge more wisely. Does spending $400 at clubs with friends make me any *happier* than spending $10 on well whiskey and hosting a house party? Nope, at least not 4 times as happy, but it costs 4 times as much.  Just be smart about how you spend your money to get the most happiness per dollar.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The biggest and most important hint which is 90% of the key to retiring earlier is to **increase your savings rate** by earning more *or spending less*.

Investment strategies (AKA what you *do* with that surplus income) are the remaining 10%. But maxing out how *much* surplus income you have is by far the most important, and is probably where you should focus. 

Do not own a home, rent an apartment. Should I look to purchase a home so that I save on rent?

In general, this isn't a major factor in reaching FI, it's a minor thing, and depends a lot on the market in your location. There's no definitive rule like "buying a home will always get you to FI faster than renting".

The absolute biggest things you can do are things like:

* reducing your transportation expenses (sell your new cars, buy used cars, bike more, eliminate one car if possible. Move closer to work.)
* Reduce living expenses (downsize home / apartment. Embrace /r/minimalism)
* Spend less on clothes, entertainment. Foster more frugal hobbies that bring you just as much happiness, but cost less. 
* Spend less on food. Many families could easily go from $1,000 per month to $400 per month in food with just a bit of planning.

What's so powerful about these tricks is that they not only increase your surplus income (and thus your savings rate), but they *also* decrease the expenses, the lifestyle you are used to, and thus decrease the expenses you need to plan for in retirement.

The other powerful thing would be to look at options for work for your spouse. But be very careful, if this means putting kids in daycare it might cost more than it gains. Consider in-home nannying, etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Percentage is not a good way to normalize your asset allocation, as people with different net worths should have drastically different percentages allocated to savings.

Someone worth 2 million dollars might quite reasonably have only $30k in cash. That's only **1.5%** allocation to savings accounts. Likewise, It might be quite reasonable for someone worth $40,000 to have $20,000 in cash. That's **50%**. Simply comparing percentages is almost worthless. 

Cash is more typically a constant number, a savings buffer that you maintain, above which you dump all surplus into investments. So as you gain net worth, the percentage of your net worth that is in cash savings will go down and down. Of course this is just the typical approach of a "boglehead" investor who isn't trying to time the market. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You are taking all of your money out of a taxable account that is now taxed at LTCG. 

Remember, only the **gains** are taxed. You won't be taxed on the total amount of your withdrawal. Depending on how early you retire, a significant portion of your withdrawal might just be withdrawal of your basis (what you contributed) and isn't taxed at all.

Are LTCG only taxed at federal levels? Not state or city? 

Most states that have an income tax also tax capital gains as regular income, regardless of LT or not. Some states don't have income tax at all. 

I don't believe most local cities tax gains.

Does this mean you now get taxed on ordinary income for $37,400 for the year due to the marriage deduction? Do you pay state/city/federal/FICA taxes based on the ordinary income of $37,400 and the $120k in LTCG does not factor into all these non-LTCG taxes?

Basically the regular income starts filling up the tax brackets first. So we would deal with the capital gains later. For 2017 tax year, you would start by "filling up" the $12,600 standard deduction with the first $12,600 of earned income from your part time job. Then you also get two personal exemptions, worth $4,050 X 2. Fill that space up with earned income. That's $20,700 that's taxed at 0%. Then the rest of that earned income fills up the 10% tax bracket (about $10k), and is taxed at 10%, and *part* of the 15% tax bracket (about $20k)

**Now** you consider the capital gains. Let's say you withdraw $120k from your brokerage account, of which half is gains, half is basis. So you have $60k LTCG. You still have a lot of space left in the 15% normal tax bracket, which is a 0% LTCG tax bracket. So most of that 60k (enough to top off this bracket) is taxed at 0%. Any that goes over the top will now be taxed. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Do previous years unfiled taxes have any impact on 2017 tax return? </TITLE>

<TEXT> I have a friend who hasn't filed taxes in a few years. The longer she waits, the more overwhelming it is, so there is a tendency to just ignore these things. To reduce the mental burden, I think it will be easiest to convince her to just file 2017 taxes since she has all the forms readily available. 

However, she didn't file 2016 taxes and probably owes a balance (she had two jobs and probably wasn't withholding enough).

As far as I can tell, 2016 taxes shouldn't have any impact on her 2017 taxes. Can you confirm that? I know ideally we would file previous years first, but are there any logistical issues with going ahead and filing an accurate and complete 2017 return on time, and worrying about previous years after that? (Other than the obvious fact that the longer we wait, the more the fee will be). I'd be worried about something like payments of previous years taxes affecting taxable income in *this* year, but that doesn't appear to be the case.

Thanks in advance for feedback.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Congress explicitly "blesses" the Backdoor Roth Conversion </TITLE>
<DATE> 2018-01-19 16:28:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Though not part of the law itself, the conference committee's explanatory statement of the law explicitly blesses a popular technique that some had questioned, namely, the "back-door Roth contribution."

[...]

Some had questioned the legality of such an indirect Roth IRA contribution, saying it might be illegal under the "step transaction doctrine." The conference committee definitively answers that question: Back-door Roth contributions are legal. The explanatory statement states (four times!) that an individual who is legally permitted to contribute to a traditional IRA can contribute to a traditional IRA then convert the account to a Roth--under the prior law and the new one. This should put an end to skepticism about back-door Roth contributions.

[Morningstar Article](http://news.morningstar.com/articlenet/article.aspx?id=843356)

This article also describes some changes to the rules allowing IRA recharacterizations:

Throughout the 20-year existence of Roth IRAs, the Roth converter has been granted a unique privilege--the option to change his mind and reverse the conversion, right up until the extended due date of his tax return for the conversion year. (This was only for conversions to Roth IRAs; "in-plan conversions" have never been reversible.) The new tax law eliminates this right. For Roth IRA conversions in 2018 and later, there will be no option to recharacterize the conversion; all Roth conversions will be irrevocable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'll tell you my story, which I don't regret, and maybe you will find it valuable.

I bought my house 5 years ago when I was 24. Purchase price was $263k, I put 5% down with a conventional loan. I brought $15,500 to closing (down payment plus closing costs minus seller assist). It's a middle unit town home built in 2000. I went from paying $1,000 renting a big 1BR apartment to $1,550 (includes $121 in PMI, plus taxes and insurance). Obviously financially this might not have been the best decision, but some of that extra money was going to drastically improving my quality of life. I'd probably have been happy with that decision even if the story ended there. But it doesn't!

For the next three years, I rented out my two spare bedrooms to friends. ~$650 per month. I shared the whole house with these people. Finished basement, and we all had our PCs in the basement. It was like a big community home. It was fun, even though I'm introverted. I earned over $40,000 in rental income over these three years, and paid down my mortgage to eliminate PMI within two years. I'd say the biggest key to my happiness with this plan is my selection of roommates. They always say that you shouldn't rent to friends, but I think it was the best decision I've made.

Once you have a mortgage with PMI, making extra payments to your mortgage is one of the highest ROI investments you can make.

<TEXT> The share price of these funds is *entirely* arbitrary, and completely uncorrelated with any growth or potential for growth. The growth depends entirely on what the underlying holdings do. do not make any decisions based on the share price, only on the asset allocation of the underlying holdings.

**Think about it this way.** 

I create a mutual fund worth a billion dollars, meaning the fund holds a billion dollars worth of underlying stocks and bonds. I could *chose* to split up my fund into a billion shares and issue them all to investors, in which case each share will automatically have a market value $1. I could instead chose to split up my fund into only a million shares, issuing those to investors, in which case each share will automatically have a market value of $1,000.

The former case has no more opportunity for growth than the latter case. The share price of $1,000 doesn't make it "more expensive" than the share price of $1. </TEXT>

My guess is that with just her income in retirement you will still be in a pretty low tax bracket, and the conversions will still be nice. Even if we still have the 2018 tax brackets after you retire, you could make $77,400 + $24,000 standard deduction + [any traditional retirement contribution your wife makes] and still be in the 12% marginal bracket. 

Can you do the mega backdoor roth with your current company? That's actually where we are at now.

$5,500 X 2 in Roth IRA  
$18,500 X 2 in pre-tax 401k / 403b  
$10,000 in Roth IRA via my mega backdoor Roth rollover. 

This is a good mix of both tax treatments that will give me ultimate flexibility in retirement. </TEXT>

I don't understand why this is any more a concern with your after-tax 401k than with any of your other investments. There's nothing special about this money, nor when it rolls over into the Roth, that makes losses here any worse than any other investment losses.

You should invest it according to your same asset allocation you have for the rest of your investments IMO. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Predicting the price movements of the new Desparado Crate Items </TITLE>
<DATE> 2018-01-16 15:18:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi everyone! I was lucky enough to open a [Black Leather Hoodie](https://skin-tracker.com/pubg/skin?id=156) yesterday. However, it's not tradable or marketable for 7 days. Apparently this limit is imposed based on the age of the **key** you use to open the crate. Since I bought a brand new key to open the Desparado crate, I have to wait seven days. If I had instead bought an older key on the marketplace that had "matured", I would have to wait much less, or even be able to sell immediately.

From a supply/demand standpoint, I think this is creating a very tight artificial restriction of the supply of these items on the market. Currently they sell for $1000+ on steam, or $700+ on real money markets. But I usually see at least one person in every game lobby with one of these skins. I'm skeptical that anything *close* to this price can be maintained once the marketplace is flooded with all the people selling the ones they opened the past few days.

Does that make sense? Will the price plummet at first as people sell their items, then gradually go back up? Or will it just plummet and stay down? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Navy Federal is a Credit Union. Many Banks and Credit Unions offer IRAs, but their investment options within the IRA are extremely limited, often limited to only "savings" and "Certificates of Deposit" that earn very minimal interest and low risk. 

Ideally, you invest the money in your IRA into a broadly diversified mixture of stocks using mutual funds or ETFs. Usually you need to have your IRA at an *investment compant* not a *bank or credit union* to get these options. If Navy Federal doesn't offer mutual funds in their IRA, you should open a new IRA at Fidelity, Schwab, or Vanguard and transfer your money there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Anecdote: Wife and I planned to get married in 2015. However, in 2014, we realized that getting married in 2014 (courthouse marriage) would save us a combined $3.5k in tax liability for the year. (She was a college student, I was earning in the 25% tax bracket). 

After much discussion we decided not to do it, we felt that it would disappoint her family and that was reason enough for us not to do it. Anyways, the point is depending on your circumstances, 1 MFJ tax return can be very different than two Single tax returns.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> We have $500k in tax sheltered accounts

we only have $80k in our Roths, so that a conversion ladder won't cover it.

This almost sounds like you don't quite understand the conversion ladder. You use money in your **traditional pre-tax** accounts to do a conversion ladder.

Starting in 2023, convert $100k from traditional to Roth. That will be money you can withdraw from the Roth in 2028 years tax and penalty free. 

Do the same conversion in 2024. That's money you can withdraw in 2029. 

And so on.

<TEXT> It's a tough decision. You are tying to decide between lump sum investing (max the IRA this month) or dollar cost averaging (putting a bit in on a regular basis to max it out by the end of the year). The science says that lump sum investing is better than DCA *on average*

The questions therefore are:

1. Are you smart enough to have a better than random guess about 2018 being better or worse than an average year? (probably not)
2. Are you in a position where you are willing to sacrifice some expected value for some improved stability. E.g. Dollar cost average in to reduce risk even though you know lump sum is better than average.

If $5,500 is less than 20% of your total invested assets, I'd probably just lump sum it. If it's more than that, I'd DCA to reduce risk.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I hear there is a difference between "taxed" and "withheld" but I'm not grasping. Any help?

You know how everyone files a tax return in April? And lots of people get a tax *refund*?

That's because we have *estimates* of our expected taxes withheld from each paycheck, but we don't actually figure our exact tax due for the year until the following year. Many people have their withholding set up to have too *much* withheld from their paychecks.

Say they had $4,000 withheld throughout the year, but at tax time they determine they only owe $3,500 for the year. They would get a $500 tax refund. 

It just so happens that this whole approach of "estimation" doesn't work well for bonuses, because they aren't regular pay. So they over-estimate, and withhold too much. But that's ok, you will get the difference (between the amount that should really have been withheld for taxes and the amount that was actually withheld) back when you file your tax return. </TEXT>

Maybe /u/MuricasMostWanted would enjoy his money MORE and get MORE happiness out of life if he and his wife only spend $400 a month on groceries and liquor at home, cooked together, and spend the other $700 each month on snowboarding. Or weekend get-away trips around the country. Or going to music festivals, *or* saving it and retiring early. 

If you just ignore what you are currently spending money on and don't stop to think about what you *could* be spending your money on (or saving it fore) because "meh, I like eating out and going to bars", then you may be robbing future-you of more happiness. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My Business ventures:

1. I have a video game and vlogging youtube channel that made $1,000 in 2017. (AdSense revenue)
2. I have an educational youtube channel focused on DIY tips and personal finance tips that made $500. (AdSense and Amazon Associates Referral revenue)
3. Recently I've tried to branch out and leverage channel #2 into a tutoring and life-coach style website. (no revenue yet, but some minor web hosting expenses).

I could see lumping items 1 and 2 under a single business (both youtube channels), and I could see lumping items 2 and 3 under a single business (self improvement coaching), but can all 3 be under the same business?

I mainly ask for the convenience of filing a single schedule C, ~~and the ability to deduct expenses from one (#3) against income of the others.~~ (edit: I realize now that even as it's own business with it's own schd. C I could still take the loss for #3 since it is a legitimate business)

I also would like to start more seriously separating the business financials from my personal financials, e.g. getting a business paypal account, email, and maybe adsense. Can I use the same paypal for all three business activities? Currently I use a single Adsense account tied to my personal email account for both youtube channels. 

Does branding matter? Currently, Youtube channel #2 and the website for my tutoring business share branding. But youtube channel #1 doesn't share any branding (although I do actually use an email address with a domain name branded like channel #2, which I started first!)

I am not incorporated in any way.  </TEXT>

My biggest concern is the house, making sure my wife would not get kicked out if I die. Is writing a will the best thing to do? Or simply getting her added to the title? 

For what other reasons would I need a will?

EDIT: apparently in Pennsylvania, if I die without a will but am survived by my spouse and one or more of my parents, according to "intestate succession", my parents will actually get a portion of my estate. That's annoying, probably enough reason for me to get a will.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys, I follow a dude named sprEEEzy who streams PUBG on both Twitch and Youtube simultaneously. In fact I believe he also streams on multiple other platforms including Facebook Live. I assume he is using a restreaming service.

Although I normally watch him on youtube (720p60fps), he has stated that the quality is better on Twitch. I have confirmed that is indeed so (also listed as 72060fps). And it seems to be better on Facebook live as well.

Is Youtube doing additional compression on their end? What explains this quality difference? I only stream to Youtube because my community is much larger there and there is not cap on the bitrate I can send them, but if there's someway to get better quality on twitch, even despite the input bandwidth cap and not being partnered, I might consider switching.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Noob Question: Best Low-cost Bearish Bet against TSLA? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi guys. New to options here. What's the best way to make a small bet that the Price of TSLA goes down by next spring, with a limit on the downside? I was thinking of buying a naked put, but most reasonable strike prices would cost me $2,500 for one contract. I'd love a way to just bet about $1,000. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Do actuarial tables used for figuring corporate pensions factor in life expectancy differences for men vs women? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-10-26 03:47:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Traditional pensions list your benefit as a monthly annuity payment, payable from your benefit commencement date until death. If you were to take a lump sum distribution instead, they use actuarial tables and math to figure the present day value of the benefit and pay it out to you all at once in cash.

If a woman and a man both have the same defined benefit (annuity), will the equivalent lump sum figured for the two of them be different because men statistically have a lower life expectancy?

<TEXT> Check out the [watch time and traffic source stats from one of my recent videos](https://i.imgur.com/kYk4HUS.png)

As you can see, I have an early small spike from posting the video to a relevant subreddit. All that watch time is green, representing traffic from an external source (my reddit post). 

After a very quiet month, the video has just absolutely exploded (relative to my normal views!), and you can see that the traffic is all from "Suggested Videos" and "Browse Features".

It's not like I got lucky and somehow my video got linked on a popular external page. For some reason Youtube just moved my video *way* up in it's rankings for suggesting it and having it appear in search.

Has anyone else seen similar trends? What could cause this? I didn't change tags or edit the video at all at the beginning of this spike. Apparently my video now shows up as the third video or so when searching for "PUBG Looting Guide". But how did it get there?

Update: On the very day my spike started, an extremely popular youtuber published a video on a similar subject with similar tags, and my video is appearing on the suggested videos when his video is complete. So I'm getting a *lot* of traffic from him </TEXT>

<TEXT> Noob to wordpress and web hosting in general. I have a new wordpress site with a theme (Avenue) that [looks like this](https://i.imgur.com/EcVyHLR.png).

All of the modifications to the starting theme I've done through the `Appearance  Theme Options` menu in my wordpress dashbaord, but now I'm at the limit of my knowledge for how to make further modifications. I have two questions, a specific one and a general one. 

1. I'd like to modify that top header in the image above. How would I delete it? How would I go about removing some of the social media icons, but not others?

2. My struggle with question #1 is rooted more deeply in a lack of understanding about how all this works. Is that header something defined by my theme? or wordpress in general? The image files for those icons (the social media ones) appear to be stored in some folder for a plug in: `/public_html/wp/wp-content/plugins/our-team-enhanced/assets/images/social/email.png`. What is calling those images up? Is that a css file I can edit?

For #2, feel free to point me to a good tutorial or guide if you know of one. Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I hate to say it, but when I first discovered Sam's podcast I just truly didn't have the attention span to sit there and listen to these long episodes. Then I discovered a podcast app (Pocket Casts) that lets me adjust the playback speed. I started listening at 1.3x, then 1.5x, now I regularly listen to all my podcasts at 1.7x speed. (That takes a 2 hour podcast to 70  minutes)

It also has a "Trim Silence" option, but I find that is unnecessary with the faster speeds.

It's also an amazing tool for Dan Carlin's Hardcore History podcasts which often exceed 3 hours in length.

Also, there are audio book players that do the same thing, such as "Smart AudioBook Player" in the Google Play store.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> A detailed look at my $1,500 side hustle: Youtube videos (and ebay flipping?) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-09-06 17:36:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey everyone! Just because I'm bored at work and I know how much you all love data, I figured I'd throw some stats out there about my side hustle. It basically has three components

1. My How-to / Personal Finance Tips Youtube Channel
2. My gaming vlogging youtube channel
3. Flipping on Ebay

I'm on track to earn ~$1,500 or so in 2017. Mentally I kind of compartmentalize it like my /r/churning efforts, and together they probably increase my savings rate by 5% or so, which is nothing to scoff at (can mean FIRE over a year earlier than doing neither). it's fun and rewarding, and has the potential for significant growth if I put a bit of work in. 

**How-to Youtube Channel**  
[Here's my monthly AdSense revenue from the How-to / Personal Finance Tips Youtube Channel](https://i.imgur.com/ysbukVQ.png). I am currently getting about 16,000 views per month, 42,000 minutes watched each month. Less than 600 subscribers. I believe because of the subject matter (credit cards, car repair, etc) I probably get above average ad rates. My success started off with a how-to video for a minor DIY car repair that is now the #1 video search result on Youtube *or* Google whenever this specific issue is searched (it's a common issue for a popular car model). My other successful videos include

* Replacing speakers in a specific car model
* How to put together a specific model of motorized sit / stand desk
* How the credit card billing cycle and grace period work
* How credit card interest works

Additionally, each of my "DIY" videos have amazon associates links (referral links) in the video description. Basically in order to do the projects I'm showing, you need specific parts. I actually make more money of these referral purchases than ads on the DIY videos themselves. [Here's my monthly revenue from Amazon referrals](http://i.imgur.com/ZZAgXWF.png)

**Gaming / Vlogging Youtube Channel**  
[Here's my monthly AdSense revenue from the gaming vlogging channel.](https://i.imgur.com/R2a4yji.png) Last fall I got lucky with a tutorial video for a game that is currently sitting at 56,000 views. I have about 1,200 subscribers. As you can see I made over $70 in one month, but I'm currently averaging around $8 a month. I've started streaming gameplay on this channel, we'll see how that turns out. 

**Ebay Flipping**  
This has literally only been one item, a gaming PC a friend bought but decided he didn't want, and didn't want to bother with selling / shipping himself. I sold the PC and peripherals seperately. 

[Financial Summary](http://i.imgur.com/XdTAVlb.png)

Net profit: $182

I fucked up a bit here ($51 to ship the monitor...), but my major takeaway is that ebay "final value" fees really fuck you, almost halving your margin. And they are insidious because they aren't charged immediately when the sale is made, you are given an invoice a month later to pay the fees. I don't think I'm going to make this a normal side hustle, scaling seems much more difficult than the Youtube gigs which I am already having success with. 


**Notes and comments**  

* I haven't seen any impact from the Youtube "apocalypse" drama early this summer frequently discussed in the youtube community. 
* It's crazy how much of a slowly rolling snowball this Youtube business is. Building up a backlog of videos that earn a few bucks here and there doesn't seem like much when you publish each one, but each one becomes one of hundreds of little "workers" for you over time. And ongoing success of your channel increases the search ranking of even your older videos. 
* Even if I don't publish another video for an entire year, I can expect to earn over $500 completely passively. With continued publication I bet I can grow even further
* shoutout to /r/newtubers for lots of good advice and encouragement. 
* I report all my income as Schedule C self employment income on my personal tax return. 
* Please don't ask for links to my youtube channels, it's against the subreddit rules. 
* I fully expect to devote even more time to this Youtube Hobby (or other similar video production hobbies) once I retire. It's not only a money making side-hustle, but a fun hobby and passion project.

<TITLE> Small Business Tax Question: Discounted Expenses </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-09-05 15:49:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello everyone!

I purchased some equipment for my business (sole-proprietorship) from Amazon.com for $X. Amazon automatically applied a $5 discount for personally referring someone to the amazon app, and I used $6.22 of personal rewards points as well, for a total discount of $11.22 on this business expense, resulting in a total invoice amount of ($X - $11.22)

Of course both of these "discounts" I could have used for a personal expense instead, in which case the business expense would be $11.22 higher. (And thus offset $11.22 more of business revenue from a tax perspective).

Can I deduct the full $X? Or can I only deduct $X - $11.22?

Thanks! (I guess this type of annoyance is why I should just have a separate Amazon account for my business) </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I don't understand the economics of this! The crates are selling for $1-$4 a piece. I've made $13 with just like 8 hours of game play, which means everyone else can do the same. How is there possibly that much demand for these?

My only hypothesis is that there are a few market "whales" (rich streamers?) buying up thousands of crates and opening them. Otherwise I can't possibly imagine the demand for enough crates such that pretty much everyone will be able to pay for the price of the game once over in just a few weeks.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Interesting Data from my channel: How Youtube Promotes Live streams </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-07-17 16:41:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have a gaming / vlog channel and I got lucky last year with a few videos on one particular game, *Civilization 6* that got tens of thousands of views. I have 1.4k subscribers, mostly from those few videos. For the past 6 months, I've only been posting videos and streaming *other* video games. When I stream, I tend to bounce between 0, 1, or 2 viewers at any given time. 

Yesterday I decided to stream Civilization 6 for the first time ever, and within a minute or two I had 6 viewers, and got up to 10 pretty quickly. 

My guess is that Youtube is promoting my Civ 6 live stream to much more of my subscribers, because it knows they liked or subscribed to me because of my old Civ 6 videos, and probably like and view *other* Civ 6 videos more than the other random games I play. It's also likely that even if Youtube is promoting my streams equally whether they are Civ 6 streams or not, more of my subscribers are likely to *click* on those streams since they actually play Civ 6!

This is probably fairly obvious, but I just wanted to share it because it was so **striking** how quickly I got up to 10 viewers when that *never* happens when I live stream other games. People subscribe to your channel for a reason: because they like very specific content you put out. This is a motivation for me to make more Civ 6 videos and live streams.

Does anyone have any experience whether it tends to be best to sell this stuff all together, or piece it out? I don't mind the extra work, just trying to get the most money I can. I'll be starting with local sales (craigslist, FB marketplace), and if I don't have success I'll ebay it. 

Clarification: I don't intend to sell the individual computer components. I'm just wondering about separating the monitor, mouse, headset, keyboard, from the PC.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi everyone! I recently listened to an episode of Sam Harris' podcast called [What is Technology Doing to Us?](https://www.samharris.org/podcast/item/what-is-technology-doing-to-us) in which he interviews Tristan Harris, ex "Design Ethicist" at Google. A fascinating conversation about how the designers of social media apps and websites manipulate our minds to maximize their bottom line. 

They don't directly discuss gaming, but there are so many parallels that it just seems like it could be *so helpful* to this community. Check it out, even if you only listen for 15 minutes (and you should have the time to do productive stuff like this since you aren't gaming, right?). It blew my mind.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Lighting / Audio] Before / After Style video of my recent audio/video upgrade. Looking for further feedback </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-18 17:34:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I recently shared a video in a critique thread and I got some comments about the poor audio and video quality. I recently upgraded the following and created a "side-by-side" video. 

* Cheap Headset Mic - Blue Snowball
* No lighting - Beginner 700W Softbox light kit
* $20 720p Logitech Webcam - Galaxy S6 1080p / 60 fps

I'd really appreciate comments on the post processing I've done, and what else I should do, both audio and video

**Strengths:** 

I am lit much better, and the blue snowball is great when I bring it close to my face (and don't have to digitally increase the gain). I also like the 60 fps. 

**Weaknesses:** 

1. The blue snowball actually doesn't sound that much better than the headset mic when it's far away (and I have to digitally increase the gain)
2. The new camera doesn't appear to be perfectly focused
3. Although the lighting is much better now, I actually like how my webcam brings out my freckles and some of my facial features. Anything in particular I should be doing in light / color balance to achieve this effect with the Galaxy S6? Do i need to reduce the exposure with my new camera?

<TITLE> [Question] Lighting and Post-Processing: Filming with a Samsung Galaxy </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-04-17 20:23:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi everyone! I'm trying to switch from my $20 webcam to filming with my Galaxy S6. I've read lots of reviews that imply Galaxy S line of phones have pretty good cameras and are good for entry level Youtubing. 

The only downside is that the stock android camera software does not have any image adjustment a color correction options on it (exposure, gamma, brightness, contrast, etc) while my webcam has lots of these options. 

Since I've upgraded to a nice bright [softbox lighting kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00E4YS2XU/), the footage from my phone is actually way too bright and washed out. Do you guys recommend downloading a third party camera app for my phone, or making all my image adjustments in post-processing (I use Sony Vegas)? (and is there really a difference? Are all the third party camera apps just doing "post-processing" anyways?)

And finally, is there an easy way to get direct video out to my PC if I am plugged in via USB? or even better, to control the phone like a webcam from my PC? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Need to replace closet flange and drain elbow </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-22 02:28:49 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello! This is going to be my first foray into plumbing, so I want to make sure I do it correctly. [My PVC closet flange is fucked](http://imgur.com/cLSG7UA). It sits *outside* the vertical 3 inch drain line, but the drain line itself is cracked. As such, I believe I need to replace the closet flange, the short vertical line, and the elbow.

[Diagram here](http://imgur.com/UV9FNt9) solid red line is the crack, dotted red line is where I plan to cut and replace the elbow upwards. 

What exactly do I use to connect up to this existing drain line after cutting? I assume I need another fitting, a horizontal run of PVC, then the elbow? 

[I do have the ceiling drywall below this cut open a bit already](http://imgur.com/kgEptCQ) and am fine with taking more out (it was wet). [See short video here](https://youtu.be/qEBpNHbGQTI). How do I make this replacement while ensuring the closet flange is in the same position, and level? Like, what's the exact order I do things?

And finally, any tips given the video of the location? There's a joist there and the main drain line which I fear is going to be difficult to navigate around, but I can just pull down a big chunk of dry wall. 

Thanks for all your expertise! </TEXT>

<TITLE> A fun way to track your progress </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-02 17:50:22 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Like many of you, I meticulously track my net worth and monthly expenses. I've found that my absolute favorite metric for my progress towards FI is my [*Equivalent Withdrawal Rate*](http://i.imgur.com/cQAfPAI.png).

The vertical axis here is my monthly expenses, times 12 (converted to yearly), divided by my retirement portfolio value. 

As you can see, when I started out I was spending nearly my entire portfolio's value in 1 year. Now I am spending about a third of my portfolio each year. **Goal: 4%.** (for 12 months in a row)

I don't personally include my cash savings (which has recently grown to be quite large) or home equity, but you could if you wanted. 

I also can't decide if I like the log view or [linear view](http://imgur.com/nPDWUnS) better. I expect the trendline to be linear on a log plot, but the linear plot gives a better sense of progress early on as my portfolio is doubling rapidly due to high contributions. 

Finally, one last change you could make is to take the inverse ratio, and plot [portfolio value as a multiple of annual expenses.](http://i.imgur.com/bLlGzmM.png). **Goal: 25X** (For 12 months in a row) </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Tips   Tricks] Detailed analysis of my first 325,000 YouTube Views (Lot's of graphs!) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-13 14:57:26 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi everyone! I figured I'd say hello since I've been lurking for a few months, and give a **loonng** analysis of how I went from a complete YouTube beginner to a semi-beginner. If you want to skip to the end, here's the coolest graph, [My daily view count across two channels.](http://i.imgur.com/nTsOSoJ.png)

##The Early Days (Channel 0)

My [very first YouTube video](http://i.imgur.com/fAqU4CR.png) was posted in November 2006, and is a twelve second, grainy clip of two guys in my college dorm playing the Original Nintendo Wii Tennis game on release day with 107,000 views.

Unfortunately this was so long ago that YouTube Analytics breaks down: I can't trend for monthly views earlier than 2Q 2017. Nearly 90% of the views were received in the first 6 months this video was posted, all before the YouTube Partnership monetization program was implemented.

For a while, this video appeared on the first page of search results for "Nintendo Wii". I thought it was a neat novelty at the time, but, if I knew what I know now, I would have cherished these early views because of how easy it would be to snowball those views into a successful channel.

## Channel 1

7 years later I recorded myself fixing a common problem with the door locks in my car, and uploaded to Youtube under my new YouTube account. Apparently this car issue is a really common problem, because I've now gotten over 80,000 views on that video. My monthly view-count increased fairly rapidly at first, and was still going up until the past few months.

[Monthly Views by traffic source on my DIY car fix video](http://i.imgur.com/8vXNzxw.png)

As you can see, the success of this video was entirely organic: Nearly all the views, especially early, were from YouTube search and Suggested videos: I was simply meeting a need by producing a video that had good search volume, and few competitors. Later, sometime in 2015, I did end up replying to some popular automotive forum posts about this issue with a link to my video, which is probably the partial cause of the increase in traffic from external sources. Then again, a lot of that is just google searches.

So at this time, I was pretty much Two-for-Two with hitting home runs on videos! I set up monetization to get a little beer money from my DIY car repair video each month.

My next video, a clip of my pet corgi chasing her tail, got 5,000 views from a reddit post, but no sustained views after the first month.

About 6 months later, December 2014, I was fed up with the amount of people posting to /r/personalfinance that didn't understand how credit card billing cycles work. So I made a video to explain it. I didn't post any links to reddit though (It's against the rules of /r/personalfinance). Turns out it was another hit, currently sitting at 33,000 views, all organic through YouTube. [Here's the trend of monthly views by traffic source for that one](http://i.imgur.com/f8UZGcf.png)

Remember, that's not total views. That's monthly views: steadily going up. At this time, I thought "Hey, this is actually pretty cool, I might make this a *thing*." So I re-branded  [Channel 1] to something cooler instead of simply my email handle.

Then comes a string of videos that didn't do so well. 142 views from my bike commute. 226 views on another video of my corgi. 91 views on another video about personal finance. I was disappointed in this one after my first personal finance video did so well, but I realize it's not a very searched topic, and it's got a lot of competing videos out there. Next up, Nov 2015, 1.5 years after I first started this channel, I made a video about how to set up my Sit-Stand desk, a popular model from Ikea. Believe it or not, it's currently at 10,000 views!

I've since made 15 more videos on that channel, about half of which are personal finance tips and tricks or other DIY content, but across all 15 I've only gotten another 10,000 view (however, some are recent and still rising fast in the monthly view count. Two of them are getting over 1,000 a month, both because they are frequently searched topics).

The success of my first channel was encouraging, (currently at 150,000 views) so I decided I wanted to put out some gaming content. Since my face and voice be more featured in these videos, I figured I'd make another channel, [Channel 2], as my gaming / "personality" channel. It launched this summer, July 2016.

##Channel 2

Here's the current view counts on my gaming channel videos (ordered from time of publication, the top one being the first one published):

* 30
* 211
* 49
* 1,058 (this was a video with information about a soon-to-be released video game that I gleaned from watching a pre-release video and commentating it. Nearly all views are from a post in the related subreddit).
* 29
* 256
* 227
* 446
* 201
* 356
* 754 (my channel trailer)
* 68
* 665
* 31
* 55

Most of these are gaming videos, or "Vlog" style videos, a very saturated field. And those are the *current* view counts, they were much lower before my channel got some extra visibility from *this:*

* **34,656**. WOOO Another hit! This was a second video on the same to-be-released video game. I spent about 4 hours doing some detailed assessment about how some certain mechanics would work, and compiled that all into a nice 10 minute package. But here's the crazy thing: I got 800 views up front when I posted it to reddit before the game was out. Then absolutely no views for the next 2 weeks, until the game was released and I saw an immense traffic spike! Having a youtube video already published when people first buy the game and start playing it was incredible helpful. I beat out all the other guides on this particular game mechanic, so I spiked in traffic results!

* 1,502 (another corgi video which I posted to reddit)
* 78
* 190
* **20,617** (another video on the same game, nearly all organic views, only 350 views from reddit)
* 391
* 6,501 (another video on the same game)
* 665 (another video on the same game)
* 2,431 (another video on the same game)
* 3,397 (another video on the same game)
* 114
* 1,416 (another video on the same game)
* 1,526 (another video on the same game)
* 91

In just 5 months [Channel 2] is now standing at 75,000 views. I've noticed that people are more likely to subscribe to me on this video game channel, when I rarely got any subs on my first channel. People don't subscribe to a DIY channel, that's content that they search for, find, and leave. But gamers enjoy new content from personalities that entertain them and teach them. Let's look at my overall YouTube History to compare the total cumulative views and total subscribers from my two channels:

[As you can see](http://i.imgur.com/xG7xWlP.png), I have over 800 subs (blue dotted line) on my second gaming channel, and only 150 on my first channel (red dotted line) despite it having much more total views.

A few lessons:

* Don't think about the health of your channel in terms of total views or total subs. Rather, look at the rate at which it is gaining views or subs (per day, week, or month). The graph above makes [Channel 1](red line) look "better" because it has more total views. But if you look at the number of daily viewers, you see something different. Check out the stacked bar chart of my combined daily views:

[Combined daily views on both channels. (Graph repeated from above)](http://i.imgur.com/nTsOSoJ.png)

* Video games: Be timely. By the very fact that YouTube culture attracts gamers, and vice versa, there are going to be a ton of generic let's play video game videos. You better have a fucking amazing personality or be really early to a video game and have highly searched keywords. 
* Put out content that people are searching for. Everyone says it, but my data proves it.
* Spamming your links to Reddit to niche subreddits can get you a few thousand views in about a 24 hour time period, but does not build any sustained viewership nor subs. Spam won't help a shitty video be successful. And by shitty, I mean shitty content with low demand, I'm not talking about production quality. My production quality has generally been pretty bad. 

Note that the last two graphs don't include my channel with the Wii video from 2006. That would make for quite the spike! I think I was getting over 10,000 views some days. All in all I'm sitting at:

* 107,000 unmonetized views on [Channel 0] in 2006
* 150,000 views on [Channel 1] over 2 years
* 75,000 views on [Channel 2] over 5 months </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Question] Help me figure out the optimum way to split my content among channels. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-11 18:54:08 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I got my start in Youtube when I happened to upload a DIY video on how to repair a common problem with my car model. Currently it sits with 75k views on my first channel with a non-descript name such as **CoolSoundingBlog** (not the real name, but something similar). 

My real passion however, is explaining personal finance concepts, tips and tricks. I've got another 10 or so such videos on the same channel. One of them has over 25k views.

However, it's not *all* personal finance tips. I have two more DIY videos on the same channel, one explaining the assembly instructions for a popular desk, another one about my car, and a few product reviews. **CoolSoundingBlog** channel has 99 subscribers.

My other more recent channel is more about me as a personality. Let's call it **subject3993**. I cast video games, and give video game tips and tricks. I also use this as my vlogging channel, sharing stuff going on in my life that might be interesting, and adorable videos of my corgi. My logic is that if it is about me, my personality, my humor, it belongs on **subject3993**. If the content stands on it's own, it goes on the first channel, **CoolSoundingBlog**.

Currently I have 45 subscribers on **subject3993**, mostly from people who subscribed on a strategy guide I made for a particular video game.

My biggest concerns are as I build up a subscriber base on either or both of my channels, that they will be annoyed when I put out content they didn't subscribe to me for.

1. People that subscribed to me on **CoolSoundingBlog** for personal finance tips might get annoyed when I make DIY videos for a car or a desk that they don't have, or review a product they aren't interested in.
2. People that subscribe to me on **subject3993** for a video game guide I made might not care about my dog or my philosophical / political thoughts shared in a vlog.

Do I need more channels? Do I wait until I have a bigger subscriber base? Do I simply turn of notifications to subscribers for certain content? (Mainly thinking about this for DIY stuff and product reviews which will get most views from youtube /Google search) </TEXT>

The "global happiness" on the main toolbar at the top of the screen in Civ V gave you an instant idea if you needed to prioritize more luxury resources. Now that amenities are city-specific, I have no way to get a quick *feeling* of the "happiness" of my cities. I have to click on each one, or rely on the notifications (which only happen too late). Same thing with housing.

The city yields summary would also be super helpful in planning out which districts to build in which city, which currently is going to require a lot of clicking back and forth between each city. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Question]. New video is getting a lot of hits from "suggested videos". Anyone know why? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-09-27 21:39:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys! I just recently released a video about some personal finance tips. It's getting an amazing (for me) 20+ views *a day* from "suggested videos". [Traffic Source Statistics,: new video](http://i.imgur.com/NoKHE2c.png)

When I compare this to the very early days of one of my most popular videos ever (27,000 views, Dec 2014) on a similar subject, I'm super pumped. [Traffic Source Statistics: first month of old, popular video](http://i.imgur.com/Lps20qe.png).

If my old video did so well in the long run even with such lackluster early viewership, I can only hope this new video does even better. I'm wondering if the high traffic from "suggested videos" is because Of how many views I got when I shared it on my personal facebook (big peak on day 1). Maybe this causes YouTube's algorithm to suggest it more?

Unfortunately it's not getting any views from YouTube search yet, which is where all the views on my older video come from now adays. Does anyone have any experience with house sustainable views are from "suggested videos" if you aren't getting much from youtube search?

One other hypothesis: Since the new video is such a similar subject (with similar tags) as the old video, maybe most of the "suggested video" views are actually coming from the suggested videos at the end of **my** old video. In that case, there's not really any way to leverage this except "Make similar videos to your other videos" which should be obvious. </TEXT>

At first glance this seems like it would be stupid, It might cost you $50 for a thousand views, and only earn you $2. But could it get the "viral" snowball rolling early, especially if you can target a specific audience on reddit or google? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Best way to remove this entry-way half wall? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-28 17:20:56 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [Image, corgi for scale](http://i.imgur.com/UpMGG29.jpg)

I'm not planning to remove the ~1-ft floor-to-ceiling extension (hell, it might be load bearing), just the half-wall portion that sticks out.

What's the way to do this that makes the drywall work easiest to finish it? Ideally I'd like to just have to drywall the "front" of this extension that faces the room, not have to do any patching on the side.

And yes, we'll have to patch the hardwood, unfortunately the flooring doesn't continue under the half-wall. Any tips on that?

Thanks in advance!

EDIT: Is there any way I can harvest the drywall from the demo'd half wall and use that to patch the front face of the full height wall? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi all, I decided to quit video games for the rest of the summer in order to get some other things done. I figured I'd start recording some videos about my progress and thoughts as I go through this. If you are interested in following along you can check out [my first video of the series](https://youtu.be/3peZZLJwiZI).

I'm probably not quitting forever, just looking for some balance in my life. I don't consider myself addicted to video games, just looking to adjust my habits.

I hope to give some motivation to others by talking about all the other great stuff I'm looking forward to getting done: projects around the house, exercising, writing, reading, and spending more time with my wife. 

Wish me luck! </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Help] Extremely strange defect with my first mechanical keyboard </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-09 01:43:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I bought this well reviewed [Havit HV-KB376L](http://amzn.to/2aNbtQL) from Amazon, and my first unit had a one defect (computer never recognizes it when booting up, only after unplugging and replugging keyboard). Thankfully customer service agreed to send a second unit for free. This second unit has the *really weird* defect that a few of the keys appear to also result in the key next to it being pressed. [Short video here](https://youtu.be/z8wUXxCAl2w)

Whenever any of the following key pairs are pressed, the other member in the pair also registers as being pressed without physically moving.

    q,w
    a,s
    z,x
    "period", "Enter" (Num Pad)

Does anyone have any clue about this? Or did I just get a second dud in a row? 

Edit I've pulled the offending keys, And there is definitely nothing that is physically interacting between these keys. The neighbor key switch is definitely not being pressed. 

Edit 2: The same defect occurs when the keyboard is plugged into my wife's MacBook.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> * Can you sell and buy, which you have held it for five years. Dump that much towards your student loans, or from money you have each month to destroy your loans each month to cover the taxes next year then.

* Also consider how much you contributed to an IRA as part of any tIRA to Roth is a comment I wrote elsewhere that might help your net worth doesn't change. It depends on your tax return next April 3. if your investment really earned more than 1 grand. 50-50 would be an extremely bad idea to purchase more individual stocks and non Vanguard funds. Either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump is going to try track that separately from alcohol.

* I'm having a slightly larger emergency fund as cash, but investing long term good companies will depreciate.

* And if you do sell it, you could do that. As long as possible, and draw down from your paychecks which you deducted when you look at past performance as any indicator of future returns.

* Re-do the IRS calculator? It is indistinguishable from immortality to my desk, and made tea.

* Yes, you can attempt to let your parents want you to take advantage of all would be an OK way of knowing how much money I went in with. 5 years after release and it was to pay down the principal. Any other recommendations: currency speculation, starting a family, you might pay a dime in interest.

* TLDR: At worst, the $70 she pays you is on income based repayment of student loans at 6%. I'm not afraid of death, as I said above you don't want to be. It depends what you are curious more about this! The new loan is at a bank.

* Pay minimums on all ballots? A budget, which is $20,000 more than they would be approximately as good or better than anything you can do! Pay minimums on all his income, which could total up to 6 miles away for retirement in Philly | $0 | $0 So basically as far as I imagine you will owe income tax rate is lower. So for that yourself?

* See if you reduce expenses? Questions: 1. sounds like a career with potential for very highly variable income, I would NOT take money out of life. This is a bad thing though! I don't think you need to pay an extra $20k-30k a year by CHOOSING expensive hobbies and brand new cards would have had to replace a hot water heater.

* Set the expectation for having these conversations before you god the personal loan, the personal loan. Our other scenario will be putting $700 a month in interest between now and expect to be president next year.

* You make less than 1% above inflation. Use safe lifting techniques, PPE, and work through the hassle and risk of that debt for much longer than 2-3 weeks. He'll blunder around and make future adjustments as you can. If you came here and we would get company match only, and shovel all other surplus cash towards the loan.

* Did you have $500 or more in taxes and penalties for withdrawal. I've earned $2,391 in cash or a Roth 401k. The noise is obviously determined by the very bad advice.

* That said, you will never end up with a lemon. Do you believe that when owning a house doesn't actually matter at all. When they leave that company, they roll the old loans 3.  Let's say you have no other itemized deductions.

* There are 4.33 weeks per month towards your student loans until now? I can't give more info, just a few thousand in maintenance. That makes it really depends on the sidebar materials! Either sell the condo, in one or more knowledgeable about the defined contribution plan, probably a 403b.

* This should be able to minimize the cost of living. This may not want to pick up a quick budget for you in Google Sheets.

* Chimps: huge balls, very monogamous. Every time your savings and investments back up with low minimums I recently opened one at the bottom? </TEXT>

<TITLE> My Experience with "Mad Money": A Flexible Way to Combine Finances in Marriage </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-05-06 19:50:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I got married last year, and we gradually developed a system that works very well for us. Even better, it's a very flexible system that you can adapt to *your* unique situation. We call it "mad money". Others call it "flex money", "blow money", or "allowance". I've heard this concept all over the place, but [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3tlkl0/mad_money_a_fun_money_solution_for_couples_that/) by /u/Melloncollieocr really cemented the idea for me.

###How it Works

Our primary family checking account is used to pay for nearly all expenses: house payment, utilities, vacations, food, and so on. Naturally however, there are some expenses where our priorities are different. In your relationship, you might prefer to spend money on videos games, whiskey, and casino trips while your spouse would rather save for her model train hobby and bungee jumping.

Because of this difference, my wife and I each get a monthly allowance of "**mad money**": This is **the money that your spouse is not allowed to get mad at you for spending**. I can burn through this money every month, or save it up for a year to blow on a fancy gaming computer.

You might choose to actually set up two bank accounts for this money, and automatically transfer your monthly allowance to them each month. My wife and I just track a "virtual" balance in a spreadsheet, while the money actually all stays in our common checking account. Our Mad Money spreadsheet [looks something like this (fake numbers)](http://i.imgur.com/cX7nLZb.png)

###Flexibility

**Food**: Maybe your spouse thinks you eat fast food too much, and you think she drinks too much Starbucks?  Why not just include food in your mad money? Take it out of your normal family budget, and add the appropriate amount to your mad money.

**Gifts and Bonuses**: Currently, when we receive a bonus at work, or a gift from grandparents, we just throw it into our family funds. But maybe you want to put it (or maybe just part of it?) in your mad money. Go ahead! See the "adjustment" column in the image above? You can split it evenly, or put it all in your mad money if it's your bonus. Just make sure the two of you agree on your approach.

**Different Tastes**: Need to buy a new couch? You want the $1000 one, and your spouse wants the $500 one? Why not agree to pay for part of the couch with the family budget (say, $750), and charge the rest ($250) to your mad money?

*As you can see, the whole concept of "mad money" simply gives you a platform to discuss and agree upon how you deal with your finances.*

**Different Incomes**: If you get married later in life and and both have well established careers, you might want to keep a lot of your finances independent, and will shift more of your finances towards mad money and away from the family budget. Maybe you even each get a different amount of mad money each month, based on your salary: She sacrificed a lot early in life to go to med school, and now has a bigger income. Maybe she should get $500 a month in mad money, while you only get $300, proportional to your salaries?

If one spouse is a stay at home parent, or you align very closely on entertainment and luxury spending priorities, it might make sense to leave nearly everything in the family budget, and only keep a small mad money account for hobbies and gifts to one another. Feel free to adjust the "slider" as it fits your family! [[Image showing the "slider"]](http://i.imgur.com/6fW6Gp0.png)

###Perspective

This system work best if you have a family [budget](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/budgeting) in the first place! Write down how much of your money each month goes towards house, utilities, travel, **mad money**, etc (as you can see, we simply include mad money as a line item in our budget.) How much leftover monthly cashflow do you have to put towards debt, savings, and investments? You may need to adjust the amount of mad money you each are allowed in order to meet your other shared goals for saving. </TEXT>

<TITLE> My Experience doing the Mega Backdoor Roth Contribution [With details!] </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-03-22 14:47:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi everyone! I just initiated my first mega-backdoor Roth IRA rollover, and I figured I'd give a report out since it can be confusing. And even once you get the concept down, you have to figure out the actual *mechanism* in working with your institutions to actually make the rollover. 

#Background

[Note: this strategy is distinct from the normal "backdoor Roth"]

If you aren't familiar with this process, the Mega Backdoor Roth takes advantage of the fact that individuals can contribute *after-tax, non-Roth* money to an employer retirement plan such as a 401(k) over and above the normal $18,000 annual limit for Roth or pre-tax contributions. If your company allows in-service withdrawals of this money, (or you plan on leaving your company soon), you can roll this money into a Roth IRA effectively  bypassing the $5,500 annual limit on Roth IRA contributions. Normally leaving money in an after-tax non-Roth 401(k) is less favorable than simple taxable investment account investments (since you owe income tax on the earnings, not just cap gains tax), but viewed as a short term "pass-through" into a Roth IRA (where the earnings are tax free), an after-tax 401(k) can be a huge weapon in your FI arsenal.

[Here's the Mad Fientist article on the trick, and I find it quite thorough.](http://www.madfientist.com/after-tax-contributions/)

#Details

I have $6,142 of after-tax money in my 401(k). I only contributed $6,115 of this money, which means that $27 is "earnings" which have yet to be taxed. This is an important nuance: The contributions themselves have been taxed already, and can be rolled directly into my Roth IRA with no tax impact. The earnings however, if rolled over (and "converted" in the process) to my Roth IRA would be taxable income. No big deal, but since late 2014 the IRS allows you to actually split off these earnings and put those in a *traditional* IRA, deferring the income tax. This is what I wanted to do. 

My 401(k) is with Fidelity, and my IRAs are with Vanguard. I first called Vanguard to initiate the process (as I know working with the receiving institution can be easier: they are the ones getting the assets, not losing them! They have an incentive to work with you). I'm not sure the Vanguard rep really understood the details of the tIRA/Roth IRA split, but I tried to move forward with them anyways. I wanted to do a direct transfer from Fidelity to Vanguard, and Vanguard said they needed to understand whether Fidelity required any paperwork. So I called up fidelity. The guy I spoke to seemed to be familiar with this procedure. According to him though, there was absolutely no way to do a direct transfer to an outside institution. After trying to sell me on opening an IRA *with Fidelity* (which isn't a bad idea, I just would rather stay with Vanguard for the time being), we initiated the transfer using physical checks.

Here's how it actually works: Fidelity will send me two checks in the mail, both made out to "Vanguard Fiduciary Trust Company for benefit of [subject3993]". One for $27 and one for $6115. I will then take these two checks and send them to Vanguard with a "letter of instruction" that I draft, instructing them to deposit the first check in my traditional IRA account, and the second in my Roth IRA account. Since the checks are made out to the other institution, not me, it's still treated as a trustee-to-trustee transfer, and they won't have to do the 20% income tax withholding on the $27.

#Summary

All in all it seems straightforward. Although I would have liked to do a direct transfer without getting a check, it seems like the "split" of assets to Roth and tIRAs make this too complicated between institutions. It seems simple enough however, and after this is complete I will effectively have contributed $5,500 + $6,142 to my own IRAs this year. I'm only allowed to do this once a quarter per my retirement plan, so I'll finish hitting my $18,000 max in my pre-tax 401(k) by late summer, then dump even more money into the after-tax, non-Roth 401(k) in the fall, and go through this process again. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Interesting tax phenomenon with deductions for renting out a room in your home. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-01-14 19:11:24 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In 2014 I was single, and renting out two rooms of my home. Since I had itemized deductions well over the standard deduction, I just itemized all of my property taxes and mortgage interest. 

This year (2015) I was married and *below* the standard deduction. However, because approximately 19% of the square footage of my home is a rental, I pro-rate 19% of the mortgage interest and 19% of the property taxes as expenses associated with the rental on schedule E, reducing my taxable income.

The other 81% of my property taxes and mortgage interest is an itemized deduction and gets "lost" under the standard deduction. However, if I didn't have rental income, 100% of it would be "lost"!

<TEXT> #Build Help/Ready

I think I'm settled on my build, but looking for guidance on whether this is the best choice of CPU and GPU for my price range. Also, am I missing any sick **Black Friday deals** that I should be getting?

###Intended Use
Gaming, some photo editing, not planning on video editing or encoding

###Budget
Looking for the best price/performance spot between $1,300 and $1,500, flexible, *without* monitor or operating system.

###Other details

**CPU:** One concern is that the i5-6600K doesn't seem to be available anywhere this morning except Amazon where it's an extra $40.  Also, I read somewhere that this is an "overclocking CPU". If I don't plan on overclocking, am I wasting some money?  
**Overclocking**: not planning on it.  
**Location**: USA

<TITLE> My wedding: A Personal Finance Post-Mortem </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-11-04 17:32:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Optimization of personal finance is a hobby of mine, and I just got married. These two things can be hard to reconcile! Traditional marriages in the United States are known for their extreme expense, and they come at a critical time in a young couple's life. A wedding can set them up for success with good financial habits, or it can severely limit their ability to meet other goals (home ownership, etc.) by drowning them in debt.

I'd like to give full visibility into what my new wife and I did. By no means did we save every possible dime in planning a wedding, but we struck a balance between expense and fun that fit our personal priorities. We splurged here and there, but still came in well under the often cited mean (~$27k) and median (~$17k) wedding costs in the United States. Or rough budget was $10,000. Continue reading to see how we did!

###Who we are
Of course one's general financial position plays a large roll in what is *reasonable* for a wedding. For me, it's as follows: 27 year old engineer, positive net worth with 20% equity in my home and cash + retirement accounts approximately equal to one 1.5 years income. No student debt. Her: 25, studying to be a registered dietitian. 

###How we got married
We both have medium to large families, and a large group of peers and friends that we would have loved to invite to our wedding. Yet we decided to do a small wedding with close family only. We rented a [7 bedroom lodge](http://i.imgur.com/091gILy.jpg) in the mountains for the whole weekend. We had 4 grandparents, 4 parents, 3 siblings, 1 sibling fiance, 1 aunt (bride's matron of honor), 1 uncle, and 1 dog. We didn't invite any cousins or any of the ~20 other aunts and uncles. We [got married by a waterfall in a state park](http://i.imgur.com/5JmZYnt.jpg), by my grandma who is a pastor. 

###What we spent

#$11,000.

[See list of expenses here](http://i.imgur.com/9shHWBd.jpg)

###What we could have spent

#$6,300
As you see, we still "splurged" a bit in some areas. If we had outstanding debt, or did not yet own a house, or did not have our current income, there would be some very easy cuts to make (see the numbers in red in the list of expenses). 

1. We didn't have to rent a big house for the whole weekend. We would still need a venue for dinner, but this would easily save $1,000. We also avoid the cost for all the other meals (which we did pretty cheaply anyways): $200.
2. Her Dress. She actually bought a $400 dress that we were very tempted to go with (wasn't officially a wedding gown, but was a beautiful white dress). We decided later to go a bit extravagant and buy a more expensive one. Easy savings: $2,000
3. Photography. My wife loves photography, and high quality photographers was one of her highest priorities. Easy to save $1,500 here, more if we had friends or family take the pictures.


###How we feel

1 week later, and we currently agree that we don't regret anything. She says the more expensive dress made her feel more comfortable and confident and special, which in turn will translate into better pictures. When we decided to go with the expensive photography, it wasn't just for memories. It is also to have beautiful *art* around our house. I don't regret the house for the weekend at all. The deep conversations and friendships that formed between our two families are priceless. 

We also understand that there is an opportunity cost to this money that we spent, and we are looking at it all in that light. We can think of this money as coming from other things that we would enjoy (renovations on the home, extravagant vacations, a newer car, an earlier retirement). This view helps us put the decision to spend $11,000 in perspective. 

My new wife: " Right now, I don't regret a thing. Ask me again in a year and we can re-assess whether we would do anything differently!"
_______________________

###Conclusion
There's no question that throwing a party for over 100 people is hard to do cheaply. What I'm trying to demonstrate is that there are other alternatives. We were both incredibly happy with this wedding. The time we got to spend with our closest family members was amazing, the level of stress was low, and it was truly an intimate experience we will cherish forever. 

Now, I love a good party, and want to have a big boozy bash with my friends which we are going to do this weekend at my house (Just spending a few hundred on booze and food). But separating this experience from the wedding was the best decision ever. 

Take what you will from my example. Obviously we could do things differently, but hopefully this can serve to give some ideas on how to save money on your *own* wedding. </TEXT>

It's interesting how you have dozens of people stuck, out of work, who hang out all day, exercise, write, send out a few applications, and generally *hate themselves* because they are draining on their parents, the government, or their savings.

Yet at the same time you have a dozen other responses from FIRE'd people who do *almost the exact same things* with their day, yet are absolutely loving their life.

The change in mental state between supporting oneself through passive income and *not* supporting oneself is amazing, even if 90% of their time is spent doing the same things.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Great summary of our mindset with some extremely quotable phrases. 

**[I retired at 30. The best part isn't leisure  it's freedom.](http://www.vox.com/2015/7/27/9023415/mr-money-mustache-retirement)**

I think this article is a bit softer and more available for a wide audience than some of his blog posts. I know a lot of people give Mr. Money Mustache a hard time for how extreme he is. I give him a break, because I think people take him a bit too seriously. 

He uses his blog to almost make an extreme caricature of himself and his practices. His job isn't to get us to swing all the way over to his position:

* driving 800 miles in the summer without A/C to save a few bucks
* using a 2 hours and a bike to haul 400 lbs of lumber a few miles which could be done in 10 minutes with a minivan that we have anyways

His job is to show us what is *possible*, to maybe recognize a bit of the ridiculous laziness of society and change our ways incrementally to reduce our expenses.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I tried using the ["User Simulator"](https://np.reddit.com/r/User_Simulator) to have a robot comb my comment history and spit out some phrases typical of what I say on reddit.

The below three phrases are the first three it gave me, I didn't even do any picking and choosing of the funniest ones. 

___________________________

* If they calculate that your current monthly escrow payments won't cover the interest that you need to have a serious look at the age you want to *recharacterize* your 2014 contributions from Roth to traditional. I would bike just about $4,500 each year in retirement. The fact that it also is moving a casino, 20 kitchens, a few of his best production/food/luxury tiles? Assuming equivalent tax rates now and figure out what he did differently than what you do within your means and on and on.


* Instincts and desires encoded in my retirement age and the research:If you file separately, how much taxes you would have to work. So you can't pay in full each month? HOWEVER Given that he has 4+ months worth of payments you would have to hit to avoid as many gains on the statement* by the man himself Really, mortgages could just be thought of as leveraged investing in an IRA to vanguard. Blame the lawmakers that maintain financial incentives for this is probably **not** your own without any renters. Ostriches are definitely contributors, but I don't understand it. In other words It was a sales call.

* Plus a few vacations, bike to work towards. I don't think my home value didn't decrease.

<TITLE> The sidebar/FAQ still doesn't very clearly show how the hell everyone is doing all this MSing. It's not set up well for noobs. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-15 22:33:06 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **EDIT**: Ahhh ok now I understand. According to over half of the comments here the sidebar, FAQ, and wiki are intentionally confusing to obfuscate MS techniques and keep newbies out. 

**Original**: Ok I've lurked here for about a year and I think I've finally picked up vaguely how you guys do manufactured spend. But it's a fucking chore to figure it out. I recommend that the mods put the general MS **logic** somewhere only one or two clicks from the home page, explained concisely, and with current information. Something along the lines of the following:

________________________
1. Sign up for a prepaid card, either Redbird or Serve
2. Purchase Visa giftcards (with PINS) at a physical store with the CC you want to create manufactured spend for
3. Go to your local target (redbird) or Walmart (serve), tell them you want to load your prepaid card with a debit card (or do you say gift card?), and follow their instructions
4. Then what??? Do you guys just spend the redbird money then with billpay? Or do you use the withdraw to bank account feature? I've seen so many warnings about this using that feature, but I also see people MSing $20k a month.

_______________________

Currently on the sidebar, I see a Redbird megathread, but I would have no clue to click it if I don't even know what redbird is yet, or why I should be interested in it (and the thread isn't helpful anyways, and contains outdated information such as loading redbird directly with CC). I also see redbird and Serve FAQ pages, but I don't even know what the heck those are, and they start off with all sorts of crossed out text, time-specific updates that I don't understand, and are generally pretty opaque. 

If instead I click "wiki", I can scroll down to "Manufacturing Spend Methods". However, once I get there I'm greeted with the trade names of two prepaid card services that I have never heard of, and still don't even quite understand what the point of these services is! If I click on either of them, it takes me to those same two FAQ pages i mentioned above.

I recommend getting rid of all three of the following from the side bar:

* Redbird Mega Thread
* FAQ - Amex Serve Wiki
* FAQ - Redbird Wiki

And replacing them with a link to a new wiki page for "How to Manufacture Spend". It would be a simple and clean page with the general logic laid out as I did above which helps the user understand the point of the prepaid cards, and why they should be interested. THEN they can be linked to the detailed Serve and Redbird specific FAQ/wiki pages.

The first is a simple 2 lane stoplight. I don't pass any of the queue on the right. There's a gutter ahead, there's not much space, and someone might be turning right.

The second is a larger intersection. There's a left turn, straight, and right turn lane all in my direction. I just want to go straight. I end up waiting in the queue for over 2.5 minutes since I don't want to get in the right turn lane.

<TEXT> Many people think that Bernie has little chance to win, partially because of name recognition. Put yourselves in the shoes of Joe-blow facebook dude, who rarely votes and doesn't get involved in politics. He's only heard of Hillary, and assumes by default that she will win.

##What if **seven** of his facebook friends all make a post on Thursday about why they are going to vote for Bernie Sanders? Imagine the impact that would have on him?

He might not read them all, but he sure as hell would notice, and would start recognizing the name *Bernie Sanders*.

I'm going to write up a paragraph or two about why I'm going to vote for Bernie. I'm going to make it personal, and even include some things I don't like about him (I'm skeptical about socialization of college tuition in the current environment)

After Bernie announces his candidacy, let's see if we can get an upswell of facebook posts showing our support. Let's move beyond the echo chamber of /r/SandersForPresident

<TITLE> 2-4 days of severe DOMS after squat day </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-04-28 18:27:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey guys, I'm a nooby-to-intermediate lifter, 27 yrs old Male and about 6'3". For the past year of been lifting about 4 days a week, cycling push/pull/legs. I've got pretty long-ass legs, and my squat sucks, (probably 230 1RM). I'm definitely going to parallel.

Normal squat workout consists of 4-5 sets: 

* warmup with 45 lbs, 8 reps
* 135lbs, 8 reps
* 185lbs, 5-8 reps
* 185lbs, 5-8 reps
* ~205-215lbs, 3 reps

After I do squats, even if I don't go too hard, I have 1 day of exhaustion followed by about 2 days of severe DOMS in my quads and some in my hamstrings and ass. I'm waddling about, holding my whole body up with my arms on the hand railing when I walk down stairs, etc. It's painful to get out of bed, or get out of my car.


Is this normal? It never comes close to this bad in my upper body or arms, or after deadlifts, just good medium soreness. 

Am I not working the rest of my muscles enough? Am I squatting too much volume? </TEXT>

<TITLE> The value of tracking expenses. </TITLE>

<TEXT> ###Graph of Monthly Food Expenses:
[Stacked Column Graph](http://i.imgur.com/mStePnW.png)  
[Grouped Column Graph](http://i.imgur.com/tOXnnbx.png)


###Summary

I use Mint.com to track every single expense I make. Mint.com can create some beautiful graphs on it's own, but doesn't have the capability to make stacked column graphs like this, so I simply exported my transaction data to a .csv, and made this graph in Excel.

_______________
### Spending details

My food spending is one area I keep a close eye on. I made a goal to spend less than $300 a month last year, and as you can see I finally accomplished that in January, but blew it *big time* the last few months. 

*I find the expense tracking particularly valuable because it shows me where to focus my efforts*: Sure, I could spend a lot of time cooking meals at home to avoid the $5 trips to Subway. But this data shows me that my efforts are much better spent avoiding those 2-4 big fancy restaurant expenses each month. (Or rather than "avoiding": seriously considering whether the happiness I get from those fancy meals is worth it, or whether this money would better be spent elsewhere). 

This data excludes all alcohol. I manually split credit card transactions that include both alcohol and food, but I just do a rough estimate. ("Hey, I got two beers with that dinner last week, I'll split $12 off and categorize that as "alcohol". That sounds about right")

I recommend expense tracking for everyone even if you don't have a "budget". It can really highlight interesting things and allow you to be critical of where your money is going. Did you even *realize* you were putting $700 a month to food, and only $100 a month to video games? Or only $X a month towards retirement?

_______________
###Data export details:

I could extract every single food transaction in mint, and manually re-sum the monthly totals for each category in Excel. But mint has another good feature: From the Trends  Spending Over Time Page, you can export the monthly spending in categories already totaled up (so I only have 12 data points for each category, not hundreds).

1. As you can see, I'm having a lot of trouble with erosion down the side of the driveway. 
2. Additionally, there isn't much space next to the vehicle to walk up the driveway.

Given these two things, I'd like to do some sort of walk-way right next to the driveway that will also combat erosion.

<TITLE> Announcement: Flair Change and Thread Locking </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-02-27 18:38:02 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> #Simplified submission flair 

##Edit 02-MAR-2015:

##Based on *further* feedback (thank you all!) We have reverted to a modified version of the original "topic" flair. The rest of this post still applies: 

#Locked Posts

In the last three months, the most frequent complaint about /r/personalfinance is the presence of belligerent and low-quality comments on popular posts. Normally, moderators can quickly take care of such comments when they are reported. However, when a post "blows up" on the Reddit front page, it can turn into an unmanageable flood of vitriol and wisecracks that drive people away. 

This is a problem that all default subreddits and large semi-anonymous internet communities in general must deal with. For a trial period, we will experiment with locking such posts: once a thread is locked, all comments after the time of locking will be invisible. This is a preferred alternative to removing the community from the "default" subreddit list altogether.

We wish it were unnecessary, but recent developments have brought this kind of measure into consideration. Note that it's only a trial period, and we are always interested in your ongoing feedback.

#Remember the Human

The moderation team also wants to encourage all commenters to remember that, behind each username, there is a real person with real problems, looking for real solutions. It's also a part of the sitewide [Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette#wiki_please__do) philosophy: "[Remember the human](http://www.albion.com/netiquette/rule1.html)", and we'd like to adhere to it here.

Quick, one-off, and rude/negative comments generally tend to make these posters regret coming here, and it also hurts our sitewide credibility as a place to be open about your goals, financial mistakes / opportunities, and general discussion for improvement. Avoid the drama, offer goal-oriented objectives, be charitable with your time, and don't say anything that would "get you in trouble with HR".

Please use the "report" feature whenever you find a comment that violates the rules: and the entire moderation team is immediately notified. Reports are anonymous, non-intrusive, and are usually taken care of within minutes.

#Feedback

As always, the moderation team is welcome to feedback. Feel free to post it here or compose a message to /r/personalfinance to contact all the mods. In particular, if you recommend changes to the rules or Wiki pages, please include a draft of the actual text you would like to change or add. </TEXT>

<TITLE> My monthly alcohol expenditures for 1 year </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-13 16:42:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I now have one year of detailed expense tracking under my belt. It's been very helpful to identify areas for improvement in my budget. One interesting trend I found is [**My monthly alcohol expenses**](http://i.imgur.com/0oAPXP5.png). 

It seems to be inversely correlated to the weather!

Notable events:

1. Went on a cruise in March
2. In May I made a change and decided to drink cheaper whiskey (Now I buy cheap $22 1.75L bottles instead of classier $22 0.75L bottles)

The visibility into my own habits is going to help my make adjustments in 2015. My goal is to stay under $100 each month.

Has expense tracking given **you** visibility into anything that needs to change?

EDIT: On categorization: My "alcohol" is actually a subcategory of "Entertainment", not of "Food" (which is what Mint does by default). I find this is more reflective of where alcohol fits in my budget. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Expense Tracking: Giftcards, Coupons, Cash Back Rewards, etc. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-01-08 18:17:52 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> ##How do you manage these types of items? 

My purpose in expense tracking is to measure my true expenses, my consumption. Partially because this helps me set my budgets and plan for retirement. For this reason, I want to know the value of products I am purchasing, not just the number of dollars that come out of my account.

**Giftcards** - For things like VISA giftcards, I always track all expenses I make with them as if they were normal expenses. For most stores like Lowe's or Target, I also track it as if it were a normal expense. I'm often using the card to purchase things I normally would anyways. The only exception here would be if I got a giftcard for an obscure place or fancy restaurant that I would not normally purchase from. In this case I will *not* track it as a normal expense, since I am treating it as if I received the product or service itself as a gift.

**Coupons** I certainly don't take the time to track the true price of my goods before any coupons. I just reflect my whole grocery store final purchase price after sales and coupons as a "Groceries" expense. It would simply be too much work, and I assume that my shopping will always have some average amount of sales and coupons included. 

**Credit Card Cash Back rewards** I never treat this money as free money, so I always want to continue making sure I am still tracking the full value of my expenses. This is easy when the rewards are applied as a statement credit, because all of your expense transactions still stand as they are. It's a little more difficult for things like the Amazon card, with which you use the reward points as a discount on your purchase. In these cases, I make sure to modify the expense in my tracking spreadsheet to reflect the whole purchase price of the item before the rewards discount. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm slightly greater than 50% sure that Adnan did it. However, the fact that a couple "unlucky" incidents strung together all occur on the day Adnan's ex get killed is *not* evidence against him. (Even if those events themselves *are* evidence)

It's selection bias. If Adnan is innocent, then of COURSE there would be a bunch of bad luck events strung together, otherwise he wouldn't be in jail and this wouldn't be the case we were talking about. This is a one in a million case. So it makes sense that there would be some one in a million bad luck events for an innocent man to get convicted. </TEXT>

<TITLE> FAQ Submission: "My company offers an "after-tax 401k. Should I contribute to it?" </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-11-04 17:52:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've spent a lot of time over the past few weeks educating myself on "after-tax 401(k)"s These are different than, and sub-optimal to traditional pre-tax 401(k)'s, traditional IRAs, Roth 401k(s), and Roth IRAs which you should max out before considering contributions to an after-tax 401(k). (For clarity I should refer to them as "after-tax, *non-Roth*" 401(k)s, to distinguish them from Roth 401(k)s).

The basic 401(k) salary deferral limit of $17,500 applies to pretax and Roth contributions. But you can stuff in aftertax contributions to get up to a total of $52,000 if your company allows [2014 numbers].

Unlike a Roth 401k, in which earnings are *never* taxed, earnings (but not contributions) in an after-tax 401k will eventually be taxed at withdrawal at your marginal income tax rate. This will likely be higher than your long-term capital gains tax rate. For this reason many people would rather just invest in normal taxable accounts.

**However**, if you can quickly roll over your after-tax 401k contributions to a Roth IRA, any earnings it makes *there* are completely tax free. The IRS published an announcement in Sep 2014 ([Source](http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-54.pdf)) that makes it easy to roll the *contributions* portion of an after-tax 401k into a Roth IRA, and the *earnings* portion in a traditional IRA.

For people that work at companies that allow in-service distributions (even with a short waiting period), or people that are planning to leave their company within a few years, an after-tax 401k may be an easy way to get a lot more money into a Roth IRA where it will continue to grow completely tax free, while only a small amount (the *earnings*) needs to be rolled over to a traditional IRA

See the following images which better explain the scenario



Scenario | Explanation  | Image
---|---|----
I can take in-service distributions, or I will leave my company within a few years | In this situation, the after-tax 401(k) didn't accumulate much taxable "earnings" before I could roll it over into a Roth IRA where it will grow completely tax free | [Image 1](http://i.imgur.com/cuY1FfF.png)
I will remain at my company for a long time still, and can't take in service distributions | In this situation, my money spent a lot of time in the after-tax 401(k) gaining a substantial amount of *earnings*. When I withdraw the earnings (or roll them over to a traditional IRA and later withdraw it), I will owe my marginal income tax rate on it.  | [Image 2](http://i.imgur.com/1tN98hz.png)


Even if you cannot do in-service distributions and are not leaving your company very soon, there may be some people that would still benefit from after-tax 401(k)s instead of taxable investing. These are people that will have an extremely low marginal income tax rate in retirement (e.g. [the Mad Fientist](http://www.madfientist.com/retire-even-earlier/) ). Trading a 10% income tax instead of 0% LTCG tax on a big chunk of earnings may be a price worth paying to get a some more money into a Roth IRA above the annual contribution limit. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Did the IRS just give an extra $35k/yr of tax-free-growth saving space? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-10-27 19:39:54 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It appears that the IRS just announced a clarification that allows after-tax 401(k)s to be rolled over directly into Roth IRAs tax free. If I am not mistaken, this effectively changes after tax 401(k)s from "tax deferred" to truly "tax free" growth, just like a Roth IRA.

http://www.forbes.com/sites/ashleaebeling/2014/10/15/aftertax-401k-rollovers-advanced-version/

Of course, your employer has to offer an after tax 401k option.

[$52,000 - $17,500 = $34,500] 

EDIT:  I've further educated myself: after-tax 401ks will (hopefully) have earnings during the time you are still at the company. You must pay your marginal income tax rate on the earnings when you make a conversion to a Roth IRA. Therefore this is only REALLY advantageous if you are planning on leaving the company soon or if your company allows in-service distributions. That way you will quickly get the money into your Roth IRA, so the money spends as little time as possible making taxable gains in your after-tax 401k, and as much time as possible making tax free gains in your Roth IRA. </TEXT>

<TITLE> She said yes! Pictures and info on Moissanite engagement ring. </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [**2 picture album of a beautiful ring on a beautiful hand!**](http://imgur.com/a/Zx6ov)

My fiancee has always had a non-traditional style, and really loves rings with asymmetry. We saw a blue diamond ring in the Caribbean with the band style seen above (three prongs holding the gem, 1 from one side, 2 from the other), but it cost $17k. She wasn't particularly set on a diamond at all, and didn't want me to spend anywhere close to that. After researching moissanite (we like to call it by it's chemical name, "silicon carbide"), we got really interested.

Compared to diamond, moissanite has

* similar or superior optical qualities
* only slightly less hard (still much harder than most colored stones like sapphire)
* **more** tough than diamond (less prone to shattering or cleaving)
* first discovered in a meteorite, and common in star dust. 
* synthetic (yay science! Boo cruel diamond mine work conditions!)

I spent some time contacting custom jewelers over the internet, but got nervous about the two-liner responses. ("Sure we can do it. It'll be $X."). But after flipping through dozens of pages of more traditional style rings on [moissanite.com](http://www.moissaniteco.com/moissanite-engagement-rings-moissanite-engagement-rings-2-c-104_101.html), I found a stock band that had the *exact* band she wanted! It's model eng596. I got a huge-ass stone (equivalent to a 2.5 ct diamond), upgraded to "Forever Brilliant" moissanite (not sure what that actually got me), and a palladium band, for under $2.5k.

We are extremely happy with it. The stone has an extremely faint yellow tint when viewed from the side, but it it crystal clear white from the top and throws light beautifully.

If you are thinking about moissanite and nervous to pull the trigger, take this as one vote to go for it! </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Online multiplayer is awesome!** Previously I've beaten deity on single-player, and played tons of games with my friends plus AI. The problem with these games is that you can "take advantage" of the AI in certain ways. Most of our games are clinched when one player pays an AI to declare war on another. Also, we usually have to set aside 6+ hours to play.

I've just discovered that public multiplayer games with 6 players on a small map are awesome. I've had to switch my mindset a little bit though: "Winning" just means getting all the other players to quit! Most games only last 2-3 hours now. I've also been forced to be much more reactive with my gameplay, scout much more, and play flexible strategies. The politics and trash talking are a huge part of the fun as well. 

In case anyone is interested, I've discovered my new favorite civ: **The Aztecs**. My normal strategy is a 3 city empire focused on population and science. I get fucked because I always see how small of an army I can get by with, and get surprise-raided. The Aztecs have a jungle start bias which is great for my love of science. They also have an OP starting warrior unit, the Jaguar, which give me a couple advantages

1. Double movement in jungles and forests. Because of this, I build an early extra Jaguar or two instead of a scout. This gets my army up to a good kick-start to be better prepared for early defense, particularly since I will have an edge defending forested or jungled cities. 
2. Gain culture for each kill. Since I have 2-3 early jaguars, I go out hunting for barbarians. The early culture is huge, as well as the CS friends I will get for clearing so many barbarian encampments. They also heal a bit with each kill, making it easier to move on to the next kill. 
3. They keep *all* their bonuses when upgraded to swordsman  longswordsman, and so forth. No explanation necessary.

I'm even thinking about putting a point into Honor to give my jaguars extra culture and strength in their early barbarian hunting endeavors.

After this early phase, I switch back to my defensive, peaceful, science and population based strategy. 

Oh, If the opportunity presents itself, I also try to get the Sacred Path for +1 culture for jungle tiles. With Jaguars PLUS 1 pt in Honor PLUS Sacred Path, I just tear through the policy tree.
______________________
On an unrelated note: I have scoured the web, and it seems like STILL no one knows how the FUCK the difficulty settings work in multiplayer. If one player selects chieftain, one prince, and one deity, how are their happiness bonuses determined? How about the AI bonuses? How  How about the barbarians? No one can give an answer!!!  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Discussion and questions from a "new" PC Skyrim player. Balance, Expansions, Mods, etc </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-09-29 19:06:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi everyone! I purchased Skyrim when it first came out on steam, and put about 20 hours in. I'm pretty sure I quickly beat the college of Winterhold quest-line, became the archmage, then got frustrated by some bugged quest and quit.

I recently started back up and spent the 10 hours necessary to figure out how to install mods (which requires downloading 3 different programs like Boss, SKSE, MMM). I'm really just using bug patches and visual mods which make the game look *amazing*. I've put about 40 hours in so far and am blown away by the scale of this game. I love completing all the side quests.

I'm playing a heavy-armor wearing, sneaky mace-wielding archer who knows some illusion spells. 

**Balance**: Is there any mod that attempts to balance the skill leveling system so that there is no way to spam/grind certain skills? It ruins the immersion for me to *know* that I could sit here and make iron daggers for 2 hours to become a master, but not *want* to because I feel like I should be able to become a master without doing something completely unrealistic. Likewise, sneaking and stabbing greybeards in the back to level up "sneak". I'd love to become a master enchanter, but it just seems impossible without game-breaking grinding.

**Expansions** Because I love it so much, I'm thinking about shelling out for Dawnguard and Dragonborn. Are these worth it even if I am already level 37 and have done most of the quests in 4-5 cities? Will I have to go back through these cities and talk to everyone again to make sure I don't miss any new content?

Will I need to deactivate and reactivate all my mods after installing the expansions?

**World Building** This is just some praise for the developers. The beautiful scenes are amazing. I love it when I am exploring some underground dungeon that opens into a vast cavern with waterfalls and sunlight streaming in. I'm also amazed at the complexity of the quests. My favorite was [No One Escapes Cidhna Mine](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:No_One_Escapes_Cidhna_Mine). What seemed like a minor choice to go to jail instead of fighting the guards resulted in experiencing an entire new storyline and area inside the jail. someone in part of this quest line wanted me to kill an "innocent" person, and I was like "fuck that" and killed the quest giver instead. Of course the developers planned for that, which in fact resulted in everyone in town greeting me with new dialogue. There are many other similar examples.

Every once and a while I like to read the books in game as well, especially the ones that are carefully placed around relevant areas and add to the lore.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Collection of Car Loan Horror Stories from /r/pf </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-07-16 17:00:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **UPDATE** All future updates to this post will instead reside on the [wiki page](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/vehicles/horror).

I'm building a collection of personal anecdotes regarding car loans from this subreddit for future reference. The key learning is that many people "think" they can handle the monthly payments. But sure enough, something comes along a year or two later (they want to buy a house, they have a kid, their student loans come out of deferral, etc), and regret the car loan decision. Even worse, they often owe more on the car than it is worth! 

Certainly no offense is meant if your link is included here. The intent is to provide a resource that may help people learn from others' mistakes instead of repeating them. Newer material posted at the top. **Updated 13 May**

<TITLE> UPDATE: How to weigh index fund investing vs. extra mortgage payments with PMI </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-05-06 20:16:23 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> See [original post here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/234et6/how_to_weigh_index_fund_investing_vs_extra/)

I wanted to figure out an effective annual rate of return on my extra mortgage payments to speed up the elimination of my PMI payments. This would give me information to compare putting my money towards my mortgage vs investing elsewhere.

I've compared two series of cash flows, one with the normal mortgage payment schedule, and one with the extra payments until I get rid of PMI. 

The difference between the two cash flows is

* negative while I am making extra payments
* positive once I get to the point where I have paid off PMI earlier than I would have with the normal payment schedule and am now just paying P I
* 0 while I wouldn't be paying PMI anyways
* positive at the end of the loan which comes sooner because of all the extra principal payments up front

I can then use the [IRR function](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/irr-function-HP010062365.aspx) in Excel or Google spreadsheets to figure out the effective annual rate of return.

[**Here is my spreadsheet**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AvpV88qMbzoLdDZTaElra01pd0V5OVcwZjdpaTVYREE usp=sharing), which should be fairly easy to plug in your own numbers

In my case, my mortgage rate is **3.75%**, but while I have PMI, my effective annual return of extra payments is **4.9%** </TEXT>

<TITLE> Looking for a bike, mainly to be used for a 10 mile round trip commute to work </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-04-25 20:47:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello everyone! I'm interested in commuting to work, which is 10 miles round trip on paved suburban streets (2 school zones mean I go as fast on a bike as a car!). I'd also like to be able to pick up a bag or two of groceries, or go for a longer ride to a friends house (all paved streets) if I feel like it.

What "type" of bike am I even looking for? Is it a road bike? a "touring" bike? A hybrid? 

Can someone point me to some of the best bang-for-buck bikes on Amazon.com (I could look for bikes anywhere up to $1000)? I was looking at a [Diamondback Century 2](http://www.amazon.com/Diamondback-Bicycles-Century-700cm-Wheels/dp/B00FB6P486/ref=lh_ni_t?ie=UTF8 psc=1 smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER), but is that the type of thing I could put a rear wheel rack on, or even a trailer if I needed to? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> First time on this subreddit, so hello! My commute is perfect for biking: Only 5 miles each way, through suburban streets including two school zones (15 mph speed limit), so I figured I could make almost as good time on a bike as a car. 

Do you think the [Diamondback Century 2](http://www.amazon.com/Diamondback-Bicycles-Century-700cm-Wheels/dp/B00FB6P486/ref=lh_ni_t?ie=UTF8 psc=1 smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER) would be a good bike for its price point? It seems to have great reviews and good components. 

**Questions:**

1. Is this overboard for a sub-30 minute commute each way? However, I could imagine using it for longer trips to visit friends, etc.

2. Does anyone ever put bike racks over the rear wheel on this type of bike (for a quick trip to the grocery store), or a bike trailer?

3. It looks like it doesn't come with pedals. Any recommendations? Is there anything else I would need before this is ready to ride? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello, I'd like to be able to make a smart decision on making aggressive extra payments to my mortgage principle to achieve 80% LTV and eliminate PMI vs investing in index funds in taxable accounts (assuming I've already maxed 401k and IRA contributions). I know the risk profiles of these two options are different, but I need to have some numbers to be able to compare my guaranteed mortgage payment to the risky 7-8% return I could get from the stock market.


My mortgage (conventional) is at 3.75% with a $1,146 monthly principle and interest payment. I also have $121 PMI each month. Can I simply calculate what my *effective* interest rate is with PMI using a simple calculator to add the PMI to the principle and interest rate? IF I do, I get about a 4.6% interest rate (the rate that gives a monthly payment of $1,267).


Does that math work out? I'm sort of treating the PMI payment as extra interest. Or is it somehow different since once I get to 80% LTV, the PMI disappears completely?

**tl;dr** Can I simply pretend my PMI payment is extra interest to calculate an *effective* interest rate of my loan? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm planning a party with a lot of beginner and a few intermediate gamblers, and I'd like to deal craps, but fudge the payouts a bit to make the odds exactly 50-50. This is easy with the 1-roll bets like the field, but does anyone know how to do this for the other bets like the hardways and the pass line?

EDIT: I guess I could just pay the [true odds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craps#Bet_odds_and_summary) for all bets, it is just cumbersome for the pass/come bets...

EDIT #2: I'm just going to pay true odds for all bets but the pass/come bets. For these during the come-out, if a 12 is rolled, the player gets to keep half their bet. This results in a house edge of only 0.03%

EDIT #3 oh, and pay 3-to-1 for 12's and 1's on the Field bet </TEXT>

2) The current period, where dark energy is enough to overcome gravity, so the expansion is speeding up.

Did the "inflation" period simply slow down until period #1 above? Or was there some other force that "ended" inflation? </TEXT>

<TITLE> I understand why a Roth IRA is "tax advantaged," but not why a traditional IRA is. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-03-12 21:50:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> With a Roth IRA, my contributions are already taxed when I put them in the Roth IRA, and there are no taxes at withdrawal, so all interest/dividends/capital gains are truly tax free.

However, with a traditional IRA, my contributions *and* my interest/dividends/capital gains are taxed as regular income when I withdraw at retirement, correct? Therefore the only advantage is the "delay" of this taxation, paying it later instead of now. How does that help me (assuming no change in tax bracket or tax rate between now and retirement)?

**Edit** Maybe I just figured it out myself: If I use a taxable account, and I earn interest when I am 26, that interest is taxed *that* year. However, in a traditional IRA, that money that I would have had to use to pay taxes instead continues to compound for 34 more years. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In addition to the traditional before-tax 401(k) savings option, my company offers an after tax option. I'm currently putting away 15% before tax, and would like to increase my after-tax savings (I keep hearing about the advantages of Roth IRAs for young people who will likely move into higher tax brackets). Company matches 4.5% of total pay from either before or after-tax.


The after-tax contributions go into the same account, which has some pretty good low fee options (large and small cap and international funds with less than 0.1% Gross Expense Ratio).


My Question: **Do I have any reason not max out my employers retirement saving options before opening IRAs?**

* 3 points per game/set win

<TITLE> Renting rooms to lodgers in my house: tax impact? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-01-08 20:35:10 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Last year I was single, renting, with no dependents and one salaried job. I always take the standard deduction. This year I bought a house with June with a mortgage, and began renting two bedrooms to three people for a set price (utilities included) each month. These are close friends of mine, and they are effectively renting use of the entire house (They have furniture and TV's in the finished basement and living room, they cook in the kitchen they have guests over, etc. Edit: they also proportionally use even more storage space in the garage and basement than I do). They have signed lodger agreements that document their shared use of the home.

I've read articles like [this](http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/tax-issues-when-renting-out-room-your-house.html) and [this](http://homeguides.sfgate.com/tax-deductions-renting-out-room-house-35556.html), and have a few questions for anyone with experience:

1. Obviously I want to balance my rental income with as many deductible expenses as possible. My plan is to pro-rate a lot of household expenses by 0.75. (4 people total including myself, 3 are renters). This gets me a better deal than prorating by square footage of bedrooms, and makes more sense anyways due to the shared use of the common areas. Is this ok, and is it legal?

2. What expenses can I prorate? I'm thinking of HOA fee, mortgage interest (is deducting it for my lodgers any different than deducting it for my self? Or do I just list it all as a single deduction?), repairs, home owners insurance, and utilities. How about property taxes?

3. What documentation is required for these prorated expenses?

4. The second link I posted above mentioned deducting depreciation on the house. How do I determine how much of the purchase price was for the house vs the land?

5. Should I just do my own taxes with something like H R block, or is it worth it for me to hire a professional?

6. Can I itemize these rental deductions, yet still take the standard deduction? I have never had any itemized deductions in the past, and my mortgage interest will probably be less than the standard deduction since I only owned the home for half the year.

Any other tips for someone in my shoes? I know it's a lot of questions.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> I just booked a 7 day Eastern Caribbean Cruise with bitcoin </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-01-06 21:16:26 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Through reddit, I found a travel agent that books trips with bitcoin. His name is Jeff Gross, and he runs [btcVacations](http://btcvacations.com/). I found him through [this reddit thread](http://w3.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1s0c4t/has_anyone_used_btcvacations/).

The website isn't all that hot, but you can see by Jeff's comment in that post that it is a prototype to gauge interest. I was slightly hesitant to send bitcoins to a random stranger on the internet, but /u/slvrtng420 's testimony in that post, the fact that Jeff's full name and phone number were published, plus my initial communications with Jeff made me willing to take the plunge. Additionally, My Google Fu revealed the instagram account of a Jeff Gross with pictures of tropical islands and what-not, as well as his non-BTC related travel booking website, [JG Sun and Sail](http://20028123.travsearch.com/travel)

**My experience**

I didn't use his website at all; I emailed him directly with the cruise I was interested in. He allayed some of my fears with additional testimony (granted, all of which could be made up), and informed me that after initially reserving the cruise based on information I provide, he would send me a CoinBase invoice to request payment in BTC.

The price he quoted me matched what I got on all the normal cruise booking sites, but he then informed me of a special deal for residents of my state that would get me a "large interior stateroom" for slightly cheaper than a normal "interior stateroom".

He sent me a booking confirmation pdf from the cruise line to confirm that all my information was correct, and then sent me a CoinBase invoice. I paid with bitcoin through coinbase, and Jeff promptly sent me the finalized reservation.

Finally, I logged into my account on the cruise line's website to confirm that indeed I was reserved, and started booking show reservetions, etc.

All-in-all it went very smoothly with prompt responses from Jeff. I'm excited to get out of this North Eastern US winter for a week in early March, and even more excited to have used it as an easy way to cash out some of my bitcoin earnings (way too much of my portfolio is in BTC after the appreciation in the past half year).

**TL;DR** Everything went well, cruise booked, Jeff got me a slightly larger room for a slightly cheaper price </TEXT>

I don't quite understand how to get the most out of ArmA III (my first entry into the series). I hear a lot of talks about mods. Are they just single player mods?

<TEXT> My friend and I play FFA multiplayer matches on standard maps with 6 AI. We dislike that the miltiplayer higher difficulties (emporer / immortal) usually result in

* AI with loads of scouts and warriors running all over the map early
* A big disadvantage for us in getting early wonders
* Not much challenge in late-mid and late game.

We just started a game on Prince with the following teams:

1. Him

2. Me

3. **Two** AI

4. **Two** AI

5. **Two** AI

Our hope was to give us a better chance at early wonders and good early settlement locations, while giving a sustained challenge throughout the game due to the AI getting shared research (does it really effectively result in 2x science?) and armies. 

Has anyone else tried this? What do you think? What will the impact be on World Congress and Victory Conditions? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I normally start with Liberty to get an early settlement in a good jungle location, but still end up playing pretty "tall" with 3-5 cities. I don't have any data, but I feel like a few early trade routes between my cities for +4 food is really OP, especially early game where the opportunity cost is just ~5 gpt if you traded with another civ or CS. 

The internal trade route is really playing for the future, setting yourself up for success later, while the gold routes seem like instant gratification. Why not put those off until later, with cargo ships and buildings + social policies that increase gold per trade route? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Why is there such pervasive hate for facebook on reddit? I'm a 25 year old male and I love facebook. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-05-24 19:48:35 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am an 25 year old engineer, and I consider facebook one of the technological tools that has added the most value to my life with the least amount of work.

I check facebook about 40 times a day, and spend an average of 30 minutes to an hour on the site every day. My facebook is like a blog plus so much more. 

I love to have deep discussions on current events, technology, religion, and philosophy with my friends and acquaintances. It is easy to prompt this by posting anything from a news article link to a lengthy status update with my opinions on recent current events. Posts of mine regularly get comment chains of 50+ comments, with people like the teachers from my Christian high school, friends from the atheist organization I was a part of in college, conservatives, liberals, and family members.


**What about all the petty, annoying bullshit that people post?**

I never unfriend anyone. I am friends with highschool kids that hung out at the pool I lifeguarded at 6 years ago. I am friends with my girlfriend's aunt. For all of these people that post petty or uninteresting things, I select the option that allows "only important" updates from them to appear on my feed. 


**Events**

For me, there is no easier way to organize a party. Literally 99.9% of the people I would invite to a party are on facebook. The event function on facebook allows me to organize parties with great ease, including directions to my place, posting pictures of the party theme, and tracking RSVPs. I plan weekly dinners amongst friends, raging parties, Magic the Gathering drafts, and surprise birthday parties. 


**Apps and Games**

I don't install any, and I take 5 seconds to block all apps that I am invited to, and I block all future app invitations from any friends that send me an invite. Easy-peasy


**So what's the deal?**

At the risk of pissing everyone off, are all of the facebook haters just butthurt that they don't have anyone to add them as facebook friends? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been working with a buyer's agent to find my first home. He's been great so far, and he just helped me sign my agreement of sale on a fantastic townhome this morning. However, his company's business model is as a "one-stop shop," and they want to sell me my mortgage. They have pre-approved me for a 30 year conventional ($253k) with 5% down, and they are quoting 3.65% interest rate (good credit, high 700's). I bet I can find a slightly lower rate if I shop around, but I imagine there will also be some benefit for having his expertise on the mortgage paperwork, particularly since my credit union is in another state.

What would you guys recommend? My agent said it was fine if I found another lender, but he did hint that he wouldn't be able to help me as much with the paperwork. I don't even really know what it all entails though. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I could use some advice on mana sources for two colored casual decks </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have a lot of good cards from the last 3 blocks, but my play group doesn't do much do much "netdecking" (purchasing singles), rather, we just build decks with what we have from lots of drafting, fat packs, starter packs, etc. I have lots of great two color decks, but could use some help knowing how to set up my mana. 

Assume my default is 12 lands of color A, and 12 lands of color B. Assuming I have no access to rare lands, under what conditions should I substitute any of the following, and in what order of preference?

* Keyrunes
* Guildgates
* Terramorphic Expanses
* Evolving Wilds
* Mana Myr (gold Myr, etc)
* Palladium Myr
* Everflowing Chalice

For the nonland cards listed, can I substitute them for lands? (i.e. just make a deck with 20 lands and 4 Everflowing Chalices?)

Thanks! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I understand the value of third party votes. It gives them and their ideas more credibility for the next election, and the election after that. It can definitely shape the future even though there is no chance of a win this year. The question is, how MUCH can it shape the future, and what are you risking by that vote?

There is a 50% chance that the entire election will come down to the result of the Ohio vote. See "Tipping Point States" On the right sidebar, [here](http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/)

When that much power is concentrated in so few people, every vote counts. If you have a preference for one of the two evils, I challenge you to vote for them. I will be voting for Gary Johnson in PA, his message will be heard. But please don't allow your idealism to put us in a worse spot than necessary for the next four years. Consider economic policy, foreign policy, healthcare, and personal liberty. But more importantly, consider how likely it is that either of the candidates will have a significant effect on those policies. For some, policies the choice of president may be huge. For others, it my not matter at all.

<TITLE> First tattoo tomorrow... artist is making me nervous about placement </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-08-30 00:03:59 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm getting the first session of my first tattoo tomorrow. It's a black and gray tree with shading, probably about 7" X 12". My first choice for placement is my rib cage / side, but the tattoo artist sent me the following email:

 Its cool. We will do what you decide on in the end. I cannot remember if this is your first tattoo or not, if it is I would definitely advise against the side unless you have a good pain tolerance. I have had more than one person get their first tattoo on the side, particularly a big one and find it hurts more than they expected. If someone is constantly moving it makes it really difficult to do a good job and they find it to be a very unpleasant experience. Other places really don't hurt that much and would get done quicker, which would also translate into a cheaper price. Its your call, I just want to give you the heads-up. As soon as we start we are committed to finishing it. I just want it to look good and for you to be happy with it. 

This obviously makes me nervous. I don't know how I compare with others in pain tolerance. I have a lot of will power, and have always been confident and comfortable going into surgeries, etc. I deal well with sustained *uncomfortable* things, like LASIK, but I have no idea with sustained pain. If I take my fingernail, and press really hard on the underside of my forearm and scratch hard back and forth, I could EASILY stand that much pain. I just tried taking a thumbtack and scratching it along my shin so that it scraped up a little skin. This hurt a LOT, and would probably be near my threshold for sustained pain.

Does anyone have any advice? I don't want to go with non-favorite placement just because of a few hours of pain. I feel like if other people can do it, I should be able to as well.

(If it matters, I am male and fairly skinny. not too much between my skin and the bone)

I need encouragement and stories from people who have done something similar.  Is there any reason *not* to do it? How many people do it and then end up regretting it? Is there a subreddit for people that have done such a thing? 

I've got about $8k in savings, no debt, and a just bought a reliable car. It would probably cost me $1k to break my apartment lease.

<TEXT> **My original post on facebook:**

Ok here we go. If you are interested in Will's controversial post of the week, watch this video:

http://youtu.be/wJR3keih6CQ (warning: violence)

It would be best if you watch the whole thing, but at least watch a minute at the beginning and another 30 seconds starting around 4:00. I'm interested in hearing about the emotions and thoughts evoked in your brain over the course of those 5 minutes.

Now I want you to read four verses in the Old Testament. Open your Bible and read Numbers 15:32-36 in any translation you please (or read it here: http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=numbers+15%3A32-36 version=NIV) Notice the explicit instructions from God. (Not a priest, not Moses, God himself).

What do you think?

**His Response**

This is in response to Will's controversial post of 6/21/12 about an instance of stoning, looking at Muslims stoning people accused of adultery and paralleled to an instance in the Bible of a man being stoned for gathering wood on the Sabbath (Numbers 15:32-36).  As a disclaimer, I don't claim to know God's way of doing things, but this is my own thoughts on the matter (Isaiah 55:9).  I wrote it in a post because it was too long to fit inside comments.

 

While gathering wood does not seem like a sin worthy of a brutal death via stoning, I don't believe it was the action itself, but rather the implications behind it that were overly offensive.  God had commanded the people not to do any work on the Sabbath.  This man was quite directly opposing God's command, and if he had not been punished, the people would have seen that there is no consequence for breaking the Law handed down from God.  This would have quickly escalated into many more acts of disobedience of increasing severity.  This people was still young in their following of God, it was early in the journey and the standards and boundaries had to be set early.  However, from what I can see, this is not so much a view of the goodness/evilness of God and His commands, but rather a view of how bad sin is to a holy, perfect, and just God.  The Bible clearly states "The wages of sin is death" (Romans 6:23) and that has always been the case.  Even the first sin had a  consequence of death (see Genesis 2:16-17, 3:21).

 

The Israelites at that time did not have the new covenant of grace through the death of Christ, but had the old covenant of following the Law.  I understand that this all sounds pretty cold and heartless, but I think that is because of our differing perspectives.  You see man as supreme, as the most important, while I see God as supreme and most important.  And this my perspective is either correct or horribly wrong depending on whether or not Christianity is true.  The same goes with any other religion, they would be either right or horribly wrong depending on if their religion is true. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok I know you guys are all probably talking about it right now, but here is what I know: Armarsh and I were fixing up water spawn and dragon16505122 was chilling with us as we were replanting dirt, starting the farm up, etc. Then benislav comes along and is staring at armarsh with his bow out. 

armarsh says something like "ummm what are you doing ben?"
ben says "do you like kfc"? after a little bit, ben shot Armarsh and armarsh says "um who shot me? and ben said "me" and started attacking armarsh. then dragon pitched in as well against armarsh. I came to try to help him but i have the shittiest stuff ever. we ended up both dying. 

I know mods probably don't care about internal disputes, there was no cheating, so they probably won't verify any of this. but this is the truth.

Armarsh and I had just come back from a big expedition in the nether, we had gotten our first ghast tears and a stack and a half of blaze rods. Also,  I hope you enjoy my efficiency, unbreaking silk touch pick Ben. That was the best thing I ever got in this game. Never thought a fellow water clanner would take it. Fuck you.

EDIT: Whelp, it looks like we were vindicated. Ben was the traitor, also betrayed the sanctuary.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am slightly disappointed in my fellow heathens on the visceral response to this phrase, particularly encouraging the reporting of the video for "hate speech".  Even though it is a disgusting, bigoted, ignorant statement, it is an *extremely* weak example of a statement that

incite[s] violence or prejudicial action against or by a protected individual or group, or [...] disparages or intimidates a protected individual or group [from the Wikipedia article on hate speech]

Sure, homosexuals are a "protected group" in the US. So are Christians and Muslims. 

So it comes down to this: if Rick Perry's video should be reported for hate speech, so should these:

[Hitchens saying that religion "should be treated with ridicule and hatred and contempt"](http://youtu.be/mQorzOS-F6w) (within the first minute)

Most of these: [Fuck Muslims](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=fuck+muslims oq=fuck+muslims aq=f aqi= aql= gs_sm=e gs_upl=10405l10805l0l11045l3l3l0l0l0l1l232l369l0.1.1l2l0)
and [Fuck Christians](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=fuck+christians oq=fuck+christians aq=f aqi= aql= gs_sm=e gs_upl=232298l233473l0l233601l10l10l0l8l0l0l86l159l2l2l0)

Now go ahead and report Perry's video if you want. Maybe it is the Libertarian in me, but I will **not** be reporting this video. Honestly, I support Rick Perry's right to say those things, in the same way I support Hitchens explicitly inciting hatred towards religion in the above video. I say *fuck* "protected groups". *Fuck* the idea of "hate speech". Free speech ftw. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> In the chapter "A science of Good and Evil", he presents a very interesting argument in the support of torture in any case where we would also rationalize collateral damage in times of war.

I was just wondering if you guys agree with this. In general, the more liberal a person is, I find the less likely they are to to advocate torture. Yet Sam's argument is hard for me to refute.

EDIT: he presents much of the same argument [here](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sam-harris/in-defense-of-torture_b_8993.html)

2nd EDIT: He further discusses and clarifies his views [here](http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/why-id-rather-not-speak-about-torture1/) </TEXT>

<TITLE> A challenge to atheists </TITLE>
<DATE> 2011-06-30 16:39:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> As a recent convert to atheism, I have noticed a tendency in the community that I think does more harm than good. The tendency to attack the *weakest arguments* of the opponent. We make fun of the obviously retarded thing that stupid Christians say on facebook. We make fun of the ignorance of young-earth creationists.  However, these are not the things that will win people over. We need to logically and systematically destroy the *best arguments* of the opponent. 

I want to see you people read things like "The Edge of Evolution" By Michael Behe, and point out the errors and logical flaws in THAT, in which he lays out a "reasonable" argument (or at least one that generally follows logical thought patterns) for the improbability of the evolution of mammals by random mutation and natural selection, based on analyzing the genetic mutation rates in bacteria. Sure, it takes more time to do, it is much more difficult that poking fun at our brainwashed great-aunts or Jehovah's witnesses. However, this kind of debate is what will really get the smart, intelligent reasonable theists to change their minds. 

Just food for thought. Also, thanks for the great community. r/atheism has opened my eyse to some great stuff.

(And by no means do we have to stop laughing at the ignorant. I would just like to see a little more balance, and an attempt to move away from lumping ALL Christians in with the least common denominator, like the young-earth creationist who believes in faith healing and noah's ark. As stated in a recent thread, "Firstly, it's not an intellectual challenge. It's like playing football against a ten-year-old.")

EDIT: Ok Ok, you all have good points. Maybe all arguments for theism are bad. I'm just saying that there are people out there who ARE trying to base their arguments for theism of logic, however flawed it is.  </TEXT>

* What exactly is the minimum payout value? What does it mean? Why wouldn't I set it as low as possible?
* I currently have an "estimated reward" of 0.15". When does this move from being estimated to my balance? When we find a block?

This deck takes advantage of the fact that I will have a lot of creatures on the battlefield and a lot in the graveyard

**Questions / Advice Needed**

Is eldrazi monument useful in this deck? I will have lots of creatures, but will I have enough?

Should I reallly have 3 mortician beetles?

Is there a better 5-drop that mitotic slime?

Anything useful in my "maybe board"? particularly 3-drops?

Nim Deathmantle is great because it lets me sacrifice a creature to birthing pod, but get it right back. However, is it too slow? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> What If I have [Near-Death Experience](http://magiccards.info/query?q=near-death v=card s=cname) out and an odd number of life points (Can be done in a variety of ways), and activate an ability that requires 1 phyrexian mana multiple times at the end of my opponent's turn?

Does this work? And more importantly, is it a viable win-condition? I feel like throwing 4 near-death experience's in a deck that already has [immolating souleater](http://magiccards.info/nph/en/139.html) or any other card with an activated ability costing 1 phyrexian mana could be good. Especially if you have something like [gut shot](http://magiccards.info/query?q=gut+shot v=card s=cname) to do 1 (or 3) damage to yourself. </TEXT>

<TITLE> My first deck worth posting. </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It may seem a little random.

http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/birthing-pod-metalcraft/

My thoughts:

**Interactions I like:**

* Birthing Pod / Nim Deathmantle: With 6 mana, I can sac a creature for Birthing Pod's effect, and bring it right back with Nim Deathmantle.
* Birthing Pod / Postmortem Lunge: I can bring a creature back from the graveyard (i would normally only keep it until end of turn), then after attacking with it, sac it for another creature I can keep permanently. 
* Birthing Pod / Mortician Beetle: Birthing Pod is a great tool for building up the beetle
* Fauna Shama / Vengevine: Obvious
* Perilous Myr / Birthing Pod: Some easy damage
* Birthing Pod / Phryexian Obliterator: I don't necessarily need 4 swamps to get him out
* Eldrazi Spawn or Memnites / Birthing pod: Easy to get my beetle or bird out.

**Other thoughts**

* Sheoldred and Postmortem Lunge both work well in a deck that will have a lot of creatures in the graveyard
* It is *ridiculously* easy to get Vengevine, Glissa, and Ezuri's Brigade out with the Green Sun's Zeniths and Birthing Pods

**Questions**

* What do you think about the mana ramp with the myr? I like it because it also helps me maintain metalcraft for my Ezuri's Brigade
* Clone Shell: Is this guy any good at all? I feel like this would be the kind of deck that could make him work
* Signal Pests: worth it? It's a creature heavy deck, and i can use birthing pod on them
* Perilous Myrs: keep them?
* Pilgrim's eyes: My thought behind this was to get land, to chump block flyers (i don't have much other aerial defense), and to turn into vengevines or ezuri's brigades
* Skinrender: Kind of random, but if I have a birthing pod and a CMC 3 out, and I need some removal (say on a flyer or something), I might choose him instead of one of the other CMC 4's (now that I think about it... that doesn't seem like a likely scenario. The other CMC 4's are all so much better)
* Despise: I don't know why I have this here, but I like it.
* Is it really worth having Green Sun's Zenith just for 2x Glissa, 2x Vengevine, and 2x Ezuri's Brigade?
* Should I even bother with metalcraft? If I take out the two Ezuri's Brigades, I unconstrain myself with all the artifacts, and could fill some of the spaces with more removal, maybe some green eldrazi spawn generators, or something else. I have most of the commons and uncommons from the last two blocks. Is there anyway I could use my Emrakul?

I'm making this deck as competitive as possible with what I have. I don't have any more of the rares in this deck. Following are some other cards I was considering (see the "Maybeboard" at the above link for pictures of the cards):

* Wall of Tanglecord
* More perilous Myrs
* More Skinrenders
* Black Removal spells
* Arrogant Bloodlord
* Troll Ascetic
* Reassembling Skeleton (could be nice to get my CMC 3's out)
* Cadaver Imp
* Leyline of Vitality
* Protean Hydra
* Kalonian Behemoth
* 2x Mortivore
* Kuldotha Forgemaster - Blightsteel Colossus

Well, now that I spewed all of my thoughts onto the page, let me know what you think! So far it is Standard Legal, but It's not likely I will actually play competitively anyways.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I currently have a credit card from a credit union that I have used for ~3 years. I've used it very responsibly. I'm looking for another one with good cash back "rewards". I just got a pre-approval letter from Chase stating the following:

* $100 initial "cash back" (a $100 check after my first use of the card)
* 1% cash back on all purchases
* 5% cash back on up to $1,500 spent each quarter in select "bonus" categories (gas, groceries, dining, depending on the quarter). In other words, UP TO $300 additional cash back per year.

Is this good? Can I do better? Where do I look?

<TITLE> Thoughts from a new atheist </TITLE>
<DATE> 2011-04-18 19:09:02 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Thoughts on morality and altruism from a new atheist:

I think most of us would agree that we are both culturally and biologically predisposed to some degree of altruism. We will, at times, perform some action that increases the general well-being of another individual, while reducing our own. For example, giving money to a homeless man, stopping to help change a flat tire, jumping on a grenade to save our squad-mates, etc. In addition, we frequently *abstain* from other actions that would increase our well-being while decreasing that of another individual. For example in general, we don't steal, we don't kill, we don't rape. 

To what extent can we go against these biological and cultural tendencies? Can we download movies and music for free, even though it hurts the record labels, RIAA, and even the artists? Can we lift up the scale with a finger while weighing our produce at the grocery store (it doesn't *really* matter to the owners of the store does it?!)? Can we pocket a roll of Lifesavers in the grocery store checkout? Can we commit insurance fraud? What about the kind of scam they try to pull in Office Space? Can we poison our annoying neighbor's food so we don't have to deal with them any more?

Granted, we have to deal with the chance of discovery and the guilt, but aren't there some cases in which these are not enough to counter-act the benefit we gain in a risk based analysis? So is our biological predisposition really strong enough to keep us from doing these things? Can't we *choose* to go against our biological tendency (to work for the benefit of others) and instead perform an action the benefits ourselves? We choose to go against what is natural in other areas (strict diet regimens, rigorous workout routines, etc) that provide us benefit.

Is it the strength of this tendency towards altruism really all that separates burglars from law-abiding citizens? Serial Killers from charity workers?

I suppose this is sort of a train-of-thought post, but if anyone has additional thoughts, I'd love to hear them! </TEXT>

<TEXT> For example, I have played a [Volition Reins](http://magiccards.info/query?q=!Volition%20Reins) on an opponent's creature (creature 1) last turn. He has one remaining creature (creature 2). If I attack with his creature 1, then play [Aura Finesse](http://magiccards.info/query?q=aura+finesse v=card s=cname) to move the Volition Reins from creature 1 to creature 2, what happens?

I assumed that it works out like this: my opponent has no eligible blockers, because creature 1 (which he now controls) is already attacking, and creature 2 is now under my control.

So the question is: Can creature 1 remain an "attacking creature" even though it is now back under my opponent's control? </TEXT>

<TITLE> The problem of the "Arms Race" in casual MTG: Any solutions? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2010-12-21 17:25:42 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The "arms race" is what I call the occurance where each member of a casual play group spends more and more money on cards in order to construct better decks than the other members. 

To give you a better idea, I'll introduce you to the members of my casual play group:

* Myself: expendable income. Began playing magic this summer. I have probably spent $150-200 on Eldrazi, Worldwake, M10, and M11 booster packs and "starter" decks.
* Buddy 1: no expendable income (living paycheck-to-paycheck). Began last year, but in a similar card position as myself
* Buddy 2: expendable income. had played ~6 years ago, and just got back into MTG. similar card position as myself and Buddy 1.

Currently, we all make decks that are roughly equivelant in strength. we have a blast playing together, and did an M11 bosster box draft. Our current strategy to avoid the "arms race" has been an unspoken rule that no one puchases card singles. However, we are getting to the point that purchasing booster packs is a waste of money due to the fact that we probably already have all the commons and uncommons. If we decide to start purchasing card singles online, the quality of the decks will be much more related to the expendable income of the player, instead of the deck construction strategy of the player (the current condition).

What can we do to avoid the arms race? Should we just quit purchasing cards until the new series comes out? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Ore Distribution Idea... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2010-10-04 23:47:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I think the distribution algorithm for the following items should vary by area: (maybe by "chunk", or maybe by an even larger area, like biome when they are implemented)

Ore frequency (The number of ore blocks per volume)
Ore distribution (The vertical level at which each ore type occurs at)
Cave frequency
Cave distribution
Lava/Water distribution
Lava/water frequency

Example: Maybe at spawn diamond is fairly common at 15 blocks above bedrock. Maybe 6 minutes west it is very common at 34 blocks above bedrock.

I think this would really encourage exploration, and it would allow for coal mines in coal rich areas, diamond mines in diamond rich areas, etc. Also, depending on Notch's coding method, this should not be too hard to implement.

What do you guys think? Notch, if you are around, do you have any plans for something like this?

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Often the times when I would most like to be carrying my concealed handgun are the times that I am going into the city to hit up some bars. How does r/guns feel about carrying while drinking?

I haven't made a set rule, but my personal alcohol limit in the past has been higher for carrying a gun than for driving a car. I won't drive after more than 3-4 drinks over a couple of hours, but I often "feel" comfortable carrying a gun up until about 6-8 drinks over the course of an evening.

Is going by my "feel" wise in this situation? I suppose it basically comes down to a risk analysis: Increased risk of mistakes vs. increased risk of needing to defend myself due to the environment.

Notes:

* I live in a state where there is no law regarding concealed carry in drinking establishments or while drinking.
* I am not prone to violence at all, even while drinking
* I understand that having alcohol in my blood stream would greatly complicate legal matters in case I ever do need to use it. However, this isn't a make-or-break for me. Better to be judged by 12 than carried by 6.

<TEXT> Did you love the feeling of depth and history in the Lord of the Rings? The subtle references to "the elder days" and "the long ages past, before the changing of the world"?

If you didn't know, Tolkien wrote volumes and volumes of histories that delve deeper into his fantasy world. I challenge you to read the [Silmarillion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Silmarillion), which covers thousands of years and hundreds of characters, really fleshing out the background of the Lord of the Rings. If you felt like you got glimpses of something richer and fuller behind the Lord of the Rings, this book let's you get a taste of it. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Question regarding revolver jams </TITLE>
<DATE> 2010-04-11 06:04:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This has now happened 4-5 times when firing .38 special rounds in my Ruger SP101 chambered for .357 magnum. I'll fire a shot or two, and then the trigger will simply not pull. To be precise, it pulls about 10% of the way back (double action), and then stops, after the cylinder turns ever so slightly. If I try to manually cock the hammer, I can not pull it back. If I try to open the cylinder, I have to really force it out hard.

Obviously something is physically stopping the cylinder from rotating. Is it possible that the cheap white box winchester .38 FMJ ammo I am using is not correctly sized? The rim is to thick?

It really makes me nervous that it could jam in a situation that I might really need it.

EDIT: The binding is not consistent, and once I unload the firearm it dry fires perfectly. Reloading with new cartridges removes the problem as well. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Huge problem in SC2 AI </TITLE>
<DATE> 2010-04-09 01:33:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> What the hell is with ranged units AI? If I have 20 roaches and I order them to attack an enemy building, the front roaches will stop immediately as soon as they reach the edge of their range, forming a giant wall for the rear roaches to get around. Sometimes they will just run back and forth for a good 10 seconds when in tight quarters, without ever dealing any damage. They NEED to make it so there is some optimization algorithm. Sure, it's good for them to run around to the edge to make a good arc if it's quick, but the front units also need to be willing to take a step forward so their buddies can get in range behind them in some cases.

Edit: All good points about the fact that we don't want ALL the fighting and positioning to be controlled by AI. We still want something to do ourselves!

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Some buddies and I are taking approximately a 2,700 mile round trip for our college spring break. I was always taught that the cost of mileage on a car was composed of two parts: gas, and car wear.

My car cost me about $3000, and I expect to spend about $2-3000 on maintenance and repair over the course of an estimated 100,000 miles. This comes out to about 6 cents a mile, while gas probably accounts for 15 cents a mile.

Is it for some reason more appropriate to ask for gas money but not the rest? $0.06 X 2,700 miles =$162 </TEXT>

<TEXT> In fact, if the Milky Way were reduced to the size of the continental United States, our sun would be 7 micrometers in radius, The size of a *white blood cell*, not a period as the original poster said. Our whole solar system (radius of Pluto's orbit, yes I know it's not a planet) would be 6 cm, just slightly smaller than a tennis ball.


If we choose to set the size of the sun at 1 mm (the size of a period?), pluto would be 8.75 meters away, and the galaxy would have a radius of 690,000 *km*... let's see that's... THE ACTUAL SIZE OF OUR SUN!!!!! holy fuck. I don't know if any trivia fact has ever truly made me short for breath before.

Pluto: average distance from the sun - 6.089E12 meters

Sol: equatorial radius - 6.955E8 meters

Milky Way: equatorial radius - 4.8E20 meters

<TITLE> I finally have some disposable income. I'm thinking about starting investing, and am looking for advice. See text below. </TITLE>

<TEXT> I have never purchased stock before, and would like to begin. I am particularly looking for advice on investment/diversification strategies, and suggestions about good discount internet brokers. Also, I've been reading a little bit about ETFs. What are the reasons to invest with a mutual fund when ETFs are available, and seem so much easier and cheaper?

More information about me to help you:

I am 21 years old, with 1 year of college left. Tuition for the next year is not a problem, and job prospects after graduation are good. I'm looking to invest  around $3000 this summer. I have a medium to high tolerance for risk.

I'd love to be able to learn from the experience of other reddit investors! </TEXT>
