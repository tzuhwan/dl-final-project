<TEXT> I have this problem too(Currently a pre calc student). My teacher would tell me how certain equations would look on a graph, and how certain parts of it would dictate transformations(the ones only possible with root, power, exponential, absolute value functions, etc) and I would think to myself, "Why does that work?" and instead of doing the assigned work for that period, I would just ponder to myself for an answer until I either got it, or the period ended. I'm not doing too well in that class right now. </TEXT>

My parents constantly drone about what I do now will affect what I do later on in life and my job, but I don't seem to care. I don't know for what purpose I live. I feel like a machine going on and on about my day, and I don't know what to do about it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree with that point. But I'm also supporting the point that not even popping the bubble would've been a better option than evading the team with the rainmaker. You and your teammate should not have popped the bubble, The bubble shouldn't have been popped. Just because your teammate was shooting it doesn't mean you had to. You were both in the wrong.

Edit: I agree your teammate was the one who screwed up the match, but just saying next time you are in such a situation, don't pop the bubble. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, unless the other team can make it to the rainmaker in 10 seconds, you should've just waited it out. If they COULD get to it in 10 seconds, you should just throw bombs at them while they are shooting the bubble or flank them when they pop it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry to hear about your troubles at work. I hope it gets better.

I use Splatoon as a way to destress from school pressures and homework. I am very conflicted about paying $20 year for the service, but if I manage to find 3-6 classmates who own a switch for the family plan to bring the cost per year down to $11.67 - $5.83 I would get it in a heartbeat. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You seem to be missing the point. It's not that they don't want to pay just because it used to be free. It's because they believe what Nintendo offers for $20 isn't worth it. We still have laggy, unreliable P2P as a means of online play(that means they are literally charging us for using our own internet connection), NES games that have literally been on every Virtual Console lineup since the Wii(Wii,3DS, Wii U) plus the arcade archives versions on the eshop. We don't even have the luxury of cloud saves for Splatoon 2. This is basically putting the game behind a paywall. I'd wholeheartedly pay $20 if we actually got dedicated servers and voice chat implemented into the console. Hell, we might even see releases of USB-c male to 3.5 mm female dongles so you can just plug your headphones into the pro controller. I agree, the release of SNES games and more might make the service more palatable, but as of now, I'm not forking any money over for it.

Edit:
For free, as long as you are a subscriptor

Hmmm </TEXT>

Edit: also no cloud saves </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel like we will definitely see him again. What superintelligent AI confides themself only to one device? Or makes a weapon that can be disabled by covering it with ink? Also even if he destroyed inkopolis, the octarian society would still exist, and even inkling towns outside inkopolis. My theory is that he knew Pearl and marina would be large influences on inkling society and they would spread the lessons that were actually right(like the ridiculousness of the race war) in hopes to get more octolings to the surface and tell them all the information from the humans he had to pass on. I don't think he'll be a villain the next time we see him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Does special power up just increase blast radius of the shots? The only situations I can consistently splat people with inkjet is if I shoot down another inkjet, rollers, and people like me. Inkbrush users and dualie users are hard to hit for me. I should probably practice my aim in Sheldon's training room. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks, you're definitely right about the roller thing, I usually find that whenever I roll back because of a horizontal fling, Im pushed against a wall. I usually get the splat, but I shouldn't take that risk.

I do run Ink Saver Main and Sub, but (probably should've mentioned this before) I also run ninja squid. Is it worth it to keep the ninja squid and put in a bunch of sub abilities for swim speed up to cancel it out, or just remove it and put all those other abilities you suggested? 

Thank you for the advice!

Edit: yeah, I'm probably going to remove ninja squid, after this new wadsm video, everyone is going to start looking for ninja squid ink trails. A lot of people already do actually. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've done things like rolling diagonally in one direction towards the enemy than again but diagonally in another direction, but I hardly end up in situations where I might have to do that so I excluded it from my go to methods.

I really only go into squid form while using inkjet if there's a charger on the other team with their sights on me, which is surprisingly rare. I usually wait until the right moments to use inkjet, like when my teammates are in a firefight with other teammates, and my use of the inkjet would cause the enemy players to push back, helping my teammates get the kills. I don't usually pay much attention to where I turn on my inkjet, so yeah, I should probably change that.

Yeah, they definitely played games with us, using their curling bombs and then they flanked us from a different corridor. A strat I've thought of using is to throw 2 curling bombs in different directions(ink saver sub) and with my ninja squid, the opponent wouldn't know where I'm going, but by the time I get the bombs out, they are too close to me for it to work and I end up getting splatted.

Don't worry if it sounds condescending! Usually when someone points out anothers flaws for anything in general or trying to help them learn, it will most likely sound condescending because the person on the receiving end of it will feel like they are being belittled that some person that they don't even know is lecturing them. I've played clam blitz a couple times before, but not too many times.

Thanks for the advice!

Edit: my guess is that they were some X rank who lost their save </TEXT>

<TITLE> Any tips for Enperry dualie user? </TITLE>

<TEXT> I just started playing clam blitz 30 minutes ago, and in my last match, there was this absolute maniac Enperry user who secured 32 kills...

https://m.imgur.com/a/pYAW5w7

Please ignore my kill-death ratio, I TRIED. I don't die this much in other matches I promise.

They were an amazing dualie user who dodged almost all our shots.

Right now, my current go to method while facing off against people is to 

- Throw a curling bomb to surf early in the match, to throw at an opponent with a wall behind them, and for retreat

- Vertical flick from roller: Dodge roll back and two the front at a diagonal to secure the kill

- Horizontal flick: Just Dodge roll back once if it isn't a carbon

- Use inkjet when opponents are on higher ground than you and grouped

When faced off with most other weapon types I just sneak behind them to get the kill. So, is there anything here that I could fix or could utilize to improve how I use the dualies? Also, if you're on here, 32-killer, great job on obtaining that much skill with the dualies. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, since we're at it, I want a DLC with Cap'n Cuttlefish and the great turf war. It would start out with Cap'n telling Callie, Marie, and Agent 4 about his time with the squidbeak Splatoon in the war. Eventually, he would start reminiscing about the first Agent 1 and it would flashback into a character select screen choosing your gender and hairstyle. The DLC would not contain any new weapons cause it's unfair to hide things like that behind a paywall, but rather reskins of the same weapons. It would contain a whole new set of sunken scrolls for that juicy Splatoon lore, and instead of getting zapfish or men cakes upon completing a mission, you would get paintings. The theme of the DLC would have a heavy inspiration on the Roaring 20's, with the music having a particular emphasis on early jazz. Upon beating the DLC, you would get all the old-timey clothes and old hairstyles. This may be less satisfying then getting to play as an octoling in the previous DLC, so of you have the DLC, you would have the ability to "imagine old inkopolis", giving the hub world a new look, and the grate where Marie stands would be young Cap'n Cuttlefish and instead of Octo Canyon or Deepsea Metro, would be Octo River or something. I thought about this way too much for my own good lol. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's a Ted talk about this. People who lack substantial knowledge and understanding on a subject suffer a double curse. They know too little about a subject that they don't know how much they don't know, and they can't realize how little they know because that's all they've ever been told. People who are extremely well-versed in a subject tend to expect others who say they know about a subject to know as much as them. People who are moderately informed on a subject know enough information that they know how much they don't know. I may have severely butchered some of the things said in the Ted talk here, so feel free to correct it while I go rewatch it to see if I said the wrong things.

<TEXT> Most math teachers just write the formula on the board, expect you to write it down, and do some problems with it. The problem most likely stems from this fact.

<TEXT> I'm sorry. Reading your original comment, I thought the scenario you showcased in the original with the boss and the worker showed the leniency of the boss and instead of telling at the worker to wake up or get back to work, he was telling him to go home and rest, which I thought was alluding to how being sleepy on the job makes you look like a bad worker, and how you want that to change. In work environments, being sleepy on the job or entering tired is pretty unacceptable already, as you are expected to work to your fullest capability while there. This mistakenly lead me to believe you had misread the question, as quite a few users commenting in this post have done the same. And as for the observation on the scene you described, I was just making a comment on how a situation like that was pretty unlikely to happen, without really any relation to the question. Again, I'm sorry, and I hope you understand my mistakes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a friend just like this. I once tried arguing with him on why apple removed the headphone jack, and he kept saying that apple did it to help go completely wireless, and I disagreed, saying that apple wanted to charge third party companies for their lightning headphones, through their MFi certification cost, which by the way is $550 per cable([Here is my source for reference](https://youtu.be/PmTSN4zWeQ0) ). He refuted this by saying that it's just $550 per line of product, when it says specifically in the video that it's per cable. I kept showing the clip to him but he just started to laugh and saying I was twisting the man's words. Needless to say, I was pretty annoyed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Singh is Kinng.

This movie is about how a Sikh named Happy Singh from a small town in India accidentally becomes an international crime lord. Once he becomes the crime lord, he teaches all his main henchmen to change their world view, to be good. He also has to deceive a couple that him and his "employees" are a proper staff of servants to host them before their wedding. Happy falls in love with the girl and the movie ends with a gunfight at the wedding with a generic resolution where everyone gets what they want and are happy. The credits roll, and Snoop Dogg is rapping the main theme, which is in Hindi.
This movie is on Netflix if you're interested. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Budget**
Under $50. If suggestions are slightly above $50 but worth it, it is definitely welcome.

**Source**
I'm just plugging these into my iPhone 5s and my HP Elitebook 820 G3.

**Requirements for Isolation**
I would mostly be using these in school while walking around or in class so I would prefer to hear outside of my music while people are talking to me or during a lesson, so I'd prefer little isolation.

**Preferred Type of Headphone**
I'd definitely prefer some IEMS so I can quickly take them on and off and put them away quickly. I really would not like earphones because I find that they are lacking in bass and hurt my ears after 30 minutes or so. I also have relatively small ear canals, so it'd be welcome if they came with a pair of s size eartips.

**Preferred tonal balance**
I'd prefer for the sound to be a bit more leaning on the bass side, tight and punchy, but not overwhelming.

**Past Headphones**
I've first had the Sennheiser CX-300II, I liked it because it was very comfortable and sound quality satisfied me, but I ended up replacing them because one cord was shorter than the other. After that, I had(and still have) the Klipsch R6 II, which was a great upgrade from the Sennheisers in terms of sound quality, but they isolated too much, so I usually only keep one in, which I'd rather not do because some of my music plays with both channels.

**Preferred Music**
I listen to Hip-Hop/Rap with a little bit of rock and lo-fi chill-hop when I'm studying.

**What I'd like to improve from my setup**
I'd really like to expand the soundstage of my headphones. I've recently discovered binaural audio and it blew my mind wearing my Klipsch R6 II, and it'd be great if I were immersed more in my music by that soundstage. I'd also like to hear a bit more detail in my music, as with my current IEMs, the lines between different sounds seem to blur together a bit. I'm not sure if I'm asking too much, because I really know nothing about audio, so take your best crack at it.
