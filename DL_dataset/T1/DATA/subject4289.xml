      I
      agree
      the
      game
      is
      broken
      in
      some
      manners
      and
      you
      have
      a
      right
      to
      be
      angry
      but
      don #8217;t
      let
      this
      get
      to
      you
      man
      just
      know
      there
      is
      a
      lot
      of
      us
      dealing
      with
      it
      too.
      Hopefully
      they
      get
      their
      shit
      together,
      maybe
      fixing
      the
      system
      when
      the
      new
      card
      class
      in
      July
      rolls
      in.
      Try
      to
      stay
      mellow
      bro,
      smoke
      a
      blunt
      maybe
      lol,
      this
      isn #8217;t
      worth
      all
      the
      negativity
      for
      your
      own
      sake.
      Stay
      happy~

      Funny
      glitch
      but
      on
      a
      serious
      note
      just
      out
      of
      curiosity
      if
      you
      don #8217;t
      mind
      me
      asking,
      how
      long
      have
      you
      been
      playing
      this
      game
      for
      and
      have
      you
      spent
      any
      $
      to
      make
      it
      all
      the
      way
      up
      there?
      Just
      curious
      if
      there #8217;s
      anyone
      competing
      with
      the
      whales
      that
      is
      F2P.

      I
      had
      high
      hopes
      for
      the
      pvp
      fix.
      My
      first
      3
      matches
      I
      was
      ranked
      against
      a
      lv
      21,
      19,
      and
      22.

      I #8217;m
      lv
      15
      and
      have
      been
      between
      4200-4600
      since
      the
      pvp
      switch
      2
      months
      ago.
      If
      you #8217;ve
      been
      experiencing
      what
      I
      have
      been
      then
      Sadly
      we #8217;re
      stuck
      with
      all
      of
      the
      lv
      18-22
      nks
      that
      are
      staying
      in
      silver,
      and
      the
      other
      lv
      13-15
      nks
      with
      lv
      5
      epics
      and
      lv
      3
      legendaries.
      It
      seems
      it #8217;s
      probably
      going
      to
      be
      this
      way
      for
      awhile.

      Just
      seeing
      if
      this
      is
      a
      struggle
      for
      others.
      Was
      anyone
      else
      2-3
      shields
      away
      from
      getting
      that
      guaranteed
      chicken
      coop
      card
      before
      they
      updated
      the
      pvp
      system
      2
      months
      back?
      And
      now
      stuck
      right
      below
      the
      rank
      but
      being
      constantly
      matched
      with
      players
      with
      level
      3
      chicken
      coop?
      I
      understand
      chicken
      coop
      is
      easy
      to
      counter
      but
      it #8217;s
      pretty
      annoying
      to
      have
      been
      so
      close
      to
      getting
      the
      card
      and
      now
      it #8217;s
      out
      of
      reach.
      I #8217;ve
      seen
      lv
      13s
      with
      the
      card..i
      don #8217;t
      even
      run
      fantasy
      often
      but
      it #8217;d
      just
      be
      nice
      to
      have
      the
      option
      to
      use
      it.

      I #8217;m

      with
      the
      rest

      If

      answer
      I #8217;d
      say

      would
      never
      happen
      for
      the
      sole
      fact
      that
      Stan
      literally
      pukes
      on
      Wendy
      everytime
      they #8217;ve
      ever
      attempted
      to
      kiss.
      I
      could
      imagine
      what
      trying
      to
      fuck
      her
      would
      do
      to
      him.

      Didn #8217;t
      even
      consider
      that
      actually.
      In
      theory
      yeah
      you #8217;d
      have
      a
      chance
      at
      them
      once
      the
      cards
      are
      added
      into
      rotation.
      I
      just
      have
      a
      feeling
      red
      lynx
      is
      going

      seize
      the

      the

      first
      in

      make
      it
      nearly
      impossible
      to
      obtain
      them
      in
      regular

      until
      a
      little
      while
      after
      releasing.

      These
      kind
      of
      matches
      are
      the
      reason
      why
      I
      continue
      to
      play.
      Sadly
      no
      one
      gets
      any
      loot
      but
      I #8217;ve
      had
      more
      fun
      in
      a
      competitive
      match
      with
      no
      winner
      than
      when
      one
      overpowers
      the

      Just
      for
      one
      moment,
      I #8217;d
      like
      to
      see
      past
      the
      hate
      and
      the
      judgement
      that
      Dougie
      users
      receive.
      Do
      not
      misunderstand
      me
      I
      dislike
      Dougie
      just
      as
      much
      as
      the
      next
      guy,
      and
      seeing
      2
      Dougies
      is
      even
      more
      irritating.
      There
      are
      many
      players
      that
      spend
      endless
      cash
      to
      beat
      the
      competition,
      there
      are
      people
      who
      still
      derank
      themselves
      to
      the
      bottom
      of
      their
      rank
      limit.
      8/10
      of
      the
      matches
      I
      lose
      are
      due
      to
      being
      overpowered
      by
      my
      opponents
      rank.
      not
      dougie
      users.
      There
      are
      many
      ways
      to
      counter
      a
      dougie
      it #8217;s
      not
      like
      he #8217;s
      that
      hard
      to
      face.
      So
      Dougie
      users,
      this
      is
      your
      chance
      to
      explain
      yourselves.
      why
      do
      you
      use
      dougie?
      Do
      you
      even
      have
      any
      fun
      using
      him?
      A
      lot
      of
      the
      Dougie
      users
      I #8217;m
      up
      against
      (especially
      ones
      with
      2)
      normally
      have
      no
      functionality
      between
      their
      other
      cards,
      kind
      of
      just
      blindly
      play
      them.
      Is
      it
      for
      a
      quick
      easy
      win?
      Do
      you
      use
      him
      as
      a
      strategy
      move?
      If
      so
      what
      is
      your
      usual
      strategy
      with
      him.
      Do
      you
      just
      play
      him
      when
      he #8217;s
      in
      your
      hand?
      Do
      you
      save
      him
      until
      all
      hope
      is
      lost
      and
      it #8217;s
      a
      last
      attempt
      or
      when
      matched
      with
      a
      overpowered
      player?
      I #8217;d
      especially
      like
      to
      hear
      from
      double
      Dougie
      users.
      I
      like
      honesty,
      I
      have
      no
      gain
      in
      causing
      you
      any
      shame.
      No
      hate
      guys,
      I #8217;m
      just
      genuinely
      curious.
      He #8217;s
      in
      the
      game
      and
      there #8217;s
      nothing
      stopping
      it.
      So
      I #8217;d
      like
      to
      just
      get
      a
      mindset
      of
      what #8217;s
      going
      on
      whenever
      I #8217;m
      facing
      up
      against
      Dougie
      users.
      Thank
      you~

      I
      think
      it #8217;s
      just
      to
      make
      a
      fair
      trade
      for
      their
      immunity
      to
      certain
      spells/charges.
      If
      it #8217;s
      the
      only
      unit
      immune
      to
      certain
      things
      it
      should
      also
      be
      penalized
      in
      some
      way
      to
      keep
      it
      fair.

      I
      do
      see
      your
      point,
      I
      think
      my
      only
      personal
      point
      on
      the
      subject
      is
      that
      a
      Dougie
      gives
      you
      2-3
      seconds
      to
      plan
      out
      a
      defense.
      besides
      mind
      controlling
      him,
      he #8217;s
      just
      an
      annoying
      waste
      of
      time
      to
      deal
      with.
      Cyborg
      Kenny
      I #8217;d
      say
      is
      a
      bit
      more
      easily
      dealt
      with,
      rats
      take
      him
      out
      easily,
      purify
      can
      instantly
      nullify
      his
      deathwish.
      Even
      just
      placing
      towelie
      near
      your
      nk
      and
      killing
      him
      with
      your
      zap.
      Works
      bout
      85%
      of
      the
      time
      for
      me.
      Best
      yet,
      use
      your
      lower
      level
      cyborg
      Kenny
      against
      an
      opponents
      cyborg
      Kenny.
      Plus
      the
      whole
      mind
      controlling
      thing
      is
      sorta
      part
      of
      the
      Sci-Fi
      theme.
      In
      simpler
      words,
      Dougie
      is
      Ass.

      I
      guess
      it #8217;s
      down
      to
      what
      you
      consider
      the
      game
      worth.
      A
      legendary
      is
      not
      worth
      2000
      cartman
      cash
      (roughly
      $20
      real
      money)
      in
      my
      opinion.
      Especially
      if
      your
      alternative
      is
      getting
      the
      battlepass
      which
      could
      guarantee
      you
      3
      legendaries
      and
      the
      possibility
      of
      more.
      Yeah
      SOMM
      at
      lv
      2
      for
      that
      arena
      is
      strong,
      but
      you #8217;ll
      just
      be
      moving
      300
      up
      the
      bracket
      and
      getting
      stuck
      against
      higher
      lv
      people
      again.
      If
      $5
      is
      worth
      that
      small
      rank
      increase
      to
      you,
      go
      for
      it.
      I
      find
      the
      pvp
      matching
      too
      broken
      to
      invest
      real
      money
      on
      it.

      the

      I

      pvp

      many

      Battle
      Pass
      Glitch?
      I
      logged
      in
      today
      to
      see
      that
      my
      battle
      pass
      had
      5-6
      unclaimed
      rewards
      scattered
      about.
      With
      confidence
      I
      always
      redeem
      these
      rewards
      the
      second
      I
      unlock
      them.
      One
      of
      the
      them
      was
      the
      first
      legendary
      pack.
      I
      took
      a
      pic
      before
      I
      claimed
      the
      last
      reward.
      Anyone
      experience
      this?

      The
      other
      ones
      were
      a
      couple
      of
      material
      packs
      and
      2
      golden
      kenny
      packs
      to
      unlock.
      I
      looked
      through
      my
      cards/materials
      and
      i
      know
      for
      a
      fact
      nothing
      is
      missing.
      I #8217;ve
      restarted
      my
      phone
      twice
      to
      make
      sure
      nothing
      changed
      and
      it
      seems
      permanent.
      I
      got
      two
      extra
      legendaries
      and
      a
      decent
      amount
      of
      materials
      from
      these.
      Seems
      rather
      odd
      but
      in
      no
      way
      am
      I
      complaining.

      It #8217;s
      honestly
      pathetic
      how
      little
      they #8217;re
      willing
      to
      give
      out
      for
      these
      events.
      I
      get
      more
      legendaries/epics
      from
      4th/5th
      place
      team
      packs...and
      those
      take
      little
      effort
      to
      accomplish.
      Especially
      for
      lv
      20+
      players.
      I #8217;m
      only
      lv
      17
      but,
      like
      fuck,
      you
      obviously
      need
      more
      cards
      to
      level
      shit
      up
      than
      lower
      levels
      so
      you
      should
      at
      least
      get
      something
      worth
      while.

      Nice
      pull
       #128077;.
      I #8217;m
      400+
      missions
      in
      and
      still
      haven #8217;t
      seen
      one.
      Hope
      for
      that
      luck
      someday.

      I
      think
      this
      is
      something
      we
      all
      would
      like
      to
      know.
      If
      you
      want
      it
      in
      a
      psychological
      perspective,
      the
      human
      brain
      responds
      positively
      to
      completion
      and
      rewards,
      some
      people
      can
      feel
      good
      about
      their
      accomplishments
      even
      if
      little
      effort
      is
      put
      forward.
      I
      agree
      completely
      that
      they #8217;re
      basically
      just
      doing
      a
      chore,
      winning
      a
      couple
      matches
      with
      little
      effort,
      then
      purposefully
      losing
      a
      couple,
      it #8217;s
      childish
      and
      definitely
      ruins
      what
      could
      be
      a
      nice
      friendly
      competition.

      I #8217;m
      sorry
      for
      anyone
      who
      is
      annoyed
      by
      this
      but
      really
      guys,
      this
      is
      suppose
      to
      be
      a
      downtime
      to
      have
      some
      fun.
      If
      your
      bank
      account
      is
      suffering
      in
      the
      process
      than
      is
      it
      really
      any
      fun?
      This
      game
      is
      broken
      for
      a
      reason.
      If
      every
      match
      was
      fair
      people
      wouldn #8217;t
      find
      a
      reason
      to
      buy
      packs
      as
      often.
      If
      every
      match
      was
      friendly
      competition
      no
      one
      would
      need
      these
      packs.
      They #8217;re
      holding
      off
      fixing
      this
      shit
      because
      they
      know
      addicts
      will
      just
      keep
      buying
      until
      they
      can
      feel
      the
      joy
      of
      winning
      again.
      I #8217;m
      losing
      more
      and
      more
      respect
      for
      this
      company.
      I
      couldn #8217;t
      care
      less
      about
      how
      much
      I
      win
      or
      lose,
      but
      when
      I
      see
      a
      lv
      13
      with
      lv
      3/4
      legendaries
      and
      lv
      5
      epics,
      I #8217;m
      less
      mad
      and
      more
      concerned
      thinking
      of
      the
      person
      on
      the
      other
      side
      of
      the
      screen,
      who
      probably
      spends
      more
      money
      on
      this
      game
      than
      food.
      Everyone
      here
      is
      worth
      so
      much
      more
      than
      this.
      You
      guys
      deserve
      better.
      This
      is
      probably
      one
      of
      my
      most
      played
      games
      in
      the
      past
      year
      or
      so
      and
      watching
      this
      company
      abuse
      the
      people
      they
      can
      is
      disgusting.
      Have
      a
      nice
      day
      everyone!

      the

      art
      is

      some

      Adding
      more
      cards
      is
      always
      sweet
      but
      fixing

      would

      I
      personally
      think
      a
      wrestling
      theme
      deck
      inspired
      by
      the
      episode
       #8220;W.T.F. #8221;
      would
      be
      interesting,
      only
      problem
      is
      coming
      up
      with
      a
      whole
      set
      of
      abilities
      to
      make
      them
      special
      from
      the
      other
      themes.
      Maybe
      adding
      a
      couple
      other
      higher
      end
      neutral
      cards
      could
      be
      an
      interesting
      change
      (this
      would
      force
      players
      to
      debate
      if
      they
      wanna
      take
      out
      some
      of
      their
      must-have
      theme
      cards
      in
      trade
      for
      more
      neutrals)
      I #8217;m
      sure
      it #8217;s
      gonna
      be
      awhile
      before
      they
      entertain
      a
      new
      deck,
      gotta
      milk
      this
      superhero
      stuff
      for
      awhile,
      make
      some
      more
      $$$
      on
      those
      packs
      you
      know.

      elf
      bebes
      then
      hotdog
      buy
      away.
      Otherwise
      I #8217;d
      just
      save
      for
      a
      700
      ticket
      epic
      card
      when
      you
      find

      If

      then
      take

      you

      It #8217;s

      over

      So
      what?
      He
      collected
      14
      copies
      of
      a
      legendary
      less
      than
      a
      month
      after
      released,
      actually
      13
      because
      of
      the
      story
      mode
      copy
      you
      get.
      So
      he
      only
      spent
      maybe
      1-2grand.
      Well..as
      far
      as
      I
      remember
      there
      hasn #8217;t
      been
      a
      pack
      with
       #8220;increased
      chance
      at
      mysterion #8221;,
      which
      means
      he
      probably
      earned
      a
      bunch
      of
      other
      legendaries
      in
      the
      process,
      ...so
      maybe
      3grand.

      Lmao
      guys
      why
      you
      salty.
      Can
      you
      not
      agree
      this
      game
      has
      some
      fucked
      up
      moments?
      The
      whole
      point
      is
      trying
      to
      make
      obvious
      that
      there
      are
      some
      clear
      problems
      with
      the
      game.
      It
      has
      a
      lot
      of
      potential
      and
      I #8217;m
      rather
      fond
      of
      it,
      I
      just
      rather
      express
      them
      than
      let
      these
      problems
      go
      unrecognized

      the

      I #8217;m
      sorry
      if
      you
      think
      people
      are
      trying
      to
      bully
      you
      into
      choosing
      specific
      cards.
      Some
      of
      these
      people
      have
      been
      playing
      for
      a
      long
      time
      and
      they
      know
      from
      experience
      which
      cards
      are
      best
      for
      most
      situations.
      You
      don #8217;t
      need
      to
      take
      the
      advice
      but
      the
      earlier
      recommendations
      I
      saw
      in
      your
      previous
      posts
      are
      pretty
      solid
      suggestions.
      Try
      out
      different
      combos
      and
      find
      one
      you
      like
      best
      buddy.

      That #8217;s
      honestly
      trash
      my
      dude.
      Your
      right
      most
      of
      us
      have
      lives
      and
      are
      doing
      our
      best
      to
      stay
      as
      active
      as
      possible.
      Even
      if
      you
      scored
      only
      20
      points
      the
      fact
      you
      put
      in
      the
      time
      to
      help
      out
      should
      be
      appreciated,
      let
      alone
      getting
      99
      points.
      Sounds
      like
      trash
      leadership
      going
      on.
      I #8217;d
      invite
      you
      to
      join
      the
      team
      I #8217;m
      in
      but
      we
      barely
      are
      breaking
      silver
      right
      now,
      with
      your
      rank
      you
      should
      be
      in
      a
      higher
      team.
      Hope
      you
      find
      a
      group
      of
      respectable
      players
      to
      team
      up
      with.
      Some
      people
      are
      just
      plain
      dickheads.

      I #8217;m
      not
      looking
      for
      an
      argument
      here,
      but
      the
      only
      point
      I #8217;m
      making
      is
      they
      have
      to
      draw
      a
      line
      somewhere.
      They
      make
      it
      easier
      for
      high
      ranked
      players
      to
      get
      tokens
      I
      assume
      as
      a
      reward
      for
      being
      long
      committed
      to
      the
      game.
      I #8217;m
      in
      silver
      and
      I
      got
      done
      a
      couple
      days
      ago,
      where
      as
      some
      people
      in
      wooden
      may
      not
      get
      the
      chance
      to
      complete
      it
      at
      all.
      Maybe
      they
      don #8217;t
      give
      a
      purpose
      for
      the
      extra
      tokens
      to
      avoid
      players
      with
      phone
      addictions
      feeling
      the
      need
      to
      play
      so
      much,
      likewise
      with
      the
      locker
      limits.
      I #8217;m
      not
      accusing
      you
      of
      being
      addicted
      I #8217;m
      just
      saying
      for
      a
      game
      that
      attempts
      to
      drain
      $
      out
      of
      it #8217;s
      players
      with
      all
      their
      sellable
      packs
      the
      fact
      they
      even
      added
      a
      battle
      pass
      should
      be
      something
      we
      all
      appreciate,
      not
      nitpick
      at.
      Imagine
      having
      to
      play
      every
      single
      day
      or
      you
      wouldn #8217;t
      get
      every
      reward?
      Would
      that
      not
      be
      worse?

      I #8217;m
      sure
      a
       #8220;top
      team #8221;
      out
      there
      would
      be
      willing
      to
      acknowledge
      your
      working
      schedule
      and
      accommodate
      you.
      We
      are
      always
      50/50
      with
      completing
      the
      weekend
      events
      and
      our
      team
      has
      managed
      1st
      multiple
      weeks
      in
      a
      row
      and
      then
      other
      times
      we
      get
      3rd
      or
      4th.
      There
      is
      only
      10-12
      of
      us
      who
      communicate
      (and
      that
      is
      only
      in
      the
      team
      chat)
      and
      only
      20-25
      that
      play
      at
      all
      during
      the
      week,
      some
      people
      don #8217;t
      even
      use
      their
      battle
      tokens
      so
      it #8217;s
      rough
      sometimes.
      Like
      I
      said
      bro
      you
      deserve
      a
      silver
      team
      that
      is
      pushing
      through
      the
      leaderboard.
      Because
      much
      like
      a
      lot
      of
      the
      1300-1700
      crown
      teams,
      we
      have
      a
      lot
      of
      recruiting
      to
      do
      before
      we
      can
      progress
      further,
      too
      many
      teams
      of
      40+
      active
      players
      to
      battle
      against
      to
      get
      up
      there.

      Yeah
      I
      feel
      you.
      Well
      our
      team
      is
      called
      Brosexuals.
      Our
      leader
      has
      been
      gone
      for
      awhile
      but
      our
      Co-leader
      is
      still
      around.
      We
      had
      50
      members
      but
      I
      removed
      2
      (they
      were
      under
      800
      elo
      and
      haven #8217;t
      played
      in
      two
      weeks)
      look
      us
      up
      and
      you
      can
      hang
      out
      for
      a
      week(or
      longer)
      if
      you
      can #8217;t
      find
      better,
      the
      people
      who
      do
      talk
      are
      all
      chill
      and
      friendly
      we
      can
      always
      use
      the
      help.
      You
      won #8217;t
      be
      kicked
      if
      you
      give
      any
      effort
      for
      the
      week,
      pretty
      sure
      we
      are
      purging
      a
      number
      of
      players
      on
      Monday
      to
      open
      up
      spots
      hoping
      for
      some
      active
      players.

      And
      that #8217;s
      great
      bro,
      I #8217;m
      sure
      your
      team
      is
      a
      lot
      more
      successful
      than
      mine
      then.
      I
      play
      very
      frequently,
      I
      work
      12
      hour
      night
      shifts
      though
      and
      I
      imagine
      a
      lot
      of
      other
      players
      do
      have
      to
      work/tend
      to
      their
      everyday
      duties.
      Imagine
      if
      you
      end
      up
      in
      a
      situation
      where
      you
      can #8217;t
      play
      for
      a
      little
      bit
      for
      whatever
      reason,
      and
      they
      move
      the
      legendary
      pack
      to
      the
      final
      reward,
      and
      because
      you
      didn #8217;t
      play
      everyday
      you
      didn #8217;t
      get
      it.
      You #8217;d
      be
      more
      bummed
      with
      that
      loss
      than
      you
      would
      the
      extra
      tokens,
      no?
      I
      can
      see
      there
      are
      a
      number
      of
      people
      who
      do
      agree
      with
      you
      so
      I #8217;m

      Yeah
      I
      agree.
      I #8217;ve
      bought
      many
      $60

      and
      played
      them
      maybe
      2-3
      days.
      This

      I #8217;ve
      been
      playing
      almost
      every
      day
      for
      9-10
      months.
      Hopefully
      they
      fix
      the
      issues
      with
      it
      because
      I

      times
      I
      buy

      I

      phone
      anywhere
      so
      I
      can
      play
      it
      more.
      But
      if
      I #8217;m
      cheap
      for
      not
      spending
      money
      on
      something

      I

      you #8217;re
      right

      Yeah
      I
      noticed
      it
      after
      the

      battle

      I

      nice
      but
      honestly
      if
      you #8217;re
      not
      earning
      a
      legendary
      after
      35

      then
      fuck
      you

      deserve

      Why
      so
      hostile
      bro
      lmao.
      I
      play
      so
      willingly
      because
      getting

      bug
      me
      because
      I #8217;m
      playing
      for
      free.
      Putting
      my
      money
      in
      to
      get
      better
      and
      then
      continuously
      still
      losing
      would
      be
      more
      annoying.
      Like
      I
      said
      I #8217;d
      be
      fully
      willing
      to
      spend
      some
      money
      on
      this
      game
      once
      the
      recurring
      issues
      are
      fixed.
      If
      I #8217;m
      cheap
      for
      not
      spending
      money
      the
      developers
      are
      cheap
      for
      not
      putting
      the
      money/resources
      into
      fixing
      the
      game.
      To
      each
      his
      own
      man.

      which
      is
      practically
      what
      pay
      to
      win
      is.
      I #8217;ll
      humbly
      stay
      free
      to
      play
      after
      this

      You
      explained
      that
      very
      nice.
      Not
      only
      that
      but
      (most)
      games
      that
      you
      buy
      last
      forever,
      excluding
      the
      ones
      that
      run
      only
      using
      online
      servers.
      This
      game
      will
      shut
      down
      eventually
      and
      any
      money
      put
      towards
      it
      will
      be
      gone.
      It
      doesn #8217;t
      mean
      you
      can #8217;t
      spend
      some
      money
      towards
      it,
      you
      spend
      money
      to
      see
      a
      movie
      at
      the
      cinema
      and
      don #8217;t
      get
      it
      forever,
      or
      like
      you
      said
      at
      an
      amusement
      park.
      I
      would
      like
      the
      issues
      to
      be
      fixed
      or
      see
      an
      attempt
      at
      improving
      before
      I
      spend
      anything.

      Yeah
      some
      of
      the
      packs
      cost
      $20+
      and
      you
      are
      only
      guaranteed
      6-10
      epics
      and
      20-30%
      at
      a
      legendary.
      So
      basically
      buying
      3
      packs
      for
      $60
      would
      get
      you
      roughly
      30
      epics
      (completely
      random
      so
      you
      could
      easily
      get
      30
      epics
      that
      you
      don #8217;t
      even
      use
      if
      you #8217;re
      luck
      really
      fell
      short)
      and
      1
      legendary.
      If
      you #8217;re
      cards
      are
      past
      lv
      2,
      that
      barely
      makes
      an
      impact
      for
      $60.

      So
      I
      switched
      to
      fantasy/sci-fi.
      Two
      days
      later
      magically
      I
      now
      face
      fantasy
      24/7.

      Alright
      so
      I
      was
      just
      trying
      to
      consider
      how
      much
      time
      it
      would
      realistically
      take
      to
      get
      this
      score
      and
      I
      went
      farther
      than
      I
      thought.
      Feel
      free
      to
      correct
      any
      of
      my
      math
      here.
      So
      let #8217;s
      say
      the
      User
      used
      the
      Maximum
      9
      cards
      able
      to
      be
      used
      at
      once
      for
      the
      card
      event.
      A
      score
      of
      4149
      would
      then
      require
      461
      matches.
      Now
      let #8217;s
      say
      this
      person
      isn #8217;t
      a
      cheater/deranker,
      let #8217;s
      assume
      the
      following-
      100
      of
      these
      matches
      took
      3minutes
      (300minutes),
      200
      of
      these
      matches
      took
      2
      minutes
      (400
      minutes),
      161
      of
      these
      matches
      took
      1
      minutes
      (161
      minutes)
      So
      461
      wins
      would
      take
      roughly
      861
      minutes.
      Or
      14.35hours.
      Let #8217;s
      say
      this
      user
      is
      pretty
      good
      assumably
      and
      only
      loses
      1/8
      matches.
      For
      461
      wins
      User
      would
      accumulate
      57
      loss
      matches
      This
      would
      total
      to
      518
      total
      matches.
      Let #8217;s
      say
      User
      isn #8217;t
      a
      big
      time
      waster
      and
      leaves
      quick
      if
      the
      match
      doesn #8217;t
      look
      good
      and
      if
      they
      stay
      they
      never
      run
      into
      overtime.
      So
      of
      the
      57
      matches
      let #8217;s
      say
      25-
      disconnected
      after
      30seconds,
      20-
      2
      minutes,
      12-
      3
      minutes
      (no
      overtime)
      This
      would
      equate
      to
      12-
      36
      minutes,
      20-
      40
      minutes,
      25-
      12minutes
      (roughly)
      88
      minutes.
      Add
      that
      to
      the
      14.35
      hours
      of
      all
      won
      matches
      and
      you
      get
      around
      15.8
      hours.
      Now
      there
      are
      loading
      screen
      times
      as
      well,
      if
      you #8217;re
      playing
      that
      many
      matches
      then
      the
      loading
      times
      are
      gonna
      add
      up.
      Let #8217;s
      say
      it
      takes-
      30
      seconds
      to
      get
      through
      the
      win
      screen/locker
      screen/back
      to
      menu
      And
      30
      seconds
      to
      find
      match,
      load
      in,
      and
      begin
      playing
      That
      would
      be
      60seconds
      between
      every
      win
      and
      immediately
      starting
      a
      new
      match.
      roughly
      40
      seconds
      if
      it #8217;s
      a
      loss
      because
      there
      is
      no
      locker
      screen
      That
      would
      be
      60seconds-
      461
      total
      matches
      40seconds-
      57
      total
      matches
      461
      minutes
      in
      loading
      times
      for
      wins
      38
      minutes
      in
      loading
      times
      for
      losses.
      499
      minutes.
      8.3
      hours.
      15.8
      hours
      +
      8.3
      hours
      =
      24.1
      hours.
      So
      1
      full
      day
      playing
      SPPD
      for
      5
      epics.
      Worth
      it.

      What
      do
      you
      think
      the
      weekend
      event
      is
      going
      to
      be
      since
      the
      developers
      said
      they
      couldn #8217;t
      release
      info
      on
      it
      due
      to
      it
      being
      linked
      to
      the
      new
      episode.
      I
      imagine
      it #8217;ll
      involve
      collecting
      marijuana
      seeds(tokens).
      If
      not
      then
      something
      ridiculous
      involving
      Mexican
      Joker.

      Also.. #8221;50%
      OFF!!! #8221;...I
      haven #8217;t
      seen
      this
      pack
      before...so
      you #8217;re
      just
      personally
      valuing
      it
      at
      $20
      so
      I
      feel

      I #8217;m
      getting
      a
      steal
      for
      buying

      understand
      we
      all
      got
      a
      free
      pack
      and
      that #8217;s
      all
      nice
      and
      dandy...but
      way
      to
      just
      make
      it
      easier
      for
      people
      who
      already
      spend
      hundreds
      of
      dollars
      to
      just
      get
      a
      quick
      discount.
      If
      anyone
      who
      is
      F2P
      has
      bought
      this
      offer
      put

      in

      place
      and

      Exactly
      it #8217;s
      not
      a
      terrible
      deal.
      Meaning
      that
      if
      you
      don #8217;t
      get
      it
      you #8217;re
      losing
      out,
      so
      guess
      my
      only
      point
      is
      them
      making
      it
      feeling
      like
      your
      more
      obligated
      to
      get
      it.
      I #8217;ve
      always
      just
      felt
      they
      value
      Legendaries/Epics
      at
      a
      higher
      real
      currency
      than
      what
      they
      should
      be
      worth.
      One
      legendary
      (2000cash
      typically
      in
      store)
      is
      valuing
      a
      single
      copy
      of
      a
      card
      at
      $20.
      To
      get
      one
      to
      lv
      3
      you
      are
      valuing
      that
      at
      $120.
      Idk
      I
      saw
      this
      as
      a
      strategic
      money
      grab
      on
      their
      part
      over
      the
      idea
      of
      trying
      to
      give
      us
      a
      nice
      offer.

      Assuming

      of
      you
      have
      completed
      the

      you #8217;ll
      find
      there
      is
      no
      reason
      for
      the
      app
      any
      longer
      (besides
      assuming
      that
      they
      may
      release
      future
      superhero
      cards
      using
      it).
      Anyone
      else
      have
      the
      problem
      of
      completing
      the
      daily/weekly
      challenge,
      earning
      your
      pvp
      pack
      and
      then
      still
      wanting
      to
      play?
      Besides
      hoping
      on
      lucky
      lockers
      there
      isn #8217;t
      much
      you
      can
      gain
      from
      playing
      at
      that
      point
      until
      the
      4hr
      wait
      is
      up.
      So
      what
      if
      they
      added
      daily
      call
      girl
      tasks.
      6-8
      random
      challenges
      (preferably
      pvp
      ones)
      that
      once
      completed
      gave
      you
      a
      card
      pack.
      The
      rewards
      wouldn #8217;t
      be
      outlandish,
      let #8217;s
      say
      500
      coins,
      350
      pvp
      tickets,
      and
      5
      cash,
      mixed
      with
      a
      couple
      cards
      and
      materials.
      It
      would
      make
      playing
      pvp
      a
      bit
      more
      interesting
      because
      more
      people
      would
      be
      using
      different
      cards
      to
      complete
      whatever
      their
      challenges
      were,
      and
      it #8217;d
      give
      players
      that
      would
      like
      to
      spend
      more
      time
      on

      something

      was
      taken,
      mind
      control
      ended

      cyborg
      ran
