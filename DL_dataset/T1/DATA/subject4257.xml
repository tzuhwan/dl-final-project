      bean
      burrito,

      beans,
      sub
      retried

      Ha
      I
      bet
      they #8217;d
      celebrate
      for
      me.
      Only

      you
      knew
      how
      much
      I
      hurt
      people.
      I #8217;m
      sorry
      for
      your
      friend
      though.
      I
      wish
      it
      was
      me
      instead
      of
      any
      good
      people.
      Plus
      let #8217;s
      be
      honest
      I #8217;m
      too
      much
      of
      a
      pussy
      to
      commit
      lol
      I
      can #8217;t
      afford
      another
      suicide
      attempt
      hospital

      I #8217;m

      wow
      there #8217;s
      such
      garbage
      advice
      in
      this
      thread.
      my
      best
      advice
      is
      this,
      it #8217;s
      possible
      to
      learn
      and
      develop
      to
      a
      point
      where
      you
      can
      cope
      with
      gambling
      and
      debt.
      it #8217;s
      easier
      than
      you #8217;d
      think
      and
      considering
      you
      went
      through
      the
      effort
      to
      write
      this,
      some
      part
      of
      you
      wants
      to
      keep
      going.
      embrace
      that
      part
      of
      you
      and
      push
      through,
      and
      one
      day
      you #8217;ll
      look
      back
      and
      realize
      how
      much
      you #8217;ve
      grown

      if
      i
      had
      to
      name
      a
      single
      person,
      i #8217;d
      say

      her
      stuff
      over
      and
      over
      for
      hours
      and
      get
      an
      experience.
      as
      for
      how
      i
      write,
      i
      don #8217;t
      think
      i
      have
      a
      coherent
      style
      really.
      to
      me,
      poetry
      is
      about
      delivering
      emotion
      in
      a
      strong,
      precise,
      and
      condensed
      manner.
      i
      use
      any
      form
      i
      find
      fit
      to
      deliver
      what
      i #8217;m
      feeling
      in
      a
      poetic
      manner.

      yes,
      that #8217;s
      pretty
      much
      exactly
      what
      i
      think.
      i
      tend
      to
      keep
      delivering
      emotion
      as
      my
      primary
      goal.
      helps
      that
      i
      mostly
      perform
      my
      own
      works
      too,
      usually
      open
      mics,
      sometimes
      actual

      it #8217;s
      nice
      to
      partake
      in
      such
      a

      I
      tend
      to
      write
      stuff
      as
      I
      get
      inspired,
      it #8217;s
      usually
      in
      bursts
      of
      5-10
      poems
      at
      a
      time.
      Once
      a
      month
      or
      so
      I
      sit
      down
      with
      a
      lot
      of
      coffee
      and
      edit
      down
      everything.
      The
      way
      I
      prefer
      to
      edit
      is
      usually
      editing
      down.
      I
      reword
      things
      and
      try
      to
      condense
      and
      get
      precise
      with
      my
      work
      to
      the
      point
      where
      every
      single
      word
      carries
      meaning.
      Writing
      in
      such
      a
      meaning
      dense
      way
      is
      both
      enjoyable,
      and
      also
      helps
      create
      the
      kind
      of
      work
      I
      enjoy
      reading.
      Lastly,
      once
      I
      perform
      a
      work
      or
      send
      it
      to
      someone
      as
      a
      final,
      I
      save
      it
      as
      its
      own
      file
      and
      don #8217;t
      allow
      myself
      to
      edit
      it
      anymore,
      saves
      me
      from
      constantly
      tweaking
      my
      work
      for
      months.
      As
      for
      the
      quality
      of
      my
      work,
      people
      seem
      to
      enjoy
      it
      but
      I
      know
      that
      doesn #8217;t
      always
      equate
      to
      good.
      I
      know
      that
      my
      perspective
      on
      myself
      is
      inherently
      biased
      and
      thus
      I
      can #8217;t
      tell
      you
      how
      good
      my
      own
      work
      is
      accurately.
      If
      you
      want
      I
      wouldn #8217;t
      mind
      reading
      a
      few
      pieces...

      pretty
      much

      looked

      loose

      covering

      are,
      it #8217;s
      something
      you
      two
      will
      have
      to
      learn
      together.
      bargaining
      with
      things
      that
      only
      exist
      in
      one #8217;s
      head
      is
      a
      futile
      attempt
      in
      my
      experience.
      that
      being
      said,
      helping
      him
      ground
      himself
      in

      things

      and
      helping
      keep
      on
      track
      with
      medication
      are
      both
      major
      boons.
      just,
      know
      that
      going
      in
      this
      probably
      will
      be
      more
      work
      than
      a

      average

      in

      still
      totally
      doable
      if
      you
      find
      value
      in
      it.

      as
      with
      any
      other
      relationship,
      it #8217;s
      about
      mutual
      respect
      and
      trust
      more

      people

      directly

      some

      appreciate
      a
      slower
      pace.
      i #8217;d
      say,

      ask
      him
      the
      same
      question
      you
      did

      would

      giving
      you
      a
      rundown
      or
      see
