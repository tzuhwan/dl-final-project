      And
      my
      12
      SEL
      Passat
      TDi
      started
      flashing
      the
      glow
      plug
      light,
      lost
      all
      power,
      died
      as
      I
      pulled
      over,
      and
      wouldn't
      restart.
      This
      was
      at
      0630
      on
      my
      way
      home
      from
      a
      12
      hour
      overnight
      work
      shift.
      Happy
      New
      year,
      was
      my
      first
      night
      back.
      Fortunately
      I
      was
      only
      a
      little
      over
      a
      mile
      to
      the
      VW
      dealer
      and
      though
      I
      know
      the
      turbo
      is
      warrantied
      to
      120k,
      the
      advisor
      informed
      me
      that
      the
      HPFP
      is
      also
      good
      to
      120k
      now.
      So
      may
      only
      be
      inconvenienced
      rather
      than
      out
      a
      large
      sum.
      Was
      intent
      on
      keeping
      the
      car
      and
      what
      happens
      here
      will
      play
      into
      that
      as
      I've
      made
      no
      commitment
      yet.

      I'm
      in
      a
      union
      job,
      and

      To
      be
      clear,
      it's
      not
      without
      it's
      merits.
      Pay,
      benefits,
      big
      safety
      net
      vs
      management/corporate.
      But
      that's
      where
      it
      ends,
      and
      it's
      becoming
      more
      and
      more
      frustrating.
      I
      have
      found
      that
      the
      union
      safety
      net
      is
      extremely
      good
      at
      making
      poor
      workers
      feel
      entitled
      and
      safe,
      thus
      allowing
      them
      to
      continue
      to
      be
      poor
      workers.
      It
      creates
      a
      divide
      between
      workers
      who
      want
      to
      do
      the
      bare
      minimum,
      and
      those
      who
      want
      to
      come
      in
      and
      actually
      put
      in
      a
      solid
      effort.
      The
      seniority
      games
      are
      ridiculous,
      and
      workers
      know
      and
      play
      that
      game
      to
      the
      point
      of
      literally
      screwing
      the
      next
      man
      down.
      Hard
      work,
      consistent
      high
      quality
      results,
      above
      and
      beyond
      effort
      mean
      NOTHING.
      But
      since
      guy
      A
      has
      worked
      here
      longer,
      it
      means
      everything
      even
      though
      he's
      a
      total
      dirtbag
      worker.
      Guys
      sleeping
      on
      the
      job
      and
      the
      company
      can't
      even
      fire
      them
      because
      of
      the
      union.
      Oh,
      but
      then
      the
      union
      representation.
      Some
      are
      absolutely
      clueless.
      Some
      play
      the
      status
      quo
      game
      with
      the
      corporate
      guys
      simply
      to
      not
      make
      waves
      in
      an
      effort
      to
      keep
      themselves
      in
      their
      union
      hall
      position.
      Bargaining
      committees
      that
      do
      anything
      but
      bargain
      when
      the
      union
      and
      workers
      have
      the
      upper
      hand.
      And
      the
      list
      goes
      on
      and
      on.
      Granted,
      this
      is
      my
      first
      and
      only
      experience
      being
      a
      union
      member,
      and
      it's
      only
      a
      few
      years
      old
      at
      that
      (my
      experience),
      but
      jeez.
      From
      what
      I've
      seen,
      the
      unions
      of
      today
      pale
      in
      existence
      of
      the
      unions
      of
      lore,
      where
      the
      laborers
      were
      actually
      able
      to
      take
      a
      stand
      for
      themselves.

      So,
      I
      run
      a
      plex
      server
      at
      home,
      on
      what
      originally
      began
      as
      a
      dedicated
      HTPC
      consisting
      of
      a
      mini-itx
      setup
      with
      an
      AMD
      a4-5400.
      Needless
      to
      say,
      transcoding
      is
      not
      one
      of
      it's
      finer
      points.
      And
      I've
      also
      noticed
      that
      multiple
      streams
      don't
      play
      nicely
      on
      it.
      So
      I
      could
      go
      two
      ways.
      One
      would
      be
      to
      pick
      up
      a
      used
      R510
      with
      an
      H700
      already
      in
      it,
      stuff
      it
      with
      drives,
      and
      drop
      the
      sledgehammer
      for
      a
      server.
      The
      other
      way,
      cheaper
      by
      far,
      would
      be
      to
      reuse
      the
      X58
      computer
      that
      currently
      sits
      idle
      most
      of
      the
      time
      not
      even
      powered
      on.
      It's
      an
      ASUS
      Rampage
      III
      Gene
      and
      I7-950
      though
      I'd
      likely
      upgrade
      the
      processor
      to
      a
      Xeon
      X5680
      (cost/price
      balance).
      I
      could
      pick
      up
      an
      H700
      cheap
      enough
      on
      ebay,
      couple
      of
      sas
      to
      sata
      breakout
      cables
      on
      amazon,
      and
      run
      up
      to
      8
      hard
      drives
      on
      it.
      Con
      is
      ram
      limitations
      and
      single
      processor
      vs
      dual
      in
      the
      R510.
      Pro
      is
      simplicity
      (already
      running
      WIn7),
      familiarity,
      and
      no
      need
      for
      a
      rack,
      etc.
      Which
      way,
      if
      you
      had
      the
      choice,
      would
      you
      go
      and
      why?

      So
      making
      a
      home
      brew
      server,
      mainly
      for
      running
      as
      a
      plex
      server
      and
      storage
      of
      all
      my
      video
      files.
      Had
      an
      old
      X58
      Intel
      setup
      sitting
      around
      (was
      the
      kids
      computer
      for
      gaming
      as
      it
      was
      semi-robust
      and
      had
      a
      XFX
      7970
      in
      it)
      but
      decided
      to
      re
      appropriate
      it
      after
      one
      to
      many
      hard
      shutdowns
      from
      the
      kids
      screwed
      the
      boot
      drive.
      As
      it
      sat,
      specs
      are:

      with

      Nothing
      spectacular.
      But
      today
      I
      got
      in
      and
      fired
      up
      a
      Dell
      PERC
      H700
      raid
      card.
      Literally
      NO
      issues
      at
      all.
      Recognized
      on
      first
      boot,
      though
      I
      did
      mask
      pins
      5
      and
      6
      for
      the
      SMBus
      compatibility
      issue.
      Had
      a
      couple
      of
      old
      64
      GB
      Sata
      II
      SSD's
      sitting
      around,
      so
      hooked
      them
      up.
      After
      installing
      the
      Dell
      drivers,
      and
      latest
      LSI
      Megaraid
      Storage
      manager,
      I
      have
      full
      control.
      Set
      them
      to
      RAID
      0
      and
      after
      tinkering
      with
      the
      settings
      was
      seeing
      a
      little
      over
      700
      MB
      read
      and
      about
      525

      write
      speeds
      via
      Atto
      and
      Crystal
      Disk
      Mark.
      Pretty
      pleased
      about.
      Those
      drives
      aren't
      staying
      though.
      Going
      to
      move
      to
      a

      Just
      curious
      to
      see
      what
      the
      threshold
      for
      people
      is
      around
      here.
      Personally,
      the
      most
      I've
      paid
      for
      anything
      was
      $70
      for
      a
      2015
      BCBS
      Rare.
      I
      see
      other
      stuff
      going
      for
      $200
      or
      so
      (Bottle
      Logic
      Fundamental
      Summation
      for
      example)
      and
      then
      there's
      the
      gargantuans
      like
      KBBS
      at
      900
      to
      1000
      on
      the
      secondary.
      So
      where
      do
      you
      draw
      the
      line
      personally?

      Been
      wanting
      a
      NEST
      since
      we
      closed
      on
      our
      house
      early
      last
      year.
      Became
      aware
      they
      were
      being
      clearanced
      at
      a
      big
      box
      store,
      found
      the
      last
      one
      locally,
      and
      got
      it
      for
      $80.
      Going
      to
      install
      it
      tomorrow
      morning
      while
      it's
      cool
      and
      the
      A/C
      isn't
      wanting
      to
      run.
      Looking
      for
      tips
      or
      tricks
      anyone
      might
      have
      for
      setup,
      getting

      started,
      maximizing
      it's
      potential,
      etc.

      Fix
      was
      completed
      on
      Monday.
      Only
      drove
      the
      car
      about
      3
      miles
      home
      from
      the
      dealership,
      and
      it
      was
      immediately
      apparent
      it
      drove
      differently.
      More
      throttle
      needed,
      hanging
      before
      shifts,
      staying
      in
      gear
      longer.
      Didn't
      drive
      it
      again
      until
      Wednesday
      night
      going
      to
      work
      (and
      that
      was
      a
      wash
      due
      to
      an
      accident
      and
      complete
      gridlock
      the
      entire
      way
      there).
      Left
      thursday
      morning
      from
      work
      in
      Fort
      Wayne
      IN
      for
      southern
      NJ.
      Trip
      there
      I
      was
      coaxing
      it
      as
      best
      I
      could.
      No
      A/C,
      windows
      up,
      no
      cruise,
      working
      with
      any
      inclines
      or
      declines,
      speed
      held
      to
      60-65
      for
      95%
      of
      the
      time.
      Trip
      out
      was
      645
      miles,
      and
      the
      last
      50
      was
      philly
      highway
      rush
      hour.
      Did
      some
      driving
      on
      Friday,
      all
      highway,
      no
      stop
      and
      go,
      again,
      being
      VERY
      mindful
      of
      economy.
      Filled
      up
      at
      716
      miles
      with
      15.124
      gallons,
      BUT,
      being
      filled
      up
      in
      NJ
      this
      morning,
      I
      couldn't
      pump
      it
      myself
      and
      the
      attendant
      didn't
      get
      me
      topped
      up
      all
      the
      way.
      Calculates
      to
      47.34
      but
      I
      think
      it
      could
      have
      taken
      more.
      Fuel
      light
      was
      NOT
      on,
      still
      had
      a
      bit
      of
      needle
      room
      on
      the
      gauge
      between
      the
      needle
      and
      red
      even.
      Route
      taken:
      30-71-76-80-322-76
      (PA/TPK)
      through
      Philly
      where
      it
      turns
      into
      42
      in
      NJ.
      Going
      home
      today,
      trip
      was
      same
      route,
      only
      backwards,
      with
      one
      spot
      I
      took
      an
      alternate
      highway
      vs.
      rural
      detour
      which
      made
      it
      a
      little
      longer.
      658
      miles
      when
      I
      pulled
      into
      my
      garage
      and
      I'm
      right
      on
      hitting
      the
      red,
      80
      to
      empty
      showing.
      Trip
      home
      use
      a
      little
      cruise
      due
      to
      some
      knee
      pain,
      A/C
      was
      used,
      had
      some
      wind
      in
      OH,
      and
      speed
      was
      mostly
      65-70.
      Using
      the
      GPS
      in
      the
      Nav,
      crossing
      PA
      there
      were
      some
      pretty
      good
      elevation
      swings,
      but
      after
      hitting
      harrisburg,
      it
      was
      only
      about
      200-300
      feet
      at
      a
      time,
      and
      once
      in
      Ohio
      leveled
      out
      with
      never
      more
      than
      about
      a
      100
      foot
      elevation
      change.
      I
      figure
      this
      tank
      is
      only
      42-43
      MPG.
      Using
      the
      trip
      fuel
      economy
      average,
      going
      out
      I
      never
      got
      above
      49.2
      MPG.
      Coming
      home,
      I
      hit
      47.1
      early
      on
      and
      that
      was
      it.
      Normally
      after
      an
      hour
      or
      two
      on
      the
      highway,
      before
      I
      was
      easily
      in
      the
      50's.
      Just
      running
      around
      my
      local
      area
      (runs
      up
      to
      Michigan,
      Chicago
      area,
      etc.....highway
      driving
      locally)
      I've
      pushed
      MANY
      tanks
      in
      excess
      of
      800
      miles
      with
      a
      solid
      mix
      of
      city
      thrown
      in.
      Now
      it
      seems
      I'll
      be
      lucky
      to
      see
      that
      with
      exclusive
      highway
      mileage.
      My
      normal
      work
      commute
      is
      mostly
      highway,
      but
      deals
      with
      a
      bit
      of
      early
      drive
      stop
      and
      go
      traffic
      going
      in
      during
      the
      afternoon
      rush.
      I'd
      still
      normally
      pull
      around
      700
      miles
      per
      tank
      give
      or
      take
      even
      using
      the
      A/C
      and
      what
      not.
      I
      absolutely
      do
      NOT
      forsee
      that
      happening
      now.
      I
      don't
      like
      accelerating
      from
      a
      stop
      now.
      It
      hangs
      in
      gear
      too
      long,
      slow
      shifts
      with
      the
      flare,
      and
      is
      just
      irritating
      to
      the
      point
      that
      I
      am
      using
      auto
      stick
      to
      upshift
      during
      acceleration.
      My
      muscle
      memory
      is
      telling
      me
      that
      I'm
      using
      FAR
      more
      throttle
      to
      get
      it
      moving,
      keep
      it
      moving,
      and
      to
      maintain
      speed.
      I
      drive
      with
      a
      light
      foot
      and
      when
      maintaining
      speed
      I
      used
      to
      be
      able
      to
      lightly
      flare
      the
      pedal
      and
      hold
      it.
      Now,
      if
      I
      try
      that,
      the
      car
      literally
      tries
      to
      decel,
      I
      can
      feel
      it
      pitching
      me
      forward,
      and
      I
      have
      to
      throw
      heavier
      on
      the
      pedal
      just
      to
      hold
      speed.
      VW
      and
      the
      EPA
      are
      NUTS
      thinking
      a
      1
      mpg
      impact
      is
      all
      that's
      happening.
      I
      have
      lost
      a
      LOT
      more
      than
      that,
      to
      the
      point
      where
      I'm
      questioning
      if
      the
      car
      was
      even
      flashed
      with
      the
      right
      tune
      because
      of
      it's
      economy
      and
      driving
      characteristics
      now.
      I'm
      going
      to
      look
      into
      options
      for
      returning
      to
      the
      stock
      tunes
      from
      before
      or
      aftermarket
      tunes
      and
      the
      likelihood
      of
      those
      being
      looked
      at
      if
      something
      needs
      servicing
      under
      warranty.
      I
      came
      to
      expect
      a
      certain
      fuel
      economy
      out
      of
      the
      car,
      and
      1MPG
      would
      have
      been
      acceptable,
      that's
      only
      a
      less
      than
      20
      mile
      per
      tank
      difference.
      The
      impact
      I'm
      seeing
      here
      is
      more
      like
      a
      ~100
      mile
      per
      tank
      difference
      (if
      this
      trip
      was
      before
      I
      had
      the
      fix,
      I
      have
      no
      doubts
      that
      the
      first
      tank
      I'd
      have
      coaxed
      up
      to
      close
      to
      900
      miles
      based
      off
      of
      previous
      partial
      tank
      trips
      I've
      done),
      or
      roughly
      5-7
      MPG
      depending
      on
      conditions.
      Yes,
      it
      still
      seems
      to
      be
      meeting
      the
      "EPA
      estimates"
      for
      economy
      of
      30/40,
      but
      realistically,
      it's
      not
      in
      the
      ball
      park
      for
      what
      it
      used
      to
      be.

      Local
      shop
      to
      me
      that
      specializes
      in
      TDI
      stuff
      has
      a
      VERY
      clean

      Golf

      door
      Manual
      trans
      on
      the
      lot,
      not
      for
      sale
      yet,
      but
      I'm
      up
      there
      enough
      he
      showed
      it
      to
      me.
      Needs
      a
      turbo.
      Dumping
      oil
      out
      the
      exhaust.
      Starts
      and
      runs
      fine,
      only
      smokes
      if
      you
      really
      get
      on
      it,
      but
      puking
      oil
      out
      the
      back
      (big
      trail
      from
      when
      he
      drove
      it
      into
      the
      lot,
      into
      the
      shop,
      out
      to
      the
      back
      of
      the
      lot).
      Other
      than
      the
      turbo,
      the
      car
      is
      straight,
      clean,
      well
      taken
      care
      of,
      just
      a
      little
      paint
      peel
      on
      the
      front
      bumper
      is
      about
      it.
      I
      can
      get
      it
      for
      $2K
      as
      it
      sits.
      Just
      wanted
      some
      thoughts
      if
      that's
      potentially
      worth
      it
      or
      not.

      This
      is
      a
      development
      as
      of
      just
      a
      couple
      days
      ago.
      My
      internet
      has
      been
      rock
      solid,
      no
      problems
      at
      all.
      Suddenly,
      with
      no
      indicators,
      a
      couple
      days
      ago
      specific
      websites
      began
      to
      load
      VERY
      slow,
      if
      at
      all.
      These
      are
      sites
      I
      frequent
      regularly,
      remain
      logged
      in
      to,
      etc.
      Other
      sites
      there
      is
      no
      change
      and
      everything
      is
      as
      it
      should
      be.
      I
      have
      so
      far
      rebooted/restarted
      my
      modem
      (Arris
      SB6184),
      router
      (Netgear
      R6300
      V1),
      PiHole
      DNS
      adblocker
      (running
      in
      a
      VM
      from
      my
      server),
      and
      computer.
      Verified
      its
      network
      based
      because
      I
      have
      a
      server
      and
      a
      laptop
      (wired
      and
      wireless
      respectively)
      all
      of
      which
      experienced
      the
      exact
      same
      problems
      on
      the
      exact
      same
      websites,
      no
      discrepancies.
      If
      I
      tether
      my
      phone
      (Verizon)
      to
      my
      laptop,
      I
      can
      access
      the
      sites
      perfectly
      fine.
      Have
      also
      done
      an
      ipconfig
      release
      and
      renew.
      DNS
      is
      manually
      set
      to
      my
      PiHole
      server
      with
      Google
      DNS
      as
      backup,
      and
      no
      change
      was
      noted
      when
      resetting
      to
      automatically
      acquire
      DNS
      from
      ISP.
      I'm
      pretty
      convinced
      it's
      from
      Comcasts
      end
      at
      this
      point,
      but
      I'm
      not
      sure
      how
      I
      should
      address
      it
      with
      them.
      Thought
      I'd
      see
      if
      anyone
      here
      has
      any
      ideas
      on
      the
      situation?

      How
      long
      to
      burn
      oil
      out

      Just
      finished
      up
      putting
      a
      new
      turbo
      on
      a
      2005
      Golf
      GLS
      TDI
      (VNT-17
      with
      tune).
      Stock
      turbo
      went
      and
      it
      was
      pouring
      oil
      out
      the
      exhaust.
      I
      cleaned
      ALL
      intake
      pipes,
      intercooler,
      and
      charge
      pipes
      while
      I
      had
      it
      apart.
      Started
      it
      up,
      and
      just
      a
      little
      smoking
      at
      idle.
      Barely
      anything.
      Leak
      checked
      good,
      topped
      off
      oil
      (did
      an
      oil
      change,
      wasn't
      level,
      so
      didn't
      have
      it
      topped
      up
      yet).
      Took
      it
      for
      a
      drive
      around
      my
      neighborhood,
      and
      left
      a
      thick
      trail
      of
      oil
      3/4
      of
      the
      way
      around,
      and
      about
      halfway
      around
      it
      started
      building
      up
      some
      head
      and
      started
      smoking....badly.
      So
      bad
      that
      it
      was
      unsafe
      because
      it
      would
      have
      completely
      blinded
      people
      behind
      me.
      Obviously
      the
      exhaust
      had
      quite
      a
      bit
      of
      oil
      in
      it.
      I
      tried
      another
      short
      drive
      with
      the
      same
      result
      also.
      Oil
      level
      on
      motor
      is
      NOT
      dropping
      that
      I
      can
      tell,
      so
      I
      don't
      think
      it's
      the
      new

      Anyone

      This
      is
      gonna
      be
      long
      so
      be
      forewarned.
      This
      is
      motivated
      partly
      by
      some
      self
      reflection
      and
      partly
      by
      the
      current
      political
      environment,
      so
      infer
      as
      you
      wish.
      People
      ask
      me
      why
      I
      work
      as
      hard
      as
      I
      do.
      I
      always
      try
      to
      go
      above
      and
      beyond.
      It's
      in
      my
      programming.
      Why
      do
      I
      come
      in
      on
      overtime
      when
      the
      company
      (by
      perception,
      I
      try
      to
      keep
      things
      in
      perspective)
      and
      Union
      treat
      us
      worker
      like
      crap.
      Why
      I
      am
      always
      go
      go
      go.
      Simple
      put,
      because
      I've
      learned
      there's
      no
      getting
      ahead
      unless
      you
      work
      for
      it.
      Things
      just
      don't
      come
      free
      and
      there's
      certainly
      no
      free
      rides
      unless
      you're
      one
      of
      a
      VERY
      privileged
      few.
      I'm
      on
      the
      tail
      end
      of
      a
      3
      day
      weekend
      as
      scheduled
      from
      work.
      This
      entire
      weekend
      was
      spent
      doing
      things
      making
      me
      get
      ahead.
      From
      scavenging
      parts
      for
      our
      vehicle
      we
      are
      getting
      ready
      to
      sell
      (little
      things
      we've
      let
      go),
      to
      swapping
      all
      mounts
      and
      a
      clutch
      on
      our
      "new"
      vehicle
      we
      bought
      as
      an
      economical
      move,
      I
      stayed
      busy
      with
      very
      little
      down
      time.
      Sure
      I
      spent
      some
      family
      time,
      played
      with
      the
      kids,
      chilled
      with
      a
      good
      friend
      who
      helped
      me
      wrench,
      but
      most
      of
      my
      time
      was
      spent
      working,
      doing
      something,
      being
      productive.
      Even
      now,
      I'm
      working
      on
      cleaning
      and
      organizing
      my
      garage
      to
      work
      better
      for
      me,
      to
      be
      more
      efficient,
      and
      taking
      a
      break
      to
      organize
      my
      thoughts
      here.
      Anyway.....
      I've
      pondered
      myself
      why
      I
      rarely
      say
      no
      to
      extra
      time
      at
      work.
      I've
      pondered
      why
      I
      feel
      guilty
      if
      I
      completely
      waste
      a
      day
      doing
      nothing
      productive
      at
      all.
      As
      I
      stepped
      out
      of
      my
      garage
      for
      some
      cool
      night
      air
      this
      night,
      I
      glanced
      inside
      my
      house
      through
      my
      windows,
      some
      dark,
      some
      lit.
      THAT
      is
      why.
      My
      family,
      comfortable
      inside,
      peacefully
      at
      rest
      feeling
      safe,
      happy.
      One
      of
      our
      cats
      carefully
      watching
      me
      from
      a
      window,
      happy
      and
      fat.
      I
      saw
      into
      my
      office,
      where
      I
      have
      pictures
      of
      my
      "Iconic
      American
      Sports
      car"
      on
      the
      wall
      from
      when
      I
      first
      owned
      it,
      having
      sold
      it
      during
      hard
      times
      and
      bought
      it
      back
      after
      regaining
      my
      feet.
      That
      made
      it
      hit
      home
      as
      trite
      and
      materialistic
      as
      it
      sounds.
      I
      had
      it
      VERY
      well
      back
      about
      7
      years
      ago,
      and
      I
      lost
      almost
      all
      of
      it
      but
      my
      family,
      and
      nearly
      lost
      them
      in
      the
      process.
      Hard
      work,
      perseverance,
      and
      perhaps
      a
      little
      luck
      and
      divine
      intervention,
      and
      I
      am
      doing
      better
      than
      I
      ever
      had.
      But
      it
      didn't
      come
      free.
      I
      had
      to
      work
      and
      I
      continue
      to
      work.
      I
      had
      to
      make
      sacrifices.
      And
      I
      will
      continue
      to
      work
      and
      make
      sacrifices
      for
      the
      betterment
      of
      my
      family
      and
      myself.
      Point
      is,
      the
      world
      doesn't
      give
      you
      things
      for
      free,
      and
      the
      world
      certainly
      isn't
      fair.
      The
      world
      doesn't
      care
      if
      you're
      offended,
      or
      about
      your
      feelings.
      You
      are
      what
      you
      make
      of
      yourself,
      plain
      and
      simple.
      Nobody
      is
      holding
      you
      down
      but
      you.
      People
      words
      won't
      stop
      you
      from
      succeeding.
      Seven
      years
      ago,
      at
      a
      lowest
      of
      the
      low
      points
      anyone
      could
      experience,
      I
      could
      have
      rolled
      over
      and
      given
      up,
      but
      I
      pressed
      on,
      and
      though
      it
      took
      some
      struggles,
      trials,
      and
      truly
      hard
      times,
      I
      overcame.
      You
      can
      too.
      Don't
      let
      anyone
      tell
      you
      you're
      not
      good
      enough
      or
      you
      can't.
      I
      have
      a
      very
      dark
      mark
      following
      me
      and
      not
      a
      single
      day
      goes
      by
      that
      I
      don't
      regret
      past
      decisions
      I
      made,
      but
      you
      can't
      dwell
      on
      it,
      you
      must
      learn
      from
      your
      past
      and
      move
      forward.
      You
      can't
      erase
      your
      history
      and
      expect
      everything
      to
      improve.
      You
      must
      take
      steps
      to
      make
      those
      improvements
      on
      your
      own,
      as
      no
      one
      will
      do
      it
      for
      you.
      History
      is
      history,
      you
      cannot
      run
      from
      nor
      hide
      from
      it,you
      can
      only
      learn
      and
      do
      better
      than
      before.
      So
      here
      I
      sit,
      about
      to
      get
      back
      to
      it.
      Looking
      from
      the
      outside
      in
      (being
      eaten
      by
      mosquitoes,
      freaking
      yaay),
      reflecting
      on
      roads
      traveled
      in
      the
      past,
      heeding
      lessons
      learned,
      and
      being
      grateful
      for
      where
      i
      am
      and
      what
      I
      have,
      and
      what
      lies
      before
      me.
      Perhaps
      you
      should
      too.
      Perhaps
      you
      should
      stop
      dwelling
      on
      the
      past,
      look
      at
      what
      you
      have,
      how
      you
      can
      improve,
      and
      what
      you
      need
      to
      do
      in
      order
      to
      make
      those
      improvements.
      I'm
      tired
      of
      all
      the
      rhetoric,
      tired
      of
      all
      the
      "something
      for
      nothing
      mentalities."
      You
      and
      only
      you
      are
      responsible
      for
      what
      you
      make
      of
      yourself,
      I
      am
      a
      living
      testament
      to
      that.
      Be
      strong,
      hold
      faith
      in
      nothing
      but
      yourself
      and
      those
      you
      hold
      dear,
      and
      keep

      Getting
      tired
      of
      Windows
      10,
      and
      figured
      I'd
      at
      least
      give
      Linux
      a
      run.
      Have
      Win
      10
      on
      a
      Samsung
      950
      Pro
      M.2
      NVME
      drive,
      and
      installed
      Linux
      Mint
      18
      on
      a
      spare
      SATA
      II
      AData
      64gb
      SSD
      I
      had
      laying
      around.
      Went
      through
      some
      growing
      pains,
      but
      after
      finding
      an
      obscure
      setting
      in
      my
      BIOS
      I
      was
      able
      to
      set
      the
      spare
      drive
      as
      the
      main
      boot
      drive
      (Thanks
      for
      making
      it
      difficult
      EVGA)
      and
      GRUB2
      picked
      up
      my
      WIndows
      boot
      loader,
      and
      I
      can
      choose
      freely
      between
      OS's
      on
      boot
      (just
      have
      normal
      issue
      of
      no
      NIC
      connectivity
      in
      Linux
      if
      I
      warm
      swap
      from
      Windows....I
      MUST
      do
      a
      power
      removed
      shutdown
      to
      get
      the
      NIC
      in
      Linux).
      ANYWAY..........
      I
      run
      a
      RAID1
      array
      of
      2x
      3TB
      hard
      drives
      as
      my
      data
      drives
      for
      backups
      of
      photo's,
      video's,
      run
      my
      transcoding
      through
      them,
      music,
      etc.
      I'm
      having
      trouble
      getting
      Linux
      to
      see
      these
      drives
      as
      a
      RAID
      array
      and
      not
      single
      drives.
      Using
      DMRAID
      -R
      in
      a
      terminal,
      I
      get
      the
      following:
      /dev/sdc:
      isw,
      "isw_bgbjjidfed",
      GROUP,
      ok,
      5860533166
      sectors,
      data@
      0
      /dev/sdb:
      isw,
      "isw_bgbjjidfed",
      GROUP,
      ok,
      5860533166
      sectors,
      data@
      0
      But.......they
      don't
      act
      like
      a
      RAID
      1
      array.
      I
      trial
      moved
      an
      item
      to
      one
      drive,
      and
      it
      was
      not
      copied
      to
      the
      other.
      I'm
      looking
      for
      guidance
      on
      how
      to
      fix
      this.
      Motherboard
      is
      an
      EVGA
      Micro2
      X99,
      and
      Processor
      is
      a
      Intel
      I7
      5820K
      if
      that's
      needed.
      I'm
      tempted
      to
      scrap
      the
      Linux
      experiment
      if
      I
      can't
      get
      this
      Raid
      Array
      showing
      properly
      as
      I
      have
      a
      LOT
      of
      family
      data
      backed
      up
      to
      it
      and
      need
      to
      ensure
      things
      stay
      copied
      to
      a
      second
      drive.

      So
      the
      experiment
      with
      the
      05
      Golf
      TDI
      I
      picked
      up
      and
      fixed
      up
      for
      my
      wife
      was
      a
      failure.
      Just
      too
      small
      of
      a
      car.
      A
      friend
      and
      co-worker
      bought
      it
      off
      of
      me
      for
      $4K
      yesterday,
      and
      I'm
      leaving
      today
      for
      a
      near
      600
      mile
      one
      way
      trip
      to
      pick
      up
      a
      2015
      Golf
      Sportwagen
      SEL
      TDI.
      It
      is
      at
      a
      non-VW
      dealer
      so
      unfortunately
      it's
      not
      a
      CPO,
      but
      it's
      got
      31K
      miles
      and
      was
      a
      one
      owner
      prior
      to
      the
      buyback.
      LOADED.
      Lighting
      package
      and
      everything.
      Platinum
      Grey
      over
      Titan
      black,
      DSG,
      Sunroof,
      Nav,
      etc.....exactly
      what
      my
      wife
      wanted
      (couldn't
      get
      her
      to
      bite
      off
      on
      a
      manual
      trans).
      Dealer
      had
      it
      listed
      at
      18k
      and
      that's
      what
      I
      got
      it
      for.
      So.......a
      friend
      and
      I
      are
      taking
      my
      12
      Passat
      SEL
      TDI
      for
      a
      road
      trip
      today
      to
      go
      pick
      it
      up.
      Looking
      forward
      to
      this........

      This
      is
      WEIRD.
      I
      did
      a
      wild
      card
      block
      of
      YouTube
      on
      my
      network.
      Confirmed
      working
      via
      multiple
      computers
      and
      tablets
      all
      with
      Chrome
      browser.
      My
      wife
      said
      our
      oldest
      was
      watching
      it
      this
      morning,
      and
      I
      found
      that
      the
      block
      was
      absolutely
      not
      effective
      on
      the
      Silk
      browser
      baked
      into
      the
      Fire
      HD
      8
      tablets
      the
      kids
      have.
      Both
      have
      the

      settings
      set
      to

      IP's
      with
      PiHole
      as
      the
      DNS
      server.
      Not
      sure
      what's
      going
      on
      here,
      hoping
      someone
      has

      Ok,

      hiatus
      when
      I
      moved
      (the
      move
      process
      caused
      me
      to
      rage
      terminate
      and
      move
      to
      Frontier
      FIOS.......boy
      that
      was
      a

      but
      was
      a
      customer
      from
      Jan
      2013
      through
      Jan
      2016,
      and
      then
      back
      in
      the
      03-06
      timeframe
      also.
      Essentially
      whenever
      Comcast
      was
      available
      I
      was
      a
      customer.
      So
      for
      the
      past
      year
      I've
      been
      on
      an
      internet
      only
      promo,
      Extreme
      150,
      for
      $59.99
      a
      month.
      That
      just
      expired,
      and
      the
      price
      has
      gone
      to
      89.99
      a
      month.
      My
      household
      is
      a
      cord
      cutter
      household,
      and
      frankly,
      $90
      a
      month
      for
      internet
      access,
      then
      being
      told
      that
      I'm
      capped
      and
      can
      only
      use
      it
      to
      a
      certain
      degree
      lest
      I
      pay
      more,
      is
      tiresome.
      I'd
      like
      to
      see
      if
      there's
      any
      way
      to
      stay
      at
      the
      $60
      a
      month
      price
      for
      the
      Extreme
      150
      package
      I'm
      on.
      I
      don't
      relish
      the
      idea
      of
      continually
      throwing
      more
      money
      at
      Comcast
      for
      a
      service
      that
      I'm
      now
      being
      told
      how
      much
      I
      can
      use
      in
      addition
      to
      the
      steep
      pricing.
      Thank
      you
      for
      any
      assistance
      you
      can
      give.

      I'm
      in
      the
      market
      for
      a
      Mesh
      type
      wifi
      system.
      I
      keep
      coming
      back
      to
      the
      Orbi
      because
      it
      has
      a
      great
      feature
      set
      and
      proven
      track
      record.
      I
      currently
      have
      an
      R6300
      router
      and
      am
      familiar
      with
      the
      Netgear
      interface,
      which
      is
      the
      cause
      of
      my
      concerns.
      Are
      the
      parental
      controls
      and
      internet
      access
      management
      any
      better
      on
      the
      Orbi
      than
      my
      old
      R6300?
      I
      have
      two
      school
      age
      kids
      and
      had
      actually
      put
      DD-WRT
      on
      my
      R6300
      so
      I
      could
      assign
      quiet
      times
      to
      their
      connected
      devices,
      shut
      off
      at
      a
      moment's
      notice
      should
      the
      need
      arises,
      etc.
      With
      the
      Netgear
      interface
      it
      seemed
      that
      I
      had
      to
      turn
      the
      network
      off
      then
      add
      exceptions
      for
      anything
      I
      wanted
      to
      connect.
      Very
      counterintuitive
      to
      me.
      Has
      this
      changed?
      This
      is
      a
      major
      factor
      iny
      purchase
      as
      it's
      something
      I
      need
      to
      have
      without
      relying
      on
      a
      3rd
      party
      app
      or
      the
      like.

      And
      I've
      been
      VERY
      impressed
      with
      it.
      I
      was
      at
      the
      point
      where
      it
      was
      this
      or
      start
      stringing
      ethernet
      cables
      around
      (i.e.
      through)
      the
      house
      and
      basement
      and
      going
      to
      a
      full
      Ubiquiti
      router/switch/AP
      setup.
      My
      ONLY
      gripe
      is
      that
      due
      to
      positioning,
      sometimes
      my
      wifi
      devices
      hit
      the
      wrong
      router
      due
      to
      signal
      coming
      through.
      I'm
      in
      a
      two
      story
      3200SF
      house
      on
      a
      basement
      (which
      isn't
      being
      used
      or
      factored
      in).
      Orbi
      router
      sits
      in
      my
      office
      at
      the
      front
      center
      of
      the
      house,
      one
      AP
      is
      in
      the
      great
      room
      on
      the
      same
      floor
      at
      the
      rear
      left
      of
      the
      house,
      the
      other
      AP
      is
      in
      the
      master
      bedroom
      at
      the
      top
      right
      of
      the
      house.
      Everything
      is
      close
      enough
      that
      there
      is
      some
      overlap
      which
      I
      expected,
      but
      can
      be
      a
      nuisance.
      For
      instance,
      my
      Xbox
      in
      my
      bedroom,
      though
      sitting
      a
      foot
      away
      from
      an
      AP,
      kept
      picking
      up
      my
      main
      router
      downstairs.
      Using
      ethernet
      on
      this
      fixed
      it
      no
      problemo.
      The
      dedicated
      backhaul
      channel
      really
      does
      it's
      job
      well,
      and
      I'm
      glad
      I
      went
      with
      this
      over
      the
      other
      mesh
      system
      I
      was
      contemplating
      (Amplifi
      HD)
      due
      to
      this
      capability.
      Got
      it
      installed,
      everything
      worked
      out
      great.
      Got
      some
      DHCP
      reservations
      set
      so
      there's
      no
      confusion,
      and
      let
      the
      wifi
      devices
      eat.
      Essentially,
      anywhere
      in
      my
      house
      now
      I'm
      getting
      throughput
      as
      if
      I
      was
      wired
      to
      the
      main
      router.
      VERY
      impressive
      to
      say
      the
      least.
      Have
      had
      zero
      issues
      yet
      other
      than
      some
      IP
      conflicts
      and
      some
      preset
      info
      issues
      (DHCP
      reservation
      in
      router
      combatting
      with
      static
      IP
      setting
      on
      device
      from
      previous
      setup
      causing
      latency
      for
      example).
      Haven't
      messed
      with
      circle
      yet,
      but
      found
      that
      using
      the
      phone
      app
      I
      can
      at
      will
      block
      devices
      internet
      access,
      which
      is
      exactly
      what
      my
      wife
      and
      I
      wanted.
      For
      the
      $400,
      this
      was
      WELL
      worth
      the
      investment.
      If
      it's
      long
      term
      stability
      holds
      up,
      I'll
      be
      even
      more
      pleased
      with
      it.

      I
      noticed
      my
      TV
      has
      seemed
      really
      dim
      the
      past
      couple
      of
      days.
      I
      normally
      keep
      it
      on
      vivid
      and
      it
      was
      nice
      and
      bright
      initially,
      but
      it
      just
      seemed
      flat
      and
      off
      for
      a
      couple
      days
      now.
      Was
      playing
      around
      in
      the
      settings
      and
      found
      that
      the
      "energy
      saving"
      was
      in
      auto
      and
      when
      I
      turned
      it
      off
      my
      screen
      instantly
      came
      up
      to
      expectations
      on
      brightness.
      I
      thought
      I'd
      turned
      all
      the
      power
      saving
      stuff
      off
      but
      apparently
      missed
      this.
      Is
      it
      really
      necessary
      to
      be
      using
      that
      for
      any
      reason
      or
      can
      I
      just
      leave
      it
      off
      and
      take
      the
      penalty
      on
      my
      monthly
      electric
      bill.
      I
      don't
      think
      it'll
      break
      the
      bank.

      the
      4k
      realm
      in
      my
      living
      room.
      So

      going
      to
      start
      encoding

      Is
      there
      a

      Plex

      going
      in
      manually

      Ok,
      this
      is
      weird.
      But
      follow
      along......
      Sold
      a
      Chrysler
      Pacifica
      on
      August
      25th
      last
      year.
      Like
      3-4
      days
      later,
      it
      was
      stolen
      from
      the
      new
      owner
      who
      never
      did
      the
      title/registration
      transfer,
      nor
      did
      he
      report
      it
      stolen
      to
      the
      police
      (for
      reasons
      that
      later
      became
      obvious
      as
      he
      had
      a
      warrant
      he
      got
      picked
      up
      on
      anyway).
      Out
      of
      my
      hands,
      but
      I
      tried
      to
      help
      where
      I
      could
      as
      the
      title
      with
      my
      identifiable
      information
      was
      IN
      the
      vehicle
      when
      stolen.
      Fast
      forward
      to
      last
      week.
      Get
      a
      call
      from
      Ontario
      of
      all
      places.
      Some
      customs
      official
      tracked
      me
      down,
      the
      Pacifica
      is
      in
      impound
      in
      Canada
      and
      apparently
      has
      been
      since
      early
      September.
      Thieves
      got
      hemmed
      up
      by
      the
      law
      there.
      Ok,
      cool,
      I
      give
      him
      the
      new
      owners
      info.
      Wash
      my
      hands
      of
      it
      again.
      Fast
      forward
      to
      today.
      Gentleman
      in
      Canada
      calls
      back.
      They
      talked
      to
      FWPD,
      and
      since
      the
      title
      was
      never
      transferred,
      I
      am
      still
      the
      registered
      legal
      owner.
      They
      won't
      work
      with
      anyone
      but
      me
      since
      it's
      legally
      still
      my
      vehicle.
      So
      looks
      like
      I'm
      going
      to
      Canada
      to
      pick
      up
      the
      Pacifica
      I
      sold.
      But
      wait......there's
      more.
      The
      guy
      I
      sold
      it
      to.
      His
      phone
      isn't
      accepting
      calls,
      nor
      is
      it
      accepting
      texts.
      His
      mother
      had
      called
      me
      while
      he
      was
      in
      jail
      last
      fall
      asking
      about
      the
      Pacifica
      (sweet
      lady),
      so
      I
      went
      through
      my
      phone
      records
      and
      spoke
      to
      her
      today.
      She
      said
      she
      randomly
      hears
      from
      her
      son
      and
      doesn't
      have
      a
      direct
      point
      of
      contact
      for
      him
      as
      of
      now
      either.
      She
      made
      it
      seem
      like
      he
      may
      or
      may
      not
      be
      in
      contact
      with
      me.
      So
      now
      I'm
      left
      in
      a
      conundrum.
      TECHNICALLY
      (and
      morally),
      it's
      not
      my
      vehicle.
      LEGALLY,
      it
      still
      is
      per
      the
      law
      and
      title/registration.
      The
      ONLY
      person
      customs
      in
      Canada
      is
      going
      to
      release
      it
      to
      is
      me
      because
      my
      name
      is
      on
      the
      title
      still.
      So
      obviously
      I'm
      going
      to
      pick
      it
      up.
      Then
      beckons
      the
      question......how
      long
      do
      I
      sit
      on
      it
      for
      before
      removing
      it
      from
      my
      possession
      if
      I
      don't
      hear
      from
      the
      guy?
      I
      can't
      just
      drop
      it
      off
      to
      his
      mother
      because
      she's
      in
      Montana.
      He
      travels
      all
      over
      the
      place
      (circus
      guy).
      Like
      what
      are
      my
      legal
      obligations
      here?
      He
      paid
      for
      the
      vehicle,
      and
      I
      will
      do
      my
      due
      diligence
      to
      get
      him
      the
      vehicle
      back
      after
      picking
      it
      up,
      but
      am
      I
      bound
      by
      a
      timeframe
      to
      do
      so?
      If
      I
      don't
      hear
      from
      the
      guy
      after
      six
      months
      and
      it's
      sitting
      idle
      outside
      my
      house,
      is
      it
      reasonable/legal
      to
      expect
      me
      to
      keep
      sitting
      on
      it?
      I'm
      just
      not
      sure
      how
      to
      proceed
      after
      picking
      it
      up
      given
      the
      high
      likelihood
      I
      won't
      ever
      be
      contacted
      by
      the
      guy.
      Even
      his
      mother
      said
      if
      it
      turns
      into
      a
      couple
      of
      months
      just
      sell
      it
      to
      someone
      else.
      I
      don't
      want
      to
      end
      up
      in
      a
      lawsuit
      or
      something
      over
      this
      when
      I'm
      going
      to
      go
      out
      of
      my
      way
      (3.5
      hour
      one
      way
      trip
      to
      pick
      up)
      to
      get
      the
      vehicle
      back
      and
      try
      to
      help.

      Just
      seeing
      what
      makes
      people
      tick.
      I've
      personally
      only
      owned
      one
      Corvette.......but
      twice.
      My
      twin
      turbo
      modded
      1999
      Nassau
      Blue
      C5
      Coupe.
      Owned
      it
      from
      May
      2006
      to
      November
      2010,
      then
      repurchased
      it
      from
      the
      person
      I
      sold
      it
      to
      in
      May
      of
      2015
      and
      will
      never
      let
      it
      go
      again.
      I've
      been
      behind
      the
      wheel
      of
      a
      couple
      others,
      a
      1995
      LT1
      M6
      a
      LONG
      time
      ago,
      a
      1998
      A4
      Coupe
      a
      couple
      months
      before
      I
      originally
      bought
      my
      99,
      a
      78
      while
      working
      as
      an
      auto
      tech
      (it
      came
      in
      for
      a
      braking
      pull,
      found
      a
      cracked
      front
      cradle
      of
      all
      things),
      and
      very
      late
      last
      year
      got
      behind
      the
      wheel
      of
      a
      friends
      2016
      ZO6.
      I've
      sat
      in
      or
      worked
      on
      plenty
      of
      others
      over
      the
      years.
      Hate
      to
      say
      it
      but
      I
      never
      envision
      owning
      a
      C7
      (though
      I
      LOVE
      the
      ZR1).
      Riding
      in
      it
      I
      couldn't
      keep
      my
      right
      knee
      out
      of
      the
      dash.
      Driving
      it
      I
      couldn't
      keep
      my
      right
      shin
      out
      of
      the
      dash.
      Just
      felt
      it
      was
      VERY
      small
      inside
      compared
      to
      my
      C5.
      I
      can't
      shake
      how
      it
      felt
      driving
      the
      LT1
      C4
      though.
      The
      ZF6
      was
      so
      buttery
      smooth,
      and
      the
      car
      was
      far
      more
      responsive
      to
      drive
      in
      terms
      of
      the
      suspension
      than
      my
      C5
      is.
      But
      then
      the
      C5.......it's
      so
      refined.
      I
      feel
      like
      I'm
      missing
      out
      having
      not
      driven
      a
      C6
      yet,
      and
      I'm
      kind
      of
      lusting
      over
      a
      C6
      ZR1
      since
      they're
      coming
      WAY
      down
      in
      price.....so
      who
      knows?
      Anyway,
      just
      curious
      about
      others
      experiences
      owning
      or
      driving
      our
      cars
      of
      choice........

      I
      hate
      admitting
      this
      because
      it's
      so
      first
      world
      problem,
      but
      I
      have
      been
      absolutely
      spoiled
      by
      my
      65"
      B7A.
      Having
      moved
      from
      a
      2006
      model
      Philips
      50"
      plasma
      which
      would
      only
      do
      720P
      anymore
      (nothing
      supports
      1080i
      it
      seems),
      the
      changes
      has
      been
      startling.
      SO
      much
      so
      that
      I'm
      SERIOUSLY
      considering
      buying
      a
      55"
      B,
      C,
      or
      even
      E7
      for
      our
      bedroom
      to
      replace
      our
      8
      year
      old
      42"
      bottom
      of
      the
      barrel
      LCD
      (the
      light
      bleed
      and
      ghosting
      is
      AWFUL!).
      Anyone
      else
      having
      similar
      tendencies?
      Get
      an
      OLED,
      then
      it's
      a
      MUST
      replace
      for
      the
      rest
      of
      the
      household
      TV's?

      Seems
      odd
      to
      have
      a
      low
      mileage
      car
      need
      seat
      covers
      replaced.
      As
      far
      as
      issues,
      make
      sure
      the
      ABS,
      Active
      Handling,
      and
      Traction
      Control
      systems
      aren't
      throwing
      any
      codes.
      The
      97-00
      C5's
      aren't
      supported
      anymore,
      and
      if
      your
      ABS
      module
      goes
      out,
      IF
      you
      can
      find
      one,
      you're
      going
      to
      pay
      dearly.
      Same
      for
      the
      Steering
      Wheel
      Position
      Sensor.
      You
      CAN
      upgrade
      to
      the
      2001-2004
      stuff
      but
      there's
      quite
      a
      bit
      of
      work
      involved.
      The
      Cluster
      will
      have
      the
      connection
      for
      the
      HUD,
      but
      you'll
      need
      to
      piece
      together
      a
      kit.
      I'd
      recommend
      find
      a
      painted
      solid
      roof
      and
      forget
      the
      acrylic
      one.
      It's
      like
      an
      acoustic
      amplifier.
      I
      hated
      mine
      when
      I
      bought
      the
      car
      and
      ended
      up
      selling
      it.
      Working
      on
      the
      C5
      is
      like
      any
      other
      car.
      I'm
      knee
      deep
      in
      my
      motor
      right
      now
      for
      some
      upgrades.
      Be
      aware
      of
      the
      driveline.
      If
      you
      don't
      know,
      the
      Clutch/flexplate
      is
      on
      the
      back
      of
      the
      motor,
      but
      the
      trans
      is
      connected
      to
      the
      diff
      in
      the
      back,
      everything
      connected
      by
      a
      torque
      tube
      with
      the
      driveshaft
      riding
      inside
      it.
      Clutch
      jobs
      are
      a
      task,
      and
      clutch
      pedal
      issues
      abound.
      Keep
      your
      fluid
      clean
      and
      fresh.

      Hmmmm......that's
      interesting.
      That's
      actually
      pretty
      nice
      that
      they
      take
      care
      of
      things
      like
      that.
      Sounds
      like
      a
      worthy
      place.
      Pull
      the
      codes.
      You
      can
      do
      it
      without
      a
      scanner
      using
      the
      DIC:
       gt;
      1.
      Turn
      your
      key
      to
      the
      "ON"
      position,
      but
      do
      not
      start
      the
      engine.
       gt;
      2.
      Clear
      any
      present
      messages
      by
      pressing
      the
      RESET
      button.
       gt;
      3.
      Hold
      the
      OPTIONS
      button
      down,
      and
      press
      the
      FUEL
      button
      4
      times.
      (This
      will
      get
      you
      into
      the
      "codes"
      section
      of
      the
      DIC.
       gt;
      4.
      The
      computer
      will
      automatically
      display
      all
      the
      codes
      your
      car
      has
      created.
      It
      will
      cycle
      through
      each
      code
      every
      3
      seconds.
      (Have
      a
      pen
      and
      paper
      handy
      to
      write
      down
      the
      codes)
       gt;
      Note:
      Any
      code
      that
      ends
      in
      an
      "H"
      is
      a
      history
      code
      (something
      that
      has
      occurred
      in
      the
      past,
      but
      is
      not
      reporting
      as
      an
      error
      currently.)
       gt;
      5.
      Once
      the
      computer
      has
      finished
      going
      through
      all
      of
      its
      codes,
      press
      RESET
      to
      enter
      Manual
      Configuration
      mode.
      It
      should
      start
      with
      a
      module
      and
      show
      "NO
      CODES"
      or
      "#
      Codes."
       gt;
      6.
      To
      optionally
      reset
      codes
      once
      in
      manual
      mode,
      press
      and
      hold
      RESET
      until
      is
      displays
      "NO
      CODES."
       gt;
      7.
      Press
      OPTIONS
      to
      go
      into
      the
      next
      module
      (ie,
      from
      PCM,
      or
      Powertrain
      Control
      Module,
      to
      TCS,
      or
      Traction
      Control
      System.)
       gt;
      8.
      Repeat
      Step
      6
      until
      you
      have
      reset
      all
      the
      codes
      in
      all
      the
      computer
      modules.
       gt;
      Note:
      Only
      reset
      the
      codes
      if
      you
      want
      to-
      it
      is
      not
      necessary
      to
      reset
      them
      every
      time
      you
      pull
      the
      codes.
       gt;
      9.
      When
      finished,
      simply
      take
      your
      key
      out
      of
      the
      ignition.
      As
      far
      as
      the
      top,
      they
      may
      not
      be
      adding
      anything
      to
      the
      painted
      tops.
      Mine
      is
      a
      factory
      piece
      (when
      I
      bought
      the
      car
      from
      the
      original
      owner
      he
      had
      both
      tops)
      and
      it
      was
      padded
      and
      cloth
      covered
      on
      the
      inside
      from
      GM.
      I
      personally
      haven't
      found
      anything
      I
      can't
      do
      on
      my
      car
      on
      jacks
      and
      stands.
      And
      I've
      had
      my
      low
      mount
      twin
      turbo
      kit
      in
      and
      out,
      driveline
      in
      and
      out,
      done
      long
      tube
      headers
      in
      and
      out,
      Motor
      out
      and
      back
      in,
      etc.
      A
      lift
      would
      DEFINITELY
      make
      life
      easier,
      but
      there's
      really
      nothing
      you
      can't
      do
      on
      stands
      with
      a
      couple
      of
      jacks.
      Someone
      else
      mentioned
      the
      balancer
      issues.
      This
      is
      a
      GM
      Gen
      III+
      issue
      not
      just
      C5's.
      And
      when
      they
      go,
      it's
      random.
      I
      replaced
      the
      one
      in
      my
      car
      with
      an
      SLP
      back
      in
      2006
      due
      to
      separation
      at
      55K
      miles
      of
      the
      stock
      piece.
      Watch
      it
      while
      it's
      running
      before
      you
      buy
      the
      car
      and
      see
      if
      it's
      wobbling
      or
      you're
      getting
      belt
      chirping.
      And
      just
      so
      you're
      absolutely
      aware,
      you
      have
      to
      pull
      the
      steering
      rack
      to
      do
      the
      job.
      It's
      kind
      of
      a
      pain
      because
      you
      have
      to
      unbolt
      then
      pull
      out
      through
      the
      drivers
      side
      wheel
      well.
      And
      generally,
      you
      have
      to
      loosen
      the
      cradle
      and
      pry
      the
      opening
      open
      a
      little
      wider
      to
      facilitate
      (yes,
      I've
      done
      this
      a
      few
      times,
      lol).
      Typical
      1/2"
      torque
      wrench
      will
      go
      to
      250
      ft/lbs
      or
      so.
      I'd
      recommend
      an
      aftermarket
      ARP
      bolt
      to
      replace
      the
      stocker,
      they're
      reusable
      and
      don't
      require
      the
      same
      torque
      sequence
      (stock
      is
      torque
      to
      yield
      so
      you
      have
      to
      degree
      turn
      stretch
      the
      bolt).
      The
      car
      you're
      looking
      at
      isn't
      an
      FRC
      is
      it?
      If
      it
      is,
      check
      for
      leaks
      around
      the
      windows
      and
      down
      the
      pillars.

      This
      place
      is
      definitely
      "Hey
      I
      have
      a

      C7"
      friendly.
      Not
      saying
      that's
      a
      bad
      thing,
      but
      it's
      definitely
      the
      dominant
      car
      here.

      I'm
      going
      to
      get
      downvoted
      to
      hell
      for
      this,
      but
      who
      cares.
      A
      cat-back,
      axle
      back,
      whatever
      back
      you
      want
      to
      call
      it
      on
      a
      corvette
      is
      NOT
      a
      major
      or
      "big"
      mod.
      It
      sounds
      good,
      it
      looks
      good,
      but
      come
      on,
      it's
      a
      bolt
      on
      couple
      hour
      mod
      tops.
      Not
      trying
      to
      rain
      on
      your
      parade,
      but
      for
      the
      sake
      of
      others,
      don't
      make
      it
      out
      to
      be
      something
      it
      isn't.

      I
      appreciate
      the
      acknowledgement
      and
      will
      readily
      concede
      that
      $2K
      isn't
      pocket
      change
      to
      most
      people
      for
      sure.
      I
      guess
      prices
      have
      gone
      up,
      that
      was
      a
      surprising
      number
      to
      hear
      for
      sure,
      as
      when
      I
      bought
      my
      Corsa
      it
      was
      retailing
      for
      about
      $1100
      (which
      I
      still
      found
      very
      pricey
      after
      moving
      from
      the
      F-Body
      world
      where
      a
      new
      borla
      cost
      $600
      back
      in
      the
      early
      2000's)
      .
      I'm
      just
      looking
      at
      it
      from
      a
      "mod"
      standpoint
      and
      not
      a
      dollar
      standpoint,
      where
      as
      a
      cat-back
      is
      one
      of
      the
      first
      and
      most
      basic
      performance
      mods
      done
      to
      a
      car.
      No
      disrespect
      intended
      at
      all.
      Believe
      me,
      I'm
      a
      performance
      guy.
      I
      just
      look
      at
      things
      in
      terms
      of
      enhancement
      and
      performance
      instead
      of
      $$$
      spent
      (again,
      no
      dig
      intended,
      just
      looking
      at
      it
      in
      terms
      of
      what
      is
      being
      done).
      FWIW
      Your
      car
      is
      beautiful
      (I've
      got
      NOTHING
      against
      C7's
      other
      than
      the
      interior
      feels
      cramped
      compared
      to
      my
      C5)
      and
      the
      exhaust
      sounds
      amazing.

      If
      it
      was
      a
      bimodal
      exhaust
      and
      he

      then
      it

      If
      you
      want
      an
      upgrade
      that's
      relatively
      cheap,
      C6Z.
      I
      like
      spending
      a
      tad
      more
      for
      Bilstein
      though.
      I've
      Bilstein
      Sport
      shocks
      in
      my
      C5
      since
      2007
      (about
      25k
      miles)
      and
      they
      COMPLETELY
      changed
      how
      I
      felt
      about
      my
      car.
      Totally
      cured
      the
      bump
      steer
      issues
      it
      had.
      The
      Bilstein
      HD
      are
      a
      good
      option
      too
      if
      you
      have
      NOT
      lowered
      the
      car
      at
      all.
      Koni's
      are
      another
      solid
      option,
      the
      FSD
      I
      think.
      But
      they're
      more
      expensive.

      I'll
      check
      the
      vid
      when
      I
      get
      home.
      Curious,
      were
      you
      dragging
      4th
      out
      at
      the
      trap?
      What
      were
      your
      RPM's
      and
      limiter
      at?
      Did
      you
      try
      bumping
      into
      5th
      and
      see
      what
      effect
      it
      had?
      Asking
      because
      I
      have
      08
      C6Z
      trans
      and
      rear
      in
      my
      C5
      and
      though
      it's
      run
      the
      mile
      (202
      at
      the
      12
      Texas
      Mile)
      I
      want
      to
      do
      some
      half
      mile
      runs
      with
      it.

      Essentially
      the
      OLED
      is
      the

      4K
      device
      in
      my
      house
      (for

      I
      run
      a
      plex
      server,
      but
      don't
      see
      a

      4K
      movies
      to
      be
      stored
      on

      I

      drive
      direct

      the
      OLED
      to
      keep
      4K
      movies
      stores.
      What
      I'm
      NOT
      finding
      documentation
      on
      is
      the

      the

      have
      this

      reading.
      On
      a
      positive
      note,
      answered
      my
      own
      question.
      The
      B7A
      (and
      I'm
      assuming
      the
      rest)
      will
      play
      a
      4K
      MKV

      with
      7.1

      an
      NTFS
      formatted
      external
      drive
      with
      ZERO
      issues.
      I
      just
      ripped
      and
      played
      Wonder
      Woman
      in
      all
      of

      4K

      This
      is
      important
      because
      Ultra
      HD
      Compatible
      drives
      have
      the
      proper
      firmware
      to
      NOT
      bypass
      the
      AACS
      2.0
      copy
      protection.
      The
      forum
      link
      has
      a
      list.
      You'll
      need
      a
      ripping
      program.
      MakeMKV
      I've
      used
      for
      YEARS
      and
      it's
      free
      in
      beta
      (or
      $50
      to
      puchase
      ahead
      of
      the
      game).
      Excellent
      program.
      Redfox
      is
      another,
      and
      there
      are
      others
      out
      there.
      Next
      step
      is
      optional,
      as
      you
      can
      rip
      to
      a
      MKV
      format
      with
      7.1
      or
      5.1
      or
      even
      stereo
      audio
      (whatever
      options
      you're
      presented
      with)
      as
      well
      as
      subtitles.
      But
      a
      4K
      movie
      is
      about
      55-65
      GB
      per
      movie.
      Normal
      1080
      Blu
      Ray's
      are
      anywhere
      from
      6
      to
      40
      GB
      depending
      on
      how
      much
      CGI
      and
      what
      not
      is
      involved.
      You
      can
      use
      these
      files
      directly,
      or
      use
      a
      program
      to
      compress,
      hardcode
      subtitles,
      etc.
      Handbrake
      is
      that
      program.
      Free,
      stable,
      powerful.
      I
      have
      NOT
      tried
      encoding
      a
      4K
      to
      compress
      the
      file
      size
      yet,
      but
      most
      of
      my
      1080
      Blu
      Ray
      library
      sits
      at
      6-12GB
      per
      movie
      with
      some
      heavy
      CGI
      movies
      (think
      Transformers)
      coming
      in
      at
      15-20
      GB.
      I
      keep
      my
      quality
      on
      the
      high
      end
      though.
      Do
      some
      searching
      and
      reading,
      there's
      tons
      of
      guides,
      but
      the
      above
      is
      what
      has
      worked
      for
      me
      since
      I
      started
      digitizing
      my
      collection
      in
      2012.

      that's

      She's
      a
      young
      spayed
      female,
      probably
      not
      even
      a
      year
      yet.
      No
      chip,
      just
      appeared
      at
      our
      neighbors
      a
      couple
      days
      back
      and
      we
      took
      herin.
      Super
      sweet,
      mouthy
      though,
      and
      full
      of
      kitten
      antics.
      My
      youngest
      named
      her
      and
      says
      she's
      his.
      She
      IMMEDIATELY
      assimilated
      into
      the
      house
      with
      the
      other
      cats
      and
      our
      two
      dogs.

      Judicious
      use
      of
      the
      right
      foot?
      Honestly,
      you
      learn
      the
      limits
      of
      a
      powerful
      car
      pretty
      quick
      if
      you're
      attentive,
      and
      most
      importantly,
      respectful
      of
      the
      power
      and
      smart
      about
      when
      you
      use
      it.
      On
      the
      old
      setup
      which
      was
      no
      slouch
      itself,
      I
      could
      putter
      around
      all
      day
      and
      not
      have
      any
      worries.
      I
      expect
      the
      same
      with
      the
      new
      setup
      I'm
      building
      now.

      is
      your

      a

      router?
      Are
      you
      using

      correct
      or
      have
      you

      So.....I
      have
      to
      recant
      as
      I
      found
      my
      TV
      does
      indeed
      direct
      stream
      4K
      H.265
      MKV
      files.
      I
      ripped
      a
      few
      UHD's,
      handbraked
      them
      down
      some,
      put
      them
      on
      my
      plex
      server,
      and
      each
      one
      direct
      streamed
      (audio
      transcoded
      as
      usual).
      It
      put
      a
      hurting
      on
      my
      network
      though
      and
      when
      I
      had
      two
      others
      (kids)
      streaming
      I
      started
      getting
      buffering.
      But
      it
      does
      it,
      which
      is
      big.
      But
      I
      still
      think
      I'm
      going
      to
      end
      up
      with
      a
      RAID
      box
      of
      some
      sort
      hooked
      up
      via
      USB
      to
      the
      TV
      directly,
      just
      to
      cut
      out
      any
      bandwidth
      issues.

      You
      may
      be
      pushing
      the

      limitations
      of

      if
      it's
      not
      on
      a
      gigabit
      port.
      I
      have

      setup

      router
      with
      about
      120

      If

      you're
      probably

      rate
      out.
      What
      router
      specifically
      is
      it?
      A
      quick
      google

      would
      let
      you
      know

      is
      or
      isn't.

      to

      QoS
      is
      Quality
      of
      Service,
      essentially
      assigning

      Looks

      too,
      sorry

      Oh
      wow.
      I'd
      have
      never
      thought
      that
      LG
      would
      have
      limited
      the

      like
      that.
      Wow.

      So
      I
      have
      a
      "server"
      running
      in
      a
      case
      and
      it's
      FULL
      of
      hard
      drives.
      Eight
      on
      the
      H700
      to
      be
      exact,
      so
      the
      SAS
      to
      SATA
      breakout
      cables
      are
      full
      and
      on
      both
      ports.
      I'm
      looking
      at
      a
      very
      high
      potential
      to
      need
      to
      expand
      due
      to
      acquiring
      the
      ability
      to
      rip
      my
      4K
      movies
      finally.
      I
      know
      I
      can
      migrate
      the
      H700
      over
      to
      a
      new
      motherboard
      and
      not
      lose
      my
      VD's,
      but
      what
      I
      need
      to
      know
      is
      if
      I
      can
      move
      one
      of
      the
      VD's
      off
      the
      H700
      itself
      and
      on
      to
      a
      port
      expander
      card
      without
      losing
      the
      VD
      config
      and
      data
      on
      those
      drives?
      Essentially
      unplug
      from
      the
      H700,
      plug
      the
      Expander
      card
      into
      the
      H700,
      then
      the
      4
      way
      SATA
      breakout
      cable
      into
      a
      port
      on
      the
      expander.

      I
      get
      that,
      but
      will
      it
      see
      the
      drives
      in
      the
      same
      VD
      configuration
      they're
      in
      now
      with
      no
      data
      loss
      if
      I
      move
      them
      from
      the
      H700
      to
      the
      expander
      card.
      The
      data
      integrity
      is
      what
      I'm
      worried
      with.
      I.E.
      if
      I
      add
      the
      expander,
      and
      move
      the
      drives
      to
      it,
      will
      the
      H700
      still
      see
      them
      as
      if
      they
      were
      still
      connected
      directly
      and
      subsequently
      leave
      the
      virtual
      disc
      intact?

      Awesome!
      Thank
      you
      so
      much!
      It's

      how
      much
      documentation
      is
      (and

      to
      my

      not
      giving
      up,
      and
      a

      luck.
      I
      just
      kept
      going,
      day
      by
      day.
      Not
      so
      much

      me,
      but
      for
      my
      wife
      and
      kids.
      Four
      years
      later
      and
      we
      are
      better
      off
      than

      with
      the
      perfect
      job
      falling
      into
      my
      lap,
      literally.
      But
      it
      wouldn't
      have
      ever
      happened
      if
      I
      wasn't
      trying
      to
      get
      things
      moving
      forward
      in
      the
      first
      place.
      Never
      give
      up.

      My

      got
      compromised
      somehow.
      Through
      my

      I
      managed

      they
      said
      I
      had
      to
      call
      mine.
      Called
      mine,
      filed
      a
      report,
      and......nothing.
      Did
      file
      a
      BBB
      complaint
      against
      the
      major

      If
      it's
      the
      vanes
      sticking,
      probably
      due
      to
      carbon
      fouling,
      you
      can
      clear
      them
      up
      with
      some
      oven
      cleaner.
      There's
      a
      good
      guide
      on
      the
      TDIClub
      forums.
      You'll
      need
      to
      disconnect
      the
      downpipe
      from
      the
      turbo
      in
      order
      to
      spray
      the
      cleaner
      in
      there
      but
      a
      lot
      of
      people
      have
      fixed
      it
      this
      way.

      Love

      Granted
      I

      days
      at
      a

      very

      too.
      Favorite
      place
      in
      the
      world
      for
      me.
      Good

      That
      car
      is
      a
      goner.
      See
      the
      silver
      and
      black
      thing
      pointing
      out
      at
      an
      odd
      angle
      in
      front
      of
      the
      front
      wheel?
      That's
      your
      right
      frame
      rail
      pointing
      in
      a
      direction
      it
      very
      much
      shouldn't
      be.
      Plus
      that
      inner
      fender
      that's
      all
      buckled
      up
      is
      a
      bonded
      body
      piece
      to
      the
      structure
      of
      the
      car.
      This
      one
      is
      going
      to
      be
      totaled.

      I
      was
      never
      really
      a
      car
      guy
      until
      I
      got
      my
      drivers
      license,
      and
      loved
      the
      F-Body.
      REALLY
      got
      into
      cars
      when
      I
      was
      about
      19-20,
      and
      was
      well
      ingrained
      in
      the
      F-Body
      world
      for
      a
      long
      time.
      That
      said,
      the
      Corvette's
      were
      always
      the
      next
      logical
      step
      up
      in
      terms
      of
      overall
      performance
      with
      a
      classier
      finish.
      I
      was
      in
      a
      position
      for
      a
      long
      time
      where
      I
      could
      have
      easily
      bought
      one,
      but
      waited
      until
      I
      was
      absolutely
      sure
      the
      disposable
      income
      wouldn't
      be
      missed
      given
      it
      wouldn't
      be
      a
      daily
      driver
      or
      anything.
      So
      in
      2006
      at
      the
      age
      of
      27
      I
      bought
      my
      1999
      Nassau
      Blue
      C5
      Coupe,
      as
      the
      C5
      was
      the
      model
      I
      had
      adored
      and
      lusted
      over.
      Had
      to
      sell
      it
      in
      2010
      due
      to
      some
      life
      changes
      (career
      change,
      NOT
      kids).
      Got
      lucky
      and
      bought
      the
      same
      car
      back
      again
      in
      2015.

      My
      best
      was
      right
      at
      30
      with
      my
      C5
      when
      it
      was
      a
      bolt
      on
      car.
      Before
      I
      tore
      it
      down
      for
      some
      extra's,
      I
      was
      getting
      around
      28MPG
      highway
      but
      packing
      an
      800+
      RWHP
      punch
      too.
      Won't
      complain
      about
      that
      one
      bit.
      It's
      pretty
      awesome
      that
      the
      fuel
      economy
      seems
      to
      be
      creeping
      up
      still
      even
      when
      these
      motors
      are
      becoming
      significantly
      more
      powerful
      (forced
      induction
      motors
      excluded......but
      who
      cars
      about
      economy
      there?).

      Initial
      reaction:
      "Hey,
      that's

      awesome!"
      Immediately
      followed
      by
      "oh......oh

      I
      look

      one
      too.

      Getting
      my
      current
      job.
      I
      was
      at
      a
      low
      point
      in
      my
      life,
      in
      a
      horrid
      career
      field
      and
      had
      just
      been
      laid
      off
      right
      before
      the
      winter
      slowdown.
      I
      am
      the
      only
      earner
      in
      my
      family,
      my
      wife
      doesn't
      work
      because
      we
      want
      to
      be
      around
      for
      the
      kids.
      I
      couldn't
      find
      a
      replacement
      job
      and
      was
      in
      the
      whatever
      you
      want
      to
      call
      it
      city
      office
      to
      file
      unemployment.
      As
      I
      was
      doing
      the
      paperwork
      the
      city
      worker
      said
      "Hey,
      this
      company
      is
      doing
      a
      hiring
      fair
      this
      weekend.
      You
      should
      come
      in
      and
      drop
      an
      app.".
      And
      three
      months
      later
      I
      suddenly
      had
      a
      new
      career.
      That
      was
      a
      little
      over
      four
      years
      ago
      and
      it's
      been
      life
      changing
      for
      my
      family.
      I
      ALWAYS
      keep
      that
      in
      perspective
      on
      the
      bad
      days.

      Totally
      agree.
      I
      knock
      down
      overtime
      whenever
      I
      can,and
      guys
      at
      my
      work
      always
      say
      it's
      not
      worth
      it.
      I
      explain
      to
      them
      whether
      I
      work
      no
      overtime,
      or
      add
      an
      extra
      $3-4k
      to
      my
      gross
      paycheck
      from
      overtime,
      I
      lose
      maybe
      an
      extra
      2-3%
      of
      the
      gross.
      I
      usually
      lose
      about
      21%
      and
      with
      a
      maxed
      out
      check
      that
      only
      dropped
      to
      24%.

      I
      do
      it
      all

      Naples
      Italy.
      That
      was
      one
      cramped
      and
      freaking
      FILTHY
      place.
      Extremely
      narrow
      roads,
      cars
      and
      little
      two
      stroke
      bikes
      zipping
      every
      which
      way,
      trans
      everywhere.
      It's
      cool
      because
      it's
      Naples
      and
      there's
      some
      history
      but
      man,
      what
      a
      dump.

      I
      was
      in
      a
      everything
      type
      of
      store
      picking
      up
      a
      couple
      of
      things.
      Was
      behind
      a
      young
      family,
      probably
      early
      mid
      20's,
      with
      a
      probably
      18-24
      month
      old
      child
      with
      them.
      They
      were
      checking
      out,
      first
      WIC
      stuff,
      the
      some
      groceries
      added
      in.
      No
      junk,
      no
      crap,
      but
      good
      healthy
      food.
      Not
      very
      much,
      the
      right
      kind
      of
      stuff
      (rice,
      checked,
      veggies,
      etc).
      They
      didn't
      have
      enough
      to
      cover
      the
      bill,
      and
      I
      saw
      the
      defeated
      look
      in
      the
      father's
      eyes
      and
      face
      and
      knew
      that
      they
      were
      on
      hard
      times
      instantly.
      He
      had
      the
      cashier
      remove
      a
      few
      items
      to
      get
      the
      bill
      low
      enough
      so
      they
      could
      pay.
      They
      finished
      up
      and
      I
      quickly
      asked
      the
      cashier
      to
      ring
      their
      items
      up
      on
      my
      bill
      and
      give
      them
      to
      the
      family
      before
      they
      had
      a
      chance
      to
      talk
      away.
      The
      look
      on
      the
      father's
      face
      was
      all
      I
      needed.
      I've
      been
      in
      that
      situation
      before.
      When
      this
      happened,
      I
      was
      in
      the
      same
      situation
      merely
      two
      years
      prior.

      Thanksgiving.
      In

      The
      build
      quality
      on
      the
      C6
      is
      a
      massive
      step
      forward
      over
      the
      C5,
      especially
      in
      the
      interior.
      The
      two
      cars
      will
      perform
      VERY
      similarity
      as
      they
      are
      quite
      close
      otherwise.
      The
      C6
      at
      this
      point
      has
      a
      bit
      more
      aftermarket
      support
      than
      the
      C5
      also.
      The
      fact
      that
      the
      C5
      is
      a
      Z
      is
      a
      selling
      point.
      Also
      the
      C5
      is
      a
      slightly
      more
      aerodynamic
      car
      than
      the
      C6.
      For
      me
      I'd
      lean
      towards
      the
      C6
      and
      just
      hold
      out
      for
      a
      six
      speed.

      Won
      my
      company
      grocery
      bagging
      competition
      back
      in
      1995
      when
      I
      worked
      as
      a.....yep,
      you
      guessed
      it,
      grocery
      bagger.
      Unbeknownst
      to
      me,
      there
      was
      a
      competition
      at
      the
      state
      grocers
      convention,
      which
      I
      had
      earned
      a
      ticket
      to.
      Won
      the
      state
      competition
      also.
      That
      got
      me
      a
      full
      interview
      on
      the
      local
      news
      (large
      metro
      area)
      and
      a
      trip
      to
      the
      national
      competition,
      which
      I
      sadly
      did
      not
      win.
      Or
      When
      I
      was
      NCOIC
      of
      the
      Joint
      Colors
      Team
      from
      McGuire
      AFB
      during
      4th
      of
      July
      ceremonies
      in
      Philadelphia
      in
      2001.
      Nationally
      televised
      colors
      presentation
      in
      the
      morning,
      then
      posted
      colors
      and
      remained
      on
      stage
      about
      ten
      feet
      from
      President
      Bush
      giving
      a
      national
      address
      that
      afternoon.
      I
      was
      carrying
      the
      US
      Flag
      and
      responsible
      for
      issuing
      commands
      for
      the
      team.

      That
      back
      in
      June
      of
      1998,
      I
      had
      gone
      to
      McDonalds
      and
      gotten
      lunch.
      Monopoly
      was
      happening,
      and
      I
      remember
      very
      specifically
      looking
      at
      my
      tickets
      and
      seeing
      a
      yellow
      Ventnor
      Avenue.
      Yellow
      section,
      new
      Corvette
      as
      the
      prize.
      Unlike
      my
      normal
      self,
      I
      threw
      out
      said
      tickets.
      Less
      than
      a
      week
      later,
      I
      had
      BOTH
      of
      the
      other
      common
      yellow
      ones
      in
      my
      possession.
      I
      had
      thrown
      away
      the
      winner
      for
      a
      new
      Corvette.
      That
      move
      haunts
      me
      to
      this
      day
      and
      I
      rarely
      tell
      the
      story
      anymore,
      but
      when
      I
      do,
      I
      don't
      expect
      to
      be
      believed.

      Either
      car
      is
      going
      to
      be
      pretty
      admirable
      in
      the
      performance
      arena.
      The
      C5Z
      is
      capable
      of
      running
      in
      the
      high
      11's
      in
      the
      1320
      bone
      stock
      with
      a
      solid
      good
      driver
      and
      good
      air.
      The
      C6
      Auto
      or
      stick
      won't
      be
      dark
      behind.
      Something
      to
      consider
      also
      if
      you
      ever
      plan
      to
      mod
      the
      car.
      Wheel
      options
      for
      the
      C6
      are
      vastly
      greater
      than
      for
      the
      C5
      when
      larger
      aftermarket
      brakes
      are
      concerned.
      Due
      to
      the
      C5's
      fender
      line
      it's
      difficult
      to
      get
      a
      wheel
      with
      the
      right
      offset
      to
      clear
      something
      like
      a
      C6Z
      brake
      caliper.
      The
      C6's
      fenderlines
      allow
      for
      better
      offsets
      and
      a
      wider
      variety
      (plus
      having
      the
      ability
      to
      bolt
      on
      the
      C6Z
      flares
      fenders
      helps
      a
      lot
      too).
      I'm
      not
      saying
      the
      C5
      is
      a
      bad
      car
      at
      all.
      I
      own
      one
      and
      love
      it.
      But
      it's
      dated,
      build
      quality
      is
      the
      epitome
      of
      late
      90's
      GM
      manufacturing,
      and
      the
      C6
      was
      a
      positive
      evolutionary
      step
      forward.
      I
      think
      you'd
      be
      happy
      in
      either
      one.

      We
      have
      5
      cats
      so
      one
      is
      usually
      in
      the
      bed.
      Usually
      one
      of
      the
      two
      youngest
      we
      have,
      but
      my
      old
      mad
      kitty
      (had
      him
      since
      he
      was
      3
      months
      old
      and
      he
      just
      turned
      17)
      comes
      up
      and
      snuggles
      up
      with
      me
      when
      I
      work
      nights
      and
      sleep
      all
      day.
      He
      avoids
      the
      kids
      that
      way.
      Our
      dog
      is
      up
      here
      right
      now.
      About
      60lbs
      of
      floof
      (shepherd
      size,
      fluffy
      husky
      coat).
      She
      usually
      sleeps
      with
      my
      oldest
      son
      but
      we
      have
      family
      in
      town
      and
      he's
      sleeping
      with
      Grandma
      who
      doesn't
      like
      animals.

      Sorta
      kinda
      first
      day.
      Was
      living
      near
      my
      wife's
      family
      and
      doing
      full
      time
      call
      center
      "work"
      and
      part
      time
      Auto
      tech.
      Wanted
      to
      move
      up
      in
      the
      world
      and
      had
      a
      friend
      a
      couple
      states
      over
      get
      me
      hooked
      up
      with
      an
      auto
      shop.
      Great
      phone
      interview,
      was
      told
      I
      had
      a
      job
      waiting.
      M-F,
      a
      Saturday
      a
      month
      on
      rotation,
      solid
      pay,
      etc.
      So
      we
      set
      it
      up
      and
      a
      few
      weeks
      later
      I
      moved
      my
      family
      two
      states
      over.
      Day
      after
      we
      move
      I
      go
      meet
      the
      guy
      who
      set
      all
      this
      up
      and
      he
      says
      let's
      go
      see
      the
      company
      owner.
      Sit
      down
      with
      him
      and
      it's
      suddenly
      a
      completely
      different
      story.
      Saturdays,
      every
      one,
      were
      mandatory
      on
      shift.
      The
      owner
      about
      had
      a
      heart
      attack
      when
      the
      guy
      who
      set
      this
      up
      mentioned
      pay
      (apparently
      was
      about
      $5
      an
      hour
      over
      their
      normal
      hire
      in
      rate).
      Guy
      started
      telling
      the
      owner
      I
      was
      completely
      ASE
      certed
      when
      I
      only
      had
      about
      4
      at
      the
      time.
      I
      still
      had
      the
      job
      and
      at
      the
      pay
      we
      discussed,
      but
      I
      knew
      then,
      before
      I
      even
      worked
      my
      first
      day,it
      wouldn't
      last.
      Six
      week
      later
      I
      was
      let
      go
      because
      "the
      company
      wasn't
      doing
      well
      and
      the
      owner
      let
      one
      tech
      go
      from
      each
      location."
      Was
      pretty
      pissed
      at
      the
      entire
      ordeal.
      Apparently
      the
      guy
      who
      set
      it
      all
      up
      did
      it
      completely
      off
      the
      cuff
      without
      authorization,and
      he
      got
      canned
      soon
      thereafter.

      Steve
      Irwin.
      He
      was
      trying
      to
      do
      so
      much
      good
      for
      animals
      and
      out
      planet.
      And
      looking
      at
      his
      family
      you
      just
      know
      it
      wasn't
      all
      for
      show
      either
      as
      they
      all
      turned
      out
      very
      awesome
      in
      their
      own
      ways.
      He
      was
      a
      soul
      taken
      from
      this
      place
      far
      too
      early.

      I
      just
      bought
      a
      65"
      in
      April
      and
      have
      been
      waiting
      to
      see
      if
      the
      55's
      would
      hit
      a
      good
      price.
      $1100
      is
      enough
      to
      make
      me
      want
      to
      pull
      the
      trigger.
      It's
      a
      front
      page
      deal
      on
      SlickDeals
      right
      now.......I'm
      REALLY
      trying
      to
      fight
      the
      urge
      to
      snag
      a
      55"..........I'm
      probably
      not
      going
      to
      make
      it...........

      You
      all
      must
      have
      missed
      where
      I
      already
      have
      the
      65"
      one.
      I'm
      talking
      about
      resisting
      a
      55"
      for
      the
      bedroom.
      Another
      65"
      isn't
      necessary
      and
      would
      be
      way
      too
      big
      for
      my
      bedroom.

      Korn
      is
      pretty
      solid
      live.
      Disturbed
      too.
      But
      hands
      down
      the
      most
      impressive
      live
      show
      I've

      of
      quality
      and
      accuracy)
      was
      Matchbox

      Took
      my
      girlfriend
      (now
      wife)
      as
      a
      surprise
      right
      after
      I
      returned
      home
      from
      a
      deployment.
      I
      wasn't
      keen
      on
      the
      band
      but
      she
      was.
      The
      live
      performance
      completely
      changed
      my
      impression
      of
      them.

      over
      it.
      Time
      makes
      it
      less
      of
      a
      burden
      on
      the
      heart.
      I
      say
      that
      having
      lost
      the
      best
      cat
      that
      I've
      ever
      encountered,
      who
      chose
      me
      as
      his
      human
      as
      a
      kitten
      and
      spent
      almost
      15
      years
      with
      me,
      back
      in
      Jan
      of
      2016.
      Not
      a
      day
      goes
      by
      that
      I
      don't
      think
      about
      my
      Ben
      Kitty,
      but
      time
      has
      made
      it
      easier.

      I

      2012
      Passat
      at
      92K
      miles
      back
      in
      early
      September
      2015
      (literally
      days
      before
      DG
      dropped).
      It
      now
      has
      135K
      and
      climbing.
      Has
      been
      largely
      trouble
      free.
      Bought
      it
      knowing
      it
      had
      an
      exhaust
      flap
      needing
      fixed
      under
      warranty.
      Had
      the
      AdBlue
      heater
      done
      under
      warranty
      (120K).
      Had
      a
      single
      temp
      sensor
      in
      the
      intercooler
      go
      bad
      (replaced
      under
      the
      DG
      warranty).
      Only
      incident
      that
      has
      cost
      me
      out
      of
      pocket
      was
      where
      the
      main
      fuel
      feed
      line
      spontaneously
      separated
      and
      left
      me
      stranded
      briefly.
      Been
      a
      really
      solid
      reliable
      car
      to
      date
      overall.
      Timing
      belt
      interval
      on
      the
      2012's
      is
      130K
      per
      dealer
      data
      sheets.
      It's
      about
      a
      $750-900
      job
      (indy
      vs
      dealer
      pricing)
      when
      it
      comes
      due
      so
      be
      prepared
      for
      that.
      If
      it's
      a
      car
      that's
      been
      fixed
      under
      the
      dieselgate
      program,
      then
      it's
      going
      to
      have
      a
      4/52K
      warranty
      (was
      4/48K
      but
      I
      just
      received
      a
      mailer
      extending
      that
      an
      extra
      4K
      miles)
      on
      pretty
      much
      ANYTHING
      related
      to
      the
      induction/fueling/exhaust/emissions
      system.
      DSG
      is
      a
      40K
      interval.
      If
      there
      are
      no
      service
      records
      I'd
      say

      it
      just
      for
      precautionary
      measures.
      If
      the
      car
      is
      clean
      and
      well
      taken
      care
      of
      I'd
      have
      zero
      hesitation
      on
      buying
      one
      even
      at
      150K
      miles.

      Ooh.....SE
      with
      the
      lighting
      package.
      Nice
      find!
      When
      we
      looked
      for
      our
      15
      GSW
      we
      wanted
      the
      lighting
      package
      but
      could
      only
      find
      SEL's....so
      we
      settled
      for
      an
      SEL,
      lol.

      Nice
      job.
      Those
      are
      really
      sharp
      for
      1/30
      to
      1/50
      on
      a
      moving
      target.
      I
      can't
      ever
      seem
      to
      keep
      that
      clarity
      with
      that
      low
      of
      a
      shutter.
      Most
      of
      my
      rolling
      shots
      are
      usually
      around
      1/125
      but
      I
      don't
      get
      near
      the
      natural
      motion
      blur
      either
      sadly.
      And.....as
      a
      C5
      owner,
      I
      love
      everything
      about
      your
      buddies
      car.
      Even
      more
      so
      that
      it's
      obviously
      an
      FI
      car.

      That's
      awful.
      I
      didn't
      know
      either
      of
      them
      but
      I
      constantly
      saw
      how
      liked
      they
      were
      in
      the
      car
      community.
      I
      can
      only
      imagine
      how
      the
      friends/family/close
      ones
      are
      feeling.
      A
      horrid
      injustice
      for
      certain.

      They're
      quite
      reliable
      as
      long
      as
      you
      don't
      ignore
      the
      maintenance.
      Costs
      aren't
      really
      any
      worse
      than
      a
      gasoline
      vehicle
      over
      the
      long
      run.
      With
      the
      mileage
      on
      the
      car,
      being
      fixed
      under
      dieselgate,
      it's
      going
      to
      benefit
      from
      the
      better
      of
      the
      two
      warranty
      options,
      that
      being
      a
      11
      year
      162K
      warranty
      on
      an
      enormous
      list
      of
      items,
      read
      [this
      link](https://www.vwcourtsettlement.com/wp-content/uploads/documents/emissions/Gen3_Emissions_Modification_Disclosure_Volkswagen.pdf)
      for
      more.
      They're
      EXCELLENT
      cars,
      IF
      you
      get
      to
      stretch
      their
      legs.
      I
      drive
      around
      25
      highway
      miles
      a
      day
      to
      work,
      and
      regularly
      get
      700+
      miles
      on
      a
      tank
      of
      fuel
      from
      my
      2012
      Passat
      TDI,
      averaging
      around
      42-44MPG
      mixed.
      Last
      fall
      we
      bought
      my
      wife
      a
      2015
      Golf
      Sportwagen
      TDI
      and
      her
      driving
      is
      almost
      exclusively
      in
      town
      short
      trips,
      and
      she
      only
      gets
      about
      30-32
      MPG
      running
      around
      town.
      Hindsight
      we
      should
      have
      bought
      her
      a
      hybrid
      of
      some
      sorts.
      With
      your
      commute,
      you'll
      probably
      do
      well
      in
      the
      TDI,
      and
      that's
      a
      pretty
      good
      price
      for
      the
      miles
      on
      the
      car.

      Colin
      Kaepernick
      --
      I'm
      a
      big
      NFL
      fan
      and
      the
      guy
      started
      a
      movement
      that
      caused
      a
      LOT
      of
      turmoil,
      but
      after
      learning
      that
      he
      went
      from
      sitting
      to
      kneeling
      on
      the
      advice
      of
      a
      Veteran,
      Nate
      Boyer,
      as
      a
      way
      to
      protest
      yet
      still
      show
      respect..........I'm
      a
      veteran
      myself,
      and
      I
      really
      think
      that
      was
      a
      truly
      classy
      move
      of
      Kaepernick
      to
      heed
      that
      advice.
      Really
      changed
      my
      tune
      on
      the
      guy.

      About
      13
      years
      old.
      Had
      a
      golf
      ball
      and
      an
      x-acto
      knife
      with
      a
      new
      blade.
      Holding
      golf
      ball
      with
      my
      left
      thumb
      and
      index
      finger
      wrapped
      around
      it.
      Insert
      blade
      with
      right
      hand
      a
      twist.......and
      cue
      the
      wide
      open
      wound
      on
      my
      left
      index
      finger
      and
      profuse
      bleeding.
      "MoooOOOOOOOoooooommmmmmmmm!!!!!!!!"
      Seven
      stitches
      later,
      I
      finished
      cutting
      that
      bastard
      golf
      ball
      open.

      It's
      what
      you
      make
      of
      it.
      If
      you
      put
      the
      effort
      in,
      the
      military
      is
      very
      rewarding.
      You
      may
      find
      you
      even
      want
      to
      make
      a
      career
      out
      of
      it,
      and
      the
      reward
      for
      putting
      in
      that
      20
      it
      pretty
      good.
      But.....
      Whatever
      you
      do,
      DO
      NOT
      fuck
      it
      up.
      The
      military
      absolutely
      will
      eat
      it's
      own,
      chew
      you
      up,
      and
      spit
      you
      out
      to
      live
      the
      rest
      of
      your
      life
      with
      a
      pretty
      significant
      label
      if
      you
      go
      that
      route.
      It
      can
      be
      extremely
      damaging
      in
      the
      long
      term
      even
      though
      it's
      a
      volunteer
      job
      to
      be
      there
      in
      the
      first
      place
      if
      you
      go
      down
      the
      wrong
      path.

      take
      a
      job
      that
      dissolved
      in
      6
      weeks.
      Had
      a
      horrible
      first
      year
      struggling,
      then
      landed
      the
      most
      lucrative
      job
      I've
      ever
      had
      and
      we
      have
      firmly
      set
      roots
      down
      here.

      Budget.
      Figure
      your
      in
      and
      out
      to
      the
      penny.
      Cut
      anything
      that's
      not
      a
      necessity.....this
      means
      cable,
      cell
      phone,
      internet,
      eating
      out,
      etc.
      If
      you're
      paying
      on
      a
      vehicle,
      get
      rid
      of
      it.
      You
      want
      to
      limit
      your
      expenditure
      as
      much
      as
      possible.
      Once
      you
      get
      your
      feet
      under
      you
      again,
      SLOWLY
      wean
      yourself
      back
      into
      the
      luxuries.

      Turned
      my
      hobby
      of
      working
      on
      cars
      into
      my
      profession
      for
      a
      couple
      years.
      Now
      I
      fight
      just
      to
      do
      my
      own
      maintenance
      I
      despise
      it
      so
      much.
      I
      have
      a
      nice
      car
      I
      need
      to
      finish
      up
      too
      but
      have
      no
      drive
      to
      put
      forth
      the
      effort.
      Working
      on
      cars
      professionally
      absolutely
      ruined
      my
      love
      for
      doing
      it
      as
      a
      hobby.

      Oh
      god
      less.
      Our
      wedding
      was
      for
      about
      120
      people
      and
      it
      cost
      just
      north
      of
      $30k
      that
      we
      paid
      90%
      of
      ourselves.
      It
      was
      nice
      and
      pretty
      extravagant
      (rented
      an
      entire
      corporate
      retreat
      to
      include
      the
      banquet
      hall,
      manor
      house,
      cottage,
      etc)
      but
      after
      it
      was
      all
      said
      and
      done,
      we
      looked
      at
      each
      other
      and
      said
      "that's
      it?".
      Live
      and
      learn.

      Interesting
      that
      this
      question
      is
      in
      my
      feed
      along
      with
      another
      one
      I
      just
      answered.
      Anyway......
      Wedding
      was
      just
      over
      $30k,
      about
      90%
      paid
      for
      by
      us.
      I
      owned
      a
      townhouse
      in
      NJ
      that
      I'd
      bought
      on
      the
      cheap
      before
      the
      housing
      boom,
      so
      I
      just
      pulled
      an
      equity
      line
      of
      credit
      and
      away
      we
      went.
      Had
      it
      not
      been
      for
      that
      our
      wedding
      would
      have
      been
      DRASTICALLY
      different.

      I
      agree.
      I
      was
      so
      excited
      when
      the
      first
      one
      came
      out
      and
      loved

      But
      they
      got
      progressively
      worse
      and
      worse
      to

      This
      tragedy
      of
      a
      traveling
      kids
      show
      called
      T-Rex
      Planet.
      Hugely
      hyped
      on
      TV,
      radio,and
      social
      media.
      VERY
      expensive
      ($100
      admission
      for
      a
      family
      of
      four),
      and
      was
      a
      complete
      joke.
      As
      we
      walked
      up
      to
      the
      entrance,
      the
      shady
      vacation
      package
      smac
      artists
      trying
      to
      make
      it
      seem
      like
      you
      had
      to
      give
      your
      info
      over
      before
      entering
      set
      off
      alarms
      big
      time.
      Once
      in,
      it
      was
      dimly
      lit
      so
      you
      couldn't
      see
      the
      abhorrent
      quality
      of
      the
      animatronic
      displays.
      The
      "rides"
      we're
      those
      4
      wheel
      carts
      with
      a
      BAD
      dinosaur
      covering,
      or
      a
      motionless
      dinosaur
      with
      a
      saddle.
      Souvenirs
      were
      dollar
      store
      toys
      (literally)
      being
      hawked
      at
      insulting
      prices.
      And
      even
      though
      we
      paid
      $100
      to
      get
      in,
      EVEEYTHING
      inside
      was
      pay
      to
      play.
      We
      were
      in
      and
      out
      in
      under
      an
      hour.
      What
      pushed
      me
      over
      the
      edge
      was
      when
      I
      left
      a
      review
      on
      the
      FB
      page
      and
      it
      was
      promptly
      deleted.
      So
      I
      went
      and
      made
      a
      Yelp
      account,
      and
      also
      proceeded
      to
      put
      up
      a
      public
      Facebook
      page
      for
      leaving
      reviews
      that
      they
      couldn't
      touch
      or
      influence.

      Very
      nice!!!!
      I
      hope
      to
      own
      a
      C6Z
      someday
      but
      I
      refuse
      to
      give
      up
      my
      C5
      to
      do
      it.

      Understand
      and
      know
      your
      customer.
      If
      they're
      looking
      at
      a
      large
      4k
      TV
      in
      the
      low
      end
      range,
      feel
      them
      out.
      Are
      they
      budget
      limited,
      usage
      limited,
      or
      are
      they
      unaware
      of
      the
      benefits
      of
      the
      extra
      expenses
      for
      the
      higher
      quality?
      It
      makes
      no
      sense
      to
      try
      to
      sell
      a
      top
      of
      the
      line
      TV
      to
      someone
      who
      can't
      afford
      or
      doesn't
      care
      about
      the
      differences,
      and
      there
      are
      a
      LOT
      of
      people
      like
      that.
      The
      OLED's
      pretty
      much
      sell
      themselves.
      For
      most
      others,
      they're
      unnecessary
      or
      a
      pipe
      dream.

      That's
      the
      plan.
      Currently
      if
      I
      wanted
      to
      make
      the
      jump
      I'd
      need
      to
      swap
      the
      C5.
      I
      love
      my
      C5
      (and
      it's
      turbos)
      too
      much
      to
      do
      that.
      Few
      years......and
      hopefully
      it'll
      be
      a
      C6
      ZR1
      that
      gets
      added.

      I
      absolutely
      agree.
      The
      taxi
      scene
      was
      a
      riot.
      It
      was
      all
      downhill
      from
      there
      though.

      For
      a
      lot
      of
      stuff,
      I've
      started
      paying
      to
      have
      it
      done.
      The
      more
      time
      consuming
      stuff
      for
      sure.
      But
      things
      like
      oil
      changes,
      brake
      jobs,
      etc
      I
      still
      do
      myself
      because
      I
      refuse
      to
      pay
      what
      shops
      want
      to
      charge.
      My
      project
      I
      won't
      let
      anyone
      touch
      because
      I
      don't
      trust
      them
      to
      do
      it
      to
      my
      standards.
      Didn't
      go
      management.
      Got
      out
      completely
      and
      into
      manufacturing.
      Best
      move
      I
      ever
      made.

      Wrong
      front
      bumper,
      no
      side
      skirts,
      wrong
      spoiler
      on
      the
      hatch,
      and
      I
      bet
      there's
      no
      exhaust
      cutouts
      in
      the
      rear
      bumper
      either.
      Nice
      bird,
      but
      it's
      a
      Formula
      and
      not
      a
      Trans
      Am.

      I
      tried,
      but
      side
      by
      side
      the
      quality
      suffered,
      not
      in
      sharpness,
      but
      loss
      of
      HDR.
      That
      and
      the
      program
      I
      use
      also
      has
      an
      8Bit
      pipeline
      only,
      even
      though
      you're
      working
      with
      10bit
      on
      the
      4K
      stuff.
      As
      of
      now
      I'm
      NOT
      touching
      my
      4K
      rips,
      and
      planning
      storage
      upgrades

      my
      server
      accordingly.

      Tried
      that.
      Colors
      still
      washed
      out.
      Problem
      is
      the
      pipeline
      of
      Handbrake
      is
      8
      bit,
      so
      it
      takes
      you
      10
      bit,
      converts
      it
      down
      to
      8
      bit,
      then
      upconverts
      it
      back
      to
      a
      simulated
      10
      bit.
      If
      I
      still
      have
      my
      files
      I'll
      try
      to
      post
      up
      a
      side
      by
      side,
      but
      essentially
      it's
      like
      looking
      at
      all
      the
      colors
      slightly
      pastelled
      with
      the
      HB
      encode
      vs
      untouched.

      My

      that

      gone

      without

      the

      Pro
      is
      the
      common
      denominator,
      seems
      you
      should
      maybe
      look
      at
      it
      at
      this
      point.
      I
      run
      an
      XBOX
      One
      S
      on
      my
      65
      B7
      and
      an
      XBOX
      One
      on
      my
      55
      B7
      and
      have
      had
      zero
      issues
      with
      either.

      All

      familiar.
      I'm
      running
      a
      PERC
      H700
      and
      had
      to
      tape
      a

      on
      it.
      No

      Thanks
      for
      the
      heads
      up
      though,
      that
      could

      chase

      my

      Watched
      my

      brother
      drop
      out
      of
      school
      halfway
      through
      his
      senior
      year.
      Just
      didn't
      want
      to
      do
      it.
      Or
      work.
      But
      it
      was
      my
      mother's
      poor
      life
      decision
      of
      not
      putting
      a
      boot
      up
      his
      ass.
      He's
      now
      37
      and
      still
      lives
      at
      home,no
      aspirations,
      menial
      random
      jobs
      that
      he
      never
      keeps,
      a
      burden
      to
      her.

      Got
      me
      through
      the
      toughest
      time
      of
      my
      life.
      Kept
      me
      emotionless,
      and
      in
      a
      fog,
      level
      and
      able
      to
      function.
      But
      affected
      my
      physical
      endurance
      at
      the
      time
      to
      the
      point
      I
      could
      only
      do
      about
      20
      push
      ups
      in
      a
      minute
      when
      I
      was
      doing
      40-50
      a
      month
      prior.
      But
      it
      absolutely
      murdered
      my
      sex
      drive.
      Eight
      years
      off
      of

      and
      it's

      LONG
      time
      ago
      now
      when
      my
      wife
      and
      I
      were
      dating.
      She
      got
      into
      bed
      coldly
      one
      evening.
      We
      are
      laying
      there
      and
      I
      could
      tell
      she
      was
      mad.
      Then
      out
      it
      comes......
      "I
      saw
      an
      address
      in
      your
      email.
      Who's
      Swingrrrr93
      that
      you're
      emailing
      with?"
      I
      started
      laughing
      and
      she
      got
      even
      more
      mad.
      "Dear......swingrrrr93
      is
      Dave.
      Dave
      is
      a
      dude.
      He
      runs
      so-and-so
      website
      with
      me.
      We
      we're
      talking
      about
      the
      website."
      I
      still
      give
      her
      crap
      over
      that.

      at
      an
      auto
      shop.
      Warranty
      job
      on
      brakes
      we
      did
      came
      in,
      the
      pads
      wore
      way
      too
      quickly.
      Manager
      wanted
      me
      to
      turn
      the
      rotors
      below
      minimum
      because
      the
      owner
      didn't
      want
      to
      pony
      up
      for
      a
      new
      set.
      I
      said
      no.
      Manager
      told
      me
      again,
      and
      I
      again
      said
      no.
      Owner
      told
      me
      to.
      I
      held
      firm.
      Owner
      gave
      job
      to
      someone
      else
      who
      did.
      I
      shortly
      turned
      in
      my
      notice
      then
      was
      fired
      3
      days
      later
      for
      some
      made
      up
      shit.
      Good
      riddance
      to
      that
      place.

      Oof.....that

      is
      a

      Some
      artificial
      atmoshphere
      via

      would
      benefit

      A amp;A

      ECS?

      I
      hate
      freaking
      holes
      cut
      in
      hoods
      like
      that.
      Just
      so
      cheap
      IMO.
      As
      for
      the
      sleeper
      debate.
      YES
      a
      Corvette
      can
      be
      a
      sleeper.
      Most
      people
      know
      they're
      fast.
      But
      a
      few
      years
      ago
      when
      my
      C5
      was
      a
      little
      less
      rowdy
      (looked
      stock
      on
      the
      outside
      save
      for
      some
      ZO6
      repro
      wheels
      and
      Corsa
      exhaust
      tips
      showing
      but
      packed
      a
      761/760
      RWHP/TQ
      punch
      via
      a
      very
      mildly
      built
      and
      sounding
      trin
      turbo
      setup)
      I
      picked
      off
      more
      than
      one
      I'll
      informed
      participant
      with
      a
      car
      that
      would
      have
      chewed
      up
      a
      stock
      C5
      alive.
      It's
      all
      in
      how
      you
      build
      it.

      A amp;A
      are

      I

      through
      them
      a
      long

      directly
      IIRC,
      been

      Their

      The
      15
      with
      the
      Gen
      3
      should
      get
      marginally
      better
      mileage.
      I
      know
      our
      15
      GSWgets
      marked
      better
      mileage
      than
      my
      12
      Passat.
      Other
      than
      that,
      they're
      so
      similar
      it's
      just
      a
      preference
      thing
      really.
      I'd
      say
      go
      with
      the
      15
      for
      a
      couple
      reasons.
      Warranty
      is
      better
      with
      the
      Gen
      3,
      possibility
      of
      getting
      a

      CPO

      and
      the
      styling
      is
      better
      IMO.

      I
      don't
      think
      there's
      any
      golden
      ticket
      for
      doing
      this.
      My
      wife
      has
      been
      a
      SAHM
      since
      we
      relocated
      in
      2013.
      Lack
      of
      debt
      is
      VERY
      key.
      You
      simply
      have
      to
      make
      enough
      to
      support
      everything
      on
      the
      one
      income.
      Looking
      at
      your
      situation,
      I
      don't
      see
      it
      as
      a
      feasible
      move
      quite
      yet
      for
      you
      with
      the
      numbers
      you've
      given.
      If
      your
      wife
      were
      to
      continue
      working,
      what
      would
      her
      net
      gain
      to
      the
      monthly
      income
      be
      AFTER
      factoring
      in
      child
      care
      costs?
      Does
      your
      wife
      have
      the
      capability
      to
      work
      from
      home
      with
      her
      current
      job
      (there
      ARE
      work
      from
      home
      jobs
      out
      there
      but
      they're
      hard
      to
      come
      by).
      Do
      you
      have
      any
      upward
      mobility
      in
      your
      job,
      possibilities
      of
      moving
      to
      a
      more
      lucrative
      job
      or
      relocating
      to
      a
      lower
      cost
      of
      living
      area?

      I
      see.
      Best
      advice
      from
      my
      limited
      perspective.....have
      her
      go
      back
      to
      work
      until
      you
      can
      knock
      the
      monthly
      bills
      down.
      Set
      yourself
      up
      for
      a
      strong
      start
      on
      the
      single
      income
      rather
      than
      giving
      it
      a
      go
      from
      an
      upside
      down
      position.
      About
      your
      job.....are
      you
      100%
      from
      home
      or
      is
      there
      an
      office
      you
      have
      to
      go
      in
      to
      on
      occasion?
      Would

      Went

      home.
      Asleep
      by

      They've

      they

      I
      had
      this
      same
      problem.
      I
      got
      above
      the
      outside
      of
      my
      window
      via

      open
      seam
      to
      the

      Water
      was
      free
      to
      just

      A

      bead
      of
      caulk
      solved
      the

      My
      car
      is
      the
      Passat,
      2012
      SEL
      bought
      mere
      days
      before
      Dieselgate
      dropped.
      Made
      out
      like
      a
      bandit.
      Been
      an
      incredible
      car
      so
      far.
      Has
      135K
      miles
      and
      is
      showing
      her
      age,
      especially
      on
      the
      front
      end
      paint
      (road
      rashed.....starting
      to
      think
      it
      needs
      a
      respray
      up
      front).
      Wife's
      driver
      is
      the
      2015
      Sportwagen
      SEL.
      I
      love
      everything
      about
      this
      car
      every
      time
      I'm
      in
      it.
      EXCEPT,
      when
      I
      get
      back
      into
      my
      Passat.
      Only
      had
      this
      one
      since
      last
      November,
      and
      it's
      a
      youngin,
      only
      has
      38K
      miles.
      *edit*
      Apparently
      I'm
      suffering
      heat
      stroke
      and
      can't
      put
      the
      right
      words

      I
      would
      but
      she
      really
      only
      putters
      around
      town
      in
      it.
      We
      actually
      screwed
      up
      getting
      her
      a
      TDI.
      Should
      have
      gotten
      her
      a
      Hybrid,
      it
      would
      do
      MUCH
      better.
      We've
      only
      put
      6K
      miles
      on
      it
      since
      purchasing
      in
      November,
      and
      it
      was
      a
      550+
      mile
      drive
      home
      after
      the
      purchase,
      and
      we've
      made
      3
      trips
      back
      to
      her
      families
      home
      with
      it
      at
      1K
      round
      trip
      each.
      So
      in
      8
      months
      she's
      really
      only
      put
      about
      2500
      miles
      on
      it.
      There's
      already
      a
      couple
      of
      nicks
      in
      the
      nose
      anyway.....

      Not
      a
      bad
      idea,
      but
      she
      needs
      the
      size
      of
      the
      sportwagen
      with
      the
      kids/dogs.
      Her
      GSW
      does
      ok,
      she
      gets
      about
      375
      a
      tank
      running
      around
      town
      and
      takes
      3-4
      weeks
      to
      use
      a
      tank
      of
      fuel.
      My
      plan
      is
      to
      eventually
      retire
      the
      Passat
      for
      a
      2014-15

      spring
      you
      could
      drop
      a
      valve
      really
      quickly.
      Pop
      the
      valve
      covers
      off
      and
      see
      what's
      loose.
      Could
      be
      a
      collapsed
      lifter
      but
      you'd
      still
      see
      it
      with
      a
      sloppy
      rocker.

      Check
      at
      Monoprice.
      I've
      been
      using
      their
      mounts
      for
      years
      now
      (installed
      my
      first
      one,
      a
      full
      articulating
      job
      that
      I
      literally
      hung
      myself
      off
      of
      back
      in
      2009,
      only
      cost
      $45
      at
      the
      time).
      Get
      a
      mount
      with
      a
      full
      back
      frame,
      not
      one
      of
      the
      ones
      where
      the
      cross
      bars
      are
      in
      two
      pieces.
      Those
      always
      shift
      and
      are
      a
      pain.
      Currently
      have
      my
      65"
      OLED
      on
      [this](https://www.monoprice.com/product?c_id=109 amp;cp_id=10828 amp;cs_id=1082822 amp;p_id=12278 amp;seq=1 amp;format=2)
      mount;
      I
      did
      modify
      the
      support
      bars
      for
      the
      400x300
      VESA
      on
      the
      OLED.
      There
      are
      other
      options
      available
      that
      are
      no
      modification
      necessary.
      My
      advice:
      ALWAYS
      get
      the
      main
      mount
      installed
      (with
      4
      locally
      purchased
      good
      lag
      bolts)
      into
      STUDS.
      NEVER
      try
      installing
      into
      drywall,
      I
      don't
      care
      what
      kind
      of
      device
      you're
      using
      to
      put
      the
      bolt
      into.
      Definitely
      need
      a
      level.
      Pre-drill
      for
      the
      lag
      bolts,
      you
      run
      far
      less
      risk
      of
      blowing
      out
      a
      stud
      if
      you're
      close
      to
      an
      edge.
      Stud
      finder
      also......
      I
      install
      the
      main
      bracket
      starting
      with
      the
      first
      hole,
      then
      level
      off
      of
      that.
      Usually
      get
      a
      0 #176;
      level
      without
      issue
      that
      way.
      Top
      right,
      then
      top
      left,
      then
      finish
      up
      with
      the
      two
      on
      the
      bottom.
      Also,
      don't
      forget
      when
      setting
      the
      height
      to
      compensate
      for
      the
      offset
      of
      the
      VESA
      on
      the
      TV.
      You've
      got
      some
      wiggle
      room
      vertically
      on
      the
      hangers
      for
      the
      mount,
      but
      only
      so
      much.
      If
      you
      don't
      get
      the
      bracket
      in
      a
      good
      spot,
      you
      may
      find
      your
      TV
      is
      too
      high
      or
      low.

      Just
      discovered
      builder
      pro

      was
      my
      shortcoming

      it's
      taking
      some
      getting
      used
      to

      I
      do

      it

      Working

      Down
      to

      Stuck

      wasn't

      Didn't

      dependable
      motor,
      great
      low
      end
      torque,
      but
      ran
      out
      of
      steam
      pretty
      quick.
      The
      LT1
      introduced
      in
      1992
      is
      what's
      known
      as
      the
      Gen
      II
      Small
      Block
      Chevy,
      and
      is
      a
      pretty
      big
      leap
      up
      from
      the
      TPI
      motors.
      In
      1996
      you
      could
      also
      get
      a
      C4
      with
      the
      further
      enhanced
      LT4
      motor
      rated
      at
      330
      HP.
      For
      a
      REAL
      kick
      in
      the
      pants,
      for
      about
      $15-25K
      you
      can
      hop
      into
      a
      1990-1995
      LT5
      equipped
      C4
      ZR1
      Corvette
      rated
      at
      anywhere
      from
      375-405
      HP.
      GREAT
      cars
      those
      ZR1's.
      Also,
      I'd
      say
      stay
      away
      from
      Manual
      Trans
      cars
      if
      they're
      pre-1989.
      The
      Nash
      4+3
      isn't
      a
      solid
      unit.
      The
      ZF6
      Six
      Speed
      trans
      introduced
      in
      89
      is
      a
      VERY
      solid
      transmission
      (I
      like
      driving
      it
      better
      than
      the
      TR6060
      in
      my
      C5).

      Spend
      some
      time
      on
      the
      Corvette
      Forum.
      You'll
      find
      that
      hard
      clear
      coat
      is
      the
      norm
      on
      the
      C5.
      I
      can
      personally
      attest
      to
      that
      as
      I've
      done
      polishing
      work
      on
      more
      than
      a
      few
      and
      every
      one
      of
      them
      took
      some
      pretty
      aggressive
      compounds
      to
      even
      make
      a
      dent
      in
      any
      swirling,
      scratches,
      etc.
      Don't
      mistake
      scratching
      to
      mean
      soft
      clear
      coat.
      If
      your
      microfiber
      towel
      has
      ANY
      kind
      of
      abrasive
      in
      it,
      is
      dirty,
      etc,
      it
      can
      and
      will
      put
      scratches
      into
      any
      clear
      coat.
      The
      true
      test
      comes
      into
      play
      when
      you
      go
      to
      polish
      those
      imperfections
      out.

      Very

      I'm

      career

      Anyone

      having
      problems
      with
      the

      One

      We
      switch
      accounts
      quite
      often
      in

      (myself
      and
      three

      play)
      and
      inevitably
      after
      the
      first
      or
      second
      account
      switch
      now,
      you
      either
      get
      a
      unselectable
      main
      screen,
      or
      if
      you
      get
      into

      and
      go
      to
      look
      at
      the
      battle
      pass,
      challenges,
      etc,
      you
      can't
      select
      anything
      at
      all.
      It's
      like
      the
      joysticks
      on
      the
      remote
      get
      locked
      out
      for
      some
      reason.
      Completely
      playable,
      but
      you
      can't
      check
      into
      or
      look
      at
      anything
      menu
      related.

      the

      was
      present
      before
      and
      after.
      ONLY
      happens
      after

      from
      one
      account
      to

      and

      Then
      you
      get
      functionality
      back
      until
      switching
      accounts

      Wouldn't

      I
      just
      listened
      to
      that
      video
      you
      posted
      up.
      That
      is
      way
      too
      fast
      on
      a
      cold
      start
      to
      be
      rod
      knock.
      I'm
      almost
      positive
      it's
      valvetrain
      related.....I.E.
      probably
      won't
      need
      a
      new
      motor
      but
      will
      still
      run
      some
      $$$$.
      You
      need
      to
      get
      someone
      competent
      to
      look
      at
      it
      before
      you
      start
      throwing
      money
      away
      on
      a
      new
      motor,
      parts,
      things
      that
      aren't
      necessary.

      you!
      Believe
      it
      or
      not,
      this
      is
      as
      shot
      straight
      off
      the
      camera.
      I
      was
      taking
      this
      shot
      at
      sunrise
      and
      got
      lucky
      with
      the
      matching
      sky.

      properly
      day
      to
      day
      throughout
      the

      Just
      a

      daily
      change
      as
      the
      seasons
      progress.

      What
      kind
      of
      car?
      I
      had
      a
      Chrysler
      Pacifica
      (2005)
      that
      was
      doing
      similar
      things
      ......turns
      out
      it
      was

      Yeah,
      that
      was
      an
      18x9.5
      and
      18x10.5
      set
      of
      machined
      face
      black
      powdercoated
      repro
      ZO6
      wheels.
      This
      pic
      was
      taken
      in
      fall
      of
      2009.
      I
      got
      rid
      of
      those
      wheels
      a
      few
      years
      back
      because
      moisture
      got
      under
      the
      clear
      coat
      and
      they
      looked
      like
      crap
      (warrantied
      the
      first
      set
      for
      the
      same
      issue)
      and
      went
      nicer
      with
      CCW's.
      I
      loved
      the
      look
      the
      wheels
      gave,
      but
      they
      just
      didn't
      hold
      up
      over
      time.

      Like
      the
      other
      guy
      that
      posted,
      I
      LOVED
      the
      picture
      on
      glass
      look.
      But
      for
      me,
      the
      big
      sound
      bar
      at
      the
      bottom
      ruined
      it
      for
      me.
      It
      takes
      some
      focus
      away
      from
      the
      TV
      display
      and
      picture
      on
      glass,
      and
      it
      shouldn't.
      Plus,
      with
      a
      dedicated
      sound
      bar,
      you
      can
      find
      one
      that
      you
      like
      (go
      listen
      to
      some
      in
      person
      before
      deciding
      on
      one
      --
      I
      nearly
      went
      bose
      until
      I
      did
      a
      side
      by
      side
      with
      a
      Klipsch
      RSB-11
      and
      heard
      how
      muddled
      the
      Bose
      sounded).

      Very

      a

      And
      responds

      who

      Remember
      also,
      the
      Coyote
      in
      the
      Mustang
      has
      to
      turn

      and
      sacrifices
      down
      low
      due
      to
      engine
      architecture,
      and
      the
      mopar
      stuff
      is
      trying
      to
      move
      tanks.
      The
      C6
      is
      lighter
      and
      has
      a
      very
      broad
      powerband.
      It'll
      be
      fine.

      I
      realize
      this,
      and
      am
      comfortable
      with
      the
      parity
      offered
      via
      the
      RAID
      to
      be
      enough
      to
      cover
      me.
      The
      SSD
      is
      simple
      just
      to
      improve
      on
      the
      old
      spinner
      that
      just
      died,
      and
      lower
      the
      heat
      in
      the
      drive
      way
      where
      it's
      located
      (top
      of
      box
      hot
      swap
      bad
      because
      all
      internal
      drive
      bays
      are
      full).

      I'll
      add
      some
      more
      info.
      I'm
      not
      a
      Dev
      by
      any
      means,
      and
      this
      was
      a
      Windows
      install
      so
      unfortunately
      a
      lot
      of
      suggestions
      are
      moot,
      but
      sincerely
      appreciated.
      This
      was
      kind
      of
      self
      induced.
      The
      boot
      drive
      that
      died
      was
      sketchy
      and
      I
      got
      lazy
      in
      spending
      the
      money
      to
      replace
      it
      and
      it
      bit
      me.
      C'est
      la
      vie
      Thank
      you
      everyone
      for
      the
      suggestions.
      I'm
      picking
      up
      a
      new
      1tb
      SSD
      on
      the
      way
      home
      from
      work
      and
      will
      hopefully
      get
      it
      up
      and
      running
      again
      this
      evening.
      I'd
      been
      binging
      Roadkill
      before
      bed
      and
      am
      going
      through
      withdrawals.

      UPDATE:
      I
      cheaped
      out
      and
      got
      a
      500GB
      SSD
      instead
      of
      the
      1TB.
      I'll
      just
      have
      to
      be
      a
      little
      more
      proactive
      on
      cleaning
      out
      the
      downloaded
      torrent
      files.
      Drive
      installed,
      took
      a
      clean
      Win7
      installation,
      and
      PMS
      is
      currently
      chugging
      away
      downloading
      metadata
      for
      my
      400+
      movies
      before
      it's
      going
      to
      import
      my
      TV
      shows
      back
      in.
      Best
      news,
      the
      H700
      proved
      worth
      it's
      weight
      in
      gold.
      All
      both
      virtual
      drives
      were
      untouched,
      unharmed,
      and
      no
      data
      was
      lost.
      Now....getting
      my
      Sonarr
      back
      up
      and
      running
      and
      playing
      nice
      with
      BTN........that
      was
      painful
      the
      first
      time
      and
      it's
      been
      a
      while.
      Expecting
      more
      pain
      there,
      lol.

      I
      considered
      it,
      but
      there's
      a
      couple
      of
      issues.
      One,
      the
      motherboard
      being
      used
      has
      an
      issue
      with
      letting
      the
      SATA
      drives
      boot
      in
      RAID
      after
      an
      RMA
      at
      the
      end
      of
      it's
      warranty
      life,
      so
      I'm
      kind
      of
      stuck
      (this
      is
      an
      X58
      setup).
      Two,
      I'm
      simply
      out
      of
      space,
      there
      are
      ZERO
      more
      connectors
      on
      my
      PSU
      at
      this
      point
      that
      can
      be
      used.
      But.......I'm
      going
      to
      get
      everything
      set
      up
      and
      then
      image
      the
      entire
      drive
      and
      store
      it
      safely
      away.

      Oh,
      I'm
      not
      backing
      up
      to
      an

      I

      a

      I

      with
      a

      1

      For
      stereo's?
      There's
      a
      sponsor
      on
      the
      corvette
      forum
      "Vettenuts"

      double
      din
      center
      console
      trim
      now.
      Takes
      a

      bit
      of
      work
      but
      the
      world
      of
      stereo's
      are
      at
      your
      disposal
      there.
      If
      you're
      talking
      direct
      fit,
      there's
      not
      much
      out
      there.

      a

      If
      the

      good
      enough,
      ceramic
      isn't
      a

      I
      was
      wondering
      when
      they
      were
      going
      to
      do
      this.
      Nice
      of
      them
      to
      give
      their
      constituents
      a
      heads
      up.
      I'm
      still
      happily
      rocking
      my
      non
      chip
      card.....for
      now.

      I
      picked
      up
      a
      friendly
      drive
      and
      can
      confirm
      doing
      this
      works
      as
      long
      as
      the
      files
      for
      the
      particular
      film
      have
      been
      updated
      (you
      have
      to
      manually
      update
      a
      specific
      file
      the
      drive
      uses
      in
      order
      to
      rip
      4K).
      I
      will
      caution,
      have
      lots
      of
      HD
      space.
      4K's
      are
      no
      joke.......50-65gb
      per
      film
      usually.
      And
      I
      personally
      haven't
      been
      able
      to
      compress
      one
      yet
      without
      losing
      HDR,
      so
      take
      that
      into
      consideration
      too.
      If
      you're
      happy
      with
      1080
      files,
      grab
      the
      fastest
      drive
      you
      can
      and
      get
      to
      ripping.

      black
      paint
      wasn't
      an
      option......so
      car's
      been
      painted.
      That
      would
      make
      me
      seriously
      question
      things
      right
      from
      the
      get-go.

      "The
      review
      of
      the
      case,
      in
      our
      opinion,
      did
      not
      establish
      any
      willful
      or
      malicious
      acts
      by
      jail
      staff
      that
      would
      justify
      the
      filing
      of
      charges
      under
      the
      requirements
      of
      the
      statute,"
      Rye
      said.
      This
      pisses
      me
      off
      to
      no
      end
      and
      it
      the
      DA
      blatantly
      covering
      for
      the
      officers
      involved.
      How
      many
      of
      you
      have
      ever
      heard
      an
      officer
      say
      "
      just
      because
      you
      didn't
      mean
      to
      is
      no
      excuse,
      you
      still
      broke
      the
      law.".
      Same
      reasoning
      applies
      whether
      or
      not
      an
      act
      was
      malicious.
      Ignorance
      and
      intent
      are
      not
      excuses
      to
      be
      used
      in
      deciding
      whether
      or
      not
      charges
      should
      be
      applied,
      yet
      it
      CONSTANTLY
      happens
      now
      with
      people
      who
      should
      be
      held
      to
      a
      higher
      standard
      and
      more
      accountable
      than
      others.

      It's
      an
      LT1
      car
      so
      that's
      essentially
      the
      Pinnacle
      of
      the
      C4
      world
      (save
      for
      the
      96
      LT4
      cars).
      Best
      options,
      best
      setup,
      etc.
      If
      it's
      condition
      reflects
      it's
      mileage,
      you
      could
      probably
      ask.....I
      SAID
      ASK.......$20-25k.
      A
      sale
      will
      probably
      take
      a
      while
      because
      you'll
      need
      to
      find
      someone
      willing
      to
      pay
      that
      for
      a
      24
      year
      old
      that
      really
      doesn't
      have
      collectibility
      aside
      from
      it
      being
      a
      clean
      low
      mileage
      example.
      Realistically
      I'd
      expect
      a
      sale
      for
      mid
      to
      upper
      teens,
      MAYBE
      breaking
      into
      the
      low
      20's
      with
      the
      right
      buyer.
      Best
      of
      luck
      with
      it.

      No
      one
      is
      going
      to
      pay
      that.
      If

      then
      yeah,

      I
      had
      to
      do
      some
      digging.
      My
      first
      thought
      was
      simply,
      that's
      not
      an
      840
      HP
      setup,
      that
      trap
      speed
      is
      more
      indicative
      of
      about
      500
      RWHP.
      Then
      I
      saw
      where
      the
      dragstrip
      was.
      Ouch.

      Good
      grief.
      I
      was
      spoiled
      for
      a
      LONG
      time
      having
      Atco
      And
      Cecil
      County
      tracks
      at

      So
      what
      did
      your
      11.9@120
      translate
      to
      roughly
      at
      sea
      level?
      Did
      you
      work
      those
      numbers
      out?
      It
      has
      to
      be
      pretty
      solid
      I'd
      think.

      2012
      VW
      Passat
      TDI,
      138K
      miles,
      original
      brakes.
      My
      car.
      Started
      getting
      some
      grinding
      from
      the
      back
      right,
      knew
      it
      was
      coming.
      This
      was
      the
      inside.....and
      was
      not
      grinding.
      It
      was
      the
      outside.
      I
      wish
      I
      could
      capture
      the
      depth
      of
      the
      grooves
      better,
      they're
      the
      worst
      I've
      ever
      seen.
      Probably
      shouldn't
      have
      waited
      this
      long
      to
      put
      new
      brakes
      on
      it,
      but
      I
      was
      curious
      how
      long
      the
      OEM
      ones
      were
      going
      to
      last.

      If
      you
      pick
      it
      up,
      just
      grab
      a
      service
      kit
      from
      one
      of
      the
      well

      on
      doing
      the
      service
      yourself
      on

      prefect

      bought
      it
      in

      No
      noises
      or
      shakes
      from
      the
      brakes
      at
      all
      until
      I
      started
      getting
      a
      grinding
      sound
      last
      Sunday.

      That's
      pretty
      low
      mileage
      for
      a

      I
      think
      $13K
      may
      be
      a
      tad
      high,
      but
      $10K
      might
      be
      a
      bit
      low.
      I'd
      shoot
      for
      around
      11-12K.
      I
      bought

      The
      difference?
      Two
      of
      the
      three
      above
      (Dieselgeek
      is
      the
      odd
      man
      out)
      include
      new
      bolts
      for
      the
      engine
      mount,
      which
      you
      do
      NOT
      have
      to
      remove.
      Certainly
      not
      $80
      worth
      of
      bolts.
      Now
      for
      the
      meat
      of
      this.
      EVERY.
      LAST.
      KIT.
      uses
      the
      exact
      same
      Litens
      Timing
      Tensioner
      and
      INA
      rollers
      which
      is
      OEM
      stuff.
      The
      OEM
      belt
      on
      the
      car
      is
      a
      Contitech,
      so
      again,
      all
      but
      dieselgeek
      are
      using
      the
      OEM
      belt
      (I
      have
      ZERO
      problems
      and
      would
      have
      preferred
      the
      GATES,
      but
      OEM
      is
      good
      enough
      for
      me).
      DieselGeek
      is
      the
      only
      one
      using
      a
      metal
      impeller
      water
      pump,
      but
      I'm
      not
      exactly
      sure
      it's
      necessary
      (I
      *think*
      the
      OEM
      pump
      is
      a
      composite
      impeller
      also).
      The
      belt
      in
      the
      Contitech
      kit
      I
      bought
      carries
      a
      120K
      mile
      guarantee
      (though
      I
      expect
      some
      company
      push
      back
      because
      I
      am
      not
      a
      shop,
      just
      a
      former
      tech,
      and
      they'll
      try
      to
      nullify
      the
      guarantee)
      also.
      Point
      is,
      while
      there
      are
      some
      respected
      vendors
      out
      there
      for
      these
      TDI
      parts,
      IDParts
      at
      the
      top
      of
      the
      list
      (their
      service
      kits
      are
      worth
      their
      weight
      in
      gold,
      I'm
      waiting
      on
      two
      40K
      kits
      for
      both
      my
      cars
      to
      show
      up),
      dig
      around
      if
      you
      like
      to
      be
      cost
      effective.
      Odds
      are
      you'll
      end
      up
      with
      the
      exact
      same
      parts
      and
      save
      a
      healthy
      chunk
      in
      the
      process.

      So
      I
      split
      the
      job
      up
      over
      two
      days,
      just
      because
      I
      had
      two
      days
      off
      and
      didn't
      feel
      like
      ramming
      through
      it.
      Literally
      had
      the
      timing
      belt
      fully
      exposed
      and
      ready
      to
      be
      taken
      off
      in
      less
      than
      an
      hour.
      Last
      TDI
      timing
      belt
      job
      I
      did
      was
      on
      my
      buddies
      former
      car,
      a
      01
      Golf
      with
      the
      ALH.
      This
      job
      on
      the
      CKRA
      in
      my
      Passat
      was
      FAR
      more
      simple.
      Used
      the
      Dieselgeek
      method
      to
      replace
      the
      tensioner,
      so
      I
      didn't
      have
      to
      remove
      the
      motor
      mount.
      I
      only
      disconnected
      a
      single
      line
      on
      top,
      the
      long
      coolant
      line
      that
      goes
      to
      the
      top
      of
      the
      expansion
      tank.
      And
      really,
      I
      didn't
      even
      have
      to
      remove
      that,
      I
      could
      have
      worked
      around
      it.
      On
      the
      12-14
      Passat's,
      the
      only
      thing
      you
      REALLY
      need
      to
      remove
      and
      get
      out
      of
      the
      way
      is
      the
      bracket
      that
      sits
      directly
      above
      the
      motor
      mount.
      Two
      10mm
      Triple
      Square
      bolts
      hold
      it
      in
      place.
      Just
      free
      that
      and
      loop
      it
      around
      behind
      the
      motor
      with
      the
      lines
      still
      attached
      (remove
      the
      three
      hose
      holder
      on
      the
      top
      side
      of
      the
      bracket
      obviously).
      I
      didn't
      break
      free
      the
      cam
      or
      pump
      bolts.
      Instead,
      when
      I
      installed
      the
      timing
      belt,
      I
      started
      at
      the
      bottom
      of
      the
      cam,
      and
      went
      clockwise,
      so
      all
      the
      slack
      ended
      up
      at
      the
      tensioner
      to
      begin
      with.
      Worked
      out
      fine.
      Everything
      lined
      back
      up
      once
      I
      properly
      set
      the
      tensioner.
      Good
      timing
      for
      the
      job
      too
      (pun
      intended).
      I
      found
      my
      water
      pump
      was
      leaking.
      As
      for
      the
      parts,
      ALL
      the
      parts
      in
      the
      Continental
      Contitech
      kit
      were
      a
      match
      brand
      for
      brand
      with
      the
      OEM
      stuff
      on
      the
      car
      EXCEPT
      for
      the
      water
      pump.
      The
      $210
      kit
      from
      Rock
      Auto
      had
      everything
      I
      needed
      to
      do
      the
      job,
      and
      properly,
      while
      saving
      $80ish
      bucks
      from
      one
      of
      the
      Diesel
      vendors
      kits.
      I
      genuinely
      think
      I
      could
      do
      this
      job
      in
      3
      hours,
      4
      worst
      case,
      should
      I
      do
      another.

      The
      2001+
      cars
      have
      a
      couple
      of
      major
      plusses
      over
      a
      2000
      and
      earlier.
      That
      being
      the
      EBCM/ABS
      Pump
      and
      the
      SWPS
      (Steering
      Wheel
      Position
      Sensor)
      are
      no
      longer
      made
      or
      available
      on
      the
      aftermarket
      for
      the
      early
      97-00
      cars.
      The
      early
      cars
      CAN
      be
      retrofitted
      with
      the
      later
      model
      stuff,
      but
      it's
      a
      good
      amount
      of
      work.
      Also,
      the
      01+
      cars
      got
      a
      slight
      hp
      and
      tq

      along
      with
      the

      For
      your
      driving......the
      TDI
      may
      not
      be
      the
      best
      choice.
      You're
      going
      to
      spend
      a
      premium
      in
      terms
      of
      cost,
      fuel
      cost,
      and
      if
      you
      don't
      DIY
      things,
      maintenance
      cost.
      Your
      12
      mile
      commute
      is
      NOT
      going
      to
      help
      you
      realize
      the
      advantages
      of
      owning
      a
      TDI.
      They
      NEED
      solid
      highway
      trips
      to
      really
      see
      the
      advantage
      over
      a
      gasser.
      I
      made
      the
      same
      mistake
      with
      my
      wife's
      car
      last
      year,
      we
      bought
      her
      a
      2015
      Sportwagen
      TDI.
      All
      she
      does
      it
      putter
      around
      town
      most
      of
      the
      time
      with
      a
      random
      road
      trip
      we
      take
      thrown
      in.
      So
      on
      a
      normal
      tank
      she'll
      only
      see
      about
      350-400
      miles
      out
      of
      the
      tank,
      usually
      averaging
      32-34
      MPG.
      For
      comparison
      sake,
      my
      2012
      Passat
      sees
      a
      25
      mile
      90%
      highway
      commute
      each
      way,
      and
      I
      average
      around
      44mpg
      normally.
      Both
      cars
      I
      can
      stretch
      to
      50
      or
      more
      MPG
      on
      a
      LONG
      road
      trip
      (Passat
      best
      was
      49.9
      and
      the
      Sportwagen
      I've
      gotten
      54
      out
      of
      for
      it's
      best).
      Point
      is,
      with
      your
      short
      commute,
      the
      added
      TDI
      cost
      may
      not
      be
      offset
      by
      any
      fueling
      advantage.
      You
      very
      well
      may
      end
      up
      on
      par
      with
      gasser
      car
      economy.
      As
      far
      as
      reliability..........do
      your
      maintenance
      on
      a
      TDI
      and
      you'll
      find
      them
      to
      be
      super
      reliable.
      I've
      owned
      my
      Passat
      for
      3
      years
      and
      50K
      miles
      now
      and
      I've
      had
      one
      breakdown
      that
      was
      a
      total
      random
      freak
      thing
      (fuel
      line
      separated)
      and
      a
      couple
      of
      minor
      issues
      all
      covered
      under
      warranty.
      We
      have
      owned
      the
      15
      Sportwagen
      for
      nearly
      a
      year
      and
      haven't
      had
      a
      single
      issue
      yet.
      They're
      well
      built,
      solid,
      reliable
      cars.
      But
      like
      any
      car,
      they
      can
      have
      problems.
      People
      throwing
      the
      "unreliable"
      tag
      out
      are
      simply
      overreacting.

      About
      $150
      or
      so
      cheaper,
      BUT........parts
      being
      used
      are
      big
      box
      store
      parts
      and
      the
      belt
      specifically
      may
      not
      carry
      the
      same
      change
      interval.
      I
      went
      through
      this
      back
      when
      I
      was
      debating
      paying
      for
      mine
      to
      get
      done
      or
      not.
      Dealership
      uses
      all
      VW
      stuff
      (mine
      does
      at
      least).
      Indy
      shop
      uses
      whatever
      they
      can
      get
      locally
      for
      the
      best
      deal
      so
      they
      can
      mark
      it
      up
      and
      make
      the
      most
      off
      of
      it.
      So
      I
      called
      the
      big
      box
      stores,
      and
      NONE
      of
      them,
      even
      the
      ....
      Know
      How
      logo
      guys,
      could
      give
      me
      a
      firm
      answer
      on
      what
      their
      timing
      belt
      change
      interval
      was.
      So
      I
      said
      nope,
      bought
      a
      contitech
      kit
      for
      $210
      (it's
      all
      the
      same
      manufacturer
      as
      OEM
      except
      the
      water
      pump),
      and
      went
      to
      town.

      The
      HH
      on
      the
      tail
      and
      decor
      of
      the
      hangar
      tell
      me
      this
      is
      Joint
      Base
      Pearl
      Harbor-Hickam.
      That
      hangar
      has
      probably
      been
      there
      since
      well
      before
      the
      attack
      in
      1941
      and
      was
      likely
      given
      a
      historical
      status.
      As
      such,
      it
      can't
      be
      torn
      down
      in
      order
      to
      have
      a
      properly
      sized
      hangar
      built
      for
      the
      C-17,
      hence
      the
      door
      modification.
      *Edit*
      Ok,
      some
      people
      are
      giving
      me
      flak
      because
      correct
      info
      was
      posted
      below
      and
      I
      was
      wrong
      with
      what
      I
      said.
      Apparently
      reading
      further
      and
      researching
      something
      for
      yourself
      isn't
      a
      task
      taken
      lightly
      and
      using
      the
      terms
      "likely"
      and
      "probably"
      are
      now
      considered
      to
      be
      coming
      across
      as
      hard
      fact
      just
      as
      posting
      them
      to
      Reddit
      makes
      them
      hard
      fact.
      Get
      over
      yourselves,
      lol.
      I'm
      not
      spreading
      misinformation
      or
      anything.
      I
      made
      an
      assumption
      based
      off
      of
      having
      been
      to
      Hickam
      numerous
      times
      and
      what
      I
      know
      about
      the
      base.
      It
      was
      wrong
      and
      correct
      information
      was
      presented
      below
      which
      I
      acknowledged.
      A
      VERY
      quick
      google
      search
      shows
      that
      I
      was
      wrong,
      and
      C-17
      Fuel
      Cell
      Hangar
      19
      in
      fact
      was
      opened
      on
      April
      14,
      2009.
      So
      by
      demanding
      I
      update
      this
      you're
      taking
      a
      valuable
      contribution
      by
      another
      person
      and
      relegating
      it
      insignificance
      because
      now
      people
      don't
      have
      to
      look
      further
      to
      see
      any
      more
      info.
      Round
      of
      applause
      folks.
      My
      condolences
      to
      tenacious_mucus
      post.
      I
      found
      it
      valuable
      and
      acknowledged
      it
      as
      such.

      Ok,
      I
      wasn't
      sure.
      I've
      been
      through
      PHIK
      many
      many
      times
      and
      saw
      a
      lot
      of
      buildings
      that
      were
      historical,
      had
      bullet
      and
      shrapnel
      holes
      still,
      etc.
      Wasn't
      positive
      this
      was
      one
      of
      them,
      but
      took
      a
      stab
      at
      it.
      Never
      spent
      enough
      time
      there
      to
      REALLY
      learn
      the
      ins
      and
      outs
      of
      the
      base,
      was
      always
      transient
      aircrew.

      Wasn't
      saying
      that
      this
      was
      the
      only
      base
      like
      this.
      I've
      seen
      these
      same
      setups
      at
      McGuire,
      Travis,
      Charleston,
      Dover,
      McChord,
      etc.
      I
      was
      just
      pointing
      out
      the
      possibility
      that
      this
      one
      may
      have
      been
      modified
      due
      to
      the
      nature
      of
      the
      hangar/base,
      to
      which
      I
      was
      corrected
      above.

      Basic
      bolt
      on
      upgrades
      will
      get
      you
      to
      the
      290-300
      RWHP
      range.
      Cold

      Round

      put

      all
      together.
      After

      grind
      like
      the

      If

      a

      Your

      As
      big
      of
      an
      LTx
      fan
      as
      I
      am,
      it's
      a
      dated
      limited
      platform
      with
      a
      couple
      of
      nefarious
      design
      issues
      (optispark
      amiright?).
      If
      you
      drop
      $10K
      into
      a
      massive
      top
      shelf
      stroked
      aftermarket
      headed
      motor
      build,
      you're
      still
      only
      going
      to
      end
      up
      in
      the
      500
      RWHP
      range.
      Not
      saying
      it's
      a
      bad
      platform,
      but
      keep
      your
      expectations
      tempered.

      This
      guy
      has
      been
      in
      my
      life
      longer
      than
      anything
      else
      at
      this
      point.
      Got
      him
      (and
      his
      brother
      who
      passed
      Jan
      2016)
      as
      kittens
      back
      in
      July
      of
      2001.
      He
      had
      slowly
      been
      losing
      weight
      over
      the
      past
      few
      months
      but
      showed
      zero
      signs
      of
      anything
      going
      on.
      Started
      acting
      a
      little
      off
      a
      couple
      of
      days
      ago,
      then
      today
      I'm
      in
      my
      closet
      getting
      changed
      for
      work
      and
      I
      hear
      what
      sounds
      like
      a
      creaky
      hinge
      being
      moved
      back
      and
      forth.
      It
      was
      my
      buddy
      and
      he
      was
      working
      to
      breathe,
      lethargic,
      and
      obviously
      in
      pain
      all
      of
      a
      sudden.
      Called
      work,
      ran
      off
      to
      the
      vet,
      x-ray
      showed
      a
      healthy
      heart
      and
      lungs.
      But
      his
      abdomen.....he
      had
      what
      the
      vet
      diagnosed
      as
      a
      slow
      growing
      lymphatic
      tumor
      that
      finally
      got
      big
      enough
      to
      push
      on
      his
      diaphram
      and
      make
      him
      have
      to
      work
      to
      breath
      right.
      He
      was
      pale,
      bad
      circulation,
      and
      his
      temp
      was
      way
      down,
      and
      he
      was
      probably
      tired
      because
      he
      probably
      wasn't
      able
      to
      sleep
      given
      the
      breathing
      effort.
      There
      was
      really
      no
      choice,
      and
      I
      wasn't
      going
      to
      pump
      him
      with
      drugs
      in
      order
      to
      put
      off
      a
      more
      painful
      slow
      passing.
      So
      I
      gave
      him
      all
      the
      love
      I
      could
      those
      final
      fleeting
      minutes,
      told
      the
      vet
      give
      us
      a
      while.
      He
      managed
      to
      drift
      into
      a
      catnap
      as
      I
      held
      his
      head
      up
      for
      a
      few
      minutes,
      and
      I
      just
      sat
      there
      bawling
      and
      appreciating
      the
      time
      we
      had
      together.
      I
      held
      his
      head
      in
      my
      hands
      and
      my
      forehead
      to
      his
      as
      he
      passed.
      I
      hope
      he
      was
      telling
      me
      the
      same,
      as
      he
      was
      purring
      all
      the
      way
      through.
      He
      had
      a
      good
      long
      life
      and
      I'm
      just
      happy
      he
      let
      me
      be
      part
      of
      it.

      So
      do
      you
      have
      to
      run
      the
      Verizon
      ROM
      or
      can
      you
      just
      run
      plain
      old
      Android
      os?
      I'd
      prefer
      NOT
      to
      have
      to
      load
      Verizon's
      crap
      on
      my
      phone,
      as
      I
      never
      use
      that
      junk
      anyway
      (visual
      voicemail,
      I'm
      staring
      daggers
      at
      you).

      Jerry
      is
      on
      the
      left,
      Ben
      is
      on
      the
      right.
      They
      were
      brothers,
      born
      in
      April
      of
      2001
      and
      adopted
      by
      me
      in
      early
      July
      of
      the
      same
      year.
      Ben
      passed
      away
      on
      Jan
      11,
      2016
      from
      renal
      failure.
      Jerry
      passed
      away
      two
      days
      ago,
      Oct
      10,
      2018,
      from
      a
      lymphatic
      tumor.
      I
      adopted
      them
      when
      I
      was
      single
      back
      in
      01.
      Didn't
      meet
      my
      now
      wife
      until
      about
      9
      months
      later.
      These
      two
      and
      I
      had
      a
      special
      bond.
      I
      was
      their
      human,
      they
      were
      my
      boys.
      I've
      had
      pets
      all
      my
      life
      and
      have
      NEVER
      experienced
      a
      bond
      with
      one
      like
      I
      did
      with
      these
      two.
      And
      unfortunately,
      I
      don't
      think
      I'll
      get
      to
      experience
      that
      again
      given
      any
      pets
      now
      have
      a
      house
      full
      of
      humans
      to
      enjoy.
      Perhaps
      it's
      for
      the
      best,
      as
      I'd
      rather
      keep
      the
      special
      connection
      I
      had
      to
      just
      them.
      Ben
      was
      Mr
      Inquisitive,
      and
      never
      met
      a
      person
      he
      didn't
      like.
      Always
      had
      to
      perch
      on
      the
      highest
      point
      he
      could
      get
      to.
      Always
      a
      talker
      if
      you
      talked
      to
      him,
      and
      he
      loved
      to
      yowl
      the
      night
      away.
      Best
      temperament
      I've
      ever
      seen
      in
      a
      cat
      too.
      I
      only
      ever
      saw
      him
      hiss
      once
      in
      his
      entire
      life.
      He
      was
      all
      about
      love.
      I
      could
      tell
      him
      come
      give
      me
      a
      kiss
      and
      he'd
      walk
      up
      and
      give
      me
      a
      head
      bonk
      on
      the
      face.
      Jerry
      was
      my
      big
      boy.
      He
      was
      a
      big
      time
      talker,
      loved
      being
      held,
      loved
      sleeping
      at
      my
      side.
      I
      already
      dearly
      miss
      waking
      up
      and
      feeling
      his
      weight
      leaning
      up
      against
      me.
      He
      wasn't
      much
      of
      a
      people
      person,
      but
      if
      he
      liked
      you,
      he
      let
      you
      know
      it.
      He
      adored
      getting
      his
      shoulders
      scratched,
      along
      with
      the
      typical
      head
      rubs.
      These
      guys
      were
      something
      else.
      Up
      until
      now,
      they
      have
      been
      the
      one
      thing
      that's
      constantly
      been
      in
      my
      life,
      longer
      than
      anything
      else.
      I
      miss
      them
      both
      so
      much.
      Thanks
      for
      listening.
      I
      needed
      to
      get
      this
      out
      somewhere.

      Man,

      So
      did
      you
      suspect
      something
      initially
      or
      after
      the
      fact.
      How
      did
      you
      feel
      about
      him
      when
      he
      was
      born?
      Did
      those
      feeling
      change
      after
      you
      found
      out
      the
      truth?
      Is
      his
      biological
      father
      in
      his
      life?
      I
      get
      what
      drove
      you
      to
      your
      decision,
      completely.
      But
      if
      it's
      eating
      at
      you
      that
      shows
      you
      care
      about
      him.
      Don't
      let
      the
      blood
      relation
      technicality
      stop
      you
      from
      doing
      what
      you
      feel
      is
      right,
      especially
      if
      you
      are
      the
      only
      one
      in
      the
      picture
      for
      him.

      If
      you're
      6'3"
      and
      worried
      about
      space,
      don't
      discount
      looking
      at
      the
      Passat.
      I'm
      the
      same
      height,
      and
      as
      much
      as
      I
      love
      my
      wife's
      Sportwagen,
      I
      couldn't
      see
      driving
      it
      full
      time
      because
      my
      Passat
      is
      so
      spacious
      and
      comfy.
      I
      have
      a
      mostly
      highway
      25
      mile
      commute
      and
      regularly
      get
      about
      44
      MPG
      with
      my
      12
      Passat
      (the
      beginning
      and
      ends
      are
      stop
      and
      go
      which
      hurts
      my
      economy).
      It's
      a
      good
      option
      compared
      to
      the
      Touareg.

      that
      he
      was

      tried

      school.
      One
      day
      I
      got
      home
      and
      decided
      to
      eat
      an
      orange.
      Peeled
      it,
      separated
      it,
      put
      it
      on
      a
      plate,
      and
      went
      to
      the
      living
      room.
      Laid
      down
      on
      the
      floor
      in
      front
      of
      the
      TV
      and
      started
      eating
      said
      orange.
      About
      halfway
      through,
      I
      have
      no
      idea
      how
      it
      happened,
      but
      suddenly
      I
      could
      feel
      this
      chewed
      up
      piece
      of
      orange
      dangling
      in
      two
      places.
      One
      side
      in
      my
      esophagus,
      the
      other
      in
      my
      windpipe.
      Every
      bit
      of
      air
      that
      was
      escaping
      I
      couldn't
      get
      back.
      I
      started
      to
      freak,
      then
      as
      best
      I
      could,
      internalized
      to
      calm
      down,
      build
      up
      from
      my
      core,
      and
      exhale
      all
      at
      once.
      Coughed
      it
      right
      up.
      To
      this
      day
      that
      still
      freaks
      me
      out.
      I
      was
      10
      or
      11
      at
      the
      time.

      Had
      a
      three
      day
      weekend.
      My
      kids
      and
      I
      all
      play
      fortnite,
      and
      Friday
      night
      we
      played
      for
      a
      LONG
      time.
      Saturday
      morning
      I
      fire
      up
      the
      65B7A
      and
      the
      Xbox,
      and
      on
      the
      green
      screen
      I
      noticed
      a
      disturbing
      dark
      bar........right
      where
      the
      bright
      green
      health
      bar
      sits.
      I
      had
      never
      seen
      it
      before
      after
      long
      sessions
      and
      was
      ready
      to
      freak
      out.
      Ran
      pixel
      refresher
      twice
      in
      a
      row,
      and
      it
      helped
      a
      LOT.
      Did
      normal
      activity
      yesterday,
      ran
      again
      last
      night
      after
      everyone
      was
      headed
      to
      bed.
      Fired
      everything
      up
      this
      morning
      and
      it's
      barely
      noticeable
      at
      all,
      and
      only
      on
      the
      green
      Xbox
      screen.
      Haven't
      picked
      it
      out
      of
      anything
      else
      yet
      (football
      Sunday
      and
      if
      it
      was
      there
      I'd
      notice).
      What
      concerns
      me
      is
      the
      sudden
      and
      very
      obvious
      retention
      from
      that
      bar.
      I've
      swapped
      the
      picture
      setting
      to
      game
      to
      subdue
      the
      color
      and
      mitigate
      any
      further
      issues,
      but
      I
      really
      wish
      these
      game
      makers
      would
      make
      some
      of
      these
      static
      info
      bars
      with
      user
      adjustable
      opacity.

      Didn't
      mean
      any
      knock
      on
      you
      man.
      I
      posted
      that
      having
      spent
      a
      few
      years
      as
      an
      auto
      tech.
      Will
      it
      run
      and
      drive?
      Almost
      certainly.
      Will
      it
      burn
      oil?
      There's
      a
      very
      high
      probability
      of
      it
      if
      you're
      able
      to
      feel
      the
      pitting.
      I
      say
      that
      having
      (at
      customer
      request)
      put
      a
      similar
      conditioned
      motor
      into
      a
      customers
      car
      because
      it's
      all
      he
      could
      afford.
      Burning
      oil
      ensued.
      It's
      not
      optimal,
      but
      if
      that's
      what
      you
      have
      to
      work
      with,
      then
      that's
      what
      you
      have
      to
      work
      with.
      Most
      of
      us
      have
      been
      there
      at
      some
      point
      and
      you
      just
      deal
      as
      best
      you
      can.
      For
      what
      it's
      worth,
      you
      did
      a
      pretty
      good
      job
      of
      cleaning
      that
      all
      up.

      it's

      This

      very
      noticeable.

      Yep,
      right
      next
      door
      to
      great
      clips.
      Not
      just
      sushi,
      they
      have
      other
      stuff
      but
      their
      sushi
      rolls
      are
      kind
      of
      the
      focus.
      It's
      not
      an
      expansive
      menu
      but
      it's
      all
      really
      solid
      stuff.

      Hey,
      I'm
      going
      to
      chime
      in
      also.
      I
      have
      a
      six
      month
      old
      OLED
      (LG
      65B7A)
      that
      is
      experiencing
      burn
      in
      from
      the
      Fortnite
      Health
      Bar
      myself
      now,
      and
      I'm
      less
      than
      happy
      about
      it.
      Being
      our
      main
      TV
      it
      sees
      a
      lot
      of
      action,
      anywhere
      from
      one
      to
      four
      hours
      a
      day
      depending
      on
      whether
      my
      kids
      play
      or
      if
      I'm
      working
      or
      not.
      The
      fact
      that
      I
      have
      to
      remember
      to
      run
      a
      pixel
      refresh
      every
      day
      and
      critically
      watch
      how
      much
      time
      we
      are
      playing
      anymore
      is
      souring
      me
      to
      the
      game,
      much
      to
      the
      frustration
      of
      my
      kids
      who
      love
      playing
      too.
      Epic,
      for
      as
      great
      as
      your
      game
      is,
      the
      fact
      that
      it's
      damaging
      to
      some
      very
      expensive
      hardware
      is
      all
      you
      need
      to
      know.
      Give
      us
      a
      user
      adjustable
      opacity
      setting
      on
      the
      on
      screen

      So
      we
      have
      four
      XBox
      One
      controllers.
      One
      original
      without
      a
      3.5mm
      jack,
      one
      original
      with
      a
      3.5mm
      jack,
      and
      two
      white
      S
      controllers.
      ALL
      controllers
      are
      synced
      with
      the
      "family"
      Xbox
      in
      our
      living
      room
      which
      my
      kids
      use.
      My
      oldest
      was
      given
      a
      Turtle
      Beach
      Recon
      headset
      for
      his
      birthday
      by
      a
      friend.
      It
      worked
      fine.....for
      a
      time.......and
      by
      "a
      time"
      I
      mean
      a
      day....literally.
      He
      got
      a
      couple
      hours
      in,
      left,
      came
      back,
      and
      nothing.
      He
      was
      frustrated
      but
      got
      along
      without.
      He
      predominantly
      uses
      the
      white
      S
      controllers.
      Today
      I
      started
      looking
      into
      it.
      I
      figured
      it
      must
      have
      been
      in
      security
      settings
      or
      something,
      but
      everything
      is
      fine
      there.
      Here's
      what
      I
      found.
      The
      headset
      works
      FINE
      with
      the
      original
      remote
      (black
      one)
      with
      the
      3.5mm
      jack.
      It
      does
      NOT
      work
      AT
      ALL
      with
      either
      of
      the
      white
      S
      remotes.
      I
      disassembled
      one
      of
      the
      white
      S
      remotes
      and
      reseated
      the
      3.5mm
      jack,
      and
      still
      nothing.
      I
      tried
      other
      headsets
      (we
      have
      a
      couple
      of
      the
      XBox
      Chat
      headsets
      then
      I
      have
      some
      headphones
      with
      internal
      mic's
      also).
      Same
      situation.
      I've
      tried
      changing
      every
      setting
      I
      could
      find,
      tried
      updating
      the
      S
      controller
      firmware
      (no
      dice,
      says
      up
      to
      date),
      hard
      reset
      on
      the
      XBox,
      etc.
      Any
      ideas?
      I'm
      perplexed
      because
      the
      S
      controllers
      are
      under
      a
      year
      old
      and
      the
      original
      controller
      has
      been
      in
      use
      since
      the
      end
      of
      2015
      and
      has
      seen
      a
      ton
      of
      headset
      time.

      Yep.
      Tried
      both
      of
      them
      about
      10
      times
      each
      with
      no
      change
      in
      results.
      Did
      it
      both
      ways,
      headset
      connected,
      headset
      disconnected.
      The
      Xbox
      doesn't
      even
      pick
      up
      that
      a
      headset
      is
      connected
      with
      the
      S
      controllers.
      If
      I
      plug
      in
      with
      the
      original
      controller,
      the
      mute
      icon
      goes
      away
      and
      the
      headset
      icon
      appears.
      With
      the
      S
      controllers
      the
      mute
      icon
      stays.

      Just
      two,
      the
      newest
      ones
      that
      have
      only
      been
      in
      service
      since
      Christmas
      and
      only
      saw
      the
      headphone
      use
      the
      one
      day
      my
      son
      used
      them
      this
      summer.
      I
      bought
      the
      two
      remote
      One
      S
      Xbox
      setup
      at
      Costco
      last
      holiday
      season,
      so
      hopefully
      I
      can
      find
      my
      remote
      since
      Costco
      is
      good
      about
      exchanging
      stuff
      and
      warranties.

      I'll
      start.
      2007
      was
      selling
      a
      nice
      townhouse
      in
      southern
      NJ.
      End
      unit,
      1800
      SF,
      full
      basement,
      good
      area.
      Place
      was
      move
      in
      ready.
      Buyer
      was
      asking
      for
      a
      $1500
      concession
      for
      a
      slightly
      wobbling
      ceiling
      fan.
      Politely
      told
      them
      to
      pound
      sand.
      They
      bought
      the
      house
      anyway.

      I
      had
      to
      fill
      up
      my
      Passat
      today
      and
      my
      normal
      cheapest
      place
      in
      town
      that
      I
      hit
      was
      LITERALLY
      $1.00
      more
      than
      regular....actually
      a
      little
      more.
      It
      was
      2.27
      for
      regular
      and
      3.31
      for
      diesel.
      I've
      noticed
      gas
      prices
      on
      the
      decline
      the
      past
      couple
      of
      weeks
      but
      of
      all
      things
      a
      slight
      bump
      in
      diesel
      prices.
      What
      gives?
      Anyone
      else
      taking
      notice
      of
      this?

      Keystone
      Lake
      near
      Tulsa,
      OK.
      This
      was
      in
      the
      late
      1980's.
      Bouyed
      off
      swimming
      area
      in
      a
      cove.
      I
      was
      about
      10-11
      at
      the
      time.
      Waded
      out
      until
      I
      could
      BARELY
      touch
      the
      bottom.
      Then
      couldn't.
      Thought
      I'd
      shoot
      for
      the
      other
      side.
      Less
      than
      halfway
      there
      realized
      I
      was
      in
      trouble.
      Trying
      to
      keep
      my
      head
      up,
      gulping
      water
      with
      air.
      Swim
      underwater,
      then
      try
      to
      paddle
      with
      my
      head
      up.
      I
      started
      freaking
      out
      mentally
      and
      there
      was
      no
      one
      close.
      At
      the
      point
      when
      I
      started
      to
      give
      up
      and
      realize
      the
      morbidity
      of
      my
      mistake,
      my
      foot
      grazed
      the
      bottom.
      I
      walked
      a
      LONG
      way
      around
      to
      the
      side
      I
      came
      from.
      Get
      back
      and
      all
      my
      dad
      said
      was
      "decided
      to
      walk
      back
      huh?
      You
      looked
      like
      you
      were
      in
      trouble
      out
      there.".
      Thanks
      Pop.
      I've
      held
      a
      disdain
      for
      my
      father
      and
      a
      fear
      of
      drowning
      ever
      since.

      9/11.
      I
      was
      in
      the
      Air
      Force
      for
      just
      over
      4
      years,
      and
      was
      walking
      into
      my
      unit
      to
      check
      in
      (was
      on
      temporary
      assignment
      to
      a
      support
      unit
      at
      the
      time).
      Saw
      the
      news
      as
      it
      was
      happening
      as
      I
      came
      in
      between
      each
      tower
      getting
      hit.
      Knew
      at
      that
      moment
      life
      just
      took
      a
      big
      change.

      to
      blaming
      something,
      to

      Decided
      to
      make
      an
      adult
      decision
      (at
      40)
      and
      moved
      from
      a
      Union/Wage
      job
      to
      a
      Salary/Management
      position
      withing
      my
      plant/company.
      Took
      a
      small
      step
      backwards
      salary
      wise
      (before
      factoring
      in
      heavy
      Overtime
      I
      was
      working
      but
      NOT
      dependent
      on),
      but
      gave
      myself
      a
      much
      needed
      opening
      in
      career
      overhead
      given
      I
      was
      topped
      out
      and
      going
      no
      further
      on
      the
      wage
      side.
      Why?
      I
      realized
      I
      am
      working
      so
      much
      (hard
      time
      saying
      no
      to
      overtime
      when
      a
      shit
      was
      worth
      nearly
      $750)
      I
      was
      missing
      entirely
      too
      much
      family
      time,
      my
      kids
      growing
      up,
      and
      just
      enjoying
      life
      in
      general.

      I'm
      so
      sorry
      to
      hear
      this.
      It's
      one
      of
      my
      greatest
      fears
      in
      terms
      of
      materialistic
      crap.
      I
      have
      two
      boys
      who
      are
      rather
      rowdy
      and
      I
      am
      CONSTANTLY
      getting
      on
      them
      about
      being
      rowdy
      in
      the
      room
      with
      my
      65B7.
      Fortunately
      it's
      wall
      mounted
      above
      the
      fireplace
      but
      still.
      Hopefully
      you
      find
      a
      solution
      that
      lets
      you
      either
      get
      it
      replaced
      or
      recoup
      some
      cost.
      Homeowners
      or
      renters
      insurance
      an
      option?

      Could

      and

      seen
      that
      from
      a
      bit
      farther
      back

      rain
      down
      afterwards.

      Ok,
      to
      clarify......look
      closely
      at
      the
      picture.
      It's
      two
      live
      edge
      cuts
      and
      a
      few
      boards
      all
      glued
      together.
      It's
      not
      a
      natural
      cut
      slab......it
      would
      be
      an
      incredible
      piece
      to
      work
      with
      if
      it
      was.
      But
      this
      is
      a
      cobbled
      together
      bunch
      of
      pieces
      made
      to
      look
      like
      a
      slab.

      Seems
      like
      the

      is
      what
      hand
      you
      write

      I

      in
      that
      case.
      But

      just.......weird.
      Not

      I

      After
      seeing
      the
      Carson
      Wentz
      news
      today
      (broken
      bone
      in
      back,
      apparently
      out
      the
      rest
      of
      the
      season),
      I
      want
      nothing
      more
      than
      to
      have
      a
      pic
      or
      a
      meme
      with
      Romo's
      head
      on
      Wentz's
      body
      in
      uniform
      so
      I
      can
      shove
      it
      at
      all
      my
      Eagles
      fan
      buddies
      after
      all
      the
      crap
      they
      blew
      towards
      me
      as
      a
      Cowboys
      fan
      for
      years.
      Anyone
      else
      feel
      that
      way?
      *Edit*
      Ok,
      I'll
      clarify
      some
      things.
      I'm
      not
      rooting
      for
      an
      injury
      and
      I'm
      not
      belittling
      Wentz
      (he's
      a
      hell
      of
      a
      QB,
      personally
      I'd
      prefer
      to
      have
      him
      over
      Dak
      but
      I'd
      FAR
      rather
      see
      Romo
      behind
      center
      still)
      nor
      do
      I
      harbor
      any
      ill
      will
      for
      the
      guy.
      I
      lived
      outside
      Philly
      for
      a
      few
      years
      and
      a
      few
      of
      my
      good
      friends
      are
      DIE
      HARD
      Philly
      fans.
      For
      years
      I
      got
      beat
      up
      about
      Romo
      being
      hurt
      as
      much
      as
      he
      was.
      It
      was
      all
      good
      natured,
      no
      one
      was
      rooting
      for
      someone
      to
      get
      hurt
      or
      anything,
      but
      if/when
      it
      happened,
      here
      came
      the
      trolling.
      Saying
      what
      I
      said
      above
      was
      not
      meant
      in
      any
      mean
      way
      at
      all,
      but
      would
      be
      the
      same
      firing
      back
      that
      I
      took
      from
      my
      friends.
      That's
      all.
      It's
      a
      good
      natured
      rivalry
      we
      have.
      We
      all
      get
      that
      no
      one
      wants
      to
      see
      anyone
      get
      hurt,
      have
      a
      career
      ruined,
      etc.

      2.5
      gallon
      jug
      of
      DEF
      is
      about
      $7.50

      Thanks
      so
      much
      for
      the
      heads
      up.
      I
      just
      need
      to
      move
      about
      2K
      points
      to
      each
      of
      my
      kids
      accounts
      then
      they'll
      both
      be
      on
      their
      own
      XBLG
      accounts
      and
      we
      can
      all
      play
      a
      game
      at
      once
      finally.

      That
      looks
      like
      a
      REALLY
      nicely
      done
      restomod.
      Quick
      glance
      I
      wanted
      to
      say
      it's
      one
      of
      those
      C2
      kits
      on
      a
      C5
      chassis,
      but
      the
      body
      proportions
      are
      too
      good.
      I
      think
      it's
      just
      a
      really
      cleanly
      done
      restomod.

      Ok,
      I
      gotcha
      now.
      At
      least
      you
      still
      have
      your
      car.
      I
      parted
      my
      car
      out
      (purple
      pearl
      93
      T/A,
      PT76GTS
      setup)
      to
      pay
      off
      my
      Vette
      shortly
      after
      buying
      it
      back
      from
      the
      guy
      I
      sold
      it
      to
      back
      in
      2010.
      There's
      days
      when
      I
      miss
      the
      rawness
      of
      an
      F-Body.
      You
      should
      swing
      back
      by
      LTx
      sometime.
      It's
      much
      slower
      now
      but
      a
      pretty
      tight
      knit
      group.

      Wow,
      something
      I
      can
      partake
      in.
      I
      have
      a
      2004
      Model
      4th
      Generation
      iPod
      with
      color
      screen.
      The
      hard
      drive
      died
      about
      3-4
      years
      ago
      so
      I
      modded
      it
      with
      a
      couple
      of
      adapters
      and
      an
      SD
      card.
      Along
      with
      it
      I
      use
      a
      first
      generation
      Bose
      Sounddock
      from
      2005.
      Those
      perform
      phenomenally
      well
      and
      keep
      my
      ears
      happy.
      Maybe
      not
      as
      old
      as
      some
      things,
      but
      some
      of
      the
      best
      modern
      tech
      IMO.

      Awesome.

      it's
      not
      just
      a
      G4
      issue
      either.
      I'm
      trying

      keep
      my
      G4
      as
      long
      as
      possible
      but
      maps
      being
      broken
      would
      have
      driven
      me
      to
      a
      new
      device
      real
      quick.

      With
      that
      kind
      of
      a
      commute
      driving
      solo
      a
      2015
      TDi
      Sportwagen
      would
      come
      close
      to
      tripling
      your
      fuel
      economy
      (we
      get
      49
      highway
      with
      two
      adults,
      two
      kids,
      two
      dogs,
      and
      luggage).
      A
      2009-2014
      would
      give
      you
      slightly
      less
      but
      still
      mud
      to
      upper
      40's.
      Not
      to
      mention
      once
      you
      move
      your
      resale
      value
      would
      be
      much
      better
      in
      terms
      of
      losses
      if
      you
      decide
      to
      move
      on.
      *Edit*
      I
      will
      add
      that
      while
      it
      is
      a
      wagon,
      it's
      not
      a
      huge
      car.
      It's
      narrow,
      and
      not
      overly
      long.
      I
      have
      fit
      an
      8'
      piece
      of
      baseboard
      in,
      but
      nothing
      longer
      is
      going
      to
      fit
      as
      it
      was
      hatch
      to
      windshield.
      So
      do
      factor
      that
      into
      your
      purchase.
      They
      WILL
      tow,
      so
      you
      could
      get
      a
      small
      utility
      trailer
      and
      made
      do
      that
      way.

      Speaking
      of,
      if
      you
      want
      good
      warranty,
      a
      2015
      is
      THE

      09-14

      Those

      No
      issues
      with
      the
      manuals.
      I'd
      prefer
      to
      have
      manuals
      but
      my
      Passat
      SEL
      wasn't
      available
      equipped
      as
      such
      and
      my
      wife
      preferred
      an
      auto
      for
      her
      GSW.
      Finding
      the
      right
      car
      can
      be
      a
      task.
      You
      may
      end
      up
      travelling
      a
      few
      hours,
      but
      you'll
      know
      when
      the
      right
      car
      appears.
      Just
      keep
      searching
      and
      it'll
      show
      up.
      Now
      that
      the
      whole
      dieselgate
      thing
      is
      winding
      down,
      they're
      becoming
      more
      and
      more
      prevalent.
      With
      autotrader,
      search
      by
      fuel
      type.
      That
      always
      got
      my
      best
      results
      when
      I
      was
      looking.
      If
      I
      searched
      for
      submodel-tdi
      I
      got
      far
      less
      results.
      But
      filtering
      fuel
      type
      to
      diesel
      opened
      it
      up.

      I
      just
      had
      to
      say
      thanks
      somewhere.
      I
      have
      two
      kids
      who
      got
      original
      black
      XBox
      One's
      for
      Christmas
      this
      year
      (my
      old
      one
      and
      a
      used
      one
      we
      picked
      up).
      I
      was
      fretting
      because
      they'd
      both
      need
      fresh
      game
      installs,
      etc,
      and
      of
      course,
      I
      have
      comcast
      with
      a
      1TB
      Data
      Limit
      (and
      we
      are
      cord
      cutters
      and
      download/stream
      everything).
      But!!!!!
      While
      setting
      up
      one
      of
      the
      systems,
      I
      discovered
      the
      network
      transfer
      feature!
      What
      a
      freaking
      lifesaver!
      Faster
      than
      downloading
      and
      no
      data
      cap
      hit.
      GOOD
      THINKING

      Xbox's.
      I
      do

      rewards.
      I
      have
      an

      the

      have

      We
      are
      all
      set
      on
      XBL
      Gold.
      As
      for
      games,
      We
      had
      to
      buy
      a

      extra
      copies,
      but
      they

      forward
      they're

      we

      1

      so

      Rocket
      League

      I

      It's
      something

      occurred

      we'll

      Yeah,
      that
      would
      be
      nice,
      but
      in
      the
      money
      is
      king
      climate
      today,
      there's
      no
      way
      that
      would
      float.
      I'm
      looking
      at
      you
      Microsoft
      for
      cancelling
      the
      Family
      Live
      package
      a
      few
      years
      ago,
      lol.

      Already
      there.
      I
      usually
      have
      a
      couple
      of
      2-3
      TB
      drives
      laying

      any
      given
      point,
      when
      one
      is
      needed
      I'll
      appropriate
      as
      necessary.

      I'd
      think
      you
      can
      get
      into
      a
      15
      S
      model
      for
      the
      12-13K
      price
      range.
      When
      I
      was
      looking
      in
      the
      Fall
      of
      2017
      for
      one
      I
      was
      finding
      S
      and
      SE's
      in
      the
      14-15K
      range.
      A
      quick
      browse
      of
      AutoTrader
      and
      I
      found
      a
      BUNCH
      of
      15's
      with
      under
      30K
      miles
      for
      $12-13K.
      I'd
      advise
      for
      a
      2015
      also
      because
      if
      you
      get
      a
      low
      mileage
      one,
      the
      dieselgate
      warranty
      is
      top
      notch.
      Greater

      OR
      5
      years
      /
      60K
      miles
      from
      Phase
      1
      and
      then
      Phase
      2
      of
      fix,
      and
      Covers
      pretty
      much
      everything
      motor/emissions
      related
      (fuel
      system,
      turbo,
      OBD
      codes/repairs,
      exhaust,
      DEF
      system,
      DPF,
      etc)
      for
      that
      period.
      The
      11-14's
      don't
      get
      near
      the
      warranty.
      Plus
      the
      15's
      are
      more
      fuel
      efficient
      and
      look
      better.

      how

      do
      you
      want
      to
      keep
      it?
      Because
      it'll
      last
      you
      that
      long.

      Best

      Surprisingly
      slow.
      I
      think
      it's
      a
      write
      speed
      limitation
      on
      the
      XBox
      One
      more
      than
      anything.
      I
      would
      fluctuate
      transfer
      speeds
      from
      80
      Mb/sec
      down
      to
      about
      20
      Mb/sec.
      It
      got
      the
      job
      done
      though.
      My
      home
      network
      is
      solid,
      Netgear
      Orbi
      and
      it's
      been
      flawless.
      I
      can
      speed
      test
      any
      of
      the
      Xbox
      units
      and
      see
      180
      down
      consistently
      which
      is
      what
      my
      connection
      is
      rated
      for
      and
      I
      get
      wired
      to
      the
      main
      unit.
      I
      still
      think
      it
      got
      done
      faster
      than
      downloading
      again
      because
      those
      never
      get
      over
      about
      40.

      This
      past
      year
      I
      replaced
      my
      living
      room
      and
      bedroom
      TV's
      with
      a
      65
      and
      55
      LG
      B7A
      respectively.
      A
      tremendous
      upgrade
      from
      the
      get
      go.
      I
      run
      a
      Plex
      server
      at
      home
      and
      all
      my
      local
      movies
      are
      clean
      and
      slightly
      compressed
      1080
      Blu
      Ray
      rips.
      A
      few
      months
      back
      I
      discovered
      I
      had
      a
      4k
      friendly
      drive
      for
      my
      computer
      so
      I
      could
      start
      ripping
      4K
      but
      haven't
      due
      to
      knowing
      how
      much
      space
      it
      would
      command,
      and
      there
      was
      no
      way
      to
      compress
      the
      huge
      files
      without
      losing
      HDR
      and
      killing
      the
      visual
      properties.
      Until
      yesterday.
      I
      repurposed
      a
      3tb
      hard
      drive
      as
      an
      experiment,
      ripped
      a
      few
      4k
      movies
      and
      threw
      them
      on
      it.
      I
      needed
      to
      check
      for
      latency
      as
      this
      drive
      is
      stored
      remote
      to
      my
      plex
      server,
      and
      I
      needed
      to
      see
      if
      my
      home
      network
      (Orbi)
      would
      be
      up
      to
      the
      task
      of
      streaming
      uncompressed
      4k
      material.
      I'm
      pleased
      to
      say
      that
      both
      are
      good
      to
      go
      and
      other
      than
      needing
      to
      get
      a
      couple
      of
      larger
      drives
      (Transformers
      Last
      Knight
      was
      90gb
      for
      example)
      I'm
      more
      than
      happy
      with
      the
      result.
      Visually......it's
      just
      stunning.
      Movies
      I've
      seen
      before
      and
      like
      are
      mind
      blowingly
      different,
      so
      much
      better
      now.
      My
      mind

      Woah.
      Thanks
      for
      the
      clarification.
      I
      kind
      of
      figured
      there
      was
      some
      kind
      of
      compression
      going
      on,
      but
      didn't
      realize
      that
      uncompressed
      it
      was
      THAT
      kind
      of
      size.

      Mainly
      because
      I
      prefer
      to
      keep
      things
      digitized.
      Little
      hands
      like
      getting
      into
      things
      and
      it's
      way
      more
      convenient.
      I
      had
      just
      been
      digitizing
      the
      Blu
      Ray
      1080
      copies
      and
      living
      with
      that.

      You

      AB,
      Krygyzstan.
      Remember
      the
      movie
      Behind
      Enemy
      Lines?
      Going
      from
      the
      airfield
      to
      the
      "base"
      portion,
      it
      reminded
      me
      of
      many
      scenes
      from
      that
      movie.
      Foggy,
      bare
      trees,
      burnt
      out
      buildings
      and
      cars
      along
      the
      road......just
      had
      a
      wartorn
      feeling.
      Thankfully
      I
      was
      only
      there
      for
      crew
      rest
      then
      flew
      out
      the
      next
      day.

      I'm

      not
      that
      interested
      in
      it
      anymore.

      In

      And

      really
      need

      a
      couple
      gaskets
      and
      a
      tune
      to
      finish
      it.
      But
      I
      just
      don't

      the

      to

      rated
      for
      24/7
      operation
      and
      are
      a
      steal.
      I've
      had
      a
      single
      drive
      die.
      I
      got
      an
      email,
      went
      in
      and
      took
      it
      off
      line,
      replaced
      a
      few
      days
      later
      with
      another
      drive,
      rebuild
      took
      almost
      24
      hours,
      back
      up
      and
      fully
      running.
      The
      Hardware
      RAID
      is
      instrumental
      to
      me,
      I
      won't
      stray
      from
      it.
      Works
      like
      a
      champ.
      Runs
      24/7,
      streams
      plex
      fine
      for
      me
      (most
      of
      my
      devices
      direct
      stream
      everything,
      even
      my
      4k
      stuff),
      runs
      QBittorrent
      and
      Sonarr
      24/7
      flawlessly
      also.
      ZERO
      issues.
      I
      have
      it
      hooked
      up
      to
      a
      1080
      HDTV
      in
      my
      office
      so
      I
      can
      actually
      watch
      whatever
      while
      I'm
      working
      on
      my
      main
      PC
      doing
      other
      things.
      Current
      plan
      is
      to
      migrate
      everything
      on
      the
      above
      over
      to
      my
      main
      computer
      (I7-5820K,
      EVGA
      X99
      Micro
      2,
      32gb
      DDR4,
      512
      GB
      Samsung
      960
      Pro
      M.2,
      Fractal
      Node
      804
      case)
      with
      the
      addition
      of
      another
      H700
      and
      10TB
      drives,
      4
      to
      start
      with
      and
      add
      more
      as
      necessary.
      The
      4K
      stuff
      takes
      up
      a
      TON
      of
      space
      because
      I
      don't
      compress
      it.
      But
      I
      only
      have
      about
      8.5
      TB
      of
      movies
      and
      shows
      currently.
      I
      figure
      this
      way
      I
      can
      condense
      to
      a
      single
      computer
      as
      a
      24/7
      box
      that
      will
      do
      what
      I
      currently
      have
      two
      separate
      computers
      doing.

      As

      (Byron

      defense
      they
      went

      I
      would
      want
      verification
      that
      the
      rebuilt
      LT4
      is
      exactly
      that.
      Externally
      it's
      very
      hard
      to
      tell
      the
      difference
      between
      an
      LT1
      or
      LT4
      considering
      the
      LT4
      manifold
      fits
      the
      LT1
      with
      machining
      and
      the
      LT1
      manifold
      is
      easily
      painter
      or
      powder
      coated
      red.
      Look
      for
      the
      casting
      numbers
      on
      the
      heads
      and
      manifold
      and
      verify
      they
      are
      legit
      LT4
      parts.
      Also,
      if
      it
      is
      an
      automatic,
      it's
      not
      an
      LT4
      car.
      ONLY
      1996
      Manuals
      and
      Grand
      Sports
      got
      the
      LT4.
      *Edit*
      Just
      saw
      you
      said
      it's
      a
      six
      speed.
      No
      worries
      there
      then.

      Run
      the
      numbers.
      Right
      now
      Diesel
      fuel
      is
      running
      about
      $1
      per
      gallon
      more
      than
      regular
      fuel.
      On
      a
      58
      mile,
      let's
      say
      mostly
      highway
      commute,
      go
      conservative
      and
      say
      44-45
      MPG
      (any
      of
      the
      TDI's
      can
      easily
      get
      better
      if
      you
      keep
      it
      in
      the
      65-70
      range,
      I've
      done
      840
      miles
      and
      49.9MPG
      in
      a
      tank
      on
      my
      12
      Passat).
      See
      if
      the
      cost
      benefits
      are
      there
      for
      owning
      a
      TDI.
      That
      dollar
      spread
      currently
      is
      NOT
      worth
      it
      for
      my
      wife's
      and
      my
      cars.
      We'd
      be
      spending
      less
      running
      less
      efficient
      gassers.

      Nope.
      Just
      using
      the
      Plex
      app
      in
      the
      WebOS
      on
      my
      B7's.
      When
      you've
      got
      a
      movie
      playing
      somewhere
      via
      your
      Plex,
      if
      you
      go
      into
      Plex
      on
      a
      PC
      you'll
      see
      a
      little
      indicator
      on
      the
      upper
      right
      showing
      activity.
      Click
      that
      and
      it'll
      bring
      up
      what
      is
      being
      streamed
      and
      will
      tell
      you
      if
      it's
      direct
      streaming
      or
      transcoding.

      Absolutely
      loved

      I
      saw

      you
      were
      going
      to
      go
      very

      DISCLAIMER:
      This
      is
      purely
      for
      fun,
      I'm
      not
      looking
      for
      assistance
      or
      anything.
      Just
      thought
      I'd
      have
      some
      amusement
      with
      my
      plight......
      Check
      engine
      light
      popped
      up
      on
      my
      2012
      Passat
      this
      morning
      on
      the
      way
      to
      work.
      Symptoms?
      Other
      than
      a
      nagging
      cold
      engine
      nailing
      and
      1800RPM
      light
      throttle
      input
      hesitation/stumble,
      nothing.
      Any
      guesses?
      I'll
      update
      later
      when
      I
      get
      home
      and
      get
      VAGCOM
      hooked
      up
      to
      it.
      Here's
      the
      update
      as
      of
      1926
      EST:
      "8845

      This
      is
      NOT
      what
      set
      the
      CEL
      but
      I'm
      extremely
      happy
      it's
      showing
      up
      because
      it
      helps
      confirm
      the
      running
      issues
      I
      was
      experiencing
      when
      the
      motor
      is
      cold.
      What
      follows
      is
      what
      set
      it
      off:
      "18638

      (I'm

      that
      out)."
      Also
      had:
      "15733

      Now
      it's
      just
      a
      matter
      of
      getting
      the
      dealer
      to
      address
      the
      two
      NON-MIL
      setting
      issues
      when
      they
      take
      care
      of
      the
      NOx
      Sensor
      (that
      was
      strangely
      enough
      replaced
      about
      40K
      ago
      I
      believe).

      already
      had
      all
      the
      AdBlue

      fixes.
      I

      it's

      you
      never

      it's
      something
      injector
      related.
      I've
      been
      chasing
      a
      sticky
      when
      cold
      injector
      (at
      least
      that's
      what
      I
      think
      and
      what
      symptoms
      point
      to)
      since
      last
      winter
      and
      my
      dealership
      refuses
      to
      actually
      diagnose
      it
      saying
      "we
      can't
      really
      look
      for
      anything
      if
      there's

      Used
      to
      be
      aircrew
      in
      the
      USAF.
      We
      would
      transit
      through
      Hawaii
      a
      lot.
      Downtown
      Honolulu,
      there
      was
      a
      restaurant
      called
      the
      Shorebird
      that
      everyone
      just
      raved
      about.
      Went
      one
      time,
      and
      it
      was
      twenty
      some
      odd
      dollars
      for
      a
      freaking
      piece
      of
      chicken
      (they
      had
      steak
      and
      other
      stuff,
      higher
      priced
      obviously)
      that
      you
      got
      to
      season
      and
      grill
      yourself.
      Thoroughly
      disappointed.

      Hahahaha,
      touch
      a
      nerve
      did
      I?
      Crawl
      off
      your
      own
      high
      horse
      buddy.
      All
      I
      did
      was
      point
      out
      that
      entirely
      too
      often
      I
      see
      people
      not
      knowing
      how
      to
      spell
      lose
      properly
      and
      then
      I
      made
      a
      play
      on
      words
      with
      it.
      There's
      a
      big
      difference
      between
      a
      simple
      spelling
      error
      and
      not
      knowing
      simple
      Grammer
      and
      spelling.
      Back
      on
      your
      little
      pony
      and
      trot
      off
      now.

      like
      you're
      the

      of

      sadly.
      My

      nearly
      bought
      off
      on
      one
      of
      the
      upper
      end
      Samsung
      models
      until
      we
      started
      looking
      at
      reviews
      and
      talking
      to
      the
      service
      departments
      at
      the
      places
      we
      were
      shopping.
      Kept
      both
      Samsung
      and
      LG
      off
      our
      buy
      list.
      Ended
      up
      with
      full
      size
      Fridge/Freezer
      combo
      from
      Frigidaire
      and
      are
      very
      happy.

      Ouch,
      that's
      a
      bummer.
      It
      was
      great.
      I'm
      a

      fan
      of
      BCBS
      (2016
      has
      been
      my
      favorite
      hands

      and

      a
      slightly
      different
      taste
      due
      to

      used.
      It's

      My
      2012
      Passat
      hasn't
      been
      right
      since
      winter
      of
      2017-2018.
      When
      the
      motor
      is
      cold
      I
      get
      BAD
      nailing
      sounds,
      what
      feels
      like
      a
      dead
      cylinder
      at
      about
      1800
      RPM
      under
      light
      throttle,
      and
      I've
      seen
      reduced
      fuel
      economy
      since
      the
      first
      indications.
      NEVER
      a
      check
      engine
      light
      though.
      Took
      it
      to
      the
      dealership
      around
      this
      time
      last
      year,
      they
      kept
      the
      car
      for
      a
      couple
      of
      days,
      tech
      said
      nothing
      is
      wrong,
      can't
      duplicate,
      I
      took
      him
      out
      in
      the
      car
      and
      showed
      him
      what
      it's
      doing,
      and
      I
      got
      the
      brush
      off
      of
      "if
      there's
      no
      MIL
      we
      really
      can't
      do
      anything."
      I
      dealt
      with
      it.
      Fast
      forward
      to
      last
      week.
      My
      MIL
      finally
      pops
      on.
      I
      run
      a
      pull
      with
      VCDS
      and
      get
      the
      following:
      8845
      -
      Torque
      Difference

      Tested
      Since
      Memory
      Clear
      So
      I
      take
      the
      car
      into
      the
      dealer.
      The
      put
      a
      new
      NOx
      sensor
      in,
      cleared
      up
      the
      MIL,
      did
      a
      couple
      of
      recalls,
      and
      that's
      that.
      While
      I
      was
      dropping
      it
      off
      I
      was
      describing
      the
      driveability
      issues
      to
      the
      writer
      and
      explaining
      the
      nailing
      and
      dead
      cylinder
      feel
      to
      the
      adviser
      and
      the
      tech
      behind
      her,
      same
      guy
      as
      last
      time,
      said
      "that's
      normal
      for
      warm
      up."
      I
      explained
      to
      him
      NO,
      that's
      NOT
      normal,
      I've
      had
      the
      car
      for
      3
      1/2
      years
      and
      over
      50K
      miles
      and
      I
      only
      started
      experiencing
      it
      last
      year.
      He
      brushed
      me
      off.
      Got
      called
      today
      that
      the
      car
      is
      done.
      Spoke
      with
      the
      adviser
      again
      and
      we
      went
      over
      notes.
      When
      I
      dropped
      it
      off,
      I
      explained
      to
      not
      be
      alarmed,
      I
      do
      my
      own
      non-warranty
      service
      and
      just
      in
      November
      did
      an
      Oil
      Change,
      DSG
      Service,
      Timing
      Belt
      w/Water
      Pump,
      and
      filters
      (Fuel,
      Air,
      Cabin).
      I
      asked
      if
      the
      two
      pending
      codes
      were
      addressed.
      She
      said
      "we
      can't
      address
      those
      because
      they
      don't
      show
      up
      on
      our
      software
      and
      they're
      not
      even
      VW
      codes."
      Finding
      that
      rather
      incredulous,
      I
      pressed
      further
      but
      got
      nowhere.
      I
      asked
      did
      they
      look
      at
      anything
      other
      than
      the
      NOx
      sensor.
      She
      said
      her
      tech
      noted
      in
      the
      system
      that
      "no
      oil
      change
      sticker
      on
      dash,
      question
      type
      of
      oil
      used,
      recommend
      oil
      change
      and
      recheck
      vehicle
      for
      driveability."
      Essentially
      at
      this
      point
      I'm
      feeling
      this
      dealership
      is
      treating
      me
      like
      I'm
      clueless
      (the
      "that's
      normal
      for
      warm
      up"
      and
      snarky
      oil
      change
      note
      in
      the
      system),
      and
      isn't
      doing
      a
      single
      thing
      to
      address
      issues
      that
      I've
      brought
      up
      (that
      are
      most
      likely
      a
      failing
      injector),
      and
      using
      every
      excuse
      they
      can
      to
      get
      out
      of
      even
      attempting
      to
      actually
      troubleshoot
      an
      issue.
      I'm
      not
      sure
      which
      way
      to
      go
      from
      here.
      This
      is
      the
      ONLY
      VW
      dealership
      in
      my
      area

      than
      an
      unrelated
      Audi

      in

      where
      I'm
      not

      how
      much
      help
      I'd
      get.
      I'm
      contemplating
      a
      VWOA
      phone
      call
      but
      not
      sure
      that'll
      get
      me
      anything.

      I

      tested
      with
      the

      He

      that
      he
      doesn't

      Closest
      dealerships
      are
      about
      an
      hour
      and
      a
      half
      away.
      This
      is
      literally
      the
      only
      one
      around.
      It
      wouldn't
      be
      me
      paying
      for
      it
      unless
      it
      was
      a
      part
      not
      covered
      by
      the
      warranty
      (which
      it
      very
      likely
      is
      covered).
      Hence
      my
      feeling
      they're
      trying
      to
      just
      move
      me
      along
      so
      they
      don't
      have
      to
      deal
      with
      it.
      Picking
      up
      my
      car
      tomorrow
      morning,
      going
      to
      have
      a
      few
      words
      with
      the
      warranty
      advisor
      at
      the
      dealership.

      I
      do
      but
      the
      problem
      is
      this
      is
      very
      likely
      an
      issue
      to
      be
      covered
      by
      the

      I'm
      somewhat
      tied
      to
      the
      dealership.

      So.......being
      the
      good
      friend
      that
      I
      am,
      I
      purchased
      a
      Mitsubishi
      HC3800
      projector
      off
      my
      buddy
      who
      decided
      he
      wanted
      to
      upgrade
      to
      a
      4K
      unit
      rather
      than
      deal
      with
      aftermarket
      bulbs
      (it
      is
      saying
      it's
      near
      EOL
      on
      the
      bulb).
      So
      for
      $100,
      I
      said
      why
      not.
      I
      have
      a
      framed
      and
      insulated
      basement,
      to
      which
      I
      have
      a
      room
      that
      I
      think
      may
      work.
      It's
      11'
      wide
      by
      14.5'
      long.
      Entry
      door
      at
      the
      rear
      left,
      small
      half
      height
      opening
      at
      the
      front
      left
      for
      under
      stairs
      cubby
      where
      I
      plan
      to
      have
      A/V
      stuff
      residing,
      possibly
      installed
      in-wall
      for
      easier
      access.
      Ceilings
      are
      about
      8'
      8"
      tall
      with
      the
      rear
      of
      the
      room
      having
      an
      HVAC
      duct
      set
      lowering
      it
      to
      just
      over
      8'
      height.
      Projector
      is
      planned
      for
      installation
      either
      directly
      under
      the
      ducting,
      or
      just
      in
      front
      of
      the
      drop
      for
      it,
      throwing
      on
      the
      11'
      wide
      front
      wall.
      The
      ONLY
      other
      equipment
      I
      have
      at
      this
      point
      is
      my
      trusty
      old
      Infinity
      IL50
      tower
      speakers
      which
      will
      continue
      to
      serve
      as
      my
      front
      channel
      and
      two
      subs.
      So........I
      have
      questions,
      and
      I
      have
      thoughts.
      Is
      this
      too
      small
      of
      a
      room
      to
      try
      to
      pull
      off
      a
      7.1
      setup?
      That's
      about
      the
      max
      I'd
      want
      to
      try,
      I
      am
      not
      interested
      in
      attempting
      anything
      more
      than
      that.
      Am
      I
      wrong
      in
      thinking
      that
      the
      rear
      channels
      will
      need
      to
      be
      slightly
      behind
      the
      sitting
      position?
      If
      that's
      the
      case
      then
      I'm
      going
      to
      have
      to
      figure
      some
      kind
      of
      layout
      setup
      for
      the
      room
      also
      because
      we're
      a
      family
      of
      four
      and
      11'
      isn't
      too
      terribly
      wide.
      I'm
      obviously
      going
      to
      wire
      everything
      in-wall,
      using
      wall
      plates
      for
      quick
      connections,
      etc.
      I'm
      going
      to
      make
      a
      single
      HDMI
      run
      to
      the
      projector,
      and
      am
      going
      to
      ensure
      it's
      high
      enough
      grade
      to
      ensure
      I
      can
      upgrade
      to
      4K
      if
      I
      want
      down
      the
      road.
      I'm
      looking
      on
      layout
      suggestions,
      seating/layout
      suggestions,
      lighting
      suggestions,
      etc.
      This
      room
      is
      studded
      and
      insulated,
      and
      the
      only
      negative
      I
      really
      have
      is
      my
      fuse
      box
      is
      in
      this
      room
      also,
      and
      I'm
      worried
      about
      it
      rattling
      but
      that
      can
      be
      mitigated.
      Just
      looking
      for
      thoughts
      and
      ideas
      mainly!
      Thanks!

      affected
      by

      They're

      furloughed,
      or
      going
      to
      get
      back
      paid.
      They

      NEWS

      People
      get
      laid
      off
      all
      the
      freaking
      time
      in
      the

      sector,
      but
      you
      don't
      see
      it
      being
      used
      for
      political
      gain.
      But
      heaven
      forbid
      the
      government
      workers
      get
      affected.
      Now
      there's
      all
      kinds
      of
      programs
      being
      touted
      to
      essentially

      feed
      them
      in
      their
      tough
      times,
      nevermind
      this
      is
      a
      continual
      issue
      for
      the

      I'm

      100"
      with
      a

      near
      120".
      I
      can
      live
      with
      that.
      You
      guys
      have
      all
      sold
      me
      on
      the

      I

      rather
      impressed
      with
      how
      well
      this
      tire
      has
      held
      up
      considering
      he's
      worn
      straight
      through
      the
      second
      steel
      ply
      and
      into
      the
      inner
      /
      first
      steel
      ply
      like
      that.
      Kind
      of
      a
      wide
      splice
      on
      that
      1
      ply
      though.
      But
      still,
      really
      impressed
      this
      thing
      has
      held
      together.

      Good
      eye.
      I
      missed
      that.
      I
      nearly
      challenged
      the
      chart
      thinking
      I
      lived
      there
      and
      service
      where
      I
      am
      is
      far
      better
      than
      that.

      Did
      this
      to
      my
      buddies
      MKIV
      Golf
      a
      couple
      years
      back
      when
      we
      had
      to
      replace
      his
      heater
      core.
      Doing
      the
      blend
      door
      was
      pretty
      easy,
      considering
      we
      had
      to
      take
      the
      dash
      out
      anyway.

      I
      work
      12
      hours,
      nights
      right
      now,
      so
      my
      car
      sat
      outside
      all
      night
      in
      this
      lovely
      Indiana
      weather.
      Battery
      gave
      it
      up.
      Got
      a
      jump.
      Still
      won't
      start
      Apparently
      the
      diesel
      gelled
      up
      even
      with
      having
      added
      a
      bottle
      of
      stabilizer
      yesterday
      before
      driving
      the
      40
      minutes
      in.
      It's
      -12
      static
      out
      right
      now.....don't
      even
      want
      to
      guess
      at
      the
      wind
      chill.
      Ugh.

      Ok
      guys,
      curious,
      why
      all
      the
      recommendations
      to
      change
      the
      fuel
      filter
      asap?
      It
      literally
      has
      about
      3k
      miles
      on
      it
      from
      when
      I
      did
      my
      last
      20k
      service.
      I
      am
      positive
      the
      battery
      is
      toast.
      Brought
      my
      charger
      to
      work
      today
      and
      pulled
      the
      battery
      and
      took
      it
      into
      my
      office
      where
      it's
      not
      going
      to
      be
      in
      a
      warm
      environment
      on
      a
      2a
      trickle
      charger
      all
      night.
      BUT.....my
      charger
      is
      reporting
      it
      at
      90%
      upon
      hooking
      it
      up.
      Probably
      a
      bad
      cell.
      Literally
      14
      days
      from
      the
      end
      of
      my
      3
      year
      replacement
      warranty
      on
      it
      at
      least.
      It's
      going
      to
      be
      in
      the
      40's
      on
      Saturday.
      I'll
      probably
      just
      wait
      until
      it's
      thawed
      to
      pick
      up
      the
      car.

      Thinking
      about
      my
      two
      cats
      I
      first
      got
      when
      I
      was
      on
      my
      own
      finally.
      Brothers,
      orange
      Tabby's.
      Ben
      and
      Jerry.
      Ben
      lived
      to
      be
      nearly
      15,
      Jerry
      made
      it
      another
      2
      1/2
      years.
      Two
      awesome
      good
      natured
      cats
      who
      lived
      happy
      lives.
      I'm
      sad
      because
      I
      miss
      them
      every
      day.
      But
      I'm
      happy
      to
      have
      been
      able
      to
      be
      their
      human.

      three

      Thursday.
      Of
      note,
      the
      battery
      wouldn't
      turn
      the
      car
      over
      but
      once
      or
      twice
      before
      giving
      up
      yet
      showed
      a
      90%
      charge
      when
      I
      put
      my
      charger
      on
      it.
      Anyway,
      Friday
      morning,
      put
      it
      in
      the
      car
      and
      it
      fired
      up
      like
      normal.
      Temps
      weren't
      -12
      at
      that
      point,
      about
      flat
      0.
      Not
      so
      sure
      my
      fuel
      was
      gelled
      as
      it
      was
      the
      battery
      just
      not
      able
      to
      get
      it
      going.
      Battery
      was
      2
      weeks
      under
      it's
      3
      year
      replacement
      warranty.
      Big
      Box
      Store
      employee
      "tested"
      the
      battery
      as
      good.
      I
      explained
      you
      tell
      that
      to
      me
      who
      was
      stuck
      at
      work
      in
      -12
      degree
      weather,
      or
      my
      wife
      and
      children
      who
      were
      put
      out
      at
      6
      AM
      to
      come
      get
      me
      from
      work.
      I
      left
      with
      a
      new
      battery.

      No.
      Not
      for
      impracticality
      though.
      Those
      TTA's
      simply
      aren't
      common
      anymore.
      They
      didn't
      make
      a
      bunch
      of
      them
      to
      begin
      with.
      Daily
      driving
      a
      3rd
      gen
      is
      fine.
      I
      used
      to
      own
      a
      91
      GTA
      that
      was
      my
      only
      car.
      But
      the
      unique
      and
      collectible
      factor
      of
      the
      89
      TTA
      should
      immediately
      put
      it
      out
      of
      your
      mind
      to
      be
      a
      daily
      driver.

      I

      all
      in
      on
      the
      MiniDisc
      format
      in
      1998.
      Bought
      a
      $300
      Sony
      olayer/recorder
      while
      in
      Japan
      that

      and

      cable
      to

      Even
      had
      a
      Sony
      MD
      In
      Dash
      receiver
      in
      my
      car
      at
      one
      point.
      Lack
      of
      efficient
      transfer
      and
      general
      overall
      support
      got
      me
      out
      of
      it
      about
      2-3
      years
      later.
      Still
      cool
      stuff
      though.

      phone
      face

      Talking

      of

      about
      one
      of

      builds
      and
      basement
      theater.
      It
      was
      mentioned
      that
      he
      was
      using
      a
      specific
      local
      shop
      for

      a

      I'd
      never
      heard
      of
      and
      wasn't
      familiar
      with.
      Fast
      forward
      a
      little
      while
      later,
      I

      you,
      I

      The

      for
      the
      specific
      home
      audio
      company
      previously

      Zero
      coincidence
      there
      IMO.

      Kept
      a
      girl
      who
      was
      living
      with
      us
      (spouses
      coworker
      who
      was
      on
      hard
      times)
      from
      getting
      dragged
      into
      her
      violent
      drunk
      dates
      car.
      Nearly
      cost
      me
      everything,
      and
      as
      time
      passed
      and
      the
      severity
      of
      my
      situation
      was
      recognized,
      she
      acted
      like
      it
      was
      no
      big
      deal
      and
      treated
      the
      legal
      proceedings
      as
      an
      inconvenience
      for
      her,
      didn't
      take
      it
      seriously,
      kept
      imbelishing
      her
      story,
      and
      essentially
      screwed
      me
      over.
      Hindsight,
      I
      should
      have
      just
      walked
      inside
      and
      locked
      the
      door.

      good
      ones.
      About
      12
      years
      ago,
      selling
      our
      townhouse
      in
      NJ.
      We're
      just
      a
      few
      weeks
      from
      moving.
      She's
      in
      the
      kitchen,
      and
      hollers
      up
      to
      me
      upstairs
      that
      the
      hot
      water
      isn't
      working.
      GREAT.
      I
      go
      check
      the
      bathroom.....it's
      fine.
      Hmmm.......go
      downstairs
      to
      the
      kitchen
      and
      look
      at
      the
      sink.
      The
      single
      handle
      actuated
      faucet,
      is
      on
      full
      cold.
      Tell
      her
      "Hey,
      the
      hot
      water
      works
      on
      hot."
      Also
      while
      living
      in
      NJ,
      we
      were
      driving
      around
      one
      day
      (central
      Jersey,
      I
      was
      station
      at
      McGuire
      AFB)
      and
      she
      comments
      "I
      wonder
      if
      they
      grow
      corn
      here"
      as
      we
      are
      LITERALLY
      driving
      down
      the
      road
      flanked
      by
      corn
      on
      both
      sides.
      She's
      got
      more
      but
      I
      am
      old
      and
      forgetful
      right
      now.

      That's
      either
      a
      92
      or
      93
      LT1,
      accessory
      drive
      setup
      says
      it's
      from
      a
      Corvette.
      Lack
      of
      a
      MAF
      is
      a
      dead
      giveaway
      as
      is
      the
      lack
      of
      a
      front
      fuel
      rail
      crossover
      recess
      in
      the
      intake
      manifold.
      This
      is
      run
      off
      of
      a
      Speed
      Density
      ECM,
      and
      utilizes
      a
      PROM
      chip
      instead
      of
      a
      reflashable
      ECM.
      It's
      also
      a
      Batch
      Fired
      injector
      setup,
      not
      the
      sequential
      fired
      setup
      of
      the
      94-97
      LT1's.
      The
      motor
      itself
      is
      essentially
      the
      same
      between
      the
      years,
      but
      the
      computer
      and
      logic
      of
      the
      early
      92-93
      ones
      is
      quite
      different.
      You're
      also
      likely
      to
      find
      an
      unvented
      optispark
      with
      a
      spline
      drive
      unless
      it's
      been
      converted
      to
      the
      later
      style
      cam
      dowel
      pin
      driven
      unit
      with
      the
      vents,
      which
      was
      a
      pretty
      common
      swap
      (I
      did
      it
      to
      two
      93
      Trans
      Am's
      myself).
      If
      you
      want
      to
      search
      parts
      for
      the
      motor,
      a
      92
      or
      93
      Corvette
      would
      be
      your
      best
      bet.
      The
      F-Body
      used
      an
      accessory
      drive
      setup
      that
      put
      the
      alternator
      on
      the
      other
      side
      (passenger
      side)
      of
      the
      motor.
      That's
      definitely
      a
      Corvette
      setup.

      I
      love
      the
      style
      and
      finish
      for
      sure.
      Car
      looks
      great
      with
      those.
      FYI,
      I
      had
      the
      C5
      ZO6
      version
      of
      these
      (black
      w/machined
      face)
      on
      my
      Corvette
      for
      a
      while.
      Hopefully
      they've
      improved
      their
      finishing
      process
      because
      I
      warrantied
      one
      set
      then
      got
      rid
      of
      them
      after
      the
      second
      set
      had
      clear
      coat
      separation
      issues
      over
      the
      machined
      areas.
      Keep
      a
      close
      eye
      on
      them
      and
      make
      use
      of
      the
      warranty
      if
      you
      have
      to.

      If

      on

      years
      ago
      myself.
      I
      do
      have
      a
      99
      FSM
      though.
      If

      Diagnostic
      Tree
      posted

      the
      P1431.
      *I
      just
      looked
      through
      and
      the
      P1431
      is
      indeed
      for
      the
      right
      side
      with
      it's
      pump/sender.
      You
      could
      try
      an
      old
      school
      trick
      and
      toss
      in
      a

      of
      Chevron
      Techron
      with
      a
      tank
      of
      top
      tier
      fuel
      and
      see
      if
      you
      get
      the
      sender
      to
      work
      again.
      Otherwise,
      odds
      are
      it's
      new
      sending
      unit
      time.

      kept.
      I've
      always
      liked
      the
      LTx
      C4's.....more
      specifically
      the
      body
      revisions
      actually
      done
      in
      1991
      when
      it
      still
      had
      the
      L98.

      2000
      Lincoln
      LS.
      It
      was
      a

      of
      a
      nickel

      This
      was
      in
      2005
      with
      a
      75k
      mile
      car.
      Sold
      it
      for
      a
      loss
      and
      never
      looked

      Well
      that's
      totally
      subjective.
      To
      add
      some
      clarification:
      Reverse
      flow
      cooling
      meaning
      coolant
      flows
      through
      the
      heads
      first.
      This
      is
      an
      added
      bonus
      and
      not
      a
      detractor.
      Keeps
      chamber
      temps
      and
      hot
      spots
      down,
      allowing
      more
      aggressive
      compression
      ratios
      and
      timing
      curves.
      Nothing
      negative
      to
      be
      had.
      EGR?
      Kludged
      together?
      I
      see
      this
      as
      a
      non
      issue.
      Stricter
      emissions
      requirements
      propagate
      added
      hardware,
      things
      like
      some
      extra
      tubes
      and
      an
      air
      injection
      pump.
      Guess
      what?
      The
      L98
      got
      that
      stuff
      too.
      The
      LT
      engine
      bay
      on
      the
      Vette
      is
      no
      worse
      than
      the
      L98.
      You
      compared
      F-Bodies.
      That's
      a
      stark
      contrast
      on
      those
      cars
      because
      as
      the
      engine
      evolved
      so
      did
      the
      chassis
      of
      the
      car
      which
      is
      where
      your
      feelings
      of
      it
      being
      easier
      to
      work
      on
      come
      from,
      as
      the
      4th
      gen
      chassis
      is
      much
      tighter
      around
      the
      motor,
      not
      to
      mention
      the
      rear
      half
      of
      the
      engine
      sits
      under
      the
      cowl.
      The
      Corvette
      on
      the
      other
      hand
      doesn't
      suffer
      from
      those
      changes.
      Ignition
      system.
      Ok,
      the
      L98
      gets
      the
      not
      from
      me
      because
      of
      reliability.
      The
      optispark
      in
      the
      LTx
      is
      a
      fantastic
      piece
      of
      engineering,
      poorly
      executed.
      Under
      the
      water
      pump?!?!
      Brilliant
      idea.
      But......they
      are
      tremendously
      accurate
      and
      when
      they
      are
      working
      it's
      hard
      to
      beat
      them.
      In
      terms
      of
      sheer
      performance,
      L98

      LT1/4
       lt;
      LS1/2/6/7/3
       lt;
      LT1/4.
      It's
      just
      simple
      evolution.
      But
      because
      one
      car
      doesn't
      have
      the
      performance
      of
      another
      doesn't
      mean
      it's
      not
      worth
      it
      to
      someone.
      Look
      at
      it
      from
      a
      Corvette
      perspective
      and
      not
      a
      performance
      enthusiast
      perspective.
      Each
      and
      every
      one
      has
      it's
      attributes.
      For
      the
      OP........don't
      let
      other
      people's
      opinions
      sway
      you
      from
      what
      YOU
      want.
      That
      car
      obviously
      has
      sentimental
      value.
      From
      what
      you've
      said
      and
      what
      was
      posted
      here,
      people
      are
      focusing
      on
      one
      thing
      mainly.
      How
      much
      power
      does
      it
      make?
      There's
      SO
      much
      more
      to
      it
      than
      that.
      Just
      because
      it's
      not
      going
      to
      make
      400
      RWHP
      with
      mods
      doesn't
      mean
      it's
      not
      worth
      it.
      It's
      all
      in
      what
      you
      want
      and
      will
      be
      happy
      with.
      From
      the
      sounds
      of
      it,
      your
      family
      has
      an
      attachment
      to
      this
      particular
      car.
      Get
      it
      and
      don't
      let
      anyone
      talk
      you
      out
      of
      it.

      I
      ask
      you
      this:
      Do
      you
      want
      a
      Corvette
      for
      the
      driving
      experience
      and
      to
      build
      up
      and
      modify
      for
      more
      performance,
      or
      do
      you
      want
      this
      particular
      1991
      Corvette
      because
      of
      the
      family
      ties.
      If
      the
      former,
      look
      for
      something
      newer/more
      capable.
      If
      the
      latter,
      buy
      it
      back
      and
      never
      think
      twice.

      The
      AF9
      is
      too
      expensive
      IMO.
      You
      can
      get
      a
      C8
      65"
      for
      under

      pretty
      easily
      right

      You
      can
      get
      a
      65"
      B8
      for
      $1600
      via
      slick
      deals
      (just
      saw
      the
      posting
      from
      yesterday,
      it's
      still
      up).
      If
      you
      have
      the
      room
      for
      a
      65"
      it's
      a
      no
      brainier
      to
      go
      for
      the
      larger
      size.

      I'd

      for
      the
      55C8.
      The
      extra
      size
      isn't
      worth
      over
      double
      the

      I'll
      throw
      it
      to
      you
      like
      this.
      $7K
      is
      too
      much
      for
      a
      C4
      with
      136K
      miles
      on
      it,
      even
      if
      it
      is
      in
      exceptional
      shape.
      If
      you're
      willing
      to
      spend
      that
      on
      it,
      you're
      paying
      for
      the
      emotional
      attachment.
      Don't
      do
      anything
      but
      that,
      because
      you
      inevitably
      won't
      be
      satisfied
      with
      the
      outcome
      should
      you
      start
      modifying
      it.
      It's
      an
      engine
      and
      will
      respond
      to
      modifications
      like
      any
      other,
      but
      your
      starting
      point
      is
      much
      lower.
      For
      probably
      $5-7K
      more
      you
      can
      get
      into
      a
      very
      clean
      C5

      would
      be
      far
      happier
      if
      performance
      is
      your
      thing.

      So
      this
      was
      made
      in
      September
      of
      2016........the
      last
      day
      my
      car
      moved.
      This
      is
      my
      youngest
      son,
      and
      my
      oldest
      got
      a
      ride
      immediately
      afterwards.
      Reason
      the
      car
      got
      torn
      into
      was
      after
      both
      blasts
      it
      dropped
      oil
      pressure
      before
      recovering
      (classic
      sticking
      check
      valve
      in
      the
      pump).
      My
      youngest
      here
      was
      just
      over
      3.....he's
      5
      1/2
      now
      and
      was
      asking
      me
      this
      morning
      to
      see
      the
      video
      and
      when
      he
      can
      ride
      in
      my
      "Fast
      blue
      car"
      again.
      For
      what
      it's
      worth,
      the
      new
      heads
      are
      on,
      cam
      is
      in,
      front
      cover
      is
      back
      on.....I
      need
      to
      fix
      an
      oxygen
      sensor
      harness
      so
      I
      can
      put
      the
      turbo's/manifolds/downpipes
      back
      in,
      then
      it's
      all
      downhill.
      But
      it's
      COLD
      in
      my
      garage
      and
      laying
      on
      the
      cement
      doing
      wiring
      doesn't
      agree
      with
      my
      40
      year
      old
      bones.
      But.......it's
      motivation......gotta
      do
      it
      for
      the
      little
      guy.
      P.S.
      The
      entertainment
      really
      happens
      starting
      at
      1:50

      That's
      beautiful.
      You
      don't
      see
      a
      whole
      lot
      of
      early/mid
      C4's
      looking
      that
      good
      anymore.
      Bravo!

      Not
      a
      $4K
      car
      though
      it
      looks
      nice.
      200K
      is
      a
      LOT
      of
      miles.
      Manual
      valve
      body
      rebuild
      on
      a
      4L60E?
      So
      they
      totally
      took
      all
      computer
      control
      away
      from
      it?
      Doesn't
      jive.
      Check
      for
      rot
      on
      the
      floor
      pans
      and
      around
      the
      rear
      wells.
      Headlight
      motors
      are
      obviously
      out.
      Wiper
      motor
      is
      bad
      and
      needs
      replacing
      too
      (see
      the
      engine
      bay
      shot,
      the
      wipers
      aren't
      parked).
      I
      wouldn't
      offer
      over
      3K
      tops.

      If
      your
      concern
      is
      overall
      safety,
      then
      yes,
      it's
      definitely
      something
      to
      take
      into
      consideration.

      Disregard
      the
      ZO6
      prices.....those
      have
      and
      will
      remain
      higher
      than
      the
      Coupe/Vert
      models.
      Your
      question
      is
      really
      vague.
      It's
      REALLY
      dependent
      on
      mileage
      and
      condition,
      and
      even
      then
      the
      price
      can
      vary
      pretty
      wildly.
      Post
      up
      some
      examples
      of
      what
      you're
      looking
      at
      and
      we
      should
      be
      able
      to
      get
      you
      a
      better
      idea.

      For
      how
      much
      you're
      going
      to
      spend
      rebuilding
      that
      305,
      you
      can
      snag
      a
      junkyard
      pull
      5.3
      or
      6.0
      and
      be
      up
      and
      running
      for
      probably
      about
      the
      same
      cost
      with
      a
      much
      better

      Admittedly,
      you
      do
      take
      a
      risk
      with
      a
      junkyard
      pull
      though
      plenty
      of
      resellers
      will
      offer
      a
      warranty
      with
      the
      motor
      also,
      however
      small,
      it
      would
      give
      piece
      of
      mind.
      As
      for
      the
      installation,
      it's
      a
      swap
      that's
      been
      done
      NUMEROUS
      times.
      You
      should
      have
      zero
      problem
      integrating
      the
      PCM
      and
      Harness
      with
      the
      factory
      stuff
      in
      the
      car.
      At
      the
      very
      least,
      take
      a
      good
      hard
      look
      at
      doing
      the
      LS
      swap.
      I'd
      just
      hate
      to
      see
      you
      spend
      the
      money
      on
      a
      rebuild
      and
      have
      that
      go
      sideways,
      or
      you
      end
      up
      swapping
      in
      the
      not
      too
      distant
      future
      and
      wondering
      why
      you
      threw
      the
      money
      away
      the
      first
      go
      around.

      Now

      Looks
      good,
      but
      the
      bokeh
      and
      motion
      blur
      is
      too
      heavy.
      Looks
      chopped.
      Not
      trying
      to
      be
      insulting,
      just
      calling
      it

      I

      it

      you
      have

      do
      to
      get

      I

      The
      motor
      in
      my
      car.
      In
      a
      race
      and
      wasn't
      paying
      attention.....full
      throttle
      into
      the
      Rev
      limiter
      at
      the
      top
      of
      3rd
      gear
      (under
      boost).
      Got
      into
      4th
      and
      back
      on
      the
      throttle
      and
      the
      cam
      gear
      boots
      promptly
      sheared.
      Bent
      all
      eight

      and
      seats
      in
      the
      heads
      we're
      hosed.
      After
      some.....upgrades,
      ended
      up
      costing
      me
      about
      $10k
      to
      get
      it
      back
      up
      and
      running.
      With
      150%
      the
      previous
      power
      at
      least.

      Very
      nice.
      Looking
      at
      the
      hood
      I'd
      probably
      pay
      someone
      to
      do
      a
      light
      correction
      on
      the
      paint
      just
      to
      get
      rid
      of
      those
      swirls
      and
      give
      you
      a
      good
      base
      moving
      forward.

      I
      (and

      only
      wonder
      how
      things

      turned

      Greentoe
      is
      fine,
      and
      they're
      not
      the
      seller,
      they
      only
      facilitate
      the
      transaction
      between
      you
      and
      the
      retailer,
      who
      will
      be
      an
      authorized
      retailer,
      so
      your
      warranty
      will
      be
      fine.
      Both
      my
      65
      B7
      and
      my
      55
      B7
      were
      Greentoe
      purchases
      last
      year,
      and
      both
      TV's
      came
      from
      the
      same
      LG
      Authorized
      retailer
      with
      the
      retailers
      name
      on
      the
      receipt.
      Think
      of
      Greentoe
      as
      a
      middleman
      price
      negotiator.
      That's
      it.

      Absolutely
      necessary?
      No.
      But......yes,
      you
      would
      benefit
      from
      that.
      Even
      without
      headers,
      you've
      changed
      the
      VE
      of
      the
      motor
      enough
      that
      a
      tune
      would
      net
      you
      some
      power
      and
      economy.
      The
      Speed
      Density
      logic
      (No
      MAF
      or
      Mass
      Airflow
      Sensor)
      ECM
      used
      on
      the
      early
      90's
      cars
      will
      adapt
      to
      a
      degree,
      but
      it's
      capability
      is
      quickly
      overrun.
      Not
      to
      mention
      the
      factory
      tunes
      are
      pretty
      conservative
      on
      these.
      Do
      you
      need
      to
      dyno
      tune
      it?
      No.
      Downvote
      me
      if
      you
      will
      everyone,
      but
      it's
      not
      necessary
      for
      the
      simple
      bolt
      on's
      as
      mentioned
      above.
      OP
      what
      you
      need
      to
      do
      is
      find
      someone
      familiar
      with
      the
      early
      90's
      stuff.
      I
      did
      a
      lot
      of
      tuning
      work
      a
      long
      time
      back
      in
      the
      mid
      2000's
      with
      a
      guy
      down
      in
      NC
      who
      used
      to
      be
      a
      part
      of
      PCMForLess
      and
      split
      off.
      He
      was
      the
      go
      to
      guy
      for
      speed
      density
      tuning,
      and
      he
      still
      does
      it
      under
      his
      grown
      into
      shop
      called
      PCMofNC.
      My
      recommendation
      would
      be
      send
      his
      shop
      an
      email
      and
      see
      what
      he
      can
      do
      for
      you.

      Concealed
      soft
      close
      cabinet
      hinges
      and
      soft
      close
      drawer
      slides.
      What
      a
      doggone
      improvement
      it
      made
      on
      my
      dated
      1998
      builder
      grade
      kitchen
      (laminate
      countertops,
      pecan
      stained
      oak
      cabinets,
      cheap
      plastic
      hinges,
      cheapest
      drawer
      slides
      available).
      And
      it's
      SO
      SIMPLE.
      Kreg
      jig
      for
      $30
      is
      worth
      every
      cent.
      I
      used
      a
      combination
      of
      Blum
      and
      Grass
      euro
      style
      (35mm)
      soft
      close
      hinges
      due
      to
      my
      narrow
      1/4"
      overlay
      (which
      Blum
      only
      had
      a
      press
      in
      hinge
      for).
      A
      10
      pack
      of
      either
      is
      about
      $35.
      As
      for
      the
      drawer
      slides,
      there
      are
      a
      LOT
      of
      options
      out
      there.
      What
      I
      found
      was
      you
      want
      to
      select
      a
      manufacturer
      who
      uses
      metal
      pins,
      not
      plastic.
      I
      can
      get
      10
      pair
      of
      22"
      slides
      from
      Gobrico
      on
      Amazon
      for
      $125ish,
      and
      they
      have
      held
      up
      great
      so
      far.
      Plus
      they're
      black
      so
      they
      look
      pretty
      nice.
      Best
      part
      about
      this
      is
      that
      you
      can
      slowly
      work
      on
      these
      simple
      but
      effective
      updates
      as
      funds
      or
      time
      allows.
      You
      can
      buy
      by
      the
      pair,
      or
      in
      bulk,
      there's
      tons
      of
      options
      available.
      But
      when
      you've
      got
      a
      dated
      kitchen
      or
      something
      and
      you
      want
      to
      do
      just
      a
      little
      something
      to
      improve
      it,
      this
      is
      a
      relatively
      inexpensive
      and
      quick
      way
      to
      make
      that
      progress.

      When
      you

      Ok,
      my
      thought
      was
      that
      something
      was
      opening
      up
      as
      the
      engine
      warmed
      up.
      Seems
      you
      addressed
      that.
      You
      don't
      have
      access
      to
      a
      real
      time
      data
      scanner
      do
      you?
      That
      would
      help
      a
      lot
      because
      you
      could
      check
      things
      like
      the
      fuel
      trims,
      MAF
      airflow,
      IAC
      positioning,
      etc.
      Are
      there
      any
      mods
      to
      the
      car,
      has
      it
      been
      tuned
      or
      anything?

      Looks
      like
      a
      MK7
      2015.
      It'll
      legit
      get
      50
      easy
      on
      the
      highway.
      I
      load
      our
      2015
      MK7
      GSW
      up
      with
      my
      wife,
      kids,
      dogs,
      and
      luggage,
      and
      still
      just
      barely
      squeak
      50
      MPG
      all
      highway
      out
      of
      it.
      One
      person,
      that's
      easy
      if
      the
      drive
      is
      right.
      The
      MK7's
      are
      a
      fair
      bit
      more
      efficient
      than
      the
      previous
      generations.

      Totally
      depends
      on
      your
      drive.
      Steady
      cruising
      speeds
      are
      what
      wins
      the
      MPG
      race.
      If
      I
      drive
      my
      wife's
      car
      to
      work,
      50+
      MPG
      all
      day
      long
      every
      day.
      But
      my
      wife
      runs
      around
      town,
      stop
      and
      go,
      and
      she
      usually
      gets
      in
      the
      lower-mid
      30's.
      To
      get
      that
      good
      economy
      you've
      got
      to
      get
      on
      the
      highway
      and
      stretch
      it's
      legs.
      *edit*
      If
      you're
      getting
      33
      with
      mostly
      highway
      driving,
      something
      is
      seriously
      off.

      Hmmm.......try
      this
      (I
      had
      to
      dig,
      it's
      been
      a
      while
      since
      I've
      owned
      a
      running
      LT1
      car):
      1
      -
      Disconnect
      the
      IAC
      harness
      connector
      2
      -
      Turn
      on
      the
      key.
      This
      will
      put
      the
      IAC
      into
      "reset
      mode".
      3
      -
      Turn
      off
      the
      key
      and
      reconnect
      the
      IAC
      harness
      4
      -
      VERY
      LIGHTLY
      holding
      the
      throttle
      ever
      so
      slightly
      open,
      start
      the
      car.
      This
      will
      reset
      the
      IAC.
      Run
      for
      5-10
      seconds.
      5
      -
      Turn
      off
      the
      car
      and
      release
      the
      gas.
      6
      -
      Restart
      and
      test
      drive
      to
      see
      if
      things
      went
      back
      to
      normal.

      It
      can,
      but
      if
      it's
      new
      it's
      probably
      not
      dirty
      enough
      (unless
      you're
      running
      pretty
      poorly).
      Can't
      hurt
      to
      pull
      it
      and
      clean
      it
      good.
      The
      other
      thing
      I'm
      wondering,
      could
      it
      be
      an
      internal
      vac
      leak
      (think
      EGR),
      tune
      related
      (throttle
      follower
      or
      lack
      of
      a
      tune
      with
      some
      airflow
      modifications),
      some
      kind
      of
      binding
      on
      the
      throttle
      cable
      no
      matter
      how
      slight,
      etc.
      But
      hey,
      it
      seems
      to
      be
      a
      little
      better......any
      progress
      is
      good.
      *edit*
      Just
      for
      kicks,
      if
      you're
      feeling
      really
      froggy......since
      you've
      reset
      the
      IAC......maybe
      try
      disconnecting
      the
      battery
      and
      reset
      the
      PCM.
      It'll
      have
      to
      relearn
      any
      adaptations
      it's
      done
      and
      could
      help
      clean
      some
      stuff
      up.

      Holy
      crap.
      I
      just
      did
      a
      rip
      (47GB)
      and
      started
      playing
      to
      make
      sure
      it
      ripped
      OK,
      HRD
      looked
      good,
      etc.
      This
      is
      going
      to
      become
      a
      new
      standard
      for
      4K
      test
      viewing.
      Absolutely
      amazing.

      My
      65"
      OLED
      hangs
      on
      a
      Monoprice
      Mount
      that
      previously
      hung
      my
      50"
      2006
      model
      plasma.
      It
      was
      about
      $25
      and
      is
      WAY
      overkill.
      Spending
      hundreds
      of
      dollars
      on
      a
      mount
      is
      asinine
      IMO.
      You
      can
      get
      a
      full
      motion
      Monoprice
      mount
      for
      about
      $75

      will
      handle
      anything
      you

      Yep.
      My
      kids
      are
      going
      to
      adore
      watching
      it
      tomorrow.
      I've
      seen
      some
      good
      4K
      stuff
      so
      far,
      but
      this
      is
      another
      level.
      Now
      they
      just
      need
      to
      appeal
      to
      my
      personal
      want
      and
      get
      Speed
      Racer
      on
      4K
      with
      HDR.

      You

      I
      HATE
      going
      to
      the
      Dentist
      (stems
      from
      horrible
      experiences
      as
      a
      kid
      then
      many
      many
      years
      of
      military
      dental
      hobby
      shop
      treatment).
      But
      I
      have
      started
      going
      again
      and
      LOVE
      Sycamore
      Hills
      over
      on
      Illinois/Scott
      by
      the
      Dunkin
      Donuts.
      I
      was
      up
      front
      about
      my
      disdain
      and
      not
      wanting
      to
      be
      there
      and
      they
      have
      been
      nothing
      but
      kind
      and
      absolutely
      outstanding.

      Great
      story!!
      Couple
      of
      things.
      83
      was
      a
      zero
      production
      model
      year,
      it's
      an
      84
      model
      year
      C4.
      Believe
      it
      or
      not,
      and
      I
      just
      found
      this
      out
      too
      because
      I'd
      NEVER
      seen
      one,
      cloth
      was
      available
      as
      an
      interior
      seat
      option
      starting
      in
      1977
      and
      continuing
      until
      it
      ended
      after
      the
      1993
      model
      year.
      Neat
      tidbit
      to
      find
      out!!

      As
      a
      Junior
      in
      high
      school,
      I
      was
      the
      1995
      Arizona
      State
      Champion
      Grocery
      Bagger.
      Too
      bad
      I
      didn't
      win
      the
      national
      competition
      a
      few
      months
      later,
      I'd
      have
      gotten
      to
      go
      on
      Letterman
      (I
      placed
      7th).
      Got
      a
      hometown
      news
      interview,
      free
      trip
      to
      Orlando,
      and
      some
      cash
      out
      of
      it
      though.

      Know
      what
      you
      can
      get
      cheap
      and
      flip
      for
      a
      tidy
      profit.
      Case
      in
      point:.
      Chrysler
      TIPM's
      (Total
      Integrated
      Power
      Module).
      It's
      the
      underhood
      fuse
      box
      in
      mid
      2000's
      vehicles,
      but
      it
      has
      a
      computer
      module
      in
      it
      too.
      I've
      picked
      up
      a
      few
      at
      the
      junkyard
      for
      $15
      each
      and
      sell
      them
      for
      $75-125
      on
      eBay
      pretty
      quickly.

      First
      off
      sorry
      for
      the
      loss
      of
      your
      father.
      For
      me,
      it's
      a
      few
      reasons.
      1.
      Home
      network
      data
      caps
      2.
      I
      can
      control
      the
      quality
      of
      my
      library
      (everything
      is
      high
      bitrate
      1080
      or
      untouched
      4k
      rips)
      3.
      Quality
      isn't
      auto
      adjusted
      based
      off
      an
      internet
      connection
      4.
      Lack
      of
      commercials
      5.
      Everything
      seems
      to
      be
      going
      to
      it's
      own
      streaming
      service.
      Those
      costs
      add
      up
      quickly
      anymore.

            Not
            my
            type,
            but
            I
            retract
            my
            previous
            statements.
            And
            a
            shout
            out
            for
            the
            driving!
            Seeing
            just
            the
            Vette
            video,
            it's
            easy
            to
            take
            out
            of
            context
            (like
            I
            admittedly
            did).
            But
            seeing
            your
            others,
            I
            can
            see
            the
            humor
            in
            it
            and
            it
            makes
            better
            sense.
            I
            was
            laughing
            pretty
            good
            at
            the
            GTR
            one
            actually.

            Seriously
            underrated
            comment.
            The
            C5
            was
            something
            special.
            All
            Corvettes
            Are
            Red
            is
            a
            GREAT
            read
            that
            will
            make
            you
            appreciate
            it
            and
            all
            things
            Corvette.
            For
            the
            guy
            who
            called
            it
            a
            parts
            bin
            special,
            I
            wonder
            if
            you've
            ever
            driven
            a
            C5.
            I've
            driven
            both
            and
            the
            C5
            is
            more
            refined
            in
            every
            way
            over
            the
            C4
            and
            will
            run
            circles
            around
            it.
            I
            don't
            dislike
            the
            C4
            at
            all
            (I
            plan
            to
            get
            one
            for
            myself
            one
            of
            these
            days)
            but
            let's
            not
            make
            the
            C5
            out
            to
            be
            a
            lesser
            vehicle
            either.
            But
            man,
            I
            absolutely
            despise
            knowing
            I
            can
            pull
            a
            truck
            radio
            and
            put
            it
            in
            my
            C5
            and
            no
            one
            would
            be
            the
            wiser.

            WAN.
            I
            can
            check
            the
            speed
            anywhere
            in
            my
            house,
            hardwired
            or
            WAN
            connected
            to
            either
            the
            main
            router
            or
            satellites,
            and
            get
            my
            advertised
            280mb
            download
            speeds
            (and
            typical
            cable
            25-30mb
            upload).
            Just
            remember,
            the
            4K
            I
            was
            streaming
            was
            an
            uncompressed
            4K
            disc
            rip,
            so
            it
            streams
            at
            a
            really
            high
            bitrates.
            I
            can
            confirm
            that
            on
            a
            normal
            day
            with
            just
            my
            family
            at
            home
            I
            have
            zero
            issue
            streaming
            any
            of
            my
            local
            4k
            content.

            temporary
            amnesia

            you

            I've

            Ok,
            gonna
            put
            my
            flame
            suit
            on
            here
            because
            there's
            bound
            to
            be
            the
            inevitable
            haters.
            Zaino.
            It's
            the
            ONLY
            polish
            product
            I
            use
            on
            my
            99
            Nassau
            Blue
            C5
            UNLESS
            I'm
            doing
            a
            machine
            polish,
            in
            which
            case
            I
            personally
            prefer
            Menzerna
            products
            (SIP,
            IP,
            and
            FP).
            But
            even
            then,
            my
            final
            polish
            is
            hand
            applied
            Zaino.
            It's
            somewhat
            spendy
            (will
            cost
            you
            about
            $75
            starting
            from
            scratch),
            but
            it
            goes
            a
            LONG
            way
            as
            you
            apply
            it
            very
            VERY
            lightly.
            The
            key
            is
            in
            the
            prep.
            The
            better
            base
            you
            start
            with,
            the
            better
            the
            results.
            It's
            also
            a
            multi-step
            process
            and
            an
            all

            a
            little

            are
            10-12'

            Yeah,
            so.........sorry
            about
            the
            oily
            mess.
            When
            I
            repurchased
            the
            car
            it
            had
            a
            scavenge
            pump
            line
            that
            was
            loose
            and
            made
            a
            mess.
            Cleaning
            is
            part
            of
            the
            process......but
            it's
            finally
            taken
            a
            big
            step
            towards
            running
            again.
            Turbos
            are
            back
            in
            and
            exhaust
            bolted
            up.
            I
            am
            putting
            a
            heat
            blanket
            above
            the
            pipes
            to
            protect
            the
            sensor
            wiring,
            hence
            none
            of
            the
            vacuum
            stuff
            being
            hooked
            up
            yet.
            Really
            just
            need
            to
            set
            the
            valvetrain
            up
            (Yella
            Terra
            10mm
            shaft
            mounts)
            to
            measure
            for
            and
            order
            pushrods,
            then
            get
            the
            radiator
            and
            condenser
            back
            in.
            For
            not
            having
            motivation
            for
            a
            couple
            of
            years......I'm
            actually
            getting
            kind
            of
            excited
            to
            have
            it
            running.
            My
            kids
            especially.

            Surprisingly
            no
            worse
            than
            when
            the
            car
            had
            LG
            long

            headers.
            I've
            had

            since
            2006
            and
            it
            works
            marvelously

            Held
            on,
            too
            long,
            for
            me.
            My
            cat
            was
            14,
            three
            months
            shy
            of
            15.
            He
            (and
            his
            brother)
            was
            the
            single
            longest
            constant
            in
            my
            life
            at
            that
            point.
            I
            got
            them
            when
            I
            was
            23.
            Longer
            than
            anything;
            my
            wife,
            kids,
            possessions......anything.
            Renal
            failure,
            and
            he
            was
            at
            his
            end.
            He
            had
            quit
            eating
            and
            was
            wasting
            away,
            but
            maintained
            his
            character
            through
            and
            through.
            I
            finally
            knew
            it
            was
            time,
            and
            made
            the
            decision
            the
            night
            before.
            I
            was
            a
            wreck.
            Night
            before
            and
            day
            of.
            I
            spent
            the
            entire
            morning
            laying
            in
            my
            bed
            bawling,
            with
            him
            on
            me.
            Weak
            as
            he
            was,
            ever
            so
            slightly,
            purring.
            Finally
            went
            to
            the
            Vet
            and
            he
            never
            left
            my
            arms,
            and
            even
            the
            vet
            noted
            it.
            It
            was
            VERY
            quick.
            Almost
            instant.
            My
            vet
            said
            "I
            can't
            believe
            he
            was
            still
            purring.
            He
            loved
            you
            and
            I
            have
            no
            doubt
            he
            was
            only
            holding
            on
            because
            of
            you.".
            Best
            cat
            I
            will
            ever
            have
            in
            my
            life.
            He
            was
            just
            special.
            Now
            pardon
            me,
            I
            got
            some
            dust
            in
            my
            eyes.

            if
            you
            didn't
            know,
            the
            wired
            connection
            on
            the
            TV
            will
            only
            give
            you
            a
            10/100
            connection.
            May
            not
            be
            an
            issue
            but
            if
            you
            try
            streaming
            some
            high
            quality
            4k
            stuff
            it
            could
            come
            into
            play.

            Being
            a
            VS986
            (I'm
            making
            this
            post
            from
            mine
            that's
            still
            plugging
            away
            after
            nearly
            4
            years
            now),
            you're
            unfortunately
            kind
            of
            trapped
            into
            being
            able
            to
            root
            one
            version
            of
            the
            software.
            Forgive
            me
            because
            it's
            been
            a
            while,
            but
            I
            don't
            believe
            the
            bootloader
            ever
            got
            unlocked
            and
            that
            severely
            limited
            development.
            For
            what
            it's
            worth
            though,
            I
            rooted
            mine
            about
            2
            years
            ago,
            and
            am
            happy.
            I
            can
            run
            AdAway
            and
            Titanium
            Backup
            which
            were
            my
            biggest
            wants.
            Sure,
            you're
            going
            to
            miss
            out
            on
            some
            newer
            features
            .....
            But
            none
            of
            it
            is
            game
            changing
            IMO.
            Check
            out
            the
            XDA
            Forums
            for
            more
            info.
            There's
            good
            guides
            and
            a
            lot
            of
            info
            available

            Ok,
            I
            was
            just
            doing
            some
            research
            because
            to
            my
            knowledge
            the
            "Delco/Mongoose"
            package
            wasn't
            a
            factory
            authorized
            package,
            but
            aftermarket
            through
            Corvette
            Concepts
            and
            available
            in
            several
            stages
            with
            HP
            ratings
            up
            to
            about
            425
            (Stage
            IV
            425SS
            is
            the
            highest
            I
            can
            find).
            Through
            some
            more
            research,
            I
            found
            the
            CL
            ad
            for
            this
            car.
            The
            name
            Ron
            Bilyeu
            checks
            out
            associated
            with
            "Pro
            Auto
            Tech"
            back
            then
            who
            originated
            the
            Mongoose
            packages
            which
            were
            continued
            by
            Corvette
            Concepts.
            Some
            more
            information
            showed
            me
            that
            up
            to
            the
            425SS
            were
            simply
            bolt
            on's
            and
            additional
            packages
            involving
            head/cam
            swaps
            were
            available
            to
            about
            a
            490
            HP
            rating
            (flywheel).
            This
            is
            just
            finding
            bits
            and
            pieces
            here
            and
            there
            since
            neither
            company
            seems
            to
            exist
            anymore
            and
            the
            majority
            of
            the
            info
            is
            gone.
            But.
            What
            REALLY
            concerns
            me,
            is
            though
            you
            may
            have
            snagged
            this
            car
            for
            a
            pretty
            cheap
            deal,
            don't
            expect
            it
            to
            give
            you
            what
            the
            CL
            ad
            said.
            There
            is
            ZERO
            way
            that
            car
            was
            making
            500
            RWHP.
            That
            engine
            has
            original
            97-98
            853
            heads,
            the
            perimeter
            bolts
            for
            the
            valve
            covers
            are
            a
            dead
            giveaway.
            Those
            heads
            won't
            support
            that
            power.
            The
            claim
            of
            a
            427
            LS1
            is
            pretty
            far
            fetched
            also,
            considering
            the
            Darton
            Sleeve
            kit
            for
            those
            engines
            until
            the
            early
            2000's.
            Even
            then,
            IF
            it's
            been
            sleeved
            and
            stroked
            out
            to
            a
            427
            (4.125
            bore
            /
            4.000
            stroke),
            those
            heads
            still
            aren't
            going
            to
            support
            500
            to
            the
            tires.
            Looking
            at
            all
            the
            pics
            and
            info
            on
            the
            car,
            I'm
            afraid
            you
            bought
            yourself
            into
            a
            super
            bad
            money
            pit
            that
            may
            never
            be
            sorted
            correctly.
            It's
            going
            to
            take
            a
            LOT
            of
            money
            to
            put
            that
            car
            back
            to
            road
            worthiness.
            Not
            trying
            to
            be
            a
            debbie
            downer,
            but
            just
            giving
            an
            honest
            opinion.

            And
            the
            worst
            part
            is
            I
            didn't
            fire
            a
            shot.
            Never
            ran
            across
            anyone
            until

            there
            were

            big

            and
            the
            storm
            got
            them
            both.
            But
            I'll
            take
            it,
            finally,
            that

            No,

            each
            other.
            Knowing
            that,
            I
            kept

            C6Z.
            I
            found
            the
            C7
            to
            be
            a
            much
            more
            cramped
            interior,
            even
            if
            the
            quality
            was
            better.
            But
            the
            C6Z
            with
            it's
            fabled
            427
            says
            it
            all
            to
            me.

            The

            a

            is
            a
            pretty
            big
            leap
            forward.
            And
            don't
            do
            an

            Awesome.

            if

            didn't

            your

            extended
            to

            If
            I
            remember
            right,
            it's
            about
            4"
            that's
            needed

            A/S.
            Car
            just
            came
            off
            the
            jack
            hence
            the
            4x4
            look,
            it's
            on
            a
            stock
            suspension.
            Why
            replace
            the
            Durban's
            you
            may
            ask.
            One
            was
            cracked
            and
            had
            a
            slow
            leak,
            and
            due
            to
            a
            pothole
            we
            had
            a
            mismatched
            tire.
            Plus
            the
            Durbans
            were
            a
            little
            beat
            up.
            So
            I
            figure
            I'll
            have
            the
            crack
            fixed,
            and
            get
            some
            snow
            tires
            for
            winter
            driving.

            I
            wouldn't
            have,

            I

            the

            were
            a
            little
            over
            $500
            so
            I
            said
            what
            the
            heck.
            It
            was
            easier
            given
            the
            one
            cracked
            OEM
            wheel.

            I
            had
            to
            wait
            for
            (wait
            for
            it.....)
            Harbor
            Freight
            to
            open
            to
            snag
            a
            cheap
            easy
            out
            kit.
            FORTUNATELY,
            it
            came
            out
            almost
            by
            hand
            power
            alone.
            Just
            ran
            right
            out
            with
            no
            fuss.

            opti)
            was
            it's
            execution.
            Let's
            put
            the
            opti
            right
            under
            the
            freaking
            water
            pump.
            Guess
            what
            happens
            when
            your
            water
            pump
            goes
            out?
            Your
            opti
            takes
            a
            coolant
            bath
            because
            the
            weep
            hole
            for
            the
            pump
            is
            DIRECTLY
            over
            the
            opti.
            They're
            really
            not
            that
            bad
            though.
            I
            owned
            twos
            LT1
            cars
            from
            2000
            until
            2015
            and
            only
            ever
            had
            two
            opti's
            die.
            They're
            not
            that
            terrible
            to
            replace
            either,
            just
            irritating
            because
            you
            have
            to
            take
            off
            the
            water
            pump.
            Now.......I'll
            say
            this.

            easy
            enough
            to
            install,
            but
            a
            little
            costly
            (about
            $2200
            if
            you

            a

            source
            other
            parts
            separately).
            As
            for
            other
            aspects.........The
            ZF6
            has
            got
            to
            be
            one
            of

            smoothest
            manual
            transmissions
            I've
            ever
            had
            the
            privilege
            of
            driving.
            Absolutely
            a
            dream
            to
            be
            in
            control
            of.
            The
            C4's
            are
            raw,
            and
            you
            feel
            like
            you're
            in
            a
            fighter
            jet
            in
            them
            because
            of
            the
            seating
            position
            and
            design
            (can
            confirm,
            I've
            got
            seat
            time
            in
            an
            F-16).
            Personally,
            my
            recommendation
            would
            be
            to
            look
            for
            a
            95-96
            car,
            preferably
            a
            96
            LT4
            car
            as
            it's
            just
            the
            best
            you
            could
            get
            in
            an
            C4.
            But
            if
            you
            find
            the

            The

            Was
            the
            last
            NFL
            game
            I
            have
            attended.
            Christmas
            day,
            1995,
            Cowboys
            at
            Cardinals.
            I'd
            bought
            my
            family
            and
            I
            tickets
            for
            Christmas.
            Little
            did
            I
            know
            that
            I'd
            be
            able
            to
            see
            Emmitt
            Smith
            set
            the
            (somewhat
            short
            lived)
            single
            season
            TD
            record
            that
            game.

            reassemble
            them.
            Went
            to
            flip
            the
            shroud
            and
            didn't
            realize
            the
            fans
            were

            plenty

            Though
            I
            try

            give

            I'm
            posting
            it
            because
            I'm
            done
            working
            on
            my
            C5
            for
            the

            am
            feeling
            a
            tad
            nostalgic.
            This
            C3R
            Stingray
            concept
            was
            in
            the
            process
            of
            becoming
            a
            produced
            kit
            car
            of
            sorts
            before
            it
            all
            fell
            apart.
            Essentially
            it's
            a
            rebodied
            C6.
            I
            absolute
            adore
            the
            design
            and
            had
            it
            actually
            happened,
            would
            have
            one
            it
            my
            garage.

            pain
            on

            I'm
            unfucking
            some
            shit
            that
            was
            done
            to
            my
            car
            that
            would
            have
            NEVER
            been
            dreamt
            of
            before
            I
            sold
            it
            (sold
            in
            2010,
            bought
            back
            in
            2015).
            I
            had
            a
            very
            similar
            rats
            nest
            hiding
            in
            my
            battery
            area
            also
            that
            I'm
            clearing
            right
            now.
            Don't
            poo
            poo
            the
            Meth
            system.
            Done
            right,
            it's
            a
            great
            little
            assistant.

            Oh,
            yeah,
            if
            you're
            on
            corn
            then
            it
            makes
            no
            sense.
            I
            think
            my
            rats
            nest
            was
            paid
            for
            unfortunately.
            Same
            guy
            that
            did
            the
            wiring
            (eBoost
            2
            and
            MAP
            extension
            mainly)
            also
            thought
            it
            would
            work
            better
            to
            use
            gorilla
            glue
            instead
            of
            the
            FAST
            seals
            on
            a
            102
            manifold.
            No
            wonder
            the
            car
            was
            wonky
            when
            I
            got
            it
            back,
            lol.

            Ran
            out
            of
            engine
            bay
            room,
            figured
            out
            I
            could
            put
            the
            breather
            tank
            down
            low
            by
            the
            Alky
            Control
            pump
            a
            couple
            days
            ago.
            My
            fittings
            I
            needed
            came
            in
            today
            so
            even
            after
            a
            12
            hour
            workday,
            I
            finished
            it
            up.
            I
            didn't
            mean
            for
            it
            to
            be
            so
            hidden,
            but
            it's
            REALLY
            well
            hidden.
            The
            only
            thing
            you'll
            really
            be
            able
            to
            see
            once
            the
            cowl
            is
            on
            is
            the
            fitting
            on
            the
            passenger
            valve
            cover.

            I
            was
            nervous
            as
            hell.
            I
            already
            verified
            the
            fuel
            system
            had
            no
            leaks,
            scavenge
            pump
            was
            working,
            etc.
            I
            needed
            to
            crank
            to
            get
            some
            oil
            movement.
            Having
            not
            been
            inside
            a
            motor
            for
            5ish
            years......I
            was
            nervous.
            What
            if
            I
            got
            the
            timing
            wrong?
            What
            if
            the
            pushrods
            were
            the
            wrong
            length?
            What
            if
            I
            pinched
            the
            oil
            pickup
            tube
            o
            ring?
            What
            if
            what
            if
            what
            if.
            Happy
            to
            say
            the
            video
            tells
            all.
            Hard
            to
            see
            but
            the
            oil
            pressure
            gauge
            started
            ticking
            so
            movement
            is
            good.
            Smooth
            rotation,
            no
            interference.
            Just
            need
            a
            startup
            tune
            now.

            Long
            Post
            Coming.
            TL/DR:
            A
            lot
            of
            expensive
            shit.
            This
            build
            was
            the
            result
            of
            a
            couple
            of
            things.
            One,
            the
            oil
            pump
            check
            valve
            started
            sticking,
            and
            as
            such,
            necessitated
            opening
            the
            motor
            up.
            Two,
            there
            was
            a
            lot
            simply
            wrong
            with
            the
            car
            after
            I
            had
            repurchased
            it
            from
            the
            gentleman
            I'd
            sold
            it
            to
            (his
            guy
            doing
            the
            work
            was
            a
            freaking
            hack
            job).
            I
            wanted
            to
            bring
            the
            car
            back
            up
            to
            my
            personal
            standards
            hence
            the
            detail
            and
            minor
            things
            you've
            seen
            me
            clean
            up
            along
            the
            way.
            So
            what
            went
            into
            the
            car
            this
            time?
            The
            meat
            of
            the
            stuff
            was
            top
            end
            related
            due
            to
            a
            couple
            times
            the
            motor
            pushed
            water.

            I'm
            probably
            forgetting
            a
            whole
            lot
            of
            smaller
            things.
            Was
            making
            about
            825-850
            RWHP
            before.
            When
            I
            sold
            it
            back
            in
            2010
            it
            was
            making
            a
            solid
            repeatable
            761/760
            to
            the
            wheels
            with
            the
            factory
            turbo's.
            It
            came
            back
            to
            me
            with
            the
            upgraded
            turbo's,
            102
            stuff,
            and
            C6Z
            driveline
            in
            2015.
            Now,
            I'm
            going
            to
            see
            what
            it
            can
            do
            on
            the
            factory
            97-98
            fuel
            lines/rail
            setup.
            At
            761/760
            it
            had
            PLENTY
            of
            head
            room
            on
            80lb
            injectors
            (it
            has
            95's
            now).
            I'd
            like
            to
            see
            1K
            RWHP
            or
            better........but
            I'm
            going
            to
            be
            happy
            with
            it
            running
            safely
            and
            expect
            it
            to
            be
            solidly
            in
            the
            900's.
            It's
            a
            LOT
            of
            money
            to
            spend
            for
            an
            extra
            100-200
            RWHP,
            but
            I
            also
            look
            at
            it
            as
            a
            longevity
            thing
            because
            the
            parts
            are
            FAR
            better
            than
            what
            was
            taken
            off
            the
            car.

            Since

            fix
            two
            years

            took

            a
            LONG

            Before
            the
            fix
            the
            car

            That's

            over

            enough

            an

            Previously
            the

            48-50
            MPG

            range
            for
            the
            same
            drive.
            All
            things
            considered
            equal
            it's

            to
            3
            MPG

            I'll
            take
            that.

            lost
            them
            two
            years

            bought

            A
            Wire

            Then
            found
            the
            ones
            I
            lost.
            These
            are
            the
            only
            sunglasses

            To
            get
            it
            up
            to
            par
            with
            a
            C5,
            in
            terms
            of
            power,
            you'll
            need
            an
            aftermarket
            intake
            and
            a
            header
            back
            exhaust
            setup,
            throw
            in
            a
            160*
            thermostat
            and
            a
            tune,
            and
            that
            should
            put
            you
            very
            close
            to
            300
            RWHP.
            You're
            going
            to
            spend
            about
            $1500
            give
            or
            take
            to
            get
            there.
            The
            unfortunate
            part
            is
            the
            C4
            is
            going
            to
            show
            it's
            age.
            It's
            an
            older
            platform,
            and
            the
            C5
            was
            a
            HUGE
            leap
            forward
            in
            terms
            of
            engineering
            design
            (it's
            stiffer
            but
            rides
            better,
            more
            comfortable,
            easier
            to
            get
            in
            and
            out
            of,
            etc).
            I'm
            NOT
            ragging
            on
            the
            C4.....the
            C5
            is
            just
            better.
            Biggest
            gotcha
            with
            the
            C4
            is
            the
            distributor
            can
            be
            troublesome
            (search
            optispark,
            and
            take
            it
            with
            a
            grain
            of
            salt
            because
            of
            the
            squeaky
            wheel
            curve).
            After
            that,
            it's
            essentially
            a
            Gen
            1
            Small
            Block
            Chevy
            motor
            with
            reverse
            cooling
            and
            aluminum
            heads.
            Unfortunately
            that
            means
            it's
            going
            to
            be
            power
            limited
            if
            you
            start
            tearing
            into
            it.
            It
            WILL
            take
            a
            full
            head
            and
            cam
            package
            to
            reach
            400
            RWHP
            where
            as
            a
            LS1
            will
            do
            it
            cam
            only.
            In
            the
            end,
            it's
            your
            call.
            You
            have
            to
            decide
            if
            a
            C4
            is
            for
            you,
            or
            you
            want
            to
            hold
            out
            for
            the
            C5.
            Depending
            on
            what
            you'd
            be
            trading
            (what
            is
            it,
            I'm
            curious),
            you
            could
            try
            on
            the
            C4,
            then
            sell
            if
            it's
            not
            for
            you
            as
            the
            C4
            market
            seems
            to
            be
            recovering.

            I
            am
            away
            from
            home
            for
            work,
            and
            my
            rental
            has
            Android
            auto,
            so
            I've
            been
            heavily
            utilizing
            it
            to
            get

            from
            work
            and
            around
            town.
            Yesterday
            when
            I
            plugged
            into
            my
            car,
            a
            destination
            that
            I
            had
            never
            put
            into
            navigation
            and
            had
            only
            searched
            once
            about
            a
            month
            ago
            (from
            a
            pc),
            auto
            populated
            into
            the
            navigation
            and
            now
            automatically
            shows
            up
            and
            starts
            navigating
            every
            single
            time
            I
            plug
            into
            the
            car
            OR
            go
            into

            and
            hit
            start
            driving.
            I
            have
            force
            stopped,
            cleared

            on
            both

            I'm
            really
            not
            sure.
            I've
            never
            driven
            a
            supercar
            level
            Mid
            Engine

            before

            and
            Fiero's
            don't
            count
            or
            compare).
            I
            expect
            acceleration
            to
            be
            better
            as
            indicated
            by

            on
            only
            495
            hp.
            But
            I'm
            unfamiliar
            with
            how
            they
            handle
            given
            the
            rear
            weight
            bias.
            I
            have
            a
            C5
            that's
            been
            worked
            over

            it's

            driving
            characteristics
            are
            wonderful.
            I
            fully
            expect
            the
            C8
            to
            be
            as
            good
            or
            better

            What
            I've
            had
            has
            been
            good,
            but
            I
            don't
            typically
            gravitate
            towards
            their
            offerings
            due
            to
            sheer
            cost.
            I
            can
            get
            better
            at
            the
            same
            price
            points
            or
            less
            than
            what
            they
            offer.

            stuff
            isn't
            bad
            per
            se.......but
            cost
            to
            quality
            isn't
            there

            Same

            I
            vividly
            remember
            that
            holdout.
            Cowboys
            started
            0-2
            without
            Emmitt.
            He
            dang
            sure
            got
            his
            contract
            after
            that,
            and
            they
            proceeded
            to
            go
            12-2
            after
            his
            return
            and
            win
            another
            Super
            Bowl.
            And
            I
            say
            vividly
            because
            I
            heard
            it
            from
            EVERYONE,
            most
            loudly
            my
            step
            father,
            about
            how
            no
            team
            in
            history
            (at
            that
            time......01
            Pats
            and
            07
            Giants
            later
            joined
            the
            club)
            had
            ever
            started
            0-2
            and
            Won
            the
            Super
            Bowl.

            UPDATE!!!!!!
            IT
            LIVES!!!!!!
            Tuner
            lit
            it
            off
            without
            me
            today.
            No
            biggie
            for
            me.
            Surprised
            me
            with
            a
            quick
            phone
            vid
            of
            it
            running.
            Said
            it's
            all
            good,
            making
            40-50
            psi
            oil
            pressure,

            has
            moved
            under
            its
            own
            power.
            I'm
            VERY
            happy
            about
            this
            considering
            the
            various
            stages
            of
            disassembly
            the

            spent
            over
            the
            past
            near
            3
            years,and
            the
            fact
            that
            it
            was
            never
            fired
            before
            going
            to
            the
            tuner.

            Passat
            is
            something
            like
            17.7
            but
            my

            are
            usually

            corrected.
            That's

            Yeah,

            so
            you
            know
            where
            it's
            actually
            hitting
            (over

            under,
            percentage
            off,
            etc.).
            I'm
            not
            saying
            it's

            Actually
            it's
            pretty
            nice
            for
            electrical
            bugs
            all
            things
            considered.
            The
            C6
            added
            more,
            and
            the
            C7
            will
            be
            a
            nightmare
            for
            electrical
            issues
            as
            it
            starts
            to
            show
            it's
            age.
            Other
            than
            the
            troublesome
            early
            97-00
            ABS
            and
            SWPS
            parts
            you
            can't
            replace,
            the
            C5
            is
            actually
            pretty
            simple
            in
            terms
            of
            electrical
            stuff
            and
            should
            hold
            up
            to
            time
            very
            well.

            Good.
            I'd
            love
            to
            have
            a
            77"
            OLED
            in
            my
            little
            theater
            room
            I'm
            working
            on
            instead
            of
            a
            projector
            with
            a
            120"
            display.
            Freaking
            OLED's
            have
            absolutely
            ruined
            me
            for
            viewing
            on
            anything
            else.

            Older
            Mitsubishi
            model.....I
            forget
            which
            one.
            It's
            decent
            but
            1080
            and
            the
            picture
            just
            doesn't
            compare.
            I
            figure
            a
            77"
            OLED
            on
            the
            wall
            in
            a
            DARK
            room
            will
            be
            more
            immersive
            than
            a
            120"
            projection
            with
            washed
            out
            colors.

            All
            the
            freaking
            time.
            I'm
            in
            a
            job
            where
            the

            of
            my
            counterparts
            have
            engineering
            degrees,
            but
            here's
            simple
            old
            me
            who
            worked
            his
            way
            up
            and
            got
            here

            work
            ethic,
            mettle,
            and
            a
            little
            bit
            of
            smarts.
            There
            are
            times
            when
            I
            absolutely
            don't
            feel
            qualified
            to
            have
            the
            job
            I
            do.

            will

            right
            now
            is

            vs

            right
            now.

            If
            anyone
            watched
            the
            7/18
            release
            live,
            one
            of
            the
            speakers
            talked
            about
            how
            moving
            to
            a
            mid
            engine
            design
            was
            a
            necessity,
            they
            had
            maximized
            what
            they
            could
            do
            with
            the
            traditional
            front
            engine
            layout
            in
            terms
            of
            performance.
            THAT
            restriction
            gave
            birth
            to
            the
            C8
            as
            we
            know
            it
            and
            not
            another
            iteration
            of
            a
            front
            engine
            Corvette.
            The
            C7
            was
            the
            last
            gasp
            for
            the
            traditional
            layout.
            And
            it
            did
            it
            well.
            Did
            it's
            success
            make
            the
            C8
            possible?
            Not
            in
            my
            opinion
            as
            it
            was
            very
            likely
            already
            in
            work
            before
            the
            C7
            made
            its
            debut.
            The
            success
            of
            the
            C7
            certainly
            helped
            the
            push
            though.

            Backstory:
            My
            wife
            and
            I
            bought
            a
            Sleep
            Number
            P7
            back
            in
            2010.
            LOVED
            it.
            Nearing
            2
            years
            ago,
            we
            upgraded
            our
            bedroom
            furniture
            to
            a
            king
            size
            suite.
            Bought
            a
            cheap
            memory
            foam
            mattress......and
            hated
            it.
            Just
            horrible.
            We
            had
            plans
            next
            year
            to
            purchase
            a
            new
            Sleep
            Number
            king
            size,
            probably
            to
            the
            tune
            of
            $3500-5000.
            Enter
            saturday.
            I
            was
            at
            work,
            it
            was
            slow,
            so
            I
            went
            to
            craigslist
            and
            just
            all
            for
            sale
            and
            started
            flipping
            through.
            Then
            I
            saw
            this.
            My
            wife
            contacted
            the
            seller
            at
            less
            than
            an
            hour
            after
            it
            was
            posted.
            Couldn't
            see
            it
            until
            today
            due
            to
            the
            sellers
            schedule.
            Then
            come
            to
            find
            out
            from
            the
            seller
            he
            had
            people
            begging
            him
            to
            let
            them
            see
            it
            first,
            rearrange
            his
            schedule,
            etc.
            MAJOR
            shout
            out
            for
            someone
            saying
            "hey,
            so
            and
            so
            is
            first,
            wait
            your
            turn."
            It's
            less
            than
            5
            years
            old
            with
            only
            about
            1.5
            years

            from
            the
            sellers
            mother.
            It's
            sat
            unused
            since.
            Spotless,
            in
            perfect
            shape,
            and
            works
            like
            a
            champ.
            $400
            My
            wife
            and
            I
            are
            SO
            happy
            right

            replace
            the
            starter.
            Gotta
            go
            back
            later
            to
            finish
            tuning
            under
            boost
            at
            about
            18-20lbs.
            Really
            encouraged
            by
            breaking
            800
            RWHP
            at
            only
            12
            PSI.
            ESPECIALLY
            considering
            this
            isn't
            a
            cobbled
            together
            fender
            exhaust
            car.
            This
            is
            a
            full
            weight
            street
            car,
            the
            ONLY
            factory
            option
            I
            no
            longer
            have
            is
            the
            F45
            shocks
            because
            the
            turbo
            pipes
            went
            right
            through
            the
            sensor
            arm.
            I'm
            really
            hopeful
            if
            my
            fuel
            system
            holds
            up
            it'll
            crack
            1000
            RWHP
            before
            seeing
            20lbs
            of
            boost.
            More
            to
            come........

            I
            wouldn't
            worry
            about
            it.
            IF
            it
            does
            give
            you
            trouble,
            you
            can
            delete
            the
            sensors
            (or
            buy
            simulators)
            and
            put
            regular
            shocks
            in.
            Sensors
            run
            a
            couple
            hundred
            bucks
            if
            memory
            serves
            me.
            So
            does
            a
            knock
            off
            GM
            Tech

            which
            you'd
            need
            to
            delete
            the
            option
            from
            the
            BCM.
            I'd
            go
            for
            the
            latter
            option
            as

            a
            LOT
            with
            a
            Tech
            II
            (ABS
            Bleed
            is
            a
            huge
            one).
            Personal
            experience.
            I
            deleted

            The

            felt
            RIGHT
            after

            Man
            there's
            some
            good
            options
            at
            40K.
            C6Z,
            clean
            low
            mileage
            C6GS,
            C7's,
            potentially
            some
            C2's
            still.
            Lots
            of
            options.
            Personally,
            if
            I
            had
            $40K.....I'd
            save
            a
            bit
            more
            and
            get
            a
            C6
            ZR1
            for
            a
            bit
            more.

            Personally,
            I'd
            go
            C6Z.
            Simply
            because
            having
            driven
            a
            C7Z,
            I
            couldn't
            get
            comfy
            in
            the
            C7.
            Knee
            was
            in
            the
            dash
            no
            matter
            what
            I
            did
            and
            I'm
            only
            6'3".
            Plus
            there's
            something
            to
            be
            said
            for
            the
            427.
            Also,
            a
            mid
            mileage
            C6Z
            can
            be
            had
            for
            $30-35K
            leaving
            some
            room
            for
            some
            good
            most,
            and
            SBE
            C6Z's
            have
            broken
            into
            the
            9's
            alone.
            There's
            so
            much
            good
            about
            that
            car.
            I
            see
            it
            being
            far
            more
            desirable
            long
            term

            Interesting.
            I
            use

            for

            and
            have
            zero
            issues.
            May
            be
            an
            age
            thing.
            These
            phones
            are
            electronic
            devices

            show
            their
            age
            differently
            and
            in
            nefarious
            ways.

            LOL!!!!!!
            We
            were
            wondering
            the
            same
            thing
            but
            didn't
            want
            to
            pry.
            Really
            inconsequential
            for
            us
            though.
            If
            she's
            haunting
            it
            she's
            not
            gonna
            want
            to
            see
            what
            we're
            going
            to
            do
            in
            it.

            I

            Nope.
            These
            were
            cut
            specifically
            for
            big
            brake
            clearance.
            They
            have
            a
            lower
            lip
            size
            of
            1"
            up
            front
            and
            2"
            out
            back
            instead

            2"
            and
            3"
            lips
            respectively.
            Even
            then,
            they're
            freaking
            TIGHT

            Frankly,
            old
            tire
            or
            not,
            it

            should
            leave
            the
            same.
            If
            they
            damaged
            it,
            that's

            tire
            they

            Between

            two.....buy
            the
            best
            car
            you
            can
            afford.
            There's
            a
            reason
            the
            C6
            was
            lovingly
            called
            the
            C5.5,
            because
            it
            was
            a
            very
            close
            evolution
            of
            the
            C5.
            The
            two
            cars
            are
            amazingly
            similar.
            The
            C6
            got
            some
            great
            styling,
            and
            a
            markedly
            better
            interior
            than
            the
            C5.
            But
            there's
            something
            to
            be
            said
            for
            the
            C5
            and
            it's
            hideaway
            headlights,
            smooth
            curves,
            and
            lack
            of
            sharp
            angles.
            Figure
            out
            what
            you
            can
            spend,
            and
            find
            the
            best
            car
            for
            the
            money.
            IF
            you
            can
            afford
            it,
            an
            LS3
            equipped
            C6
            would
            be
            my
            choice
            (2008+),
            and
            I'm
            a
            C5
            guy
            saying
            that.

            Car
            was
            at
            the
            tuners
            two
            weeks
            ago.
            Going
            fine,
            tuned
            to
            some
            really
            good
            numbers
            on
            the
            wastegates.
            Then.....the
            starter
            broke.
            Flat

            to
            my
            buddies
            barn,
            replace
            starter.....nothing.
            Some
            more
            tinkering,
            then
            boom,
            that
            starter
            broke.
            Pulled
            the
            plugs
            and
            found
            that
            the
            motor
            was
            hydrolocked.
            METHANOL.
            Something
            in
            my
            meth
            injection
            system,
            likely
            the
            pump
            because
            it
            was
            VERY
            old
            and
            leaking
            heavily
            from
            the
            head,
            failed,
            and
            it
            kept
            running
            after
            the
            last
            dyno
            pull.
            This
            was
            discovered
            yesterday.
            I
            was
            absolutely
            beside
            myself.
            Got
            home,
            couldn't
            take
            it,
            so
            I
            went
            out
            and
            got
            a
            new
            starter
            (third
            one)
            and
            replaced
            it,
            then
            compression
            tested
            the
            motor.
            Came
            back
            good
            surprisingly.
            But
            I
            wasn't
            holding
            my
            breath
            until
            it
            ran.
            This
            video
            was
            started
            about
            30
            seconds
            after
            it
            was
            lit
            off
            for
            the
            first
            time.
            She's
            good
            to
            go
            it
            seems.

            Yeah,

            completely
            unrelated
            as
            they're
            divorced,
            cut
            my
            father
            out
            about
            six
            months
            later.
            Neither
            of
            them
            has
            given
            a
            damn
            about
            me
            for
            the
            past
            two
            plus
            decades
            and
            after
            some
            terse
            conversations
            I
            said
            enough
            is
            enough
            and
            quit
            contacting
            them
            (I'm
            over
            40
            by
            the
            way).
            I
            have
            been
            the
            sole
            person
            to
            reach
            out
            to
            either
            ever
            since
            leaving
            home,
            neither
            ever
            reached
            out
            to
            me.
            Sad
            part
            is
            my
            kids
            aren't
            going
            to
            know
            their
            grandparents
            on
            my
            side.
            My
            oldest
            recently
            started
            asking
            and
            I've
            slowly
            been
            explaining
            things
            to
            him
            and
            why
            he's
            unlikely
            to
            know
            either
            of
            them.

            I'm
            really
            pulled
            different
            directions
            on
            this.
            On
            the
            one
            side,
            that
            was
            savage
            af
            and
            I
            initially
            lost
            it
            when
            I
            first
            saw
            the
            clip.
            Then
            I
            looked
            closer.
            It
            almost
            looks
            staged
            because
            of
            how
            decked
            out
            in
            Giants
            gear
            the
            kid
            is.
            But......
            As
            a
            dad,
            seeing
            the
            dejection
            in
            the
            kids
            face
            pisses
            me
            off.
            He
            obviously
            recognized
            DLaw,
            he's
            holding
            a
            Cowboys
            towel.
            The
            kid
            can
            root
            for
            who
            he
            wants,
            but
            giving
            benefit
            to
            doubt
            (mainly
            about
            parents
            pushing
            him
            into
            it
            for
            profit,
            etc),
            what
            if
            he's
            just
            a
            kid
            who
            loves
            the
            game
            and
            happens
            to
            like
            one
            team/player
            more
            than
            most?
            Don't
            do
            the
            kid
            like
            that
            man.

            Probably.

            The
            BIGGEST
            thing
            you
            need
            to
            look
            for
            on
            a
            potential
            purchase
            of
            a
            C5
            (anything
            with
            an
            LS
            motor
            actually)
            is
            front
            crank
            pulley
            wobble.
            There
            are
            an
            outer
            ring
            and
            an
            inner
            hub
            bonded
            with
            a
            rubber
            insulator
            between
            them
            that
            degrades
            over
            time
            and
            the
            two
            metal
            pieces
            begin
            to
            separate.
            This
            causes
            the
            pulley
            to
            wobble,
            and
            causes
            anything
            from
            belt
            chirping
            up
            to
            throwing
            the
            belts.
            It's
            an
            involved
            replacement
            given
            the
            steering
            rack
            is
            directly
            in
            front
            of
            the
            pulley
            (books
            around
            4.5
            hours
            for
            the
            job).
            Besides
            that,
            they're
            solid
            cars.
            Yeah,
            they're
            20
            years
            old,
            so
            expect
            a
            little
            blemish
            or
            problem
            here
            or
            there,
            but
            there's
            not
            a
            lot
            of
            electronics
            on
            them
            to
            go
            bad,
            you're
            not
            going
            to
            find
            rust
            everywhere,
            etc.
            Even
            a
            wobbling
            balancer
            wouldn't
            be
            enough
            to
            make
            me
            walk
            away
            from
            a
            good
            buy.
            The
            motors/trans/drivelines
            are
            all
            solid
            on
            these
            cars
            and
            hold
            up
            great
            if
            taken
            care
            of.

            I
            have
            a
            2012
            SEL
            with
            just
            over
            148K
            miles
            on
            it.
            Have
            owned
            it
            for
            the

            years
            and
            56K
            miles.
            It's
            been
            a
            wonderful
            car.
            Even
            post
            fix
            I
            get
            48-50
            MPG
            highway
            only.
            I've
            done
            all
            my
            own
            maintenance
            (including
            timing
            belt)
            with
            exception
            to
            warranty
            work.
            I've
            had
            ONE
            issue
            where
            a
            fuel
            line
            under
            the
            car
            spontaneously
            disconnected
            that
            left
            me
            seeking
            a
            tow.
            Other
            than
            that
            it's
            been
            solid.
            I
            take
            as
            good
            of
            care
            as
            I
            can
            with
            it,
            but
            I
            am
            getting
            ready
            to
            have
            a
            door
            repainted
            and
            the
            hood
            replaced
            courtesy
            of
            VW
            and
            it's
            rust
            warranty.
            The
            bottom

            door
            started
            bubbling,
            and
            I
            had
            some
            minor
            rust
            starting

            hood.
            Even
            my
            dealer
            who
            looked
            at
            it
            said
            "that's
            odd,
            those
            are
            both
            really
            weird
            spots."
            Just
            follow
            your
            maintenance
            schedule
            and
            you'll
            be
            fine.
            And
            rest
            assured
            you've
            got
            a
            pretty
            solid
            warranty
            behind
            it
            too.

                  Noticed
                  it
                  Wednesday
                  night,
                  found
                  a
                  big
                  puddle
                  on
                  my
                  garage
                  floor.
                  I'd
                  only
                  driven
                  the
                  car
                  home
                  from
                  my
                  buddies
                  on
                  Saturday
                  then
                  run
                  it
                  shortly
                  for
                  the
                  kids
                  amusement
                  on
                  Wednesday
                  evening.
                  Traced
                  it
                  to
                  the
                  valve
                  cover
                  but
                  couldn't
                  figure
                  out
                  WHY
                  it
                  was
                  leaking
                  given
                  the
                  Yella
                  Terra
                  5132

                  on
                  OEM
                  covers.
                  Threw

                  grey
                  on

                  and
                  let
                  it
                  sit
                  last
                  night.
                  Figured
                  out
                  how
                  to
                  get
                  my
                  gopro
                  to
                  see
                  the
                  area
                  it
                  was
                  leaking
                  from.
                  MUCH
                  to
                  my
                  surprise
                  I
                  found
                  the
                  cause.
                  That
                  gold
                  bracket
                  for
                  my
                  turbo
                  oil
                  distribution
                  block
                  was
                  designed
                  around
                  factory
                  height
                  valve
                  covers.
                  The
                  extra
                  5/16
                  height
                  given
                  by
                  the
                  thick
                  YT
                  gaskets
                  was
                  enough
                  to
                  cause
                  just
                  enough
                  interference
                  for
                  the
                  cover
                  to
                  leak.
                  I
                  would
                  still
                  be
                  chasing
                  my
                  tail
                  had
                  not
                  put
                  my
                  GoPro
                  where
                  I
                  did
                  because
                  I
                  can't
                  see
                  the
                  interference
                  from
                  the

                  side.

                  I
                  am.
                  Surprisingly
                  so
                  because
                  I've
                  had
                  this
                  phone
                  since
                  June
                  of
                  2015
                  now
                  and
                  it's
                  been
                  flawless,
                  my
                  primary
                  phone
                  the
                  entire
                  time.
                  It's
                  been
                  case
                  kept,
                  screen
                  protected
                  the
                  entire
                  time,
                  and
                  has
                  just
                  held
                  up
                  to
                  whatever
                  I've
                  thrown
                  at
                  it.
                  I
                  find
                  myself
                  looking
                  at
                  other

                  as
                  of

                  ago,
                  and
                  I'm
                  envious
                  of
                  the
                  near
                  completely
                  encapsulating
                  front
                  display)
                  but
                  can't
                  justify
                  the
                  expense
                  when
                  I've
                  got
                  one
                  sitting
                  here
                  running
                  fine.
                  It's
                  been
                  rooted
                  and
                  on

                  of
                  2016,
                  and
                  I
                  think
                  I'm
                  going
                  to
                  install

                  to
                  see
                  if
                  I
                  can
                  freshen
                  it
                  up
                  some.
                  I'm
                  actually
                  getting
                  curious
                  as
                  to
                  how
                  long

                  LG
                  G2.
                  I
                  adored
                  that
                  phone.
                  Unfortunately
                  it
                  only
                  lasted
                  me
                  about
                  15
                  months
                  before
                  I
                  got
                  the
                  dreaded
                  dead
                  stripe
                  in
                  my
                  screen.
                  I'd
                  probably
                  still
                  be
                  using
                  that
                  one
                  if
                  it
                  had
                  held
                  up.
                  That
                  phone
                  was
                  perfect
                  IMO.

                  I've
                  looked

                  live

                  I'll
