      I
      came
      to
      reddit
      to
      post
      about
      the
      same
      thing,
      and
      yours
      first
      showed
      up.
      This
      makes
      me
      feel
      less
      alone
      in
      my
      struggles,
      as
      I
      am
      also
      young
      and
      not
      much
      of
      a
      drinker,
      yet
      lately
      it's
      been
      getting
      bad.
      It
      could
      be
      that
      maybe
      subconsciously
      you've
      been
      exposed
      to
      drinking
      as
      a
      regular
      coping
      mechanism,
      which
      it
      isn't,
      so
      that
      is
      the
      first
      thing
      your
      mind
      wanders
      to
      when
      in
      need
      of
      wanting
      to
      escape...
      Know
      that
      you
      are
      not
      alone
      in
      this
      and
      that
      being
      self
      aware
      is
      the
      best
      thing
      and
      you
      can
      take
      steps
      to
      make
      sure
      you
      don't
      fall
      into
      the
      same
      unhealthy
      habits
      that
      others
      in
      your
      family
      have
      made.
      Love
      and
      Light.

      My
      whole
      life
      I
      told
      myself
      I'd
      never
      be
      sucked
      into
      the
      faux
      glamour
      of
      alcohol.
      Three
      of
      my
      family
      members
      have
      died
      because
      of
      alcohol
      or
      health
      issues
      related
      to
      alcohol
      abuse.
      A
      few
      more
      are
      having
      major
      issues,
      including
      my
      grandma.
      Anyway.
      The
      past
      5
      months
      have
      started
      going
      downhill
      for
      me,
      internally
      at
      least.
      I
      can
      keep
      myself
      together
      during
      the
      day,
      smile
      in
      front
      of
      friends
      and
      tell
      my
      family
      I'm
      doing
      well,
      but
      at
      the
      end
      of
      the
      day
      I
      typically
      feel
      so
      empty
      and
      need
      a
      drink
      to
      fill
      it.
      I'm
      such
      a
      lightweight
      that
      it
      doesn't
      take
      much.
      I
      try
      not
      to
      drink
      more
      than
      a
      beer
      or
      two,
      or
      a
      mixed
      drink.
      But
      when
      I
      do
      consume
      more,
      I
      feel
      like
      I'm
      more
      relaxed
      and
      more
      easygoing,
      but
      I'm
      also
      more
      impulsive
      and
      loud.
      I've
      been
      starting
      fights
      with
      my
      partner,
      over
      stupid,
      petty
      things
      that
      I
      can't
      say
      sober,
      or
      coming
      home
      drunk
      and
      thinking
      I'm
      okay
      to
      drive
      when
      in
      reality
      I'm
      probably
      not.
      And
      that's
      scary.
      My
      partner
      gets
      worried
      that
      I
      won't
      come
      back
      home
      one
      of
      these
      nights,
      and
      that
      worry
      is
      expressed
      as
      fear,
      so
      they
      raise
      their
      voice,
      and
      I
      end
      up
      raising
      mine.
      Nobody
      wins
      and
      everyone
      is
      a
      little
      more
      heartbroken
      than
      before.
      To
      make
      things
      worse,
      I
      work
      at
      a
      bar
      that
      is
      very
      lenient
      and
      I
      have
      customers
      that
      will
      just
      buy
      everyone
      a
      drink
      on
      slow
      nights.
      So
      it
      seems
      socially
      acceptable
      for
      a
      young
      person
      to
      drink,
      no
      big
      deal.
      However
      it's
      been
      going
      on
      almost
      every
      night
      since
      I
      turned
      22.
      I've
      become
      a
      mild
      alcoholic,
      in
      a
      sense.
      I
      hate
      this
      part
      of
      me.
      I
      hate
      that
      my
      whole
      family
      is
      addicted
      to
      this
      poison
      and
      I
      don't
      want
      to
      fall
      down
      the
      same
      rabbit
      hole.
      I
      know
      what
      it
      does
      to
      people,
      and
      I
      don't
      want
      to
      keep
      causing
      (needless)
      drama
      and
      chaos
      and
      harm.
      I
      feel
      like
      I'm
      becoming
      disrespectful
      to
      myself
      in
      a
      way,
      as
      I'm
      self
      aware
      but
      don't
      try
      to
      stop
      much.
      I
      go
      a
      few
      days
      sober
      and
      then
      fall
      back
      down
      again.
      I'm
      starting
      therapy
      next
      week
      so
      maybe
      I
      can
      have
      someone
      to
      talk
      to
      and
      process
      everything
      in
      a
      healthy
      manner.
      Maybe
      I
      can
      learn
      to
      communicate
      more
      adequately
      instead
      of
      just
      yelling
      at
      my
      partner.
      It's
      hard.
      I
      don't
      feel
      like
      I
      have
      anyone
      to
      really
      talk
      to,
      I'm
      alone
      in
      a
      new
      city,
      and
      I
      keep
      so
      much
      inside.
      Nobody
      knows
      how
      much
      I
      hurt,
      not
      even
      my
      partner.
      TLTR:
      Catching
      signs
      of
      alcohol
      abuse/realizing
      I'm
      self
      medicating.

      Hey
      y'all.
      20-something
      year
      old
      female,
      who
      has
      had
      open
      relationships
      in
      the
      past,
      now
      found
      myself
      in
      a
      relationship
      dynamic
      I
      don't
      think
      is
      healthy
      for
      any
      party
      involved.
      I
      met
      my
      girlfriend
      years
      ago
      in
      a
      chat
      group
      for
      those
      with
      similar
      interests,
      and
      we
      have
      been
      friends...until
      about
      3
      days
      ago
      when
      she
      asked
      me
      to
      be
      her
      girlfriend.
      I
      ended
      an
      unhealthy
      relationship
      at
      the
      beginning
      of
      the
      year,
      did
      a
      bunch
      of
      traveling,
      all
      the
      while
      trying
      to
      make
      friends
      outside
      of
      my
      ex's
      group.
      I
      ended
      up
      meeting
      "Allen",
      a
      beautiful
      soul
      who
      has
      shown
      me
      so
      much
      in
      the
      short
      amount
      of
      time
      we
      have
      known
      one
      another.
      We
      met
      through
      a
      mutual
      friend
      last
      October
      (who
      I
      guess
      was
      dating
      him
      at
      the
      time).
      I
      figured
      we'd
      keep
      things
      chill
      and
      friendly
      especially
      if
      we
      both
      were
      in
      relationships
      and
      busy
      travelling.
      Fast
      forward.
      Me
      and
      my
      boy
      don't
      work
      out,
      and
      Allen
      has
      tried
      a
      couple
      of
      casual
      gfs,
      who
      all
      eventually
      move
      on
      or
      he
      dumps.
      We're
      still
      friends
      but
      we
      acknowledge
      an
      attraction--mental,
      physical,
      emotional.
      And
      it's
      unlike
      anything
      I
      have
      experienced.
      We
      have
      a
      real
      connection.
      I
      explain
      to
      Allen
      that
      I
      typically
      like
      girls
      so
      it's
      rare
      for
      me
      to
      be
      exclusive
      with
      a
      man.
      He
      understands.
      However,
      my
      "girlfriend"
      has
      become
      heightenedly
      obsessed
      and
      infatuated
      with
      me.
      She
      has
      a
      husband
      and
      a
      child,
      mind
      you,
      and
      is
      states
      away.
      I
      figured
      we
      would
      keep
      being
      friends
      and
      try
      out
      for
      a
      girlfriend/girlfriend
      scenario.
      I
      thought
      I
      liked
      her
      as
      much
      as
      she
      liked
      me
      but
      boy
      was
      I
      wrong.
      I
      feel
      guilty
      now,
      like
      I
      only
      want
      to
      love
      people
      because
      they
      love
      me,
      and
      I
      don't
      wanna
      make
      them
      feel
      bad.
      I
      liked
      my
      gf
      until
      a
      few
      days
      ago
      when
      she
      pushed
      to
      make
      it
      official
      because
      me
      and
      Allen
      made
      our
      situation
      more
      official.
      Now
      gf
      stalks
      me
      and
      my
      bf,
      is
      constantly
      talking
      to
      him
      about
      me
      and
      her
      obsession
      and
      jealousy
      of
      him.
      He
      mentioned
      it
      today
      and
      it
      has
      gotten
      way
      out
      of
      hand.
      He
      is
      not
      poly,
      but
      wants
      me
      to
      be
      happy
      if
      I
      like
      someone.
      I
      have
      so
      much
      guilt
      and
      regret
      for
      giving
      into
      someone's
      desires
      for
      me
      when
      I
      wasn't
      100%
      into
      it.
      TDLR:
      I
      got
      a
      new
      bf,
      my
      female
      friend
      pushed
      for
      a
      relationship
      and
      I
      gave
      it
      a
      chance,
      now
      she
      is
      going
      overboard
      with
      messaging
      and
      obsessing
      over
      both
      of
      us
      when
      she
      has
      a
      husband
      and
      son
      to
      look
      after.
      Bf
      is
      concerned
      for
      me
      and
      thinks
      she
      isn't
      heathy.
      I
      don't
      think
      so
      either.
      I
      don't
      have
      the
      heart
      to
      break
      up
      after
      3
      days.
      UPDATE:
      After
      much
      contemplation
      and
      reading
      through
      your
      guy's
      responses
      (which
      are
      greatly
      appreciated),
      I
      reached
      out
      to
      her
      to
      discuss
      my
      boundaries
      and
      that
      I
      wanted
      to
      take
      things
      slow.
      She
      was
      posting
      these
      long
      long
      posts
      about
      how
      infatuated
      she
      was
      with
      me.
      I
      explained
      to
      her
      I
      am
      not
      all
      I
      seem,
      "as
      beautiful
      as
      I
      am,
      I
      can
      be
      equally
      as
      ugly",
      and
      not
      to
      put
      me
      on
      a
      pedestal...
      and
      that
      really
      upset
      her;
      she
      got
      mad
      that
      I
      was
      "being
      manipulative"
      just
      by
      giving
      her
      a
      heads
      up
      that
      her
      actions
      were
      making
      me
      anxious.
      She
      got
      upset
      that
      I
      have
      my
      boyfriend,
      I
      respectfully
      asked
      her
      to
      tone
      it
      down
      (she
      had
      been
      spamming
      him
      with
      messages,
      told
      him
      her
      whole
      life
      story
      in
      a
      day,
      and
      I
      have
      known
      her
      for
      years
      and
      am
      aware
      of
      her
      mental
      illnesses)
      and
      of
      course,
      accused
      me
      of
      playing
      with
      her
      feelings,
      which
      was
      not
      my
      intention
      at
      all.
      At
      least
      it
      was
      a
      few
      days
      that
      we
      "dated",
      not
      a
      whole
      year
      that
      I
      "led
      her
      on".
      The
      thing
      is,
      I
      truly
      liked
      and
      love
      her,
      but
      her
      intense
      reactions
      and
      mood
      swings
      really
      caught
      me
      off
      guard.
      She
      got
      really
      harsh
      and
      aggressive
      real
      quickly;
      I
      had
      to
      block
      her
      because
      she
      kept
      texting
      me
      and
      emailing
      me
      and
      messaging
      me
      about
      how
      awful
      I
      am.
      I
      literally
      just
      asked
      her
      to
      calm
      down,
      take
      a
      step
      back
      and
      evaluate
      the
      reality
      of
      the
      situation,
      especially
      since
      I
      could
      not
      physically
      be
      near
      her...
      She
      only
      seemed
      to
      take,
      my
      energy
      and
      counsel,
      and
      my
      boyfriend
      pointed
      that
      out.
      Hours
      of
      one
      sided
      conversations
      have
      been
      the
      basis
      of
      our
      friendship,
      anyway.
      Sigh.
      I
      guess
      I
      can't
      always
      make
      people
      happy
      and
      I
      have
      learned
      from
      this
      situation.
      Update
      pt
      2:
      I
      called
      it
      off
      and
      broke
      up.
      Of
      course
      she
      feels
      I
      chose
      Allen
      over
      her,
      and
      I
      feel
      bad,
      but
      I
      would
      feel
      even
      worse
      if
      this
      dynamic
      had
      continued..

      I

      she
      suffers
      from
      mental
      illness
      and
      I

      I
      have
      talked
      with
      her
      in
      the
      past
      when
      she
      wanted
      to
      pursue
      a
      relationship,
      and
      I
      wasn't
      ready.
      She
      got
      really
      upset
      and
      confused
      with
      me,
      as
      we
      had
      been
      talking.
      I
      like
      her
      and
      love
      her,
      but
      I
      feel
      like
      I
      can
      only
      focus
      on
      one
      relstionship
      right
      now,
      and
      frankly,
      I
      have
      let
      her
      know
      she
      comes
      off
      too
      strong
      at
      times.
      I
      get
      it...
      So
      do
      I.
      It's
      just
      I
      have
      never
      seen
      this
      jealous
      side
      of
      her
      or
      this
      extreme
      manic
      side
      until
      I
      told
      her
      about
      my
      new
      bf,
      then
      she
      immediately
      was
      asking
      to
      make
      me
      her
      gf.
      I
      figured,
      "let's
      try,
      you've
      been
      pursuing
      me
      for
      quite
      some
      time,
      I
      care
      for
      you
      and
      want
      to
      see
      you
      happy."
      Now
      I
      am
      uncomfortable,
      mostly
      with
      her
      massaging
      my
      bf
      constantly
      because
      he
      is
      a
      busy
      guy,
      and
      cannot
      always
      respond.
      She
      is
      an
      agoraphobic,
      stay-at-home
      mom
      and
      gets
      upset
      if
      I
      don't
      even
      message
      or
      call
      her
      back
      right
      away.
      I
      do
      my
      best
      to
      be
      compassionate.
      I
      suppose
      I
      need
      to
      reinstate
      some
      solid
      boundaries
      so
      we
      are
      all
      on
      the
      same
      page...

      Yeah...
      Planning
      on
      having
      a
      talk
      today.
      She
      has
      made
      this
      huge
      social
      media
      posts
      about
      us,
      about
      me.
      Lol
      and
      3
      days
      later,
      here
      I
      am,
      breaking
      up
      with
      her...the
      world
      can
      see
      it...
      This
      is
      why
      I
      always
      try
      to
      keep
      my
      personal
      relationships
      PERSONAL
      for
      a
      reason.
      I
      guess
      I
      am
      selfish
      either
      way.

      Hello.
      I
      guess
      I
      will
      start
      off
      by
      saying
      I
      have
      been
      looking
      through
      online
      sources,
      as
      well
      as
      this
      subreddit,
      to
      find
      some
      kind
      of
      advice
      or
      closure
      for
      my
      situation.
      My
      situation
      is
      very
      unique,
      and
      I
      cannot
      seem
      to
      find
      any
      one
      resource
      to
      give
      me
      advice,
      and
      I
      am
      trying
      to
      put
      the
      pieces
      together.
      My
      Significant
      Other
      and
      I
      live
      in
      a
      large
      city,
      both
      far
      away
      from
      family.
      We
      had
      planned
      to
      move
      out
      of
      state
      to
      live
      with
      my
      mother
      and
      grandmother--however,
      my
      grandmother
      passed
      away
      last
      month
      while
      we
      visited
      to
      take
      care
      of
      her.
      This
      was
      supposed
      to
      help
      slowly
      transition
      to
      moving,
      as
      our
      lease
      ended
      at
      the
      end
      of
      March.
      Because
      of
      my
      grandmother's
      death,
      my
      mother
      no
      longer
      wanted
      us
      to
      really
      stay,
      nor
      did
      we
      have
      jobs
      lined
      up
      (as
      I
      was
      supposed
      to
      be
      my
      grandmothers
      caregiver,
      full-time.)
      We
      have
      been
      having
      problems
      with
      having
      stable
      income,
      so
      I
      have
      been
      working
      longer
      shifts
      to
      compensate
      for
      it.
      He
      had
      lost
      his
      job
      prior
      to
      the
      death
      of
      my
      grandmother,
      so
      he
      stopped
      working
      before
      our
      plans
      fell
      through
      (more
      on
      this
      later).
      This
      brings
      me
      to
      the
      "unique-ness"
      of
      our
      situation:
      I
      am
      a
      professional
      dancer/entertainer
      at
      a
      night
      club,
      and
      he
      makes
      artwork
      on
      the
      side.
      I
      have
      been
      very
      supportive
      of
      him
      trying
      to
      make
      his
      art
      into
      an
      actual
      company,
      and
      I
      support
      his
      dreams.
      I
      invest
      in
      supplies
      for
      him,
      even
      though
      we
      don't
      have
      much,
      and
      I
      do
      my
      best
      to
      encourage
      him
      while
      we
      try
      to
      get
      back
      on
      our
      feet.
      One
      big
      that
      has
      been
      emotionally
      and
      physically
      draining
      is
      that
      he
      has
      not
      tried
      to
      get
      a
      job
      since
      losing
      his
      previous
      one.
      His
      art
      right
      now
      is
      not
      bringing
      in
      as
      much
      income
      as
      it
      would
      if
      he
      had
      another
      source
      of
      income
      (a.k.a.
      a
      job).
      The
      thing
      is,
      he
      does
      NOT
      want
      to
      work.
      He
      does
      NOT
      want
      to
      try
      to
      find
      a
      job.
      He
      just
      assumes
      every
      one
      is
      going
      to
      deny
      him.
      I
      am
      starting
      to
      notice
      patterns
      of
      laziness,
      and
      it
      might
      stem
      from
      depression
      and
      housing
      with
      a
      roommate
      who
      is
      not
      particularly
      clean
      nor
      organized,
      but
      then
      again,
      he
      has
      been
      showing
      signs
      since
      4
      months
      ago.
      He
      was
      always
      late
      to
      work,
      would
      never
      cover
      people's
      shifts
      even
      though
      they
      always
      covered
      him,
      and
      he
      would
      complain
      and
      say
      it
      was
      not
      worth
      the
      commute
      (which
      in
      hindsight,
      it
      was
      not,
      but
      he
      very
      well
      could
      have
      been
      looking
      for
      another
      closer
      job).
      He
      ended
      up
      getting
      fired
      when
      I
      went
      to
      go
      visit
      my
      grandma
      early
      March,
      before
      she
      passed.
      He
      was
      to
      fly
      in
      days
      later
      to
      help
      me
      out
      with
      grandma,
      and
      we
      would
      fly
      back
      to
      our
      city
      together.
      But
      while
      I
      was
      out
      of
      state,
      we
      agreed
      he'd
      work
      more
      shifts
      and
      try
      to
      make
      some
      extra
      money
      since
      I
      would
      be
      gone.
      He
      pretty
      much
      just
      slept
      through
      his
      alarm
      and
      all
      the
      phone
      calls
      from
      me
      and
      his
      previous
      manager.
      As
      for
      me
      and
      my
      job,
      it
      causes
      so
      many
      issues.
      I
      make
      pretty
      decent
      money,
      but
      not
      enough
      to
      keep
      us
      afloat.
      I
      used
      to
      be
      a
      "model"
      and
      "cam
      girl"
      of
      sorts
      before
      dating
      him,
      and
      that
      was
      some
      more
      passive
      income
      on
      top
      of
      my
      dancing.
      Since
      getting
      more
      serious
      into
      our
      relationship
      (we
      are
      8
      months
      in),
      I
      have
      had
      to
      quit
      my
      internet
      work
      and
      modeling,
      which
      not
      only
      has
      taken
      a
      toll
      on
      my
      wallet,
      but
      also
      my
      self
      esteem.
      I
      have
      had
      to
      cut
      off
      friendships
      with
      other
      sex
      workers
      because
      he
      feels
      like
      they
      influence
      me
      or
      he
      gets
      jealous
      because
      I
      have
      connection
      to
      certain
      friends.
      I
      feel
      like
      a
      possession
      and
      that
      I
      am
      not
      worthy,
      if
      that
      makes
      any
      sense...
      I
      don't
      work
      that
      often.
      I
      used
      to
      work
      30-35
      hours
      a
      week,
      be
      solid,
      but
      now
      it's
      barely
      20
      hours.
      Maybe
      15
      hours,
      if
      that.
      Every
      night
      I
      come
      home,
      it
      just
      turns
      into
      a
      big
      argument
      and
      he
      talks
      down
      to
      me
      about
      my
      job.
      Then
      he
      compares
      the
      fact
      that
      I
      make
      more
      money
      than
      him
      and
      I
      sometimes
      hold
      it
      over
      his
      head...
      It
      doesn't
      help
      that
      he
      drinks
      often,
      which
      is
      another
      issues
      altogether,
      but
      it
      definitely
      fuels
      his
      resentment
      towards
      me
      and
      my
      job
      that
      I
      have
      had
      since
      before
      meeting
      him.
      Dancing
      has
      been
      very
      convenient
      in
      terms
      of
      a
      flexible
      schedule,
      and
      I
      like
      to
      travel,
      and
      have
      been
      traveling
      more
      since
      I
      had
      to
      attend
      my
      grandmothers
      funeral,
      out
      of
      state.
      I
      also
      have
      some
      re-occurring
      injuries
      and
      back
      pains,
      so
      it
      helps
      when
      I
      can
      take
      time
      off
      and
      give
      myself
      some
      care.
      I
      have
      been
      looking
      for
      a
      steady
      day
      time
      job
      to
      slowly
      transition
      out
      of
      dancing,
      but
      I
      am
      also
      trying
      to
      finish
      my
      Associates
      degree
      this
      year.
      I
      really
      need
      the
      money
      to
      get
      through
      school.
      My
      SO
      has
      no
      interest
      in
      trying
      to
      go
      back
      to
      school,
      but
      says
      he
      supports
      me.
      If
      he
      truly
      supported
      me,
      he
      would
      understand
      that
      my
      job
      is
      just
      a
      job,
      not
      any
      reason
      to
      go
      behind
      his
      back,
      or
      "cheat"
      on
      his,
      as
      he
      often
      says.
      I
      am
      so
      tired
      of
      trying
      to
      defend
      myself
      and
      my
      work,
      just
      to
      be
      talked
      down
      on
      and
      feel
      unappreciated
      and
      shamed.
      I
      don't
      tell
      anyone
      about
      this.
      I
      can't.
      Recently,
      as
      of
      this
      past
      week,
      my
      mother
      invited
      us
      to
      live
      with
      her.
      She
      has
      been
      having
      issues
      coping
      with
      loneliness
      and
      grieving,
      and
      she
      wanted
      some
      help
      with
      rent.
      I
      am
      still
      down
      to
      move
      out
      of
      state
      and
      start
      fresh,
      to
      heal
      any
      animosity
      between
      my
      mother
      and
      I.
      I
      want
      be
      closer
      to
      family,
      but
      my
      SO
      doesn't
      like
      my
      mother
      since
      she
      changed
      plans
      on
      us
      after
      the
      funeral.
      He
      doesn't
      trust
      her.
      She
      kind
      of
      screwed
      us
      over,
      since
      we
      had
      planned
      for
      5
      months
      to
      move
      in
      with
      her
      and
      my
      grandma,
      and
      our
      lease
      ended
      at
      the
      end
      of
      March
      when
      we
      got
      back
      from
      out
      of
      state.
      So
      now
      we
      are
      staying
      with
      a
      friend,
      trying
      to
      get
      back
      on
      our
      feet,
      with
      just
      me
      working.
      But
      I
      feel
      like
      I
      am
      at
      the
      end
      of
      my
      rope,
      and
      I
      am
      completely
      open
      to
      living
      with
      my
      mother,
      even
      if
      it
      is
      just
      for
      a
      few
      months.
      I
      kind
      of
      just
      want
      to
      go,
      and
      I
      don't
      really
      care
      right
      now
      if
      he
      comes
      with
      me.
      I
      am
      feeling
      smothered,
      dragged
      down,
      and
      used.
      I
      don't
      know
      what
      to
      do.

      I
      think
      it
      would
      help
      a
      lot
      to
      connect
      with
      others
      maybe
      experiencing
      similar
      things.
      Sorry
      if
      this
      is
      all
      too
      long,
      I
      hope
      I
      communicated
      my
      situation
      adequately.
      **TL;DR:
      My
      SO
      and
      I
      are
      having
      issues
      surrounding
      my
      job
      as
      a
      club
      dancer,
      but
      he
      does
      not
      have
      a
      job
      nor
      has
      tried
      to
      get
      one.
      I
      am
      actively
      looking
      for
      new
      work,
      he
      is
      not,
      although
      he
      makes
      and
      sells
      art
      occasionally.
      We
      have
      an
      opportunity
      to
      move
      in
      with
      my
      mother
      and
      start
      fresh,
      but
      he
      doesn't
      want
      to
      go
      due
      to
      previous
      issues
      with
      potential
      living
      situations
      with
      my
      mother.
      I
      think
      I
      should
      be
      closer
      to
      family
      and
      start
      fresh
      and
      get
      back
      on
      my
      feet
      and
      finish
      school.
      I
      need
      a
      second
      opinion/advice,
      thank
      you.**

      Thank
      you
      for
      the
      resources!
      I
      consider
      myself
      a
      Sex
      worker,
      just
      different
      from
      a
      full
      service
      worker.
      So
      these
      subreddits
      are
      helpful.

      If
      I
      don't
      work,
      we
      won't
      be
      able
      to
      save
      up
      money
      to
      get
      where
      we
      need
      to
      be
      in
      life...

      I'm
      no
      doctor
      in
      any
      sense...
      but
      just
      from
      experience,
      it
      has
      helped
      my
      depression
      and
      my
      mild
      psychosis
      episodes.
      Some
      states
      have
      clinical
      trials
      for
      ketamine
      treatments
      and
      I
      am
      trying
      to
      get
      into
      one.
      Just
      be
      safe
      and
      hopefully
      you
      can
      find
      a
      clinic
      that
      will
      help
      you.

      Are
      we
      the
      same
      person?
      Lol.
      All
      joking
      aside,
      I
      can
      definitely
      relate
      and
      empathize
      with
      your
      current
      situation.
      I
      have
      two
      names
      that
      trigger
      me,
      and
      I
      immediately
      lose
      my
      cool
      after
      hearing
      them
      or
      even
      meeting
      someone
      with
      the
      same
      name.
      I
      have
      had
      some
      time
      to
      cope
      with
      the
      trauma
      associated
      with
      the
      names,
      and
      it
      does
      get
      easier
      with
      time.
      Although
      my
      trigger
      names
      are
      not
      someone
      currently
      in
      my
      life,
      I
      am
      in
      a
      similar
      situation
      and
      do
      find
      it
      extremely
      hard
      to
      have
      someone
      still
      in
      my
      partner's
      life
      who
      had
      once
      been
      romantically
      involved
      with
      him.
      Even
      if
      they
      don't
      talk
      every
      day,
      it
      is
      still
      painful
      to
      know
      that
      they
      are
      in
      each
      other's
      lives,
      regardless
      of
      your
      feelings.
      It
      really
      sucks,
      but
      please
      please
      do
      not
      hurt
      yourself
      over
      this
      situation.
      Comparing
      yourself
      to
      another
      person
      will
      only
      dig
      you
      deeper,
      and
      even
      if
      you
      don't
      believe
      it
      right
      now,
      you
      ARE
      worthy
      of
      love
      and
      respect,
      especially
      from
      yourself.
      No
      one
      else
      is
      better
      than
      you.
      You
      do
      not
      have
      to
      have
      this
      girl
      in
      your
      life
      or
      even
      be
      friends
      with
      her.
