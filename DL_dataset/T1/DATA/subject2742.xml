      Just
      happened
      here.
      Feels
      at

      like
      you #8217;re
      being
      shaken
      back
      and
      forth
      like
      maybe
      in
      a
      washing
      machine.
      Then
      sometimes
      like
      yesterday
      it #8217;s
      more
      like
      being
      on
      a
      boat
      in
      the
      ocean
      over
      waves.
      Your
      eyes
      usually
      dont
      see
      thing
      moving
      so
      it #8217;s

      about
      three
      months
      ago
      at
      a
      test

      loved
      it.
      I
      had
      to
      keep
      my
      mouth
      shut
      while
      everyone
      as
      trashing
      it,
      deep
      down
      knowing
      how
      much
      my
      girlfriend
      and
      I
      enjoyed
      it.
      I #8217;m
      so
      happy
      it
      is
      getting
      love.

      I
      went

      Ireland
      twice
      this

      and
      started
      looking

      there,
      I
      love
      it
      so
      much.
      Sadly
      no

      Overpriced
      but
      really
      fun
      the
      past
      few
      times
      I #8217;ve
      went.
      Really
      though
      my
      favorite
      place
      in
      Ireland
      is
      McGanns
      pub
      in
      Doolin.
      Incredible
      local
      music
      with
      great
      food,
      and
      you
      can
      sleep
      above
      the
      pub
      using
      AirBnb.
      Oh,
      and
      a
      15
      minute
      drive
      from
      the
      Cliffs
      of
      Moher.

      Definitely
      his
      weakest
      and
      least
      organized,
      it
      felt
      pretty
      sloppy

      in
      a
      way
      that
      you
      can
      tell
      a
      master
      was
      holding
      the
      reigns.
      I
      got
      bored
      at
      times
      but
      overall
      still
      better
      than
      most
      films
      this
      year.

      I #8217;m
      terrified
      of
      flying
      yet
      I #8217;m
      taking
      my
      third
      trip
      overseas.
      I
      use
      a
      combination
      of
      Xanax
       #8220;before
      takeoff #8221;
      then
      Ambien
      once
      at
      altitude.
      The
      Xanax
      made
      me
      care
      about
      nothing
      so
      even
      during
      takeoff
      I #8217;m
      just
      chill.
      The
      ambien
      kept
      me
      asleep
      for
      8
      hours

      Everyone
      reacts
      different
      but
      for
      me,
      no.
      After
      about
      1/2
      hr
      of
      taking
      it
      I
      just
      start
      to
      feel
      super
      tired
      and
      relaxed.
      I
      just
      don #8217;t
      care.
      I
      still
      feel
      like
      me,
      no
      dizziness,
      no
      change

      I
      previewed
      things
      really,
      I
      just
      care
      less
      and
      I #8217;m
      tired.
      Helps
      a
      LOT.
      Before
      a
      friend
      turned
      me
      onto
      it
      every
      flight
      was
      a
      nightmare.

      I #8217;d

      I #8217;m

      at

      170
      I
      knew
      it
      wouldn #8217;t
      be
      180
      so
      I
      said
      160.
      I
      hit
      that
      last
      month
      and
      decided
      150
      because
      im
      so
      close.
      I
      hit
      150
      this
      morning.
      My
      final
      guess
      (aided
      with
      a
      fat
      caliper)
      is
      140.
      The
      thing
      is,
      even
      before
      you
      hit
      that
      goal
      you #8217;re
      going
      to
      feel
      so
      goddamn
      good
      as
      the
      weight
      starts
      to
      leave
      and
      clothes
      fit
      better.
      And
      as
      someone
      who
      was
      massively
      overweight
      I
      couldn #8217;t
      stop
      the
      junk.
      I
      won #8217;t
      lie,
      two
      years
      on
      and
      I
      still
      look
      at
      chocolate
      like
      I
      want
      to
      have
      sex
      with
      it.
      It
      doesn #8217;t
      go
      away,
      I
      just
      only
      allow
      myself
      a
      binge
      every
      two
      to
      three
      weeks.
      Knowing
      I
      can
      have
      a
      cheat
      meal
      makes
      dieting
      super
      easy

      Damn
      that

      sounds

      surprising

      good
      healthy
      food
      can

      I
      didn #8217;t
      fly
      until
      2017
      because
      of
      anxiety.
      A
      friend
      gave
      me
      some
      Xanax
      and
      I
      took
      one.
      Now
      I
      can #8217;t
      fly
      without
      it,
      it #8217;s
      my
      magic
      pill.
      I
      have
      an
      11
      flight
      in
      two
      weeks

      Tomorrow
      I
      fly
      into
      Ireland
      for
      my
      third
      time
      in
      18
      months,
      I
      absolutely
      love
      it
      there.
      I
      started
      researching
      how
      to
      emigrate
      there
      but
      sadly
      I
      discovered
      I
      can #8217;t
      without
      being
      part
      of
      a
      desired
      field
      of
      work,
      so
      I #8217;ll
      just
      have
      to
      make
      due
      with
      my
      visits.
      Ireland
      feels
      like
      a
      second
      home
      to
      me.

      I
      always
      took
      it
      as
      deforestation.
      Kids
      playing
      in
      old
      forested
      pretending
      it
      to
      be
      haunted.
      The
      trees
      wanted
      that
      but
      were
      cut
      down.
