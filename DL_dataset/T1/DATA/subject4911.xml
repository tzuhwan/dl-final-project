      It #8217;s

      harness!
      I #8217;m
      not
      a

      Even
      breakaway

      for

      cats.
      My

      had
      a
      kitten
      nearly
      hang
      herself
      on
      a
      breakaway
      collar
      because

      weight
      to
      break
      it
      open,
      so
      when
      cats
      are
      young,
      I
      just
      go
      with
      a

      I
      could

      of

      so
      much
      to

      What
      doopsloot
      means
      by

      info
      is
      that
      your
      only
      hope
      is
      your
      friend
      having
      a
      PowerUp
      Rewards
      account
      with
      Gamestop.
      If
      they
      do
      AND
      they
      used
      it
      on
      that

      it
      will
      be
      in
      their
      transaction
      history.
      Then
      you
      can
      contact
      customer

      (usually
      connected
      with

      sure
      you
      have
      the
      information
      attached
      to
      that
      PUR

      they #8217;ll
      likely
      ask
      questions
      to

      I
      don #8217;t
      know
      why
      the
      concept
      of
      instant
      depreciation
      confuses
      so
      many
      customers.
      We
      all
      know
      its
      frustrating,
      but
      even
      if
      you
      just
      opened
      it
      (didn #8217;t
      even
      take
      the
      game
      out
      or
      play
      it),
      there
      no
      way
      we
      can
      take
      it
      back
      in
      for
      the
      full
      amount
      and
      resell
      it
      as
      brand
      new.
      Same
      thing
      with
      systems.
      How
      upset
      would
      you
      be
      if
      you
      bought
      a
       #8220;new #8221;
      system
      or
      game
      and
      opened
      it
      and
      it
      had
      obviously
      been
      used
      before?

      I
      mean...
      there #8217;s
      a
      small
      chance
      that
      he
      could
      call
      the
      store
      he
      bought
      it
      from
      and
      explain
      the
      situation.
      If
      he
      can
      tell
      them
      the
      day
      he
      bought
      it,
      the
      approximate
      time,
      and
      the
      register
      he
      was
      at
      (usually
      a
       #8220;the
      middle
      one #8221;
      or
       #8220;the
      one
      closest
      to
      the
      door #8221;
      is
      good
      enough),
      there #8217;s
      a
      chance
      they
      can
      find
      the
      transaction.
      I
      know
      my
      store
      would
      try
      their
      darndest
      to
      help
      but
      not
      every
      store
      will
      be
      the
      same.
      But
      it #8217;s
      always
      worth
      a
      good
      try!

      I
      feel
      you.
      Things
      that
      used
      to
      make
      me
      so
      happy
      (bookstores,
      new
      art
      supplies,
      etc.)
      just
      don #8217;t
      anymore.
      It #8217;s
      always
      hard
      the
      first
      time
      you
      realize
      that.
      I #8217;m
      getting
      back
      to
      forcing
      myself
      to
      pretend
      I #8217;m
      happy
      about
      them
      anyways.
      Maybe
      one
      day
      it #8217;ll
      be
      genuine
      again.
      Hope
      things
      start
      looking
      up
      for
      you.

      I
      push
      baby
      after
      sorting
      cosmetics
      and
      the
      baby
      section
      is
      always
      equally
      disgusting.
      The
      strollers/car
      seats
      section
      seems
      like
      the
      graveyard
      for
      the
      empty
      boxes
      of
      thefts
      past.

      It
      definitely
      is
      exhausting.
      To
      be
      honest,
      I
      don #8217;t
      have
      much
      of
      a
      friend
      group
      at
      the
      moment
      (many
      of
      them
      graduated
      college
      and
      are
      all
      doing
      their
      own
      thing),
      so
      I
      don #8217;t
      have
      to
      do
      much
      pretending
      for
      others,
      which
      helps.
      I
      mostly
      try
      to
      pretend
      for
      myself,
      so
      if
      I
      just
      can #8217;t
      do
      it
      on
      any
      given
      day,
      no
      one
      notices
      but
      me.
      I
      also
      make
      compromises
      with
      myself.
      I
      /want/
      to
      stay
      home
      in
      bed
      and
      watch
      Youtube.
      I
      /used/
      to
      go
      to
      coffee
      shops
      and
      draw
      or
      write.
      So
      sometimes,
      I
      get
      myself
      to
      go
      to
      a
      coffee
      shop
      and
      watch
      Youtube
      on
      my
      laptop
      and
      enjoy
      being
      out.
      I
      know
      it #8217;s
      more
      likely
      that
      I #8217;ll
      convince
      myself
      to
      do
      that
      than
      go
      100%.
      You
      should
      try
      that
      sometime!

      In
      the
      end,
      he #8217;s
      right.
      It
      is
      up
      to
      you.
      That #8217;s
      something
      that
      I #8217;m
      trying
      to
      learn
      as
      well.
      If
      we
      give
      up
      on
      ourselves
      and
      expect
      other
      people
      to
      fix
      our
      lives
      for
      us,
      we #8217;re
      always
      going
      to
      be
      left
      disappointed.
      Are
      you
      actively
      taking
      baby
      steps
      towards
      getting
      better?
      Therapy?
      Medication?
      Maybe
      self-help
      books
      (I
      know
      that
      sounds
      dumb,
      but
      I
      have
      some
      for
      BPD
      and
      they #8217;ve
      actually
      been
      helpful).

      If
      money
      isn #8217;t
      a
      huge
      issue,
      you
      could
      always
      consider
      some
      medicinal
      genotyping
      tests.
      It
      gives
      you
      and
      your
      doctor
      insight
      into
      what
      medications
      may
      be
      more
      effective
      for
      you
      instead
      of
      dabbling
      in
      a
      bunch
      and
      wasting
      your
      time.
      It
      looks
      at
      how
      your
      body
      metabolizes
      various
      drugs
      and
      will
      tell
      you
      if
      your
      body
      is
      too
      slow
      or
      fast
      to
      metabolize
      it
      (because
      this
      makes
      the
      drug
      less
      effective).
      It #8217;s
      not
      crazy
      expensive,
      I
      believe.
      But
      definitely
      not
      the
      cheapest.
      Otherwise,
      medication
      is
      definitely
      worth
      a
      try.
      Most
      people
      don #8217;t
      respond
      to
      JUST
      therapy
      or
      JUST
      medication.
      It
      usually
      takes
      a
      good
      balance
      of
      both
      to
      get
      to
      a
      place
      where
      you
      can
      focus
      on
      healing
      and
      growing
      instead
      of
      just
      surviving.

      A
      lot
      of
      them
      focus
      on
      mindfulness
      and
      meditation,
      so
      you
      have
      to
      go
      into
      it
      with
      an
      open
      mind.
      Look
      into
      workbooks.
      Give
      them
      a
      chance
      and
      don #8217;t
      give
      up
      too
      quickly.
      Also,
      if
      you
      find
      a
      regular
      therapist
      or
      psychiatrist,
      they
      can
      vouch
      for
      you
      and
      discuss
      medication
      with
      your
      parents
      if
      you #8217;re
      under
      18.
      They #8217;ll
      be
      able
      to
      take
      your
      parents #8217;
      concerns
      and
      openly
      discuss
      it
      on
      a
      professional
      level.
      Your
      mindset
      seems
      very
      similar
      to
      my
      own
      lately #8212;
      and
      to
      be
      honest,
      the
      only
      thing
      I #8217;ve
      found
      that
      really
      has
      helped
      me
      has
      been
      a
      balance
      of
      medication
      and
      Dialectical
      Behavioral
      Therapy.
      Good
      luck!

      you.
      So
      for
      now,
      keep
      on
      surviving
      until
      you

      I
      feel
      you.
      You #8217;re
      not
      alone.
      But
      that #8217;s
      what
      we #8217;re
      all
      here
      for.
      We #8217;re
      all
      struggling,
      but
      want
      to
      help
      each
      other.
      Think
      about
      how
      many
      bad
      days,
      weeks,
      months,
      or
      even
      years
      you #8217;ve
      had.
      They
      felt
      endless
      and
      hopeless
      right?
      Well,
      guess
      what.
      You
      survived
      those.
      So
      I
      believe
      in
      you
      when
      I
      say
      you
      can
      survive
      these
      bad
      times,
      too.
      Keep
      it
      up.
      Even
      if
      you #8217;re
      just
      surviving
      for
      now,
      that #8217;s
      enough.
      Look
      forward
      to
      a
      day
      when
      you
      can
      live
      and
      not
      just
      survive.

      Thank
      you!
      I
      regret
      that
      you
      can
      see
      the
      rainbow
      peeking
      through
      the
      space,
      but
      I #8217;m
      hoping
      that
      will
      go
      away
      when
      I
      fill
      it
      in
      for
      the
      back!

      Of
      course!
      Like
      I
      said,
      I
      don #8217;t
      know
      a
      lot
      about
      it
      when
      it
      comes
      to
      prices
      or
      requirements
      or
      anything #8212;
      I
      just
      know
      a
      close
      friend
      of
      mine
      utilized
      it
      and
      has
      been
      having
      much
      more
      luck.
      Hope
      you
      start
      feeling
      better!

      I #8217;m
      really
      sorry
      to
      hear
      that
      you
      had
      to
      deal
      with
      it,
      too.
      I
      think
      the
      worst
      thing
      is
      that
      life
      was
      so
      great
      before
      him.
      I
      grew
      up
      in
      foster
      care,
      but
      despite
      that,
      I
      had
      gotten
      basically
      a
      full
      ride
      to
      a
      university.
      I
      was
      a
      year
      away
      from
      graduating
      when
      I
      met
      him,
      and
      things
      went
      downhill.
      I
      just
      hope
      that
      I
      can
      get
      back
      on
      my
      feet
      so
      I
      can
      complete
      my
      education.
      I
      know
      it #8217;s
      likely
      a
      couple
      years
      away,
      but
      a
      girl
      can
      dream.
