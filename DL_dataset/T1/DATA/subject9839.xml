      I'm
      bad
      for
      the
      two
      of
      them.
      She
      brought
      warmth
      into
      my
      life,
      but
      my
      emotional
      baggage
      is
      a
      cruel
      thing
      to
      put
      onto
      such
      a
      wonderful
      person.
      All
      I
      want
      is
      peace.
      I
      want
      this
      rushing
      and
      buzzing
      to
      stop.
      I
      want
      to
      be
      able
      to
      sit
      down
      and
      think
      about
      my
      life
      instead
      of
      some
      fantasy
      that
      is
      blurring
      into
      the
      physical
      world.
      Maybe
      I
      want
      to
      be
      able
      to
      feel
      another
      person
      without
      getting
      sick
      to
      my
      stomach.
      Everything
      is
      fading.
      My
      family
      relationships
      are
      pretty
      much
      no
      more
      --
      why
      do
      I
      hate
      them?
      You
      shouldn't
      hate
      your
      family.
      I'm
      such
      a
      bad
      person
      for
      falling
      in
      love
      with
      my
      friend.
      I
      should
      not
      be
      feeling
      these
      urges
      and
      desires
      for
      her.
      She
      is
      dating
      another
      dear
      friend.
      I'm
      sick!
      This
      all
      just
      needs
      to
      stop.

      There
      is
      nothing
      cringe
      about
      taking
      a
      selfie
      in
      sad/awkward
      times.
      We
      share
      so
      much
      now,
      and
      who
      the
      hell
      are
      we
      to
      question
      how
      someone
      deals
      with
      pain?
      Selfies
      are
      not
      all
      about
      vanity
      --
      they
      can
      be
      about
      sharing
      for
      some
      people.
      This
      is
      how
      she
      is
      reaching
      out.

      I
      know
      the
      feel.
      I'm
      too
      much
      of
      a
      coward
      to
      do

      I
      just
      feel
      guilty
      for
      it
      --
      many
      reasons.
      It
      does
      just
      seem
      disloyal
      to
      my
      friendship,
      but
      I
      shouldn't
      have
      this
      feeling.
      This
      warm
      feeling.
      I
      don't
      deserve
      to
      love
      anyone,
      and
      I
      don't
      want
      love
      to
      be
      wasted
      on
      me
      when
      someone
      else
      could
      be
      taking
      this
      emotion
      that
      I'm
      wasting.
      But
      I
      don't
      know
      how
      to
      put
      it
      onto
      someone
      else.
      I
      can
      only
      absorb
      everyone
      and
      how
      they
      feel.
      I
      want
      to
      get
      up.
      I
      want
      to
      take
      care,
      but
      I
      lay
      in
      bed
      so
      much
      that
      I'm
      sore
      when
      I
      do
      walk
      around.
      And
      if
      I
      go
      eat
      or
      anything,
      all
      of
      these
      people
      will
      be
      all
      over
      me
      and
      trying
      to
      get
      something
      out
      of
      me
      that
      I
      don't
      have.
      I
      don't
      know
      what
      everyone
      wants,
      but
      they
      are
      loud
      about
      it!
      More
      and
      more
      they
      are
      nearly
      pressing
      down
      on
      me.
      I
      can't
      get
      any
      peace.
      I
      can't
      get
      any
      quite
      with
      all
      of
      these
      people.

      Or
      maybe
      you're
      a
      loser.
      I
      am
      too,
      but
      I'm
      not
      moaning
      in
      denial.
      I
      think
      what
      he
      said
      is
      off
      putting,
      but
      chill.
      Working
      yourself
      up
      isn't
      going
      to
      get
      you
      laid.
      Give
      up.
      Be
      alone.
      It's
      not
      that
      bad,
      man.

      It
      makes
      me
      not
      care
      about
      the
      sadness
      and
      pain
      so
      much.
      Doesn't

      it

      Makes

      not

      the
      bother.

      I
      really
      wish
      assisted
      suicide
      was
      for
      people
      going
      through
      this
      intense
      pain.
      Being
      able
      to
      go
      out
      peacefully
      sounds
      so
      nice.
      It
      seems
      cruel
      to
      me
      that
      society
      will
      not
      give
      us
      a
      way
      out.
      This
      depression
      --
      if
      I
      could
      fall
      asleep
      and
      never
      wake
      up
      again
      --
      maybe
      with
      one
      good
      friend
      by
      my
      side.
      Perfect.
      I
      don't
      think
      we
      are
      asking
      for
      a
      lot
      her.
      Just
      a
      little
      compassion.

      My
      dearest
      friend
      was
      the
      first
      person
      I
      had
      ever
      hear
      bring
      this
      up
      as
      something
      society
      should
      do.
      So,
      if
      we
      ever
      allow
      it,
      at
      least
      I
      have
      someone
      who
      will
      understand
      and
      likely
      agree
      to
      be
      by
      my
      side.
      I
      doubt
      I'll
      last
      that
      long.
      This
      Summer
      will
      be
      my
      true
      test.
      I'll
      be
      around
      guns
      all
      the
      time.
      Ah
      --
      it
      looks
      so
      quick
      in
      videos.
      I
      just
      don't
      want
      to
      be
      found
      all
      bloody.

      No,
      this
      obsession
      with
      truth,
      especially
      online,
      is
      annoying.
      Everything

      people

      moaning
      about
      absolutely
      everything.
      Who
      cares
      if
      the
      story
      in
      the
      post
      isn't
      true?
      Why
      does
      that
      matter?
      The
      emotion
      that
      we
      are
      sharing
      is
      real,
      and
      if
      someone
      needs
      to
      validate
      themselves
      by
      being
      Reddit
      Police,
      then,
      fuck,
      what
      a
      confused
      little
      person.

      I
      just
      know
      I'll
      eventually
      do
      it.
      It's
      like
      a
      matter
      of
      time.
      I'm
      so
      afraid.
      All
      I
      can
      do
      is
      scream
      and
      stomp.
      Overdosing
      scares
      me
      the
      most.
      I'm
      not
      on
      medication
      anymore,
      but
      I
      was
      on
      lithium
      when
      I
      stopped
      going
      to
      a
      psychiatrist,
      and
      I
      know
      the
      death
      on
      that
      is
      a
      new
      kind
      of
      Hell.

      I'm
      sorry
      that
      you
      are
      in
      such
      pain
      --
      and
      I
      know
      that
      sorry
      means
      nothing,
      but
      I
      feel
      you.
      I
      have
      a
      therapy
      appointment
      tomorrow.
      I
      don't
      know
      what
      to
      say.
      I
      don't
      want
      to
      be
      put
      in
      a
      hospital
      again.

      Not
      necessarily
      True.
      I
      supported
      Trump
      and
      was
      never
      over
      the
      top
      about
      it,
      especially
      to
      family
      and
      close
      friends,
      and
      I
      lost
      quite
      a
      fee
      people.
      I
      got
      yelled
      at
      and
      belittled
      for
      months
      every
      time
      I
      talked
      to
      them,
      and
      they
      really
      lost
      it
      on
      me
      when
      he
      won.
      Some
      people
      are
      just
      not
      accepting
      of
      beliefs
      other
      than
      their
      own.
      I'm
      sure
      it
      happened
      for
      the
      reverse
      as
      well.
      But
      it
      is
      not
      hard
      to
      be
      like
      that
      a
      well
      worded
      and
      calm
      young
      Trump
      supporter
      could
      lose
      a
      lot
      solely
      for
      support.

      Seeing
      legitimate
      human
      connection
      makes
      them
      feel
      bad
      about
      themselves.
      Idk.
      Probably
      that.

      I
      think
      it's
      sweet.
      And
      he
      was
      self
      aware
      with
      how
      it
      may
      look,
      but
      he
      needed
      to
      express
      himself
      and
      his
      love.
      If
      this
      was
      to
      some
      girl
      that
      he
      was
      trying
      to
      get
      with,
      I'd
      cringe
      hard,
      but
      this
      just
      seems
      like
      a
      nice
      gesture
      from
      am
      awkward
      and
      kind
      of
      sad
      guy.

      I've
      heard
      people
      do
      it,
      and
      it
      comes
      across
      as
      them
      trying
      to
      prove
      a
      point.
      Probably
      a
      bad
      idea
      for
      them.

      Things
      are
      just
      hot
      right
      now.
      I'm

      calm
      down
      soon.

      It's
      hard.
      People
      are
      always
      willing
      to
      talk
      to
      you,
      if
      your
      lucky,
      and
      if
      not
      you
      can
      call
      a
      hotline.
      But
      really
      seeking
      help
      can
      hurt
      so
      much
      more.
      Our
      hospital
      system
      for
      mental
      health
      is
      not
      checked
      in
      on
      the
      same
      way
      any
      other
      facility
      would
      be.
      You
      can
      get
      treated
      so
      poorly
      in
      them.
      That
      is
      where
      I
      faced
      the
      worst
      verbal
      abuse
      of
      my
      life.
      Tough
      love
      maybe?
      The
      stigma
      is
      too
      strong.
      I
      don't
      know
      what
      more
      we
      can
      do
      besides
      give
      people
      a
      bit
      of
      mercy.

      That
      had
      to
      drop
      hearts
      when
      people
      checked

      Eh,
      all
      of
      em
      are
      shit
      heads

      all
      weird

      And
      if
      you
      think
      disowning
      and
      excommunication
      is
      the

      Hey,
      I
      know
      the
      feel.
      Literally
      nothing
      works.
      Hours
      upon
      hours
      of
      therapy
      just
      lead
      me
      to
      the
      same
      breaking
      points
      time
      and
      time
      again.
      My
      friends
      care,
      and
      I'm
      sorry
      that
      yours
      seem
      to
      not,
      but
      my
      issues
      are
      a
      lot
      of
      baggage
      to
      throw
      at
      someone.
      I
      can
      tell
      they
      are
      all
      frustrated
      at
      this
      point.
      Meds
      --
      whatever,
      they
      did
      nothing
      for
      me,
      but
      I
      hear
      success
      stories.
      Being
      at
      what
      seems
      like
      the
      end
      is
      tough.
      The
      best
      I
      can
      do
      is
      try
      and
      laugh
      at
      the
      absurdity
      of
      it
      all.
      I
      sort
      of
      own
      it
      when
      I
      do
      that.
      Take
      care.
      I
      do
      hope
      you
      get
      some
      calm
      and
      ease.
