      I
      got
      this
      same
      flyer
      but
      I
      just
      threw
      it
      in
      the
      trash.
      It's
      nice
      to
      see
      someone
      was
      more
      creative.

      I
      was
      in
      class
      today
      and
      and
      I
      overheard
      some
      kids
      talking
      about
      gay
      marriage.
      Me
      being
      the
      cheeky
      shit
      that
      I
      am,
      I
      felt
      I
      had
      to
      but
      in
      my
      two
      cents.
      One
      of
      them
      was
      saying
      that
      the
      bible
      defines
      marriage
      as
      between
      a
      man
      and
      a
      women
      and
      gays
      shouldn't
      be
      allowed
      to
      marry.
      After
      telling
      him
      about
      how
      America
      does
      not
      incorporate
      religion
      into
      the
      government,
      he
      retorted
      with
      "America
      was
      founded
      on
      the
      bible".
      Realizing
      this
      kid
      was
      stupid
      I
      just
      didn't
      even
      try
      to
      explain
      this
      to
      him.
      So
      then
      I
      mentioned
      some
      of
      the
      other
      things
      that
      the
      bible
      forbids
      and
      allows.
      Instead
      of
      making
      some
      petty
      excuses
      like
      I
      expected,
      he
      just
      flat
      out
      denied
      that
      the
      bible
      said
      these
      things.
      Even
      after
      showing
      him
      in
      the
      bible
      he
      still
      denied
      it.
      I
      just
      thought
      I
      would
      share
      because
      I
      am
      bored.

      I

      too
      and

      my

      is
      pissed
      because
      of
      this
      bullshit.
      I
      almost
      died
      laughing
      when
      one
      day
      he

      he
      looked

      how

      The
      more
      details
      the
      better.**
      I've
      always
      wanted
      a
      desktop
      for
      gaming
      and
      I've
      always
      been
      stuck
      on
      a
      laptop.
      I'll
      also
      be
      using
      this
      for
      college
      and
      running
      some
      biology/chemistry
      modeling
      programs.
      I
      also
      wanted
      to
      do
      some
      self-taught
      coding
      stuff.
      **If
      gaming,
      what
      kind
      of
      performance
      are
      you
      looking
      for?
      (Screen
      resolution,
      FPS,
      game
      settings)**
      After
      being
      stuck
      on
      mediocre
      laptops
      anything
      will
      seem
      better.
      Playing
      games
      like
      League
      of
      Legends,
      WoW,
      and
      Skyrim
      are
      a
      struggle
      for
      my
      laptop.
      However,
      I
      would
      like
      to
      have
      a
      computer
      that
      can
      run
      most
      games
      better
      than
      average.
      High
      FPS
      and
      graphic
      settings
      would
      be
      great.
      **What
      is
      your
      budget
      (ballpark
      is
      okay)?**
      ~$1,600
      **In

      I've
      altered
      this
      build
      several
      times
      and
      I'm
      getting
      close
      to
      finally
      settling
      on
      a
      final
      decision.
      I
      just
      wanted
      some
      additional
      input
      before
      I
      take
      the
      plunge.
      I'm
      wanting
      this
      build
      to
      last
      me
      some
      time
      and
      willing
      to
      invest
      in
      it.

      Thank
      you!
      I've
      been
      all
      over
      the
      place
      trying
      to
      figure
      out
      what
      motherboard
      to
      get.
      I've
      also
      had
      people
      tell
      me
      conflicting
      things
      about
      the
      what
      power
      supply
      I
      should
      have
      so
      thanks
      for
      clearing
      that
      up.
      And
      I
      still
      do
      need
      to
      pick
      out
      a
      monitor.

      Hey
      i
      just
      had
      a
      quick
      question.
      When
      I
      plug
      the
      mobo
      you
      suggested
      into
      my
      part
      list
      PC
      part
      picker
      gives
      this
      warning:
      "The
      motherboard
      M.2
      slot
      #0
      shares
      bandwidth
      with
      SATA
      6.0
      Gb/s
      ports.
      When
      the
      M.2
      slot
      is
      populated,
      two
      SATA
      6Gb/s
      ports
      are
      disabled."
      I
      didn't
      know
      if
      that
      is
      something
      I
      should
      be
      concerned
      about?

      Yeah
      I

      I'm
      fine
      with
      everything
      else.
      But
      the
      fact
      she
      can
      theoretically
      put
      ten
      rounds

      So
      I'm
      level
      36
      (got
      the
      game
      about
      three
      weeks
      ago)
      and
      I'm
      gold
      1
      in
      ranked.
      Obviously
      I
      get
      matched
      with
      similar
      skill
      level
      players
      in
      ranked.
      However
      in
      casual
      I
      seem
      to
      get
      matched
      with
      and
      against
      people
      significantly
      worse
      than
      me.
      I
      noticed
      all
      these
      people
      were
      all
      around
      the

      (30-40).
      So
      is
      casual
      generally
      matched
      with
      similar
      level
      players,

      not

      Honestly
      if
      you
      win,
      the
      leaderboard
      doesn't
      matter
      at
      all.
      Be
      thankful
      they

      not

      you

      level
      20's?
      I

      I've

      playing
      for
      about

      ban
      from
      complete
      accidental
      team
      killing.
      Obviously
      I'm
      getting
      matched
      with
      other
      new
      players
      who
      constantly
      run

      or
      running
      into
      a
      room
      I
      threw
      a

      in.
      It's

      You're
      telling
      me.
      My
      favorite
      was
      I
      was
      playing
      blitz
      and
      I
      was
      hip
      firing
      to
      break
      a
      barricade
      and
      one
      of
      my
      teammates
      was
      off
      to
      the
      left.
      Apparently
      the
      hip
      fire
      spread
      is
      wider
      than
      I
      thought
      because
      one
      bullet
      goes
      hard
      left
      and
      hits
      him
      in
      the
      head.

      I

      if
      he's
      watching
      the
      corner
      when
      you
      run
      in
      and
      your
      flashes
      are
      going
      off,
      he's
      an
      easy
      target.
      Either
      way
      he's
      not
      seeing
      the
      door
      or
      window
      or
      wherever
      you
      are

      Yeah
      but
      it
      takes
      a
      while
      for
      your
      candelas
      to
      go
      off
      and
      even
      a
      flash
      bang
      provides
      a
      decent
      amount
      of
      time
      for
      you
      to
      get
      in
      the
      room
      and
      scope
      it

      Even
      if
      people
      are
      rushing
      they
      will
      see
      that
      laser
      and
      stop
      for
      a
      second.
      That's
      why
      frost
      traps
      are
      very
      viable
      because
      when
      people
      are
      rushing
      they
      don't
      see
      them,
      but
      kapkan
      traps
      are
      easy
      to
      spot.
      With
      the
      change
      you
      are
      gonna
      hit
      a
      lot
      more
      rushers
      and
      if
      they
      aren't
      already
      below
      60
      they'll
      be
      an
      easy
      target
      to
      finish
      off
      because
      you
      instantly
      know
      where
      they
      are.

      What

      sketchy
      is
      that

      was

      Yeah
      that
      was
      the
      plan
      to
      wait
      a
      little
      bit.
      I
      carry
      a
      ruger
      american
      and
      it's
      just
      so
      bulky.
      I
      dont
      mind
      most
      of
      the
      time
      but
      sometimes
      when
      it's
      really
      hot
      out
      it
      gets
      annoying
      and
      is
      harder
      to
      conceal
      in
      lighter
      clothing.
      I've
      narrowed
      it
      down
      to
      either
      the
      p365
      or
      the
      m amp;p
      shield
      m2.0
      for
      a
      smaller
      carry
      option.
      I'm
      not
      the
      biggest
      fan
      of
      glocks,
      the
      grip
      angle
      has
      always
      bothered
      me
      slightly.

      I'm

      need

      My
      only
      worry

      that
      I
      havent
      been

      find
      any
      holsters
      that
      fit
      this
      gun.
      A
      lot
      of
      lcr
      .357
      holsters
      are
      out
      there
      but
      because
      the
      .327
      is
      a
      6
      shot
      it
      doesnt
      fit
      the
      cylinder
      mold.
      Any
      advice?

      no

      Idk
      seems
      like
      a
      very
      niche
      firearm.
      In
      my
      first
      gun
      I'd
      want
      something
      simpler
      and
      something
      I
      could
      conceal
      carry.
      BUT
      the
      scorpion
      is
      cool
      as
      fuck
      so
      theres
      that.

      No
      the
      strat
      is
      to
      give
      the
      gun
      to
      your
      attacker
      and
      then
      you
      run
      away
      while
      they
      try
      to
      figure
      out
      how
      to
      get
      it
      to
      fire.
