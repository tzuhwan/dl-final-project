      I #8217;m
      not
      entirely
      sure
      since
      I #8217;ve
      only
      seen
      the
      Live
      a
      couple
      of
      times.
      I
      think
      the
      usual
      actor
      for
      Race
      stands
      with
      the
      Brooklyn
      Newsies
      in
       #8220;Brooklyn #8217;s
      here #8221;.
      This
      is
      probably
      just
      to
      fill
      it
      but
      you
      know
      how
      fandoms
      work.
      Also,
      Race
      touches
      spot
      in
      some
      screen?
      Like
      when
      Jack
      is
      betraying
      them?

      Only
      if
      you
      believe
      in
      looooooveeee~
      Wrong
      fandom.
      But
      I
      think
      like
      this;
      Fiyero
      is
      a
      prince.
      He
      is
      obviously
      handsome,
      rich
      and
      kind
      of
      a
      bad
      boy.
      It
      is
      shown
      in
       #8220;Dancing
      through
      life #8221;
      how
      BASICALLY
      everyone
      swoons
      over
      him
      as
      soon
      as
      he
      walks
      in.
      Expecting
      him
      to
      be
      this
      fun,
      carefree
      idiot.
      But
      we
      realise
      later,
      thanks
      to
      Elphaba
      that
      he
      actually
      is
      just
      kind
      of
      depressed.
      So
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      Fiyero
      chose
      Elphaba
      because
       #8220;WoAh
      i
      tHinK
      I
      LovE
      hEr???
      Maybe??? #8221;
      I
      think
      he
      noticed
      how
      Elphaba
      was
      the
      only
      one/one
      of
      the
      first
      people
      to
      actually
      CARE
      about
      him
      and
      see
      through
      him.
      And
      he
      did
      know
      Elphaba
      was
      innocent.
      So
      I
      think,
      even
      though
      wealth
      and
      privelege
      would
      give
      a
      fantastic
      life,
      would
      it
      really
      be
      as
      fulfilling
      without
      someone
      to
      understand
      you
      really?
      To
      be
      sure
      that
      they
      love
      you
      for
      you
      and
      not
      your
      looks?
      To
      do
      the
      right
      thing?
      But
      this
      is
      just
      my
      thoughts.

      I
      just
      brought
      them
      home
      like
      6
      hours
      ago
      so
      I #8217;m
      not

      if
      it #8217;s
      a
      habit
      she #8217;ll
      keep
      but
      she #8217;s
      done
      it
      to
      all
      dumps
      she
      has
      laid
      so
      far.

      I
      guess
      so.
      I
      have
      two
      rats
      but
      the
      other
      one
      is
      more
      used
      to
      me
      since
      I
      visited
      it
      frequently
      at
      the
      Zoo.
      The
      other
      just
      came
      from
      the
      breeder
      so
      she #8217;s
      much
      more
      hesitant.
      Ever
      since
      she
      got
      home
      she #8217;s
      been
      hiding
      in
      one
      of
      the
      igloos
      and
      only
      eats
      when
      I
      look
      away.
      The
      other
      pretty
      much
      always
      stays
      outside
      and
      jumps
      up
      on
      my
      hand
      whenever
      she
      can.
      Another
      thing
      that
      worries
      me
      is
      that
      they
      both
      sleep
      a
      LOT.
      And
      they
      both
      do
      it
      in
      separate
      corners,
      one
      level
      away
      from
      eachother.
      Since
      I #8217;ve
      never
      had
      rats
      I #8217;m
      not
      sure
      if
      this
      behavior
      is
      normal
      or
      not
      and
      the
      internet
      hasn #8217;t
      been
      much
      help
      this
      far.

      They
      haven #8217;t
      squabbled
      anything
      what
      I
      can
      see.
      I
      tried
      putting
      them
      both
      on
      the
      same
      level
      and
      they
      bundled
      up
      in
      a
      pile
      immediately.
      One
      of
      them
      (Nessa)
      always
      stands
      over
      my
      other
      (Letchie)
      and
      I #8217;m
      not
      sure
      if
      Letchie
      is
      fine
      with
      that
      since
      she #8217;s
      rather
      shy
      usually.
      They
      have
      a
      huge
      cage
      to
      be
      in
      and
      I #8217;ve
      taken
      them
      both
      out
      into
      a
      secure
      but
      open
      area
      where
      they
      could
      free
      roam
      but
      Letchie
      wants
      to
      stay
      in
      her
      corner
      on
      the
      highest
      level
      and
      if
      I
      try
      to
      put
      her
      elsewhere
      she
      climbs
      right
      back
      up.
      Nessa
      stays
      wherever
      I
      put
      her
      and
      doesn #8217;t
      go
      anywhere
      even
      though
      there
      are
      paths
      and
      toys
      all
      around
      her.

      Tl;dr
      in
      the
      end
      This
      all
      went
      down
      when
      I
      was
      still
      in
      middle
      school
      so
      it #8217;s
      a
      bit
      blurry.
      I
      spent
      most
      breaks
      usually
      following
      my
      older
      brother
      around,
      doing
      whatever
      he
      did.
      That
      way
      I
      got
      to
      meet
      many
      of
      his
      friends,
      including
      his
      then
      best
      friend
      Fred.
      Even
      when
      my
      brother
      wasn #8217;t
      in
      school,
      Fred
      would
      play
      with
      me
      instead
      of
      his
      own
      classmates.
      He
      treated
      me
      like
      his
      own
      little
      sister
      and
      was
      overall
      a
      nice
      kid.
      Fred #8217;s
      mother
      would
      ask
      to
      leave
      Fred
      with
      us
      while
      she
      made
      some
      errands
      every
      now
      and
      then.
      It
      usually
      didn #8217;t
      last
      longer
      than
      a
      few
      hours
      so
      my
      parents
      didn #8217;t
      mind,
      but
      then
      she
      began
      just
      dropping
      him
      off
      and
      leaving
      without
      a
      word.
      It
      became
      a
      problem
      for
      when
      we
      had
      plans
      those
      days
      and
      as
      this
      went
      on
      for
      a
      while,
      we
      couldn #8217;t
      really
      do
      stuff
      on
      our
      free
      time
      anymore
      because
       #8220;What
      if
      Fred
      comes? #8221;
      My
      mother
      liked
      Fred
      but
      she
      was
      concerned
      of
      course.
      She
      tried
      contacting
      Fred #8217;s
      mom
      but
      she
      had
      stopped
      responding
      out
      of
      nowhere.
      She
      dropped
      him
      off
      almost
      daily
      now
      but
      never
      responded
      to
      any
      calls
      from
      my
      parents.
      We
      didn #8217;t
      know
      where
      Fred
      lived
      and
      every
      time
      he
      was
      asked
      about
      his
      mother
      he
      would
      be
      quiet.
      My
      mom
      figured
      that
      maybe
      his
      mother
      had
      a
      few
      problems
      of
      her
      own
      she
      needed
      to
      handle
      for
      a
      while
      so
      she
      didn #8217;t
      mind
      having
      him.
      She
      didn #8217;t
      stop
      trying
      to
      reach
      Fred #8217;s
      family
      (even
      distant
      relatives)
      but
      she
      tried
      not
      to
      let
      it
      bother
      us
      kids.
      But
      then
      one
      time
      when
      Fred #8217;s
      mother
      dropped
      him
      off,
      she
      didn #8217;t
      come
      back.
      My
      mother
      got
      more
      stressed
      as
      the
      days
      went
      on
      without
      her
      showing
      up
      and
      it
      didn #8217;t
      go
      unnoticed
      by
      me
      and
      my
      brother.
      We
      took
      care
      of
      him
      naturally
      but
      as
      we
      had
      no
      clue
      when
      or
      IF
      his
      mother
      was
      coming
      back,
      my
      parents
      tried
      harder
      than
      ever
      to
      get
      in
      touch
      with
      people
      -
      From
      contacting
      our
      school
      to
      stalking
      Fred #8217;s
      mothers
      social
      media
      in
      an
      attempt
      to
      find
      anything.
      And
      then
      after
      two
      WEEKS
      she
      came
      to
      pick
      him
      up
      again.
      This
      time
      my
      mother
      stepped
      in
      front
      of
      the
      car
      and
      refused
      to
      move
      until
      Fred #8217;s
      mother
      stepped
      out
      and
      talked
      to
      her.
      It
      was
      revealed
      that
      she
      had
      dropped
      him
      off
      to
      go
      on
      a
      vacation
      In
      the
      neighbouring
      country.
      My
      mother
      couldn #8217;t
      trust
      Fred #8217;s
      mother
      anymore,
      of
      course,
      and
      told
      her
      that
      although
      he
      was
      allowed
      to
      play
      with
      us,
      she
      wouldn #8217;t
      babysit
      him.
      So
      Fred #8217;s
      mother
      stopped
      dropping
      him
      off
      all
      together.
      Instead
      she
      would
      pass
      by
      the
      school
      and
      talk
      to
      me
      and
      my
      brother
      during
      breaks.
      She
      went
      as
      far
      as
      telling
      us,
      a
      pair
      of
      children,
      how
      she
      thought
      our
      mother
      was
      irresponsible
      and
      rude.
      Fred
      was
      fine
      for
      a
      while
      but
      then
      he
      also
      began
      talking
      about
      our
      mother
      the
      same
      way,
      probably
      influenced
      by
      his
      own
      mother.
      My
      brother,
      bold
      as
      he
      is,
      told
      Fred
      several
      times
      how
      he
      didn #8217;t
      like
      what
      he
      was
      saying
      and
      after
      a
      while
      told
      him
      to
      stay
      away
      from
      us
      all
      together
      since
      he
      didn #8217;t
      really
      change
      his
      ways.
      Because
      I
      was
      more
      shy
      and
      manipulative,
      heinstead
      went
      on
      to
      try
      talking
      with
      me
      when
      my
      brother
      wasn #8217;t
      around,
      He
      would
      randomly
      come
      and
      stand
      behind
      me
      while
      I
      was
      swinging
      to
      push
      me
      or
      something
      and
      then
      walk
      away
      as
      soon
      as
      he
      saw
      my
      brother
      approaching.
      It
      was
      creepy.
      After
      that
      I
      don #8217;t
      know
      what
      happened
      but
      Fred
      ended
      up
      switching
      schools.
      We
      laugh
      about
      it
      today
      but
      I
      still
      wonder
      what
      happened
      to
      him.
      Tl:dr
      In
      middle
      school
      my
      friend #8217;s
      mother
      dropped
      her
      kid
      off
      at
      our
      house
      for
      two
      weeks
      without
      a
      notice
      to
      go
      on
      a
      vacation
      in
      the
      neighbouring
      country.
      After
      that
      she
      and
      the
      kid
      talks
      badly
      about
      my
      mother
      in
      front
      of
      me
      on
      school
      breaks.

      It
      is
      hard
      to
      get
      pictures
      of
      her
      since
      she #8217;s
      the
      more
      energetic
      one
      and
      when
      she
      sleeps
      it #8217;s
      usually
      hidden
      or
      under

      older
      sister.
      The

      are

      too
      certain
      of
      her
      age,
      but
      we
      got
      her
      when
      she
      was
      just
      a
      few
      weeks
      old.
      I #8217;d
      bet
      she #8217;s
      about
      three
      months
      old
      or
      so?

      Coming
      from
      a
      Christian
      family,
      I #8217;ve
      always
      been
      told
      that
      god
      doesn #8217;t
      have
      control
      over
      what
      happens.
      God
      isn #8217;t
      a
      person
      or
      an
      object.
      God
      has
      no
      direct
      power
      on
      earth.
      God
      is
      just
      a
      relief,
      a
      person
      who
      loves
      you
      when
      nobody
      else
      does
      and
      listens
      when
      no
      one
      else
      will.
      Someone
      who
      can
      hear
      your
      rants
      and
      cries
      and
      not
      judge
      you.
      But
      then
      again,
      the
      information
      and
      beliefs
      gets
      very
      thrown
      around
      when
      it
      comes
      to
      different
      churches,
      Basically,
      god
      has
      no
      control
      over
      who
      wins
      the
      lottery
      or
      who
      gets
      abused.
      He
      can
      only
      be
      there
      for
      you
      to
      help
      you
      get
      through
      it.

      My
      bible
      is
      not
      English
      so
      this
      is
      a
      rough
      translation
      by
      me
      but
      the
      whole
      quote
      should
      go
      something
      like
      this;
       #8220;Then
      he
      said:
       #8220;But
      now
      shall
      you
      who
      have
      a
      penny
      pouch
      take
      it
      with
      you,
      and
      as
      well
      the
      bag,
      and
      the
      one
      who
      is
      without
      money
      shall
      sell
      his
      cape
      and
      buy
      a
      sword. #8221;

      Oh
      no,
      you
      weren #8217;t
      offensive
      at
      all!
      I
      just
      wanted
      to
      help
      out.
      Plus
      reading
      the
      bible
      is
      a
      matter
      of
      perspective
      and
      every
      quote
      can
      be
      taken
      differently
      by
      different
      people.
      It
      is
      also
      filled
      with
      metaphors
      and
      laws
      that
      just
      can #8217;t
      be
      followed
      today
      because
      they #8217;re
      so
      outdated.
      What
      I #8217;m
      saying
      is,
      you
      shouldn #8217;t
      take
      the
      quotes
      too
      seriously.
      No
      matter
      how
      Christian
      you
      are.

      As
      a
      Christian
      I #8217;ve
      always
      learned
      that
      god
      can #8217;t
      control
      anyone.
      That
      you #8217;re
      in
      charge
      of
      your
      own
      deeds
      and
      misdeeds
      in
      your
      own
      life.
      He
      is
      everything
      you
      want
      him
      to
      be.
      He
      can
      be
      the
      scapegoat,
      the
      ally
      or
      the
      nonpartial
      voice.
      He
      can #8217;t
      save
      you
      from
      abuse
      but
      he
      will
      help
      you
      get
      through
      it.
      In
      my
      church
      we
      don #8217;t
      praise
      god
      because
      he
      is
      our
      dictator
      or
      because
      we
      necessarily
      have
      to
      -
      we
      do

      If
      you
      honestly
      think
      that
      I
      am
      gonna
      cross
      an
      entire
      ocean,
      one
      continent
      and
      probably
      thousands
      of
      kilometres
      just
      to
      pet
      some
      baby
      rats
      then
      you #8217;re
      absolutely
      right.

      Zara
      Larsson.
      Living
      in
      Sweden,
      it
      was
      pretty
      exhausting
      to
      see
      everyone
      talking
      about
      Zara
      Larsson,
      the
      swede
      who #8217;s
      music
      is
      known
      by
      th
      entire
      world.
      In
      difference
      to
      ABBA
      and
      other
      Swedish
      legends,
      I
      just
      viewed
      her
      as
      the
      typical
      narcissistic
      pop
      star
      who
      only
      lived
      on
      Autotune
      and
      good
      looks.
      Nothing
      else.
      She #8217;s
      blonde,
      wears
      flashy
      clothes
      and
      keeps
      mentioning
      her
      love
      life.
      Then
      when
      I
      was
      in
      the
      car
      with
      my
      dad,
      he
      put
      on
      a
      pod
      about
      her.
      I
      knew
      dad
      had
      no
      idea
      who
      she
      was
      and
      only
      put
      it
      on
      cause
      he
      thought
      I
      liked
      her
      but
      it
      was
      sweet
      of
      him
      so
      I
      listened.
      Turned
      out
      she
      had
      been
      singing
      with
      this
      much
      power
      ever
      since
      she
      was
      little.
      Her
      voice
      is
      genuine.
      And
      despite
      her
      incredible
      talent,
      she
      speaks
      openly
      about
      feminism
      and
      doesn #8217;t
      filter
      her
      opinions
      just
      for
      the
      fans
      sake.
      I
      really
      judged
      the
      book
      by
      its
      cover
      on
      this
      one.

      Well
      he
      is
      very
      impulsive
      and
      well
       #8220;brainless #8221;
      but
      I
      think
      Elphaba
      could
      help
      a
      lot
      on
      that
      part.
      Other
      than
      that
      he
      is
      shown
      to
      be
      very
      sympathetic
      and
      caring.
      In
      the
      musical
      he
      would
      give
      up
      hits
      place
      as
      captain
      of
      the
      guard
      and
      be
      a
      wanted
      criminal
      just
      to
      spend
      one
      night
      with
      the
      woman
      he
      loved
      so
      I
      doubt
      anything
      would
      go
      before
      his
      children.
      He
      wouldn #8217;t
      be
      a
      perfect
      dad
      but
      he
      wouldn #8217;t
      be
      a
      bad
      one
      is
      what
      I #8217;m
      saying.
      Then
      there #8217;s
      the
      fact
      that
      he #8217;s
      a
      scarecrow
      so
      him
      having
      children
      isn #8217;t
      too
      possible
      anyways.
      I,
      quite
      obviously,
      have
      only
      watched
      the
      musical.
      I
      can #8217;t
      talk
      for

      I #8217;ve
      been
      diagnosed
      with
      anxiety
      since
      three
      years
      back
      and
      my
      mom
      knows
      it.
      She
      knows
      I
      will
      have
      panic
      attacks.
      It #8217;s
      just
      that
      since
      three
      years
      ago
      it
      has
      gotten
      worse.
      And
      my
      panic
      attacks
      are
      instead
      of
      just
      shaking
      and
      screaming
      to
      actually
      trying
      to
      end
      my
      life.
      I #8217;m
      way
      too
      scared
      to
      actually
      do
      it
      I
      think.
      But
      I #8217;ve
      attempted
      to.
      I #8217;ve
      tried
      knives,
      fire,
      drowning
      and
      just
      today
      I
      tried
      hitting
      my
      head
      in
      my
      bathtub,
      chairs
      and
      more.
      I
      just
      feel
      so
      empty
      and
      while
      I
      might
      not
      want
      death,
      I
      want
      some
      sort
      of
      break
      or
      a
      stop.
      Everything
      is
      going
      to
      fast
      and
      I
      don #8217;t
      even
      have
      my
      own
      body
      in
      control
      anymore.
      Today
      my
      brother
      found
      me
       #8220;sleeping #8221;
      on
      the
      bathroom
      floor.
      I
      was
      awake
      but
      I
      couldn #8217;t
      move
      or
      talk,
      I
      didn #8217;t
      feel
      like
      I
      had
      the
      physical
      power
      to
      do
      anything
      no
      matter
      how
      much
      I
      actually
      wanted
      to.
      He
      called
      for
      my
      mom
      and
      once
      she
      came
      up
      she
      started
      shaking
      my
      body,
      even
      when
      I
      had
      proved
      to
      be
      awake
      and
      she
      screamed
      at
      me
      stuff
      like
       #8220;Sit
      up!
      You
      know
      you
      can. #8221;
       #8220;Are
      you
      going
      to
      let
      the
      anxiety
      take
      over? #8221;
       #8220;You
      sit
      up
      now. #8221;
       #8220;You
      don #8217;t
      have
      epilepsy
      I
      know
      you
      can
      do
      it #8221;
      and
      other
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      she
      knows
      about
      my
      suicidal
      thoughts.
      She
      knows
      I #8217;ve
      made
      cuts
      but
      when
      I
      told
      her
      she
      took
      away
      everything
      sharp
      in
      my
      room
      and
      now
      she
      daily
      has
      to
      check
      if
      I
      have
      done
      more.
      I #8217;ve
      also
      tried
      telling
      her
      that
      her
      touching
      me
      and
      screaming
      at
      me
      makes
      me
      more
      tense
      but
      she
      insists
      it #8217;s
      the
      only
      way
      for
      me
      to
      get
      out
      of
      the
      attacks.
      To
      force
      myself
      to
      ignore
      it
      and
      think
      happy
      thoughts
      but
      it
      doesn #8217;t
      work
      I
      take
      meds
      daily
      and
      nightly
      and
      I
      have
      therapy
      sessions.
      I
      don #8217;t
      know
      what
      else
      there
      is
      for
      me
      to
      do
      at
      this
      point.
      It
      won #8217;t
      stop
      it
      hasn #8217;t
      for
      three
      years
      and
      I
      get
      more
      scared.
      Sorry
      for
      bad
      English

      I

      This

      Yeah
      I
      can
      always
      move
      back
      home
      if
      needed
      so
      that #8217;s
      a
      plus!
      I #8217;m
      the
      type
      of
      person
      who #8217;d
      rather
      have
      everything
      planned
      out
      in
      beforehand
      though.

      In
      my
      country
      school
      is
      free,
      we
      get
      free
      lunch
      and
      as
      a
      student
      I #8217;ll
      get
      about
      200$
      weekly
      by
      the
      government
      to
      pay
      off
      loans
      and
      other
      necessities.
      Students
      get
      a
      lot
      of
      advantages
      here
      so
      while
      Finance
      definetely
      is
      important,
      it
      isn #8217;t
      much
      of
      a
      problem
      right
      now.
      Health,
      lodging
      and
      predators
      is
      what
      worries
      me
      the
      most.
      The
      city
      is
      naturally
      crowded
      since
      it #8217;s
      a
      capital
      so
      I
      would
      most
      likely
      need
      to
      get
      a
      roomie
      of
      some
      sort,
      otherwise
      it
      will
      be
      nearly
      impossible
      to
      get
      a
      place
      for
      my
      own
      which
      is
      something
      we
      haven #8217;t
      figured
      out
      yet.
      I #8217;m
      also
      very
      dependent
      on
      my
      parents
      to
      get
      me
      out
      of
      my
      panic
      attacks
      and
      as
      they
      can #8217;t
      really
      move
      with
      me
      I
      don #8217;t
      know
      about
      that
      either.
      My
      country
      is
      also
      quite
       #8220;famous #8221;
      for
      how
      many
      girls
      get
      targeted
      by
      predators.
      I #8217;m
      absolutely
      frightened
      because
      of
      that.
      It
      has
      always
      been
      a
      goal
      of
      mine
      to
      attend
      this
      school
      though.
      I
      have
      done
      plenty
      of
      visits
      and
      it #8217;s
      now
      confirmed
      that
      if
      I
      can
      find
      a
      way
      to
      get
      to
      it
      each
      morning,
      I
      will
      be
      able
      to
      attend.
      It #8217;s
      an
      extremely
      hard
      decision.

      My
      self
      harm
      is
      connected
      to
      my
      panic
      attacks.
      Even
      when
      there #8217;s
      nothing
       #8220;bothering #8221;
      me
      I
      will
      start
      shaking,
      crying
      and
      I
      just
      have
      to
      get
      as
      far
      away
      from
      people
      as
      I
      can.
      I
      usually
      run
      to
      a
      bathroom
      and
      lock
      myself
      in.
      More
      and
      more
      control
      I
      will
      loose.
      I
      go
      from
      slightly
      shaking
      to
      jumping
      uncontrollably,
      crying
      to
      screaming
      etc.
      Etc.
      I
      am
      fully
      mentally
      aware
      when
      this
      happens
      but
      it
      feels
      as
      if
      I
      can #8217;t
      control
      anything
      in
      my
      entire
      body
      and
      what
      makes
      it
      worse
      is
      that
      I
      never
      know
      WHY
      it
      happens.
      Self
      harm
      to
      me
      is
      sort
      of
      giving
      myself
      a
      reason
      and
      something
      to
      control
      over.
      If
      I
      hurt,
      it
      is
      because
      I #8217;m
      hurting
      myself.
      Drawing
      blood
      isn #8217;t
      my
      inner
      anxiety,
      it
      is
      all
      me.
      Harming
      myself
      shows.
      I #8217;m
      bleeding,
      I #8217;m
      in
      pain.
      It #8217;s
      okay
      for
      me
      to
      feel
      sad
      then.
      I #8217;m
      not
      just
      panicking
      for
      no
      reason,
      I #8217;m
      obviously
      physically
      hurting.
      If
      I
      can #8217;t
      find
      any
      sharp
      objects
      I
      will
      punch
      myself,
      run
      into
      hard
      objects,
      claw
      with
      my
      nails
      over
      my
      skin,
      bite
      etc.
      I
      need
      the
      pain
      to
      have
      a
      reason
      and
      to
      have
      something
      to
      fix.
      When
      I
      take
      a
      piece
      of
      paper
      and
      wipe
      away
      the
      blood
      I
      can
      calm
      down.
      I
      fixed
      the
      pain.
