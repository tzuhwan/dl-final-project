      watching
       #8220;Boys
      In

      gave
      me
      a
      feeling
      of
      Indescribable
      beauty.

      Does
      it
      make
      you
      guys
      mad
      when
      people
      are
      telling
      you
      about
      a
      trip
      there
      planning
      and
      all
      it
      is,
      is
      just
      irresponsible
      shit.
      Like
      right
      now
      I #8217;m
      talking
      to
      a
       #8220;friend #8221;
      and
      he #8217;s
      telling
      me
      that
      the
      guy
      doesn #8217;t
      know
      how
      many
      ug #8217;s.
      First
      red
      flag,
      then
      I
      ask
      if
      it #8217;s
      tested
      and
      he
      told
      me
      that
      it
      doesn #8217;t
      really
      matter
      because
      it #8217;s
      only
      one
      tab.
      WHY
      CANT
      PEOPLE
      BE
      RESPONSIBLE
      Also
      did
      I
      mention
      this
      is

      Crystal
      mdma.
      Now
      it #8217;s
      $15
      for
      .1,
      he
      says

      that #8217;s
      plenty
      for
      1
       #8220;trip #8221;.

      amount
      to
      take

      first
      time,
      I
      have
      had
      experience
      with
      a
      little
      weed,
      lsd
      and
      an

      So
      today
      during
      my
      math
      class
      today
      there
      was
      some
      announcements
      over
      the
      intercom
      and
      then
      was
      proceed
      by
      the
       #8220;pledge
      of
      allegiance #8221;.
      To
      give
      some
      context
      I #8217;m
      16
      and
      a
      junior
      in
      high
      school,
      I #8217;ve
      been
      having
      a
      really
      hard
      time
      trying
      to
      find
      ways
      that
      I
      can
      create
      active
      political
      changes!
      But
      back
      to
      the
      story
      as
      all
      the
      drones
      got
      into
      position
      I
      decided
      that
      I #8217;m
      not
      going
      to
      stand
      this
      time.
      A
      couple
      of
      people
      noticed
      and
      I
      was
      then
      yelled
      at
      by
      this
      one
      asshole
      (I #8217;ve
      known
      him
      for
      some
      time
      and
      we
      mutually
      hate
      each
      other)
      he
      told
      me
      that
      I
      need
      to
      stand
      up
      and
      show
      respect.
      He
      continued
      to
      tell
      me
      to
       #8220;get
      my
      ass
      up #8221;
      as
      this
      point
      I
      didn #8217;t
      want
      to
      antagonize
      them
      so
      I
      just
      kept
      working.
      Then
      from
      behind
      I
      was
      slapped,
      I
      didn #8217;t
      know
      how
      to
      react
      I
      just
      looked
      at
      him
      (I
      should
      mention
      this
      is
      a
      different
      person).
      The
      teacher
      then
      said
       #8220;come
      on
      guys
      don #8217;t
      hit
      Nate #8221;
      then
      continued
      on
      to
      say
       #8220;you
      need
      to
      stand
      up #8221;.
      Later
      on
      I
      confronted
      the
      person
      who
      slapped
      me
      and
      they
      said
       #8220;oh
      I #8217;m
      sorry
      it
      was
      an
      automatic
      reaction #8221;!
      I
      don #8217;t
      even
      know
      what
      to
      do
      anymore
      the
      one
      asshole
      kept
      calling
      me
      names
      though
      out
      class
      and
      it #8217;s
      just
      fucking
      annoying.
      I
      know
      there
      trying
      to
      get
      to
      me
      but
      still
      it #8217;s
      so
      frustrating
      to
      not
      have
      the
      power
      to
      make
      change!!!
      How
      come
      all
      the
      fucking
      sexist,
      racist,
      homophobic
      fascist
      can
      go
      around
      with
      immunity?
      If
      you
      have
      any
      advice
      on
      how
      I
      can
      help
      or
      make
      the
      time
      go
      fast
      please
      help.
      Sorry
      for
      my
      grammar
      and
      spelling
      btw
      TDLR:
      I
      didn #8217;t
      stand
      for
      the
      pledge
      of
      Allegiance,
      got
      yelled
      at
      and
      hit.

      Whenever
      I
      take
      any
      stim
      it
      seems
      like
      I

      stop
      fucking
      yawning,
      it #8217;s
      so
      annoying!
      I
      get
      up
      get
      ready
      take
      like
      20mg
      XR
      most
      of

      take
      a
      full
      breath
      and
      I
      just
      yawn.
      My
      eyes
      get
      all
      watery
      and
      my
      nose
      runs,
      it
      makes
      me
      look
      like
      I #8217;m
      strung
      out
      or
      some
      shit.
      This
      happens
      on
      any
      stims
      I #8217;ve
      tried
      over
      time
      I
      just
      get
      more
      and
      more
      annoyed
      and
      tired
      every
      time
      I
      FUCKING
      yawn.
      Does
      this
      happen

      anyone
      else
      I
      don #8217;t

      good
      to

      but
      I
      wanted

      I #8217;ll
      try
      and
      make
      it
      but
      is
      there
      anymore
      details
      on
      this
      like
      if
      it #8217;s
      gonna
      be
      at
      a
      21+
      venue?
      Edit:
      found
      some
      more
      info
      on
      there
      Facebook
      and
      it
      looks
      like
      it #8217;s
      being
      held
      at
      a
      place
      call
      Twilight
      Cafe
      And
      Bar
      and
      it
      looks
      21+
       #9785; #65039; #128557;
      very
      sad
      that
      it #8217;s
      practically
      impossible
      to
      see
      these
      bands.
      Someday
      hopefully
      soon
      I #8217;ll
      just
      get
      a
      fake
      ID
      because
      it #8217;s
      so
      goddamn
      annoying
      that
      I
      can #8217;t
      just
      go
      out
      and
      see
      the
      music
      that
      I
      like.

      Ya

      today

      I
      loved
      it
      to
      bits
      and
      it
      gave
      a

      more

      on
      how
      a

      *cough*

      All
      throughout
      history
      we #8217;ve
      seen
      that
      prohibition
      has
      failed
      just
      outlawing
      sometime
      isn #8217;t
      going
      to
      change
      the
      fact
      that
      teens
      are
      still
      going
      to
      find
      a
      way.
      I
      just
      graduated
      from
      a
      state
      that
      is
      21+
      for
      tobacco
      and
      weed,
      but
      guess
      what
      everyone
      still
      smoked
      weed
      and
      if
      people
      couldn #8217;t
      get
      ahold
      of
       #8220;reliable #8221;
      nicotine
      products.
      Then
      people
      went
      to
      sketchy
      products
      online
      that
      you
      have
      no
      clue
      what #8217;s
      actually
      in
      them,
      I #8217;m
      not
      saying
      we
      should
      let
      all
      kids
      smoke
      and
      vape
      but
      we
      need
      to
      get
      some
      real
      education
      that
      doesn #8217;t
      just
      feed
      them
      lies.

      No
      but
      if
      you
      look
      at
      countries
      that
      have
      decriminalize
      drugs
      and
      actually
      gave
      support
      to
      addicts
      there #8217;s
      a
      massive
      reduction
      in
      overdoses
      then
      over
      time
      a
      reduction
      in
      addition
      in
      general.

      Up
      here
      in
      Oregon
      and
      always
      thought
      people
      overreact
      about
      how
      this
      cost
      is
      supposed
      to
      have
       #8220;the
      big
      one #8221;
      but
      now
      it #8217;s
      getting
      scary.
      Probably
      gonna
      add
      to
      the
      supplies
      that
      I
      already
      have
      set
      aside,
      get
      an
      amount
      to
      keep
      full
      for
      a
      few
      days.
      Edit:
      I
      didn #8217;t
      feel
      it
      sorry
      if
      it
      sounded
      like
      that
      just
      scary
      to
      see
      this
      happening

      Ya
      but
      what
      really
      scares
      me
      is
      the
      aftermath,
      look
      at
      what
      happened
      after
      Hurricane
      Katrina,
      violent
      white
      supremacy
      gangs
      hunting
      people
      and
      mass
      looting.
      There #8217;s
      this
      podcast
      called
      It
      Could
      Happen
      Here
      and
      it #8217;s
      scary
      to
      see
      how
      things
      could
      end
      up.
      And
      California
      and
      Oregon
      have
      always
      been
      known
      for
      having
      some
      very
      strained
      race
      relations
      especially
      with
      the
      state.
      Hope
      y #8217;all
      don #8217;t
      get
      another
      one,
      good
      luck

      I #8217;m
      sad
      now
      though
      I
      might
      be
      able
      to
      feel
      that
      feeling
      of
      bliss
      and
      everything
      is
      ok
      but
      I
      guess
      not
      maybe
      another
      would
      help

      You
      seem
      to
      have
      some
      anxiety
      about
      your
      role

      is
      perfectly
      normal,
      what
      I
      think
      you
      should
      do
      is
      pop
      half

      pill
      after
      you
      say
      goodnight
      to
      everyone
      put
      on
      some
      headphones
      and
      jam
      out
      to
      your
      favorite
      music.
      You
      might
      feel
      a
      bit
      scared
      on
      the
      come
      up
      but
      you
      know
      it #8217;s
      tested
      good
      and
      you #8217;re
      only
      taking
      half.
      Maybe
      pick
      up
      some
      5-htp
      for
      after
      the
      roll
      to
      help
      but
      it #8217;s
      not
      needed.
      I #8217;m
      sure
      you #8217;re
      gonna
      have
      a
      great

      You
      haven #8217;t
      proved
      anything
      but
      a
      scary
      story
      you
      heard
      mostly
      likely
      created
      my
      the
      government
      to
      scare
      people.
      I
      think
      it
      would
      actually
      be
      illegal
      to
      poison
      something
      that
      you
      know
      will
      be
      ingested
      by
      someone.

      anyone
      know
      wtf
      all
      the

      was?
      All
      I
      remembered
      was
      people
      calling
      the
      owner
      of
      this
      sub
      a
      pedo
      and
      shit
      but
      then
      it
      all
      disappeared
      I
      never
      saw
      evidence.

      A
      few
      of
      the
      post
      gained
      a
      couple
      hundred

      so
      it #8217;s
      hard
      to
      tell
      what
      the
      community
      wants.
      Also
      man
      mods
      are
      volunteers
      we
      don #8217;t
      do
      this
      all
      day
      I
      hop
      on
      here
      every
      2
      days
      or
      so
      and
      idk
      about
      the
      other
      mods
      but
      it #8217;s
      hard
      to
      know
      what
      to
      do.
      I
      would
      appreciate
      it
      if
      you
      were
      a
      little
      nicer
      it #8217;s
      pretty
      discouraging
      when
      your
      trying
      to
      make
      a
      cool
      place
      for
      people
      but
      then
      just
      get

      Your
      completely
      correct
      I
      definitely
      dropped
      the
      ball
      on
      this.
      I
      just
      think
      if
      we
      have
      a
      more
      open
      conversation
      we
      can

      lot
      more
      done
      for
      this
      subreddit
      ya
      know.
      Also
      not
      trying
      to
      make
      excuses
      but
      I
      mainly
      use
      mobile
      so
      I
      can #8217;t
      see
      when
      there #8217;s
      a
      post
      that #8217;s
      been
      reported
      but
      I #8217;ll
      definitely
      try
      and
      get
      on
      my
      computer
      more
      often
      to
      see
      all
      the
      reports.

      they
      can
      easily
      ask
      just
      like
      this
      one.
      But
      when
      they
      don #8217;t
      believe
      the
      answer
      that #8217;s
      where
      you
      need
      to
      open
      up
      a
      discussion
      about
      why
      there
      is
      untrust
      and
      where
      it #8217;s
      coming
      from.
      I
      have
      a
      helicopter
      parent
      and
      know
      first
      hand
      that
      kids
      should
      not
      indulge
      these
      overprotective
      tendencies,
      they
      will
      only
      lead
      to
      a
      larger
      divide
      in
      the
      relationship
      and
      more
      of
      a
      lack
      of
      communication.

      Ok
      I
      no
      expert
      and
      don #8217;t
      pretend
      to
      be
      but
      right
      now
      the
      best
      thing
      your
      friend
      can
      do
      is
      document
      document
      document!
      Have
      him
      or
      her
      get
      as
      much
      evidence
      as
      possible
      about
      the
      family,
      texts,
      phone
      conversations,
      real
      life
      conversations
      (this
      one #8217;s
      important
      with
      everything
      else
      they
      can
      argue
      it #8217;s
      fake
      but
      if
      they
      get
      some
      voice
      recording
      of
      threats
      or
      verbal
      abuse
      it
      could
      go
      a
      super
      long
      way!)
      that #8217;s
      just
      while
      they
      still
      lives
      there.
      Next
      have
      them
      try
      and
      find
      out
      where
      important
      documents
      are
      ex.
      Birth
      certificate,
      ID,
      any
      bank
      documents
      that
      pertain
      to
      them.
      Also
      remember
      that
      you
      can #8217;t
      bring
      anything
      that
      can
      be
      tracked
      or
      anything
      that
      can
      be
      considered
       #8220;stolen #8221;
      because
      the
      phone
      is
      most
      likely
      owed
      by
      the
      parents
      they
      can
      track
      it
      so
      leave
      it
      behind
      and
      if
      you
      take
      any
      property
      that
      is
      expensive
      or
      important
      then
      they
      can
      file
      a
      police
      report
      and
      be
      on
      the
      look
      out
      for
      it.
      Next
      your
      best
      bet
      is
      it
      lay
      low
      for
      awhile
      if
      they
      have
      a
      credit
      card
      or
      anything
      don #8217;t
      use
      it
      it
      can
      be
      tracked
      also
      change
      your
      social
      media
      they
      can
      be
      watching
      it.
      Eventually
      you #8217;ll
      probably
      want
      to
      get
      a
      restraining
      order
      to
      that #8217;s
      where
      the
      evidence
      comes
      into
      play.
      Also
      having
      some
      money
      saved
      up
      will
      help
      you
      out
      a
      ton
      so
      have
      um
      save
      as
      much
      as
      they
      can
      CASH
      only
      once
      you

      Edit:
      ok
      I #8217;m
      stupid
      I
      tried
      to
      crosspost
      this
      from
      r/pics
      but
      it
      was
      taken
      down.
      These
      trucks
      were
      seen
      going
      straight
      into
      Hong
      Kong!
      There
      all
      empty
      which
      leads
      me
      to
      believe
      mass
      arrest
      and
      work
      camps
      will
      come
      soon.
      These
      images
      and
      videos
      are
      disappearing
      so
      please
      tell
      people
      this
      could
      be
      a
      1989
      all
      over
      again.
      Stay
      strong

      the
      world
      is
      holding
      their
      breath
      for
      you!

      sorry
      that
      you
      had
      to
      go
      through
      such
      a
      traumatic
      experience,
      substance
      abuse
      is
      extremely
      difficult
      to
      go
      through
      and
      see
      someone
      go
      through.
      I #8217;m
      lost
      for
      words
      about
      your
      mother
      and
      how
      narcissistic
      and
      idiotic
      that
      shit
      is
      but
      I #8217;m
      sorry.
      One
      of
      my
      favorite
      songs
      has
      given
      me
      a
      lot
      of
      straight
      in
      the
      world
      I
      I
      hope
      it
      give
      you
      some
      to
       #8220;your
      Hart
      is
      a
      muscle
      the
      size
      of
      your
      fist,
      keep
      on
      fighting
      keep
      on
      loving.
      And
      hold
      on
      and
      hold
      on,
      hold
      on
      for

      There

      a

      just

      ??
      Reddit
      have
      multiple
      huge
      community #8217;s
      that
      are
      dedicated
      to
      fighting
      fascism,
      it
      also
      has
      a
      generally
      good
      view
      on
      antifa.
      Even
      though
      isn #8217;t
      being
      censored
      we
      still
      have
      huge
      community #8217;s
      of
      comrades
      and
      anarchist
      that
      are
      spreading
      real
      news.
      I
      don #8217;t
      see
      any
      other
      social
      media
      platforms
      that
      have
      this
      much
      of
      a
      leftist
      culture?
      Twitter
      is
      being
      paid
      to
      put
      out
      propaganda,
      Instagram
      will
      ban
      you
      for
      the
      smallest
      shit,
      idk
      about
      any
      other
      platforms
      because
      I
      only
      use
      Reddit
      but
      if
      there #8217;s
      something
      better
      please

      You

      never
      hit
      it
      straight
      out

      Seriously
      the
      gas
      is
      still
      expanding
      so
      when
      you
      inhale
      it
      it
      can
      pop
      a

      it
      can

      and
      throat
      which
      can
      also
      be
      dangerous.
      You
      should
      definitely
      just
      get
      some
      balloons
      and
      inhale
      it
      from
      them
      it #8217;s
      1000x

      like
      no

      the

      month

      I
      wait
      a

      a
      half
      to
      two
      months
      whenever
      I
      roll.
      And
      the

      going

      every

      weekend
      is
      way
      to
      much.
      Edit:
      maybe
      just
      roll
      at
      the
      first
      and
      last
