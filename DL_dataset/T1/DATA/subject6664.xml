      Background
      information:
      We
      have
      been
      together
      off
      and
      on
      for
      about
      a
      year
      and
      a
      half
      now.
      We
      broke
      up
      in
      September
      of
      2015,
      but
      when
      we
      started
      talking
      about
      two
      months
      ago
      (March
      of
      2016),
      we
      were
      originally
      going
      to
      keep
      it
      as
      just
      friends,
      however
      it
      now
      seems
      like
      we
      are
      almost
      back
      together.
      When
      we
      first
      met,
      in
      October
      of
      2015,
      people
      warned
      me
      about
      his
      drug
      habit
      and
      tendency
      to
      lash
      out.
      I
      chose
      to
      ignore
      the
      warnings,
      because
      i
      try
      my
      best
      not
      to
      judge
      people
      based
      on
      rumors.
      When
      our
      relationship
      first
      started
      out,
      i
      would
      see
      him
      stoned
      occasionally,
      but
      that
      was
      it.
      As
      months
      progressed,
      i
      realized
      he
      had
      a
      ketamine
      addiction
      that
      was
      just
      getting
      worse
      and
      worse.
      As
      of
      now,
      he's
      stopped
      ketamine,
      but
      has
      picked
      up
      prescription
      pills
      to
      cope.
      My
      Dilemma:
      I
      don't
      know
      what
      to
      do.
      We
      can't
      go
      out
      because
      he
      is
      noticeably
      high,
      he
      doesn't
      remember
      the
      time
      we
      spend
      together,
      and
      the
      pills
      turn
      him
      into
      an
      ass.
      He
      called
      a
      mutual
      friend
      a
      few
      nights
      ago,
      and
      spilled
      my
      secrets
      and
      thoughts
      to
      him,
      which
      was
      very
      embarrassing
      for
      me.
      I
      know
      he
      wants
      to
      stop,
      but
      he
      always
      runs
      to
      drugs
      when
      things
      go
      wrong.
      i
      can't
      bring
      him
      around
      my
      parents
      because
      he
      would
      have
      to
      get
      fucked
      up
      to
      have
      a
      meal
      with
      them.
      I
      feel
      like
      i
      will
      never
      be
      emotionally
      satisfied,
      but
      at
      the
      same
      time,
      i
      don't
      want
      to
      leave.
      When
      he's
      sober,
      things
      are
      fantastic,
      and
      we
      can
      have
      meaningful
      conversations.
      I
      just
      feel
      like
      I'm
      wanting
      something
      that
      is
      never
      going
      to
      be
      anything.
      Should
      i
      just
      move
      on?
      If
      it
      hasn't
      worked
      for
      a
      year
      and
      a
      half
      should
      i
      just
      give
      up?
      Im
      tired
      of
      waiting
      for
      it
      to
      get
      better.
      But
      when
      things
      are
      great,
      they
      are
      so
      great.
      I
      have
      so
      many
      great
      memories
      of
      us
      laughing,
      and
      just
      enjoying
      one
      another.
      But,
      when
      things
      aren't
      great,
      they
      really
      do
      suck.
      I
      guess
      I'm
      just
      really
      confused
      and
      unsure
      what
      to
      do.
      Dating
      an
      addict
      is
      hard.
      Its
      hard
      to
      watch
      them
      run
      to
      their
      substance,
      and
      its
      hard
      watching
      them
      fall.
      This
      is
      just
      a
      mindless
      rant,
      and
      also
      my
      first
      reddit
      post.
      Please
      don't
      be
      too
      mad
      at
      me
      if
      my
      format
      isn't
      that
      of
      an
      experienced
      reddit
      user.
      I
      just
      needed
      to
      get
      this
      off
      my
      chest.

      [18

      Last
      night,
      my
      boyfriend
      and
      I
      were
      hanging
      out
      at
      his
      house.
      I
      was
      originally
      at
      a
      friends
      house,
      who
      i
      rarely
      hang
      out
      with,
      because
      I'm
      usually
      with
      him.
      But
      due
      to
      repeated
      texts
      of
      "come
      over
      now"
      "please
      don't
      leave
      me"
      "lets
      hang
      out
      now",
      I
      left
      my
      friend's
      house
      early.
      I
      arrive
      at
      his
      house,
      and
      he's
      throwing
      himself
      a
      pity
      party.
      He
      was
      saying
      how,
      "Life
      is
      awful"
      "I
      should
      just
      kill
      myself",
      I
      slowly
      began
      to
      feel
      more
      and
      more
      uncomfortable.
      I
      am
      unsure
      of
      how
      to
      respond
      to
      these
      remarks,
      and
      it
      was
      like
      he
      was
      fishing
      for
      my
      affection?
      He
      then
      began
      to
      try
      and
      "get
      me
      in
      the
      mood",
      and
      got
      even
      more
      moody
      when
      I
      didn't
      want
      to
      have
      sex.
      He
      then
      needed
      his
      inhaler,
      and
      asked
      me
      to
      look
      on
      the
      desk
      for
      him.
      When
      I
      couldn't
      find
      it
      in
      3
      seconds,
      he
      started
      going
      on
      about
      "I
      guess
      I
      just
      won't
      use
      my
      inhaler
      anymore";
      after
      digging
      around
      in
      a
      drawer,
      I
      found
      it,
      then
      he
      said,
      "This
      is
      why
      I
      *NEED*
      you.
      I'm
      too
      dumb
      to
      do
      these
      types
      of
      things
      on
      my
      own."
      He
      needs
      me
      to
      find
      an
      inhaler?
      He
      needs
      me
      to
      do
      menial
      tasks
      that
      a
      child
      could
      do?
      Then,
      we
      got
      on
      the
      topic
      of
      our
      2
      year
      anniversary
      coming
      up,
      he
      said
      he
      wanted
      to
      get
      me
      a
      ring
      that
      has
      "always"
      engraved
      on
      it.
      That
      was
      just
      about
      it
      for
      me,
      I
      said
      my
      mom
      needed
      help
      in
      the
      kitchen
      and
      left.
      Always
      and
      needing
      me?
      I
      feel
      trapped,
      and
      am
      unsure
      what
      to
      do.
      Is
      he
      acting
      childish
      and
      needy
      or
      am
      I
      afraid
      to
      be
      serious?
      Am
      i
      afraid
      for
      the
      right
      reasons?
      Is
      he
      too
      childish
      and
      too
      needy?
      Any
      comments
      helping
      me,
      or
      even
      an
      anecdotal
      advice
      to
      help
      me
      with
      this
      is
      welcomed
      and
      greatly
      appreciated.

      It

      you
      aren't
      emotionally
      satisfied,

      Thats
      what
      i
      worry
      about,
      the
      "I'll
      kill

      hand.
      thank
      you!

      It
      is
      slowly
      becoming
      more
      and
      more
      tiresome,
      we
      started
      our
      relationship
      when
      we
      were
      more
      immature,
      i
      just
      think
      I'm
      growing
      apart.
      Thank
      you
      so
      much!

      its
      hard
      to
      forget
      someone
      who
      was
      so
      important
      to
      you
      and
      who
      you
      experienced
      so
      much
      with.
      It
      is
      a
      cliche,
      but
      time
      will
      heal
      this,
      and
      you
      will
      meet
      someone
      new.
      It
      might
      be
      hard,
      but
      maybe
      not
      even
      having
      contact
      as
      friends
      might
      help
      you
      move
      on.
      Good
      luck.

      memorable
      sessions.

      gave

      an

      all
      I
      do
      is
      worry
      about
      the

      I

      do.
      It's

      and
      I
      don't
      know
      how
      to
      go
      about
      figuring

      I'm

      afraid
      I

      I've
      been
      in
      high
      school
      for
      the
      passed
      four
      years
      and
      have
      been
      told,
      if
      I
      worked
      hard,
      I
      could
      get
      into
      a
      good
      college.
      I
      have
      worked
      hard.
      I
      have
      a
      3.8
      gpa,
      not
      Harvard
      worthy,
      but
      something
      to
      be
      proud
      of.
      These
      passed
      four
      years
      I've
      studied
      for
      every
      class,
      never
      had
      a
      missing
      assignment,
      and
      busted
      my
      ass
      in
      an
      academic
      sense.
      When
      it
      came
      time
      for
      college
      applications,
      I
      thought
      I
      had
      finally
      worked
      hard
      enough
      and
      I
      would
      be
      moving
      away
      from
      home
      next
      year.
      I
      was
      excited.
      Except.
      All
      the
      colleges
      I've
      applied
      to
      have
      rejected
      me.
      I
      don't
      know
      what
      to
      do.
      Only
      my
      local
      state
      school
      has
      accepted
      me
      and
      it's
      been
      such
      a
      slap
      in
      the
      face
      to
      know
      my
      hard
      work
      hasn't
      gotten
      me
      anywhere.
      I
      could've
      made
      straight
      Cs
      and
      yielded
      these
      same
      results.
      Nights
      of
      studying
      for
      AP
      tests,
      creating
      flashcards,
      and
      doing
      my
      best
      has
      amounted
      to
      absolutely
      nothing.
      It's
      been
      a
      week
      since
      the
      school
      I
      thought
      I
      was
      going
      to
      go
      to
      rejected
      me.
      Now
      at
      school,
      I
      don't
      do
      the
      work.
      I
      don't
      care.
      Why
      should
      I
      care?
      Why
      should
      I
      continue
      to
      work
      hard
      when
      there
      is
      no
      pay
      out?
      All
      my
      hard
      work
      was
      for
      nothing
      and
      all
      I
      can
      do
      now
      is
      sign
      up
      for
      community
      college.
      Tldr;
      I
      feel
      I
      worked
      hard
      these
      passed
      four
      years,
      only
      to
      get
      denied
      from
      every
      single
      college
      I
      applied
      to.
      Thank
      you
      for
      reading.

      This
      really
      did
      help.
      I've
      talked
      it
      over
      with
      my
      parents
      and
      we
      decided
      on
      a
      community
      college
      to
      save
      money
      and
      explore
      other
      job
      options.
      I
      know
      it'll
      work
      out,
      it
      just
      is
      kinda
      hard
      I
      have

      in
      my
      friend
      group
      it
      is
      jokes
      about
      how
      specific
      it
      is.
      If
      someone
      has
      bad
      hair,
      it's
      really
      hard
      for
      me
      to
      consider
      them
      physically
      attractive.
      I
      just
      wanted
      to
      know
      if
      anyone
      else
      had
      make
      or
      break
      physical
      characteristics
      for
      considering
      someone
      attractive.

      The

      I
      used
      to
      be
      in
      the
      best
      physical
      shape.
      I
      would
      work
      out
      2
      hours
      in
      the
      morning
      then
      another
      3
      in
      the
      afternoon.
      I
      used
      to
      be
      able
      to
      run
      a
      mile
      and
      not
      feel
      winded.
      I
      stopped
      this
      routine
      about
      2
      years
      ago
      and
      since
      then
      have
      lost
      20
      pounds.
      I
      went
      back
      to
      the
      gym
      today
      and
      I
      could
      only
      last
      40
      minutes
      without
      feeling
      nauseous,
      tired,
      and
      needing
      to
      leave.
      It's
      frustrating
      to
      know
      I've
      let
      myself
      fall
      this
      deep.
      I
      need
      to
      be
      strict
      with
      myself
      again.
      I
      need
      to
      monitor
      my
      eating
      habits
      and
      I
      need
      to
      start
      pushing
      myself
      again.
      It's
      hard
      to
      walk
      out
      knowing
      I
      used
      to
      be
      there
      for
      hours
      and
      now
      I
      can
      only
      stand
      40
      minutes
      of
      a
      fairly
      easy
      work
      out.
      I
      guess
      this
      will
      be
      my
      drive
      to
      get
      back
      in
      shape.

      I
      have
      never
      enjoyed
      school.
      Whether
      it
      was
      getting
      bullied
      throughout
      elementary
      school
      and
      the
      school
      refusing
      to
      recognize
      it,
      the
      general
      horrors
      of
      middle
      school,
      or
      the
      truly
      saddening
      experience
      of
      high
      school...
      I
      have
      hated
      it
      all.
      I
      busted
      my
      ass
      for
      four
      years
      to
      get
      a
      3.8
      but
      to
      have
      no
      college
      accept
      me.
      I'm
      so
      embarrassed
      that
      I'm
      going
      to
      a
      city
      college
      while
      all
      my
      friends
      got
      into
      their
      dream
      school.
      I'm
      starting
      to
      believe
      school
      might
      not
      be
      for
      me.
      I
      really
      don't
      want
      to
      go
      through
      the
      experience
      of
      jumping
      through
      hoops
      and
      busting
      my
      ass
      for
      a
      degree
      that
      might
      not
      even
      secure
      a
      job.
      Not
      to
      mention
      the
      debt
      it'll
      land
      me
      in.
      I'm
      considering,
      against
      my
      parents
      wishes
      (they
      are
      doctors),
      going
      straight
      into
      the
      work
      force.
      I'm
      really
      considering
      selling
      real
      estate
      or
      maybe
      becoming
      a
      repairman
      of
      sorts.
      School
      has
      only
      isolated
      me
      and
      disappointed
      me.
      I
      don't
      want
      to
      do
      it
      again.
      I've
      had
      enough.
      If
      anyone
      has
      any
      advice
      it'd
      be
      appreciated.

      I'd
      prefer
      not
      to
      name
      them
      because
      they
      might
      give
      out
      where
      I
      live.
      But
      I
      applied
      to
      8.
      They
      weren't
      prestigious
      schools
      like
      Harvard
      or
      anything.
      All
      my
      teachers
      told
      me
      i
      could
      get
      into
      the
      schools
      with
      my
      gpa
      but
      it
      didnt
      happen.

      Sigh.
      I'm
      graduating
      high
      school
      and
      I
      smoke
      too.
      Every
      time
      one
      of
      my
      friends
      got
      caught
      with
      any
      drugs,
      I
      was
      ALWAYS
      the
      scapegoat.
      I'm
      not
      exaggerating.
      I'm
      going
      to
      tell
      you
      the
      lesson
      I
      wish
      I
      had
      learned
      in
      my
      junior
      year.
      People
      who
      you
      get
      fucked
      up
      with
      are
      not
      your
      friends.
      When
      push
      comes
      to
      shove
      and
      it's
      time
      to
      take
      responsibility,
      they
      will
      do
      whatever
      they
      have
      to
      to
      get
      in
      the
      least
      amount
      of
      trouble.
      It's
      not
      fair
      and
      it
      hurts
      a
      lot.
      Learn
      quickly
      who
      is
      using
      you
      for
      drugs
      and
      who
      is
      genuinely
      a
      friend.
