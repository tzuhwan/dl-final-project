      Why

      I
      bought
      something
      small
      at
      my
      local
      BAM,
      and
      then
      they
      asked
      me
      if
      I
      wanted
      three
      months
      worth
      of
      free
      magazines
      (three
      different
      magazines
      for
      three
      months).
      I
      said
      that
      I
      didn #8217;t
      want
      any
      magazines
      and
      that
      they
      would
      just
      take
      up
      space
      (I
      don #8217;t
      read
      magazines.
      I
      think
      they #8217;re
      boring
      and
      useless
      in
      today #8217;s
      digital
      world).
      However,
      he
      said
      that
      it
      was
      JUST
      the
      free
      months
      and
      I
      didn #8217;t
      want
      to
      go
      back
      and
      forth
      with
      this
      guy.
      I
      chose
      Rolling
      Stone,
      Time,
      and
      National
      Geographic
      because
      those
      seemed
      like
      ones
      that
      I
      would
      like
      or
      at
      least
      have
      an
      easier
      time
      explaining
      the
      presence
      of
      in
      my
      home.
      What
      followed
      three
      months
      of
      those
      for
      free
      (never
      really
      used
      them
      anyway)
      was
      more
      magazines.
      This
      time
      they
      weren #8217;t
      free.
      I
      have
      been
      paying
      for
      magazines
      despite
      the
      employee
      ensuring
      me
      it
      would
      just
      be
      free
      issues.
      I
      have
      probably
      paid
      about
      $70-$120
      in
      magazines
      (that #8217;s
      an
      estimate,
      it
      could
      be
      more
      or
      less)
      because
      I
      could
      only
      cancel
      one.
      The
      company
      that
      was
      charging
      me
      for
      these
      magazines
      said
      that
      only
      one
      magazine
      was
      on
      my
      account
      when
      there
      were
      three
      I
      was
      being
      charged
      for.
      The
      little
      loop,
      the
      whole
      nipple
      twister
      of
      the
      situation
      is
      that
      the
      other
      two
      were
      under
      my
      MOM #8217;s
      name.
      Like
      wtf...
      After
      finding
      that
      out,
      the
      magazine
      company
      was
      quite
      apologetic
      and
      everything
      was
      sorted
      out,
      but
      they
      still
      tried
      to
      sell
      me
      more
      magazines
      despite
      clearly
      stating
      that
      I
      didn #8217;t
      read
      magazines.
      TLDR:
      A
      Books
      A
      Million
      purchase
      that
      would
      only
      be
      about
      $20
      ended
      up
      being
      at
      least
      $90
      and
      at
      most
      $140
      because
      of
      a
      crappy
      magazine
      service
      they
      signed
      me
      up
      for.
      The
      company
      was
      charging
      my
      account
      for
      a
      different
      account
      under
      my
      mom #8217;s
      name.

      I
      know
      I #8217;m
      really
      late
      for
      this,
      but
      my
      father
      plays
      Dwarf
      Fortress
      a
      lot,
      and
      he
      has
      a
      couple
      of
      amusing
      stories
      of
      him
      going
      into
      the
      code.
      I
      haven #8217;t
      played
      the
      game.
      Basically,
      he
      had
      some
      cats
      that
      were
      multiplying
      like
      crazy
      so
      he
      manipulated
      the
      raw
      code
      of
      the
      game
      and
      it
      ended
      up
      setting
      all
      of
      the
      cats
      on
      fire,
      which
      is
      surprisingly
      similar
      to
      some
      Australian
      current
      events
      (rip
      feral
      cats,
      f
      in
      chat
      for
      all
      the
      birds
      and
      rodents
      they #8217;ve
      driven
      to
      extinction).
      He
      also
      did
      something
      similar
      to
      carps.
      I
      remember
      that
      a
      carp
      bite
      does
      more
      damage
      than
      an
      axe
      to
      the
      head
      usually
      does,
      so
      based
      on
      that
      alone
      I
      don #8217;t
      blame
      him
      at
      all.
      Edit:
      Or
      at
      least
      that #8217;s
      what
      I
      remember
      him
      telling
      me.
      This
      is
      my
      biological
      father
      who
      lives
      several
      states
      away
      he
      might
      have
      just
      been
      pulling
      my
      leg.

      I
      liked
      Tobuscus
      better
      because
      he
      relied
      more
      on
      comedic
      voices
      than
      just
      screaming.
      Plus
      at
      my
      age,
      if
      my
      parents
      walked
      in
      to
      see
       #8220;fuck #8221;
      on
      my
      computer
      screen
      in
      giant
      bold
      text
      repeatedly
      I #8217;d
      probably
      still
      be
      grounded
      to
      this
      day.

      a
      couple
      of
      newer

      his

      is
      actually
      still
      pretty

      His

      The
      first
      few
      episodes
      are
      actually
      pretty
      good
      ngl.
      A
      bit
      of
      dark
      humor
      marketed
      to
      kids.
      Shame
      they
      had
      to
      tailor
      it
      to
      kids
      because
      that #8217;s
      the
      audience
      that
      kinda
      found
      it.
      Another
      example
      of
      this
      phenomenon
      is
      Cat
      Face
      (or
      cat
      head
      or
      something),
      a
      show
      about
      a
      balloon
      with
      a
      cat
      face
      on
      it.
      The
      balloon
      would
      originally
      do
      some
      really
      edgy
      stuff
      like
      trapping
      an
      old
      woman
      in
      a
      room
      full
      of
      skeletons
      of
      previous
      victims,
      but
      then
      kids
      found
      it
      and
      they
      made
      it
      g
      rated
      material.

      grieving
      to

      a

      I #8217;m
      reading
      Ha
      Jin #8217;s
       #8220;In
      the
      Pond #8221;,
      which
      is
      about
      a
      short-tempered
      factory
      worker
      who
      just
      wants
      a
      better
      apartment
      in
      a
      socialist-like-kinda-moreso-utilitarian
      country.
      His

      don #8217;t
      want
      him
      to
      have
      this
      privilege

      and
      they
      try
      to
      just
      not
      let
      him.
      This
      book
      is
      a
      relatively
      quick
      read,
      but
      it
      is
      quite
      an
      amusing
      and
      angry
      one.
      The
      characters
      frequently
      use
      insults
      that
      are
      products
      of
      their
      culture
      which
      make
      no
      sense
      to
      ours.
      The
      book
      devolves
      into
      stranger
      and
      stranger
      stuff
      happening
      as
      our
      protagonist
      weaponizes
      his
      art
      very
      effectively
      and
      the
      owners
      of
      the
      factory
      trying
      harder

      shut

      I
      have
      three
      unique
      troop
      concepts
      to
      display,
      one
      common,
      one
      rare,
      and
      one
      epic.
      While
      I
      know
      the
      chance
      of
      these
      getting
      noticed
      is
      slim
      to
      none,
      I
      have
      a
      feeling
      that
      they
      offer
      interesting
      mechanics
      that
      would
      spice
      up
      the
      game
      a
      little
      bit.
       #8203;
      Common:
      Builder
      5
      Elixir
      Unlocks
      At:
      Builder's
      Workshop
      (duh)
      The
      Builder
      is
      a
      very
      simple
      card
      with
      a
      buff
      that
      makes
      sense
      given
      the
      builder's
      role.
      A
      builder
      knows
      where
      all
      the
      weak
      spots
      are
      on
      buildings
      (including
      crown
      towers)
      and
      thus
      do
      double
      damage.
      This
      ability
      is
      very
      powerful,
      thus
      to
      counter
      it,
      I
      made
      it
      decidedly
      weak
      against
      troops
      with
      rather
      low
      HP
      and
      attack
      damage
      for
      its
      cost.
      The
      Builder
      could
      still
      become
      a
      strong
      anti-structure
      unit
      while,
      with
      its
      flaws,
      could
      become
      a
      great
      glass
      cannon.

      Rare:
      Assault
      Knight
      4
      Elixir
      Unlocks
      At:
      Royal
      Arena
      \[Edit:
      Thinking
      about
      making
      this
      6
      Elixir\]
      Another
      simple
      card
      with
      a
      cool
      ability.
      This
      card
      is
      different
      from
      all
      others
      because
      it
      has
      not
      one
      but
      two
      weapons.
      One
      of
      the
      weapons
      is
      a
      ranged
      crossbow
      with
      a
      fast
      fire
      rate,
      and
      the
      other
      is
      a
      more
      powerful
      sword
      for
      hand-to-hand
      combat.
      The
      Assault
      Knight
      shoots
      his
      enemies
      while
      walking
      toward
      them
      for
      more
      damage.
      Another
      one
      of
      the
      key
      aspects
      of
      this
      troop
      is
      the
      speed
      of
      its
      attacks,
      shooting
      three
      times
      per
      second
      and
      slicing
      twice
      per
      second.
      One
      may
      note
      that
      the
      Valkyrie
      and
      the
      Musketeer
      are
      also
      4
      Elixir
      rare
      cards,
      which
      may
      make
      the
      ranged
      ability
      look
      too
      powerful.
      However,
      the
      range
      is
      half
      of
      that
      of
      the
      Musketeer
      and
      the
      Assault
      Knight
      only
      does
      single
      target
      attacks.
      Another
      downside
      for
      this
      troop
      is
      that
      it
      moves
      at
      a
      slow
      speed
      when
      shooting
      the
      crossbow.
      This
      is
      indeed
      another
      glass
      cannon
      of
      sorts,
      but
      it
      is
      a
      proper
      anti-troop
      troop.
      It
      is
      very
      susceptible
      to
      spells
      and
      crown
      tower
      damage,
      however,
      making
      it
      a
      terrible
      rush
      leader.

      6
      Elixir
      Unlocks
      At:
      Spooky
      Town
      (Where
      else?)
      If
      players
      get
      their
      hands
      on
      this
      card,
      many
      may
      look
      at
      the
      stats
      for
      a
      second
      and
      completely
      dismiss
      it,
      even
      refusing
      to
      upgrade
      it
      because
      it
      would
      cost
      too
      much
      of
      their
      hard-earned
      gold.
      However
      players
      who
      decide
      to
      give
      it
      a
      chance
      will
      find
      it
      to
      be
      a
      strategic
      goldmine.
      The
      stats
      of
      this
      thing
      are
      absolutely
      abysmal,
      but
      this
      spooky
      boi
      has
      a
      trick
      up
      its
      sleeve.
      Every
      time
      a
      new
      Undead
      Knight
      is
      placed,
      all
      of
      the
      old
      ones
      resurrect
      where
      they
      died.
      This
      resurrection
      works
      with
      mirrored
      Undead
      Knights
      but
      not
      clones.
      If
      an
      Undead
      Knight
      as
      much
      as
      touches
      a
      crown
      tower,
      it
      is
      in
      grave
      danger
      (pun
      definitely
      intended).
      With
      a
      new
      Undead
      Knight
      spawning,
      it
      will
      come
      back
      to
      life
      at
      full
      health
      and
      immediately
      start
      attacking
      the
      tower
      again.
      At
      the
      start
      of
      the
      game,
      this
      card
      would
      be
      a
      complete
      joke,
      however
      near
      the
      end
      of
      the
      round
      the
      joke
      will
      be
      on
      the
      defender
      as
      an
      estimated
      4-6
      of
      them
      would
      spawn
      near
      their
      towers
      without
      mirrors
      being
      involved.
      With
      mirrors,
      I
      could
      potentially
      see
      about
      7-12
      near
      the
      end
      of
      matches.

      I
      have
      a
      feeling
      these
      may
      be
      way
      too
      strong
      so
      make
      any
      suggestions
      for
      changes
      you
      would
      like.

      This
      may
      be
      a
      very
      contradictory
      opinion
      from
      literally
      everyone
      else
      in
      this
      thread
      but
      diamonds
      should
      stay
      being
      perceived
      as
      rare
      for
      as
      long
      as
      possible.
      If
      the
      DeBiers
      (I
      think)
      company
      lets
      other
      companies

      one
      of
      the
      largest
      markets
      in
      the
      world,
      jewelry,
      would
      completely
      collapse
      causing
      a
      worldwide
      economic
      depression
      of
      sorts.
      Yeah,
      we
      don #8217;t
      want
      that.

      Ooh
      I
      know
      a
      lot
      of
      these!
      Here
      are
      some
      just
      stupid
      ones
      first:
      Pedal
      Powered
      Wheelchair
      (Yes
      this
      is
      real...)
      USB
      Powered
      Pet
      Rock
      (Does
      exactly
      what
      you
      would
      expect...)
      Head
      On
      (Apply
      directly
      to
      the
      forehead...
      this
      was
      marketed
      as
      a
      way
      to
      relieve
      headaches
      I
      believe
      but
      it
      really
      did
      nothing.)
      External
      Turkey
      Roaster
      (Stop
      what
      you #8217;re
      doing
      and
      look
      up
      pictures
      of
      this
      right
      now.
      This
      thing
      is
      glorious.)
      Pizza
      Ordering
      Button
      (For
      when
      you #8217;re
      too
      lazy
      to
      just
      order
      online.)
      Car
      Exhaust
      Grill
      (You
      have
      to
      go
      somewhere
      or
      just
      burn
      gas
      to
      cook
      your
      food,
      and
      exhaust
      causes
      cancer
      so
      this
      sounds
      like
      a
      great
      idea!)
      Those
      were
      more
      dumb
      than
      impractical,
      but
      here
      are
      some
      of
      those,
      too:
      Golden
      Toilet
      Paper
      (Yes...)
      World #8217;s
      Fastest
      Motorcycle
      (500
      horsepower
      and
      nothing
      between
      you
      and
      anything
      else
      you
      could
      possible
      hit...
      oh
      and
      it #8217;s
      over
      $500,000.)
      The
      1000
      Year
      Watch
      (It
      literally
      runs
      for
      1000
      years.
      Why?)
      Solid
      Diamond
      Ring
      (This
      ring
      is
      made
      of
      nothing
      but
      diamond.
      No
      gold,
      no
      silver,
      no
      platinum,
      just
      diamond.
      Solid
      diamond.)
      The
      Kuratas
      (An
      actual
      real
      life
      mechwarrior
      suit
      available
      for
      around
      1.35
      million
      dollars.)
      Louis
      Vuitton
      Toilet
      (Yes,

      heard
      that
      right.)

      Not
      a
      teacher,
      but
      I
      have
      a
      friend
      who
      is
      one
      of
      those
      people
      with
      good
      grades
      in
      some
      of
      the
      toughest
      classes
      but
      she
      has
      absolutely
      no
      common
      sense.
      We
      all
      have
      one
      of
      those
      friends
      I
      think.
      Once
      she
      forgot
      to
      study
      for
      an
      English
      test
      in
      our
      Dual
      Enrollment
      class.
      She
      had
      the
      gall
      to
      ask
      if
      it
      could
      be
      open
      book.
      Our
      professor
      looked
      at
      her
      like
      she
      had
      lobsters
      crawling
      out
      of
      her
      ears
      and
      didn #8217;t
      even
      answer
      her.
      Just
      pretended
      he
      didn #8217;t
      hear
      it.

      Edit:
      Note
      that
      this
      post
      may
      not
      be
      as
      catastrophic
      as
      others
      but
      it #8217;s
      mildly
      amusing.
      I
      worked
      at
      a
      water
      park.
      It
      was
      really
      kinda
      boring
      because
      despite
      being
      a
       #8220;catering
      host #8221;
      I
      usually
      worked
      in
      a
      concession
      stand
      of
      sorts
      called
      the
       #8220;snack
      shack #8221;.
      This
      was
      everyone #8217;s
      least
      favorite
      job
      but
      I
      did
      find
      things
      to
      do
      like
      clean
      the
      nasty
      popcorn
      machine...
      still
      really
      boring,
      though.
      A
      lot
      of
      people
      would
      ask
      me
      for
      like
      sprite
      in
      a
      water
      cup
      and
      I
      did
      not
      oblige
      because
      I
      was
      a
      good
      boy,
      and
      I
      didn #8217;t
      want
      to
      be
      fired
      because
      that
      looks
      bad.
      Then
      I
      thought
      about
      a
      way
      to
      spice
      up
      the
      boring
      snack
      shack
      work.
      I
      put
      some
      pretzel
      salt
      in
      a
      cup
      and
      waited
      for
      the
      next
      one
      asking
      for
      free
      sprite.
      I
      gave
      him
      carbonated
      water
      in
      the
      cup
      with
      the
      salt
      and
      even
      mixed
      it
      up
      until
      it
      was
      dissolved
      without
      him
      noticing.
      He
      took
      a
      sip
      and
      violently
      spit
      it
      out
      and
      proceeded
      to
      dump
      the
      rest
      out
      all
      over
      the
      floor.
      I
      had
      to
      clean
      it
      up
      even
      though
      it
      was
      outside
      and
      probably
      would
      have
      evaporated
      anyway.

      Well,
      when
      I
      was
      a
      Cub
      Scout
      (scouting
      before
      Boy
      Scouts),
      we
      were
      on
      a
      camp
      out
      and
      everyone
      was
      being
      kinda
      dumb
      and
      climbing
      trees.
      I
      saw
      a
      branch
      that
      bent
      down
      toward
      the
      ground
      in
      the
      approximate
      shape
      of
      a
      slide
      so
      I
      got
      one
      of
      the
      dumbest
      ideas
      in
      my
      life.
      I
      slid
      down
      this
      in
      shorts,
      causing
      every
      single
      tiny
      twig
      to
      snap
      off,
      leaving
      numerous
      cuts
      on
      my
      legs.
      Then
      my
      arm
      got
      caught
      on
      another
      branch
      and
      a
      twig
      from
      that
      penetrated
      my
      right
      arm
      at
      the
      wrist
      and
      left
      a
      giant
      gash
      down
      the
      entirety
      of
      my
      forearm,
      to
      the
      inside
      of
      my
      elbow.
      I
      still
      have
      a
      scar
      from
      this.

      I
      eat
      lunch
      early.
      In
      my
      senior
      year
      of
      high
      school
      I
      had
      lunch
      at
      about
      10:00
      because
      my
      weight
      training
      class
      was
      right
      after
      lunch,
      and
      I
      haven #8217;t
      broken
      the
      habit
      yet.
      It
      hasn #8217;t
      been
      super
      long
      or
      anything
      but
      it
      is
      kinda
      strange.
      I #8217;m
      trying
      to
      right
      my
      eating
      schedule
      now.

      Jimmy
      Kimmel.
      His
      show
      is
      more
      millennial
      catering
      than
      comedy.
      There #8217;s
      like
      zero
      substance
      to
      it
      and
      he #8217;s
      a
      massive
      hypocrite.
      Of
      course
      it #8217;s
      easy
      to
      say
      that
      stuff
      like
      blackface
      is
      bad,
      but
      Kimmel
      said
      that
      when
      he
      had
      previously
      done
      it
      himself
      to
      impersonate
      a
      professional
      basketball
      player.
      When
      anyone
      tries
      to
      bring
      up
      a
      rational
      thought
      that
      just
      so
      happens
      to
      disagree
      with
      his,
      he
      immediately
      shuts
      it
      down
      as
      completely
      ludicrous.
      If
      you
      don #8217;t
      agree
      with
      me,
      that #8217;s
      fine.
      Just
      watch
      Emplemon #8217;s

      just

      and
      yeah

      him.
      Really
      don #8217;t
      want

      it,
      it

      I
      had
      sleep
      paralysis
      once
      when
      my
      parents
      walked
      into
      my
      room
      way
      too
      late
      at
      night.
      I
      saw
      a
      man
      with
      a
      mask
      and
      a
      chainsaw
      walk
      towards
      me
      and
      my
      parents
      didn #8217;t
      notice.
      It
      decapitated
      me
      and
      my
      head
      fell
      off
      my
      body
      and
      rolled
      on
      the
      floor
      (I #8217;m
      still
      seeing
      from
      the
      head #8217;s
      POV
      as
      this
      happens).
      Edit:

      A
      lot
      of
      the
      time
      my
      scariest
      dreams
      happened
      when
      I
      went
      to
      sleep
      angry
      at
      one
      or
      both
      of
      my
      parents.
      Some
      examples
      include:
      Being
      at
      my
      dad #8217;s
      funeral.
      Waking
      up
      to
      see
      my
      mother
      being
      taken
      away
      by
      people
      with
      hairnets,
      face
      masks,
      and
      lab
      coats.
      This
      had
      zero
      explanation
      at
      all.
      Me
      biting
      off
      my
      dad #8217;s
      thumb
      and
      physically
      feeling
      it
      crunch
      and
      roll
      around
      in
      my
      mouth.
      It
      felt
      like
      one
      of
      my
      molars
      had
      come
      out
      and
      was
      now
      rolling
      around
      like
      wtf.
      Seeing
      my
      parents
      be
      put
      into
      body
      bags,
      which
      were
      then
      loaded
      on
      a
      shopping
      cart
      that
      was
      pushed
      down
      a
      hill.
      I
      was
      being
      restrained
      during
      this
      so
      it
      was
      a
      feeling
      of
      powerlessness
      that
      got
      me
      there.

      In
      the
      builder
      base
      there
      are
      quite
      a
      few
      new
      and
      innovative
      ideas
      that
      I
      really
      appreciate,
      but
      I
      feel
      like
      this
      is
      another
      newer
      idea
      that
      can
      fit
      in
      perfectly
      with
      the
      builder
      base.
      The
      idea
      itself
      is
      not
      very
      complicated,
      and
      has
      various
      strategic
      options
      and
      counters
      that
      are
      uniquely
      its
      own.
      Here
      are
      the
      basic
      principles
      behind
      it:
       #8203;
      The
      decoy
      is
      a
      trap
      that
      activates
      when
      troops
      are
      within
      a
      radius
      of
      3
      tiles.
      It
      immediately
      draws
      attention
      of
      all
      troops
      within
      4
      tiles
      once
      activated
      (except
      those
      with
      a
      favorite
      target).
      The
      decoy
      has
      a
      large
      amount
      of
      health,
      but
      doesn't
      do
      much
      damage
      initially.
      It
      takes
      up
      one
      tile.
      Players
      would
      be
      able
      to
      purchase
      one
      at
      Builder
      Base
      level
      5
      and
      one
      more

       #8203;
      Decoys
      have
      five
      levels.
       #8203;
      Level
      1:
      Just
      health.
      A
      pretty
      useful
      tool
      for
      drawing
      in
      attackers
      to
      other
      traps.
      Level
      2:
      Fortified
      and
      given
      a
      wooden
      sword.
      The
      Decoy
      automatically
      spins
      and
      swings
      around
      to
      do
      some
      minor
      damage.
      No
      ranged
      attacks,
      though.
      Level
      3:
      Further
      fortified
      and
      given
      a
      better,
      iron
      sword
      Level
      4:
      Given
      a
      crossbow
      with
      surprisingly
      accurate
      shots
      and
      further
      fortified
      (range
      is
      3.5
      tiles)
      Level
      5:
      Fortified
      a
      little
      bit
      more
      and
      given
      marginally
      better
      weapons

      Edit:
      Oof,
      apparently
      decoys
      have
      already
      been
      suggested,
      but
      this
      is
      different
      enough
      that
      it
      should
      be
      okay.

      This
      happened
      about
      20
      minutes
      ago.
      Let #8217;s
      set
      the
      scene:
      I
      was
      backing
      out
      of
      my
      very
      steep
      driveway
      while
      admittedly
      kinda
      tired.
      We
      have
      a
      little
      bit
      of
      landscaping
      done
      at
      the
      bottom
      corner,
      so
      there
      are
      like
      bricks
      around
      our
      mailbox
      and
      some
      flowers.
      A
      delivery
      guy
      (I
      think
      at
      least...
      he
      may
      have
      been
      doing
      surveys
      door
      to
      door.
      We #8217;ll
      just
      call
      him
      DG)
      who
      looked
      to
      be
      about
      in
      his
      teens
      was
      standing
      at
      the
      mailbox
      to
      stay
      out
      of
      the
      way.
      Alright,
      so
      while
      backing
      out
      of
      my
      driveway,
      my
      front
      bumper
      got
      caught
      on
      top
      of
      one
      of
      the
      bricks
      that
      was
      sticking
      out.
      I
      thought
      it
      was
      just
      a
      scratch
      and
      I
      was
      in
      a
      bit
      of
      a
      hurry
      so
      I
      kept
      going...
      until
      I
      saw
      the
      look
      on
      DG #8217;s
      face.
      DG
      was
      looking
      like
      pretty
      much
      everyone
      who
      reacts
      to
      anything
      in
      your
      stereotypical
      WorldStarHipHop
      video.
      That
      was
      the
      moment
      I
      knew
      I
      fucked
      up.
      I
      stopped
      my
      car
      immediately
      to
      see
      that
      THE
      ENTIRE
      FRONT
      OF
      MY
      FUCKING
      CAR
      POPPED
      OFF.
      It
      was
      being
      held
      on
      by
      one
      singular
      cord.
      Still
      kinda
      tired,
      I
      reluctantly
      took
      off
      the
      front
      bumper
      with
      a
      little
      help.
      Took
      the
      front
      of
      my
      car
      inside,
      and
      drove
      it
      to
      where
      I
      was
      going.
      It
      only
      really
      hit
      me
      like
      halfway
      through
      my
      drive
      how
      much
      it
      would
      probably
      cost.
      I
      have
      pictures
      for
      anyone
      interested.
      But
      anyways,
      kudos
      to
      DG.
      Without
      his
      reaction,
      I
      probably
      would
      have
      kept
      driving
      and
      completely
      destroyed
      the
      front
      of
      my
      car.
      TL;DR:
      Basically
      I
      completely
      destroyed
      the
      front
      of
      my
      car
      being
      an
      idiot.

      1.
      Sadly
      no,
      stuff
      actually
      snapped
      so
      I
      can #8217;t
      fix
      it
      for
      now.
      2.
      Want
      really
      worrying
      about
      fixing
      the
      problem
      but
      my
      parents
      reaction.
      This
      is
      going
      to
      cost
      around
      $2000.

      Sorry
      I #8217;m
      a
      little
      late.
      I
      have
      nightmares
      very
      often.
      Here
      is
      one
      that
      I
      remember
      the
      most:
      I
      was
      in
      the
      gymnasium
      of
      a
      church
      (that
      I
      went
      to)
      where
      all
      my
      friends
      and
      I
      were
      surrounded
      by
      some
      terrorists
      of
      some
      sort.
      Somehow
      I
      managed
      to
      escape
      because
      they
      didn #8217;t
      see
      or
      guard
      some
      side
      door.
      I
      was
      trying
      to
      get
      away
      when
      I
      saw
      my
      parents
      outside.
      A
      man
      I
      couldn #8217;t
      see
      grabbed
      my
      arms
      behind
      my
      back.
      Two
      other
      men
      put
      bags
      over
      my
      parents
      heads
      and
      threw
      them
      in
      a
      shopping
      cart.
      That
      cart
      was
      pushed
      down
      a
      hill,
      picking
      up
      a
      lot
      of
      speed
      until
      it
      hit
      a
      parked
      car
      at
      the
      bottom
      of
      the
      hill.
      The
      shopping
      cart
      realistically
      hit
      the
      car
      at
      a
      high
      force,
      launching
      my
      parents
      bodies
      over
      the
      car.
      And
      I
      was
      held
      from
      behind
      to
      watch
      all
      of
      this...

      I #8217;d
      pick
      the
      car.
      I
      know
      how
      to
      survive
      being
      hit
      a
      pedestrian
      by
      most
      cars
      so
      as
      long
      as
      it #8217;s
      not
      a
      school
      bus
      I #8217;d
      be
      fine,
      and
      it
      would
      be
      just
      one
      blow.
      Then
      I #8217;d
      buy
      the
      car.
      That
      car.
      You
      heard
      me
      right.
      If
      people
      are
      talking
      shit
      and
      acting
      all
      tough
      you
      can
      just
      be
      like
      :
       #8220;Hey
      do
      you
      see
      my
      car
      right
      there #8221;
       #8220;Uhh...
      yeah #8221;
       #8220;Someone
      hit
      me
      full
      speed
      with
      that
      car,
      then
      I
      bought
      it,

      I #8217;m
      late,
      but
      here #8217;s
      a
      good
      one!
      There
      is
      a
      commonly
      followed
      rule
      at
      most
      snow
      tubing
      places
      now
      which
      was
      only
      in
      place
      in
      certain
      locations
      before.
      My
      family
      made
      that
      common
      practice
      by
      doing
      one
      of
      the
      biggest
      and
      most
      stupid
      mistakes
      we
      have
      ever
      made.
      Basically,
      my
      whole
      family
      (around
      20
      people)
      all
      thought
      it
      would
      be
      a
      great
      idea
      to
      grab
      other
      people #8217;s
      handles,
      thus
      joining
      all
      the
      tubes
      together.
      Even
      though
      I
      was
      a
      kid,
      I
      remember
      this
      vividly.
      Basically
      we
      had
      such
      a
      high
      inertia
      when
      we
      were
      all
      put
      together
      that
      the
      short
      barrier
      of
      snow
      at
      the
      end
      didn #8217;t
      stop
      us.
      We
      plowed
      right
      through
      that
      shit.
      Then
      we
      kept
      going...
      hitting
      a
      chain
      link
      fence
      with
      enough
      force
      to
      bend
      it
      into
      a
      ramp
      of
      sorts,
      we
      lost
      control
      and
      flew
      down
      a
      steep
      hill
      with
      the
      parking
      lot
      at
      the
      bottom.
      I
      landed
      upside-down
      near
      the
      top
      without
      injuries,
      but
      one
      member
      wasn #8217;t
      as
      fortunate
      and
      twisted
      an
      ankle.
      That
      was
      surprisingly
      the
      only
      real
      injury
      of
      the
      whole
      situation.
      Looking
      back
      on
      it,
      while
      it
      wasn #8217;t
      too
      bad
      it
      could
      have
      been
      absolutely
      terrible.
      Several
      of
      my
      family
      members
      could
      have
      been
      seriously
      injured
      or
      even
      killed.
      My
      Uncle
      has
      a
      video
      of
      it,
      and
      we
      eventually
      want
      to
      send
      it
      to
      America #8217;s
      Funniest
      Home
      Videos,
      but
      it #8217;s
      somewhere
      among
      his
      gigabytes
      of
      photos
      and
      videos
      that
      he
      uses
      for
      his
      work
      as
      a
      photographer.
      Tl;dr:
      My
      family
      almost
      killed
      people
      during
      snow
      tubing.

      Reddit,
      my
      time
      has
      come!
      Most
      of
      my
      dreams
      are
      nightmares
      so
      just
      bear
      with
      me
      I #8217;ll
      give
      a
      couple
      disturbing
      ones.
      (On
      mobile,
      sorry
      for
      formatting.
      1.
      I
      was
      a
      baby
      again
      and
      my
      dad
      kept
      shoving
      his
      thumb
      in
      my
      mouth
      and
      it
      really
      annoyed
      me.
      I
      bit
      off
      my
      dad #8217;s
      thumb
      and
      could
      feel
      the
      end
      of
      it
      roll
      around
      in
      my
      mouth.
      2.
      I
      was
      in
      a
      mall
      and
      literally
      everything
      was
      fine.
      Like
      nothing
      would #8217;ve
      signaled
      this
      at
      all.
      Suddenly
      over
      loudspeakers,
      everyone
      is
      told
      to
      get
      down
      because
      someone
      had
      a
      gun.
      I
      then
      briefly
      saw
      this
      one
      guy #8217;s
      pistol.
      Trying
      to
      get
      people
      to
      move
      out
      of
      his
      line
      of
      sight,
      he
      noticed
      me
      communicating
      with
      others
      and
      thought
      I
      was
      telling
      them
      all
      he
      had
      a
      gun.
      Then
      he
      put
      it
      against
      my
      temple
      and
      I
      cried
      until
      I
      woke
      up.
      3.
      This
      one
      is
      similar
      to
      the
      last
      one
      but
      I
      was
      at
      a
      church
      function
      and
      I
      had
      this
      nightmare
      when
      I
      was
      younger.
      Terrorists
      or
      just
      church
      shooters
      in
      general
      gathered
      everyone
      in
      the
      middle
      of
      the
      gymnasium.
      We
      were
      surrounded,
      and
      I
      didn #8217;t
      know
      where
      my
      parents
      were.
      I
      somehow
      sneaked
      outside
      to
      be
      grabbed
      and
      then
      I
      had
      to
      watch
      my
      parents
      be
      loaded
      into
      a
      shopping
      cart
      with
      bags
      over
      their
      heads.
      It
      was
      pushed
      down
      a
      hill
      where
      it
      gained
      speed
      until
      it
      hit
      a
      parked
      car.
      Their
      bodies
      flew
      and
      had
      some
      definitely
      fatal
      impacts
      on
      the
      car
      and
      on
      the
      ground.
      All
      while
      I
      was
      being
      restrained
      and
      forced
      to
      watch.
      4.
      I
      had
      this
      nightmare
      multiple
      times
      in
      the
      same
      night,
      which
      was
      what
      made
      this
      bizarre
      nightmare
      actually
      scary.
      I
      was
      sitting
      in
      my
      high
      school #8217;s
      cafeteria
      with
      a
      strange
      old
      lady
      sitting
      next
      to
      me.
      I
      don #8217;t
      know
      how
      but
      she
      looked
      eerily
      familiar.
      Suddenly
      a
      black
      vortex
      like
      a
      black
      hole
      opened
      above
      us,
      causing
      me
      to
      avert
      my
      attention.
      Every
      table
      except
      for
      ours
      got
      sucked
      into
      the
      black
      hole
      like
      structure.
      It
      was
      still
      open,
      and
      I
      looked
      back
      at
      the
      old
      lady
      and
      then
      she
      jumpscared
      me
      with
      a
      quickly
      transforming
      face.
      Basically
      her
      mouth
      opened
      like
      in
      one
      of
      those
      source
      films
      and
      her
      eyes
      rolled
      up.
      I
      immediately
      woke
      up
      and
      fell
      back
      asleep.
      I
      then
      had
      the
      same
      nightmare
      in
      which
      I
      woke
      up
      from
      it
      three
      or
      four
      times
      in
      a
      row,
      but
      each
      time
      it
      almost
      got
      worse
      as
      when
      I
      looked
      back
      at
      the
      old
      lady
      she
      didn #8217;t
      jump
      scare
      me
      immediately,
      she
      would
      like
      fake
      me
      out
      my
      slightly
      opening
      her
      mouth
      and
      closing
      it
      and
      stuff.
      That
      whole
      situation
      was
      a
      huge
      nope.

      My
      friend
      has
      leukemia.
      He #8217;s
      fairly
      young
      (16-25).
      I #8217;m
      not
      going
      to
      elaborate
      much
      on
      his
      situation
      or
      who
      he
      really
      is
      for
      fear
      of
      identifying
      him,
      but
      that #8217;s
      been
      pretty
      hard
      especially
      because
      it #8217;s
      in
      his
      bones.
      It #8217;s
      already
      down
      to
      about
      30%
      though,
      fortunately.
      It #8217;s
      still
      scaring
      me
      though
      because
      cancer
      at
      a
      younger
      age
      is
      something
      that
      everyone
      hears
      about
      but
      you
      feel
      detached
      from
      it
      because
      you
      think
      it
      will
      never
      happen
      to
      you
      or
      a
      friend
      or
      someone
      you
      love.
      But
      then
      something
      like
      this
      happens
      and
      reminds
      you
      that
      reality
      is
      unbiased
      in
      the
      coldest
      of
      ways.

      hecking

      a

      that
      is
      full

      the

      will
      evaporate
      inside

      cactus
      instantly,
      building
      up
      pressure
      and
      creating
      a
      deadly
      explosion.

      I

      been
      eating
      my

      for
      a

      When

      first
      actually
      caught
      him,
      he
      locked
      eyes
      with
      me
      and
      just
      continued
      eating
      without
      blinking
      once.
      What
      a
      psychopath...
      I
      mean
      that #8217;s

      If
      it #8217;s
      like
      homemade/house
      made
      then
      I #8217;ll
      probably
      like
      it.
      Once
      I
      was
      visiting
      Maine
      or
      Pennsylvania
      and
      this
      one
      restaurant
      up
      there
      had
      ketchup
      that
      was
      almost
      literally
      the
      best
      thing
      I #8217;d
      ever
      tasted.
      I
      can #8217;t
      remember
      what
      it
      was
      called
      but
      it #8217;s
      logo
      looked
      like
      an
      owl.
      So
      yeah
      100%
      good
      in
      homemade,
      just
      not
      a
      fan
      store
      ketchup
      or
      name
      brand
      ketchup.

      Addiction
      is
      a
      very
      complicated
      and
      serious
      issue,
      a
      lot
      bigger
      of
      a
      problem
      than
      a
      reddit
      post
      can
      solve,
      but
      I
      think
      this
      may
      help
      a
      couple
      of
      people.
      First,
      see
      if
      you
      can
      go
      without
      what
      you
      are
      addicted
      to
      for
      a
      day,
      then
      two
      days,
      etc.
      If
      you
      mess
      up
      on
      one
      or
      feel
      like
      you
      need
      more
      time,
      repeat
      the
      increment
      that
      you
      were
      on.
      IMPORTANT:
      This
      doesn #8217;t
      work
      for
      many
      substances
      that
      have
      a
      fast
      withdrawal
      time.
      This
      method
      also
      won #8217;t
      be
      the
      best
      for
      everyone.
      It
      worked
      for
      me,
      though.

      Book
      wise,
      I #8217;d
      have
      to
      say
      House
      of
      Leaves.
      I
      mean
      I #8217;m
      usually
      not
      a
      big
      fan
      of
      books
      because
      they #8217;re
      too
       #8220;passive #8221;
      it #8217;s
      just
      black
      text
      on
      a
      white
      page.
      However,
      House
      of
      Leaves
      requires
      that
      you
      really
      get
      involved
      in
      the
      reading
      of
      it.
      Certain
      words
      are
      color
      coded,
      certain
      passages
      are
      stitched
      together
      sideways,
      in
      boxes,
      upside
      down,
      making
      pictures
      with
      text,
      text
      in
      different
      languages
      or
      Braille
      that
      you
      have
      to
      decipher,
      etc.
      If
      you
      are
      bored
      of
      reading
      books
      because
      the
      experience
      is
      too
       #8220;passive #8221;
      or
       #8220;simple #8221;
      I
      recommend
      you
      read
      a
      chapter
      of
      this
      book
      every
      night.
      It #8217;s
      supposed
      to
      be
      a
      slow
      burn,
      but
      damn
      is
      it
      ever
      a
      burn.
      This
      is
      the
      scariest,
      most
      disorienting
      book
      I
      have
      ever
      read.

      When

      strikes
      a
      cactus
      that

      like

      you

      certain
      people
      in
      certain
      locations

      watchtowers
      so
      it
      focuses
      more
      on
      stealth
      than
      combat.

      My
      high
      school
      was
      a
      Christian
      school,
      and
      we
      had
      chapel.
      Usually
      the
      messages
      were
      good
      and
      we
      occasionally
      got
      guest
      speakers.
      They
      were
      all
      good
      except
      this
      one...
      Into
      our
      HIGH
      SCHOOL
      walks
      a
      kindergarten
      teacher
      from
      another
      school.
      She
      starts
      playing
      kids
      music
      and
      dancing
      like
      an
      idiot.
      Absolutely
      nobody
      was
      having
      it
      especially
      because
      she
      was
      tying
      to
      act
      like
      super
      country
      (our
      school
      was
      in
      Tennessee
      but
      we
      were
      by
      no
      means
      country
      and
      this
      imitation
      was
      offensively
      bad).
      It #8217;s
      almost
      like
      she
      didn #8217;t
      know
      she
      was
      doing
      chapel
      for
      a
      HIGH
      SCHOOL.
      It
      was
      just
      as
      bad
      if
      not
      worse
      than
      that
      clip
      of
      Ninja
      trying
      to
      get
      people
      to
      floss
      on
      Times
      Square.
      The
      worst
      part
      was
      even
      though
      she
      saw
      nobody
      was
      getting
      into
      it
      and
      we
      were
      all
      like
      15-18,
      she
      just
      kept
      going
      and
      going
      far
      past
      the
      time
      chapel
      was
      supposed
      to
      end.

      There #8217;s

      This
      is
      kinda
      stretching
      it
      but
      it
      was
      in
      food
      service
      when
      I
      worked
      at
      a
      water
      park.
      I
      was
      in
      catering,
      and
      we
      all
      had
      to
      wear
      hats.
      The
      water
      park
      made
      us
      buy
      our
      own
      matching
      hats
      for
      a
      ridiculously
      high
      price
      (roughly
      $30)
      when
      we
      were
      being
      paid
      7.25
      an
      hour.
      Obviously
      I
      just
      didn #8217;t
      get
      one.
      When
      the
      health
      inspectors
      came,
      an
      employee
      just
      ran
      in
      who
      was
      like
      on
      watch
      and
      yelled
      that
      they
      were
      here.
      Suddenly
      everyone
      else
      was
      like
       #8220;TOAOFriedPickleBoi,
      get
      your
      ass
      out
      of
      here! #8221;
      And
      I
      ran
      out
      of
      the
      building
      where
      I
      was
      preparing
      mass-produced
      frozen
      barbecue
      into
      this
      field
      and
      hid.

      Okay
      I #8217;ll
      say
      the
      title
      and
      do
      some
      explaining:
      The
      Avengers.
      But
      oh
      a
      plot
      twist,
      this
      is
      not
      the
      Avengers
      you #8217;re
      thinking
      of,
      but
      a
      shitty
      90 #8217;s
      spy
      movie
      based
      on
      a
      show
      from
      the
      60 #8217;s.
      I
      recorded
      it
      when
      I
      had
      ATT
      U-Verse
      thinking
      it
      was...
      you
      know,
      THE
      AVENGERS!
      The
      whole
      movie
      played
      out
      like
      the
      smell
      of
      burnt
      popcorn.
      It
      was
      bad,
      and
      there
      was
      the
      disappointment
      in
      knowing
      that
      you
      could #8217;ve
      had
      popcorn.
      The
      only
      enjoyable
      part
      of
      the
      movie
      is
      when
      a
      random
      grandma
      just
      pulled
      a
      machine
      gun
      from
      nowhere.
      That
      made
      me
      die
      laughing.

      Yeah
      but
      I
      placed
      it
      under
      a
      second
      block
      and
      attached
      it
      to
      a
      single
      pulse
      maker
      which
      is
      powered
      by
      a
      daylight
      sensor.
      When
      he
      breaks
      the
      top
      block
      he
      just
      sees
      another
      block
      underneath
      it
      and
      not
      a
      piston
      so
      he
      just
      assumes
      that
      I
      keep
      manually
      moving
      it
      or
      an
      enderman
      messed
      it
      up
      or

      I
      work
      at
      a
      boat
      dock.
      This
      one
      guy
      asked
      for
      help
      connecting
      his
      Bluetooth.
      Pretty
      common.
      But
      he
      already
      had
      like
      the
      other
      30
      boats
      on
      there
      and
      he
      was
      spending
      20
      minutes
      trying
      to
      find
      the
      right
      one.
      I
      mentioned
      that
      he
      could
      plug
      in
      his
      phone
      and
      that
      would
      work
      just
      fine,
      but
      he
      said
       #8220;No,
      Bluetooth
      is
      easier. #8221;
      And
      proceeded
      to
      struggle
      for
      another
      10
      minutes.
      Plugging
      in
      the
      phone
      would
      take
      about
      10
      seconds.
      (He
      definitely
      had
      a
      plug
      with
      him,
      he
      told
      me
      so.)

      and

      Jason
      Bourne
      (2016).
      I
      hadn #8217;t
      seen
      the
      other
      movies
      but
      I
      knew
      what
      Jason
      Bourne #8217;s
      basic
      story
      and
      stuff.
      But,
      the
      acting
      was
      bad
      and
      so
      was
      the
      writing.
      Also,
      I
      was
      kinda
      confused
      because
      I
      hadn #8217;t
      seen
      the
      other
      ones
      but
      I
      guess
      that #8217;s
      my
      fault.

      Yeah
      I
      do
      have
      a
      lot
      of
      respect
      for
      Blue
      Album

      I #8217;m

      just
      because
      it

      emotion
      in
      it.

      at
      about

      She

      I #8217;d

      some

      Let #8217;s

      their
      name
      is

      who
      is
      an

      She

      your
      luggage
      is
      in
      an

      compartment. #8221;
      Then
      everyone
      did
      the
      most

      part
      of

      I
      wouldn #8217;t
      have
      Supreme
      Court
      Justices
      be
      Justices
      for
      life.
      There
      was
      this
      one
      justice
      who
      had
      to
      be
      like
      wheeled
      in
      on
      a
      wheelchair
      because
      he/she
      didn #8217;t
      want
      to
      give
      up
      his/her
      title.
      She
      couldn #8217;t
      walk
      and
      all
      of
      her
      senses
      (and
      her
      memory)
      were
      deteriorating
      past
      the
      point
      that
      she
      could
      validly
      study
      or
      especially
      vote.
      I
      would
      think
      having
      a
      justice
      appointed
      every
      year
      (meaning
      nine
      year
      terms)
      would
      be
      pretty
      good.
      In
      addition
      to
      this,
      other
      judges
      could
      almost
      unanimously
      vote
      (at
      least
      seven
      out
      of
      the
      other
      eight)
      one
      member
      out
      per
      five
      years.
      That
      means
      when
      someone
      is
      no
      longer
      able
      to
      be
      a
      Supreme
      Court
      Justice,
      they
      won #8217;t.
      Simple
      as
      that.

      I
      was
      in
      a
      Sailor
      Moon
      club
      for
      some
      reason...
      even
      though
      I
      haven #8217;t
      seen
      a
      single
      episode
      of
      Sailor
      Moon.
      If
      someone
      held
      a
      gun
      to
      my
      head
      and
      told
      me
      to
      frantically
      guess
      the
      main
      character
      of
      Sailor
      Moon
      I #8217;d
      just
      say
      Sailor
      Moon,
      which
      is
      probably
      wrong.
      Apparently
      I
      was
      so
      deep
      in
      this
      club
      that
      I
      was
      on
      an
      international
      trip
      to
      Japan
      with
      them.

      Of
      course,
      seasoning
      is
      important,
      but
      we
      heavily
      emphasize
      the
      meats
      by
      getting
      a

      weird
      with
      it.
      Not

      My
      Minecraft
      world
      where
      I
      made
      what
      is
      probably
      the
      largest
      boat
      race
      track
      with
      water...
      ever.
      I
      made
      it
      on
      an
      amplified
      world
      and
      just
      snaked
      the
      track
      through
      all
      the
      cool
      land
      formations.
      It
      was
      big.
      Like
      REALLY
      big.
      It
      had
      giant
      towers
      with
      multiple
      complicated
      paths
      and
      stuff.
      Several
      waterfalls
      and
      boat
      elevators
      with
      bubble
      columns,
      too!
      It
      took
      all
      year
      to
      make
      but
      then
      someone
      walked
      on
      my
      charger
      at
      school
      and
      it
      fucked
      up
      not
      the
      charger
      but
      the
      part
      of
      the
      computer
      you
      plug
      the
      charger
      into.
      I
      managed
      to
      upload
      pictures
      to
      planetminecraft
      but
      the
      world
      upload
      failed
      at
      literally
      the
      worst
      possible
      time.

      So
      at
      stores
      like
      Sams
      Club
      and
      Costco
      there
      are
      these
      giant
      bags
      of
      Krusteaz
      pancake
      mix.
      I
      would
      recommend
      using
      them
      if
      you #8217;re
      feeding
      a
      large
      group
      of
      people
      because
      the
      price
      of
      food
      per
      person
      will
      be
      equal
      to
      or
      less
      than
      a
      dollar
      with
      enough
      people.
      Oh,
      and
      they #8217;re
      REALLY
      good.

      Ethiopian
      food
      is
      really
      good.
      I #8217;d
      say
      it #8217;s
      closest
      to
      Indian
      or
      *other*
      African
      food
      due
      to
      the

      Note:
      Have
      a
      friend
      with
      you.
      Pocket
      Tanks
      (Free
      Edition
      or
      Deluxe,
      whatever
      you #8217;re
      feeling)
      is
      a
      great
      game
      similar
      to
      Shellshock
      Live.
      In
      fact,
      it
      was
      Shellshock
      Live
      before
      there
      was
      Shellshock
      Live.
      If
      you
      get
      all
      of
      the
      weapons
      packs,
      it #8217;s
      a
      fairly
      expensive
      game,
      but
      it #8217;s
      very
      expansive
      for
      when
      it
      came
      out
      (14
      years
      before
      Shellshock
      Live)
      and
      it #8217;s
      a
      lot
      of
      fun
      if
      you
      know
      what
      you #8217;re
      doing.
      I
      recommend
      you
      start
      with
      the
      Free
      Edition
      to
      learn
      the
      mechanics
      before
      you
      spend
      money.
      But
      anyways,
      it #8217;s
      always
      been
      a
      favorite
      of
      mine.
      While
      it
      does
      have
      some
      flaws
      and
      slightly
      broken
      weapons,
      most
      of
      them
      revolve
      around
      a
       #8220;more
      skill,
      more
      points #8221;
      system
      that #8217;s
      really
      fun.

      Operation
      Ivy-
      This
      is
      arguably
      one
      of
      the
      most
      influential
      punk
      bands
      ever
      as
      their
      unique
      sound
      inspired
      lots
      of
      big
      bands
      and
      artists
      like
      Rancid,
      Green
      Day,
      Sublime,
      311,
      etc.
      Also,
      Operation
      Ivy #8217;s
      unique
      mix
      of
      hardcore
      punk
      and
      reggae
      is
      still
      a
      relatively
      fresh
      sound
      today
      despite
      their
      only
      album #8217;s
      very
      raw
      recordings.

      Legalizing
      specific
      drugs.
      I
      thought
      that
      would
      be
      a
      very
      bad
      idea
      for
      obvious
      reasons
      but
      it
      gets
      substances
      which
      are
      not
      very
      dangerous
      in
      their
      pure
      form
      like
      MDMA
      off
      of
      the
      streets
      where
      they
      are
      very
      easily
      and
      commonly
      laced.

      I
      present
      to
      you:
      **-=The
      Forever
      Stamp=-**
       #8203;
      **Rank:**
      S
      **Unlocks:**
      Buy
      from
      Professor
      Goopton
      for
      \~35
      Credits
      **Appearance:**
      Looks
      like
      a
      stamp
      with
      an
      American
      flag
      on
      it.
      **Splash
      text
      on
      pickup:**
      Adjusts
      for
      Inflation
      **Description:**
      Adjusts
      power
      of
      weapons
      and
      shop
      prices
      per
      floor.
      **Effect
      (Detailed):**
      This
      item
      effects
      both
      floor
      shops
      and
      your
      guns.
       #8203;
      **Shop:**
      Everything
      in
      the
      shop
      (or
      sold
      by
      other
      NPCs)
      on
      each
      floor #8217;s
      price
      remains
      the
      same
      as
      it
      would
      be
      on
      floor
      one.
      For
      example,
      keys
      would
      always
      cost
      25
      casings
      no
      matter
      which
      floor
      you
      are
      on,
      and
      full
      hearts
      will
      always
      be
      30.
      While
      this
      discount
      is
      pretty
      nice,
      it #8217;s
      the
      combination
      of
      this
      the
      gun
      part
      which
      makes
      it
      a
      S
      tier.
       #8203;
      **Guns:**
      Alright,
      here #8217;s
      where
      it
      gets
      interesting.
      Using
      both
      the
      health
      of
      bullet
      kin
      and
      shotgun
      kin,
      I
      have
      determined
      conversion
      rates
      that
      would
      make
      your
      guns
      feel
      just
      as
      powerful
      on
      each
      floor.
      Basically,
      in
      the
       gt;!Oubliette! lt;,
      your
      guns
      are
      powered
      up
      by
      1.33x,
      guns
      in
      the
      Gungeon
      Proper
      would
      be
      powered
      up
      by
      1.3x,
      guns
      in
      the
       gt;!Abbey! lt;
      would
      be
      powered
      up
      by
      1.66x,
      guns
      in
      the
      mine
      would
      be
      powered
      up
      by
      1.6x,
      guns
      in
      the
      Hollow
      would
      be
      powered
      up
      by
      1.85x,
      and
      guns
      in
      the
      Forge
      and
      beyond
      would
      be
      powered
      up
      by
      2.1x.
      That
      means
      that
      one
      would
      always
      be
      able
      to
      take
      out
      a
      bullet
      kin
      in
      three
      shots
      of
      a
      starting
      weapon
      (unless
      you
      have
      certain
      characters),
      or
      take
      out
      a
      red
      shotgun
      kin
      with
      two
      crossbow
      shots
      or
      point
      blank
      sawed-off
      shots.
       #8203;
      Ultimately,
      these
      combined
      effects
      would
      definitely
      make
      the
      game
      a
      lot
      easier,
      thus
      the
      high
      rank.
      People
      may
      initially
      be
      pissed
      to
      get
      a
      stamp
      instead
      of
      a
      cool
      gun,
      but
      they
      would
      eventually
      discover
      how
      well
      this
      item
      can
      carry
      a
      run.
      I
      was
      debating
      between
      A
      and
      S
      tier,
      and
      I
      think
      that
      S
      tier
      fits
      because
      even
      though
      it
      isn #8217;t
      anywhere
      near
      as
      powerful
      as
      Platinum
      Bullets
      (comparing
      a
      potential
      2.1x
      DPS
      to
      a
      potential
      9x
      DPS),
      it
      still
      does
      a
      lot
      to
      boost
      your
      power
      as
      you
      go
      deeper
      and
      the
      shop
      thing
      really
      is
      a
      nice
      added
      bonus
      that
      makes
      this
      overpowered
      at
      high
      floors.

      Thanks,
      man!
      I
      was
      on
      the
      fence
      for
      A
      tier
      and
      S
      tier.
      Now
      that
      I
      think
      about
      it,
      the
      shop
      thing
      is
      really
      powerful.
      However,
      I
      just
      don #8217;t
      know
      if
      it #8217;s
      strong
      enough
      to
      be
      placed
      besides
      Platinum
      Bullets
      and
      Blank
      Bullets
      remembering
      that
      it
      takes
      until
      the
      forge
      to
      get
      to
      2.1x
      damage.
      I #8217;ll
      just
      have
      to
      wait
      for
      a
      little
      more
      feedback
      first.

      The
      Bullet
      Hell
      would
      be
      the
      same
      damage
      bonus
      as
      the
      Forge.
      NPC
      shops
      would
      also
      have
      their
      prices
      adjusted
      to
      [Bello #8217;s
      Prices
      on
      the
      first
      floor.](https://enterthegungeon.gamepedia.com/Shop)
      The
      keys
      used
      for
      Flynt #8217;s
      shop
      wouldn #8217;t
      necessarily
      change.
      The
      Vampire
      would
      always
      give
      you
      20
      casings
      for
      half
      a
      heart.

      yes!
      I

      even
      think

      I

      the
      reload

      Probably
      no
      decrease
      for
      the
      tax
      because
      that

      and

      which
      would
      be
      a
      bit
      too
      complex.
      If

      think
      of
      how
      the
      Forever
      Stamp

      I
      like
      the
      eagle
      idea,
      but
      I #8217;ve
      got

      think
      of
      a
      way
      to
      make
      it
      as
      over-the-top
      American
      as
      possible.
      What
      if
      the
      eagle
      was
      wearing
      an
      American
      flag
      hat
      and
      shooting
      fireworks?
      I
      really
      like
      the
      Stars
      and
      Stripes
      name.

      What #8217;s
      the
      most
      morbid
      story
      from
      work?
      I
      work
      at
      a
      boat
      rental
      company.
      We
      have
      helmets
      for
      a
      very
      morbid
      reason.
      Basically,
      a
      father
      who
      was
      a
      regular
      took
      his
      kids
      out
      to
      go
      wake
      boarding.
      One
      of
      the
      kids
      died
      from
      a
      head
      injury,
      which
      is
      really
      sad.
      It
      was
      nice
      of
      him
      to
      give
      us
      the
      helmets,
      but
      what
      happens
      next
      is
      pretty
      fucked
      up.
      Basically
      the
      guy
      rents
      the
      exact
      same
      boat
      the
      next
      day
      and
      goes
      wake
      boarding
      with
      his
      friends.
      He
      doesn #8217;t
      even
      grab
      one
      of
      his
      own
      helmets.
      We
      have
      a
      shack
      with
      a
      lot
      of
      supplies
      and
      life
      jackets,
      etc.
      These
      helmets
      are
      hanging
      over
      our
      heads
      from
      the
      relatively
      short
      ceiling
      as
      a
      constant
      reminder.

      Idk
      if
      it
      causes
      cancer
      but
      if
      you
      reuse
      plastic
      bottles
      for
      long
      enough,
      the
      plastic
      will
      start
      to
      leach
      into
      the
      water.
      That
      could
      cause
      some
      problems,
      but
      idk
      about
      cancer...

      I #8217;d
      get
      a
      hydroflask.
      They #8217;re
      just
      a
      bit
      pricey
      but
      they #8217;re
      vacuum
      insulated
      like
      Yetis
      (which
      are
      way
      more
      pricey...).
      If
      you
      want
      something
      cheaper
      that
      works
      just
      as
      well
      as
      both,
      go
      to
      amazon
      and
      search
      for
      Ironflask,
      they
      make
      similar
      things
      with
      vacuum
      insulation
      that #8217;s
      really
      nice
      for
      as
      low
      as
      roughly
      $20

      Iron
      Flask
      is
      a
      brand
      similar
      to
      hydro
      flask.
      I
      actually

      Iron
      Flask #8217;s
      design
      better.
      It
      looks
      really
      sleek.
      Idk
      about
      durability
      differences
      though.
      And
      yes
      those

      They #8217;re
      reusable
      water
      bottles
      with
      amazing
      insulation.
      You
      can
      keep
      ice
      in
      those
      frozen
      for
      a

      So
      no,
      I

      think
      they
      are.

      Sure,
      some
      products
      also
      have
      insulation,
      but
      vacuum
      insulation
      is
      kinda
      pricey
      to
      do.
      It
      works
      a
      lot
      better,
      though.
      I #8217;d
      say
      Yetis
      are
      gimmicks
      because
      they #8217;re
      obviously
      overpriced
      based
      on
      brand
      name,
      but
      comparing
      Yeti
      VBS
      Iron
      flask
      is
      like
      $45-50
      vs
      $20.
      Iron
      flask
      is
      the
      best
      less
      expensive
      version
      of
      Yeti
      right
      now.

      Okay,
      that
      is
      indeed
      a
      much
      better
      price
      at
      around
      10
      USD.
      I
      am
      that
      only

      in
      the
      UK?

      The
      former
      Nestle
      CEO.
      The
      new
      one
      is
      still
      bad,
      but
      the
      old
      one
      was
      worse.
      In
      fact,
      the
      old
      Nestle
      CEO
      was
      literally
      the
      most
      corrupt
      and
      morally
      devoid
      business
      owner...
      pretty
      much
      ever.
      This
      guy
      gave
      free
      infant
      formula
      to
      mothers
      in
      third
      world
      countries.
      This
      sounds
      good,
      but
      water
      quality
      was
      and
      still
      is
      godawful
      in
      those
      countries,
      leading
      to
      tons
      of
      infections
      and
      disease
      because
      mothers
      were
      not
      educated
      to
      boil
      water.
      In
      addition
      to
      this,
      that
      formula
      would
      last
      them
      long
      enough
      to
      where
      mothers
      could
      no
      longer
      produce
      breast
      milk.
      Then,
      mothers
      were
      forced
      to
      buy
      overpriced
      baby
      formula
      for
      their
      children,
      often
      not
      having
      enough
      money
      and
      resorting
      to
      under
      feeding
      themselves
      and
      their
      children.
      Fuck
      tons
      of
      babies
      died
      because
      of
      Nestle #8217;s
      aggressive
      tactics,
      and
      Nestle
      turned
      a
      blind
      eye
      to
      it
      knowing
      good
      and
      well
      what
      was
      going
      on.
      This
      lead
      to
      a
      boycott
      which
      Nestle
      responded
      to
      by
      providing
      mothers
      in
      third
      world
      countries
      with
      clean
      bottled
      water...
      from
      Nestle
      that
      they
      also
      had
      to
      buy.
      That #8217;s
      like
      the
      ultimate
      middle
      finger,
      the
      ultimate
      fuck
      you
      to
      these
      poor
      families
      struggling
      to
      keep
      their
      children
      alive.
      In
      addition
      to
      that,
      he
      either
      was
      complicit
      in
      or
      facilitated
      human
      trafficking
      of
      children
      and
      teens
      aged
      12-15
      to
      work
      as
      slaves
      in
      chocolate
      plantations...
      Oh,
      and
      he
      also
      said
      that
      the
      idea
      that
      water
      should
      be
      a
      human
      right
      is
       #8220;extreme #8221;.
      So,
      fuck
      that
      guy.
      I
      would
      visit
      him
      right
      now
      to
      beat
      his
      ass
      if
      I
      could.

      The
      solution
      was,
      surprisingly
      enough,
      a
      cactus.
      I #8217;ve
      seen
      a
      little
      bit
      of
      hate
      on
      the
      cactus
      in
      this
      sub,
      but
      with
      bullet
      modifying
      items,
      it #8217;s
      really
      useful.
      To
      power
      it
      up
      I
      had
      Thorns
      Armor
      for
      that
      synergy,
      then
      I
      had
      angry
      bullets
      (which
      really
      helped
      for
      crowd
      control),
      and
      I
      also
      got
      cursed
      bullets.
      From
      there
      I
      racked
      up
      all
      the
      curse
      I
      could
      get,
      powering
      up
      my
      bullets
      significantly.
      The
      rapid
      fire
      coupled
      with
      the
      bouncing
      bullets
      really
      helped
      clear
      rooms,
      and
      the
      good
      dps
      shredded
      bosses
      very
      well.
      Note
      that
      my
      Hollow
      boss
      was
      the
      kill
      pillars,
      making
      this
      combination
      effective
      in
      both
      ways.

      my

      it

      to
      use.
      When
      used
      by
      a
      skilled
      player,
      it
      becomes

      an
      highly
      reusable
      micro-blank.

      Nah
      the
      banking
      system
      takes
      your
      money
      and
      invests
      it,
      it
      then
      scrapes
      off
      all
      the
      interest
      on
      whatever
      land/companies
      they
      invested
      in,
      give
      a
      tiny
      portion
      to
      you,
      and
      keep
      the
      profits.
      That
      way,
      they
      don #8217;t
      actually
       #8220;sell #8221;
      you
      anything
      unless
      you #8217;re
      just
      counting
      loans.
      Those
      can
      actually
      come
      from
      pretty
      much
      anywhere.

      I #8217;m
      going
      to
      recommend
      you
      House
      of
      Leaves,
      but
      this
      isn #8217;t
      a
      normal
      book
      in
      the
      slightest.
      In
      fact,
      it #8217;s
      one
      of
      the
      most
      complicated
      yet
      terrifying
      books
      I
      have
      ever
      read.
      Don #8217;t
      read
      this
      one
      all
      at
      once,
      you
      need
      time
      to
      let
      each
      chapter
      set
      in.
      Set
      aside
      some
      time,
      maybe
      before
      you
      sleep,
      or
      after
      work
      to
      read
      a
      chapter.
      It #8217;s
      a
      heck
      of
      a
      commitment,
      but
      it
      definitely
      pays
      off.

      I
      know
      I #8217;m
      really
      late,
      but
      the
      Snackman
      Effect.
      Basically,
      if
      two
      people
      are
      becoming
      aggressive
      toward
      each
      other
      and
      you
      think
      it
      could
      escalate
      further,
      you
      can
      take
      your
      bag
      of
      chips,
      walk
      right
      in
      between
      them,
      and
      de-escalate
      the
      situation
      just
      by
      eating.
      I
      don #8217;t
      remember
      exactly
      how
      this
      works,
      but
      the
      brain
      usually
      processes
      eating
      as
      a
      peaceful
      activity.
      The
      randomness
      of
      a
      person
      just
      eating
      there
      probably
      also
      throws
      them
      off
      a
      bit.

      This
      looks
      like
      it
      could
      be
      one
      of
      two
      varieties
      of
      spiders.
      1.
      If
      you
      live
      north
      of
      Iowa,
      the
      chances
      of
      it
      being
      a
      brown
      recluse
      are
      very
      low,
      but
      if
      you
      live
      within
      that
      range,
      it
      is
      definitely
      a
      large
      possibility
      because
      of
      the
      shape
      on
      its
      head.
      2.
      If
      you
      do
      live
      north
      of
      Iowa,
      it #8217;s
      probably
      a
      field
      wolf
      spider
      because
      those
      things
      live
      everywhere.
      Like...
      Everywhere.
      While
      the
      size
      range
      of
      the
      brown
      recluse
      sounds
      a
      lot
      like
      what
      you
      described,
      it
      it
      could
      have
      been
      up
      to
      half
      an
      inch,
      it
      could
      have
      been
      a
      smaller
      wolf
      spider.
      Wolf
      spiders
      are
      not
      at
      all
      dangerous,
      their
      bites
      hurt
      less
      than
      bee
      stings
      and
      their
      venom
      has
      little
      to
      no
      effect
      in
      humans.
      They #8217;re
      ideal
      pets
      if
      you #8217;re
      into
      pet
      spiders
      (I #8217;m
      not
      lol).
      Brown
      recluses,
      however,
      can
      cause
      lesions
      with
      bites
      so
      yeah
      you
      don #8217;t
      want
      those
      within
      50
      yards
      of
      you.
      In
      all
      honesty
      o
      was
      thinking
      it
      was
      a
      huntsman
      spider
      until
      you
      told
      me
      the
      size.
      That #8217;s
      WAY
      too
      small
      to
      be
      a
      huntsman
      spider.
      They #8217;re
      1-5
      inches
      depending
      on
      the
      breed,
      but
      they
      are
      definitely
      not
      dangerous.
      So
      from
      that,
      take
      what
      you
      want.
      I
      think
      the
      people
      saying
      it
      looks
      nothing
      like
      a
      brown
      recluse
      are
      full
      of
      crap
      because
      they
      look
      a
      lot
      like
      certain
      types
      of
      them.
      That
      also
      look
      like
      field
      wolf
      spiders.
      I
      would
      still
      take
      this
      to
      r/spiders
      to
      be
      more
      sure
      Edit:
      dang
      that
      was
      long,
      hope
      it
      was
      helpful!
      Edit
      2:
      okay,
      brown
      recluses
      are
      definitely
      in
      France.
      Sorry
      for
      thinking
      you
      were
      a
      filthy
      capitalist
      American
      like
      me
      for
      a
      second.
      Edit
      3:
      it #8217;s
      too
      dark
      to
      be
      a
      Tegenaria
      domestica,
      but
      it
      could
      also
      be
      a
      Tegenaria
      Atrica
      because
      of
      your

      I
      have
      only
      read
      one
      book
      by
      James
      Patterson.
      That
      book
      was
       #8216;I
      Funny #8217;,
      and
      it
      was
      just
      as
      idiotic
      and
      unfunny
      as
      the
      title
      would
      suggest.
      The
      only
      thing
      I
      liked
      about
      it
      was
      the
      main
      character
      was
      depicted
      as
      being
      a
      pretty
      cool
      kid
      despite
      being
      in
      a
      wheelchair,
      with
      the
      target
      audience
      being
      kids
      in
      late
      elementary
      to
      middle
      school.
      It #8217;s
      good
      for
      kids
      to
      know
      that
      stuff
      like
      that
      doesn #8217;t
      have
      any
      effect
      on
      the
      personality
      of
      the
      person.

      A
      **DoubleShot**
      is
      a
      very
      simple
      thing
      to
      understand,
      and
      it
      happens
      every
      once
      in
      a
      while
      on
      Reddit,
      but
      is
      not
      super
      common.
      When
      a
      user
      comments
      two
      relevant
      subs
      in
      a
      row,
      it
      is
      a
      **DoubleShot**.
      Here
      are
      the
      rules
      to
      prevent
      this
      phenomenon
      from
      growing
      into
      something
      very
      annoying.
      1.
      Both
      subs
      must
      be
      commented
      by
      the
      same
      user
      in
      different
      comments
      (same
      thread,
      though)
      2.
      Do
      not
      post
      your
      own
      **DoubleShot**s,
      as
      this
      would
      encourage
      **DoubleShot**
      farming,
      which
      would
      get
      very
      annoying
      in
      the
      other
      subs
      of
      Reddit
      very
      fast.
      3.
      To
      claim
      a
      **DoubleShot**'s
      screenshot,
      one
      must
      comment
      r/DoubleShots
      in
      the
      screenshot,
      showing
      they
      have
      staked
      their
      claim
      for
      the
      post.
      4.
      In
      the
      rare
      case
      of
      anything
      above
      a
      **DoubleShot**
      such
      as
      a
      ***TRIPLESHOT,***
      the
      post
      must
      be
      marked
      as
      such
      using
      flairs.
      5.
      A
      ***~~qUiNtUpLeShOt~~***
      is
      properly
      known
      as
      an
      ***~~^(ACE)~~***.
      These
      are
      exceptionally
      rare.
      6.
      If
      you
      haven't
      caught
      on
      yet,
      bold
      **DoubleShot**
      or
      you're
      a
      normie.
      7.
      Mark
      NSFW
      content
      as
      such.
      (Not
      quite
      sure
      how
      that
      would
      happen
      at
      all,
      but
      mark
      it
      if
      it
      is,
      m'kay?)
      8.
      No
      text
      posts
      or
      link
      posts,
      please.
      9.
      No
      irrelevant
      links
      in
      comments
      (NSFW
      links
      should
      be
      marked
      as
      such,
      NSFL
      links
      should
      be
      in
      spoilers
      and
      marked
      as
      such.)
      10.
      Here
      is
      an
      example
      of
      a
      **DoubleShot**
      before
      r/DoubleShots
      was
      a
      thing:

      Before
      we
      start
      this
      story
      I
      need
      to
      give
      you
      guys
      some
      background
      so
      everything
      will
      make
      sense.
      Edit:
      And
      I
      should
      mention
      I #8217;m
      on
      mobile.
      So,
      formatting.
      To
      simplify
      the
      matter,
      I
      work
      at
      what
      is
      basically
      a
      boat
      rental
      place.
      One
      of
      our
      rules
      is
      that
      you
      must
      fill
      up
      the
      boat
      with
      gas
      before
      you
      pull
      in
      the
      slip
      again.
      This
      is
      very
      clearly
      stated
      multiple
      times
      when
      people
      sign
      up.
      Literally
      EVERYONE
      gets
      gas,
      and
      these
      people
      have
      used
      our
      services
      many
      times
      before
      so
      they
      definitely
      knew
      this.
      And
      now,
      our
      cast:
      Me
      Narrator
      Manager
      Karen
      -=(Curtains
      Open)=-
      Narrator:
      And
      so
      it
      all
      started
      yesterday
      afternoon
      when
      Karen
      got
      gas
      (stick
      with
      me
      here).
      And
      then
      she
      proceeds
      to
      go
      back
      out
      to
      play
      more
      which
      will
      definitely
      burn
      a
      bunch
      of
      it.
      Pulling
      in
      a
      boat
      like
      that
      can
      potentially
      make
      the
      next
      member
      have
      to
      pay

      Manager:

      may
      I
      help
      you? #8221;
      Karen:
       #8220;I

      gas

      I #8217;m

      Manager:
       #8220;Really?
      I
      didn #8217;t
      see
      you
      guys
      at
      the
      gas
      dock
      a
      minute
      ago... #8221;
      Karen:
       #8220;I
      got
      gas
      two
      hours
      ago,
      I
      shouldn #8217;t
      have
      to
      put
      up
      with
      this
      shit. #8221;
      Manager:
       #8220;Yes,
      and
      boats
      burn
      a
      lot
      of
      gas
      in
      two
      hours.
      Please
      refill
      it
      before
      you
      pull
      in. #8221;
      Karen:
       #8220;Fuck
      you,
      (Manager),
      I #8217;m
      pulling
      in! #8221;
      Narrator:
      Karen
      did
      indeed
      pull
      in,
      and
      that
      was
      her
      final
      mistake.
      She
      walked
      down
      the
      dock
      like
      it
      was
      a
      fashion
      show
      catwalk
      with
      the
      smuggest
      look
      on
      her
      face.
      Manager:
       #8220;(Me),
      go
      fill
      up
      the
      boat
      with
      gas.
      Make
      sure
      you
      put
      in
      every
      last
      drop
      you
      can
      fit. #8221;
      Me:
       #8220;Aye
      aye,
      captain! #8221;
      Narrator:
      So
      I
      filled
      up
      the
      tank,
      not
      to
      one
      click
      of
      the
      fueling
      station,
      but
      to
      three,
      when
      gas
      almost
      dropped
      out
      of
      the
      top.
      At
      the
      first
      click
      it
      was
      already
      $20,
      and
      after
      the
      third
      it
      was
      completely
      full
      at
      $21.80.
      We
      were
      definitely
      charging
      her
      for
      this.
      However,
      it
      gets
      better.
      Our
      company
      policy
      puts
      a
      $25
      asshole
      tax
      on
      the
      people
      who
      think
      they #8217;re
      really
      slick
      and
      they
      can
      get
      in
      without
      fueling
      up,
      making
      her
      charge
      a
      total
      of
      $46.80.
      I
      know
      it #8217;s
      a
      relatively
      small
      tax,
      but
      it
      feels
      so
      good.

      Yeah.
      It #8217;s
      very
      inconsiderate
      and
      just
      lazy.
      The

      is
      literally
      30-40
      feet
      from

      This.

      time
      and
      asking
      if
      these
      people
      are
      getting
      charged.
      When
      in
      fact,
      the
      boat
      is
      full,
      and
      the
      gauge
      just
      stops
      a
      tiny
      amount
      under
      full.
      We
      explain
      to
      her
      every
      time
      it
      is
      normal
      for
      all
      the
      tri-toon
      boats
      we
      own.,
      but
      they
      will
      get
      charged
      if
      she
      can
      prove
      otherwise.
      We
      literally
      watch
      people
      fill
      up
      with
      gas
      (the
      gas
      dock
      is
      run
      by
      another
      company
      and
      they
      pump
      the
      gas
      for
      the
      members,
      unless
      there #8217;s
      a
      special
      case
      like
      this
      one,
      or
      people
      come
      back
      late
      after
      that
      company
      closes.
      We
      pay
      the
      gas
      company
      in
      full.)
      She #8217;s
      one
      of
      our
      least
      favorite
      members
      for
      many
      obvious
      reasons.
      Sorry
      that
      was
      a
      bit
      long,
      but
      I
      hope
      that
      clears
      up
      everything.

      Yeah,
      but
      like
      the
      guy
      with
      the
      zucchini
      a
      while
      back,
      it
      technically
      isn #8217;t
      a

      money,
      but
      percent
      up
      charge
      wise,
      it
      definitely
      feels
      good.
      I
      just
      said
      that
      because
      I #8217;m
      seeing
      a

      hundreds
      or
      thousands

      it #8217;s

      small

      Broccoli
      isn #8217;t
      a
      naturally
      occurring
      food,
      it
      was
      selectively
      bred
      into
      existence
      from
      cabbage
      ~2000
      years
      ago.
      When
      you
      think
      about
      it,
      it
      really
      makes

      You #8217;ve
      never
      seen
      any
      wild
      broccoli.
      Edit:
      It
      was
      bred
      into

      in

      pretty

      This
      was
      fucking
      great!
      First
      of
      all,
      I
      need
      to
      give
      you
      props
      for
      sampling
      Black
      Flag.
      That
      was
      an
      interesting
      stylistic
      choice
      that
      definitely
      paid
      off.
      This
      is
      one
      of
      the
      catchiest
      underground

      I
      got
      my
      first
      in
      the
      800s.
      It
      was
      a
      bit
      of
      bad
      luck,
      and
      the
      fact
      that
      I
      had
      no
      prior
      experience
      to
      bullet
      hell
      or
      dungeon
      crawler
      games.
      I
      got
      to
      the
      dragon
      like
      seven
      times,
      but
      couldn #8217;t
      beat
      my
      past
      until
      one
      especially
      lucky
      run
      involving
      a
      pig.

      Did
      that
      really
      take
      five
      days
      to
      think
      of?
      I #8217;ve
      seen
      this
      multiple
      times
      for
      several
      months
      before
      you
      posted
      it.
      I #8217;m
      saying
      this
      is
      already
      everywhere,
      and
      thus
      is
      no
      longer
      a
      rare
      insult.
      Find
      fresh
      content
      in
      the
      wild
      to
      post.
      Edit:
      Got
      to
      point
      out
      that
      I
      just
      realized
      this
      was
      blocked
      because
      of
      rule
      3,
      which
      literally
      proves
      my
      point.

      Plumber
      Van
      Rework
      Idea

      Most
      people
      know
      that
      the
      plumber
      van
      is
      the
      worst
      card
      in
      the
      game.
      This
      is
      no
      surprise
      due
      to
      the
      high
      availability
      of
      splash
      damage
      and
      other
      multi-targeting
      towers
      and
      troops
      in
      Rush
      Wars.
      Here
      are
      a
      few
      ways
      to
      make
      the
      Plumber
      Van
      a
      bit
      more
      useful.
      These
      are
      all
      separate
      ideas,
      and
      wouldn #8217;t
      exactly
      stack
      well.
      However,
      one
      of
      these
      would
      definitely
      make
      the
      Van
      at
      least
      a
      little
      more
      useful.
      -The
      Plumbers
      only
      get
      out
      of
      the
      Van
      when
      it #8217;s
      destroyed.
      Until
      then,
      the
      Van
      can
      soak
      up
      some
      damage
      in
      the
      front.
      When
      the
      Van
      is
      destroyed,
      all
      of
      the
      plumbers
      get
      out
      at
      once,
      almost
      like
      a
      Skeleton
      Barrel
      or
      a
      Goblin
      Giant
      in
      Clash
      Royale.
      The
      Van
      could
      also
      get
      right
      up
      on
      defenses,
      so
      instant
      damage
      is
      more
      likely.
      -The
      Plumbers
      get
      out
      at
      the
      normal
      time,
      but
      they
      get
      out
      of
      the
      back
      of
      the
      Van
      at
      a
      faster
      rate.
      The
      Van
      would
      then
      speed
      ahead
      and
      crash
      into
      a
      tower
      or
      large
      troop
      like
      a
      Tank/Gorilla
      dealing
      around
      200
      damage
      at
      level
      1.
      -The
      Van
      contains
      12
      Plumbers.
      This
      would
      be
      kind
      of
      funny
      like
      they #8217;re
      all
      crammed
      into
      a
      clown
      car
      or
      something,
      and
      I
      think
      it
      would
      be
      very
      fitting
      for
      their
      character.
      Plus,
      the
      Plumber
      Van
      might
      actually
      provide
      firepower
      closer
      to
      that
      of
      two
      Troopers.
      The
      12
      Plumbers
      would
      get
      out
      of
      the
      Van
      in
      the
      same
      time
      it
      takes
      the
      six
      of
      them
      right
      now.
      -You
      can
      put
      up
      to
      two
      other
      single
      units
      (no
      big
      units)
      in
      the
      Van
      with
      the
      Plumbers,
      offering
      protection
      from
      mines
      and
      other
      splash
      damage.
      This
      would
      be
      recommended
      for
      like
      Hotshots,
      Pitchers,
      and
      Bazookas.
      These
      two
      units
      would
      get
      out
      of
      the
      back.
      This
      would
      emphasize
      the
      value
      of
      the
      Van
      over
      the
      Plumbers
      themselves
      which
      would
      be
      very
      welcome
      in
      my
      book.
      Edit:
      just
      thought
      of
      one
      more!
      -Each
      Plumber
      takes
      off
      a
      door
      of
      the
      Van,
      giving
      them
      a
      small
      shield
      with
      the
      hitpoints
      being
      around
      their
      normal
      health.
      This
      would
      be
      a
      little
      more
      protection
      from
      splash
      damage,
      but
      nothing
      too
      crazy.
      Anyways,
      while
      this
      probably
      won #8217;t
      get
      too
      much
      traction,
      thanks
      for
      at
      least
      reading
      my
      ideas
      and
      hearing
      them
      out!
