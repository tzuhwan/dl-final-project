      im
      glad
      there
      was
      ATLEAST
      a
      little
      improvement!
      Ethernet
      is
      always
      the
      way
      to
      go.
      i
      used
      to
      have
      ping
      spikes
      /
      ind
      spikes
      in
      mostly
      overwatch
      before
      I
      got
      my
      Ethernet
      cable.
      Its
      butter
      smooth
      now
      and
      I
      highly
      reccomend
      it
      because
      your
      ping
      will
      lower
      to
      the
      20-30 #8217;s
      from
      60-70 #8217;s.
      my
      best
      friend
      constantly
      complains
      about
      her
      WiFi
      struggles
      because
      of
      it
      being
      wireless
      (and
      the
      cheapest
      plan,
      haha.)
      so
      ive
      learned
      how
      to
      remedy
      it
      even
      if
      it #8217;s
      slightly.

      i
      am
      pretty
      new
      with
      ryzen,
      my
      last
      pc
      had
      a
      i7-6700
      in
      it
      so
      I
      have
      some
      questions
      about
      it
      and
      it #8217;s
      performance.
      Does
      the
      cpu
      automatically
      overclock
      itself
      with
      default
      bios
      settings?
      I
      am
      not
      currently
      interested
      in
      OCing
      the
      2700x
      with
      the
      stock
      fan.
      with
      default
      bios
      settings
      my
      CPU #8217;s
      EDC
      spikes
      to
      red
      during
      idle.
      is
      that
      normal?
      Is
      it
      normal
      for
      the
      VDDCR
      to
      be
      1.4+
      consistently?
      I #8217;ve
      seen
      it
      hit
      1.5
      occasionally
      on
      stock
      bios
      settings.
      My
      cpu
      stock
      fan #8217;s
      speeds
      whirr
      and
      tone
      themselves
      down
      pretty
      quickly
      whenever
      I #8217;m
      idle
      or
      browsing
      through
      the
      bios.
      it
      is
      pretty
      annoying.
      is
      that
      a
      normal
      occurrence
      of
      the
      processor?
      would
      it
      be
      worth
      investing
      in
      a
      aio
      cooler?
      i
      am
      using
      the
      latest
      bios
      update
      and
      my
      chipset
      drivers
      are
      up
      to
      date
      as
      well.
      Thank
      you
      for
      your
      patience
      as
      I
      try
      and
      wrap
      my
      head
      around
      this
      thing!

      My
      mom
      has
      not
      learned.
      I
      am
      18,
      I #8217;ve
      spent
      most
      of
      my
      life
      taking
      care
      of
      her,
      my
      little
      sisters
      and
      dealing
      with
      the
      aftermath
      of
      her
      relationships.
      I
      have
      not
      had
      time
      to
      go
      to
      college
      or
      live
      my
      life.
      My
      dad
      has
      not
      been
      in
      the
      picture
      since
      I
      was
      13,
      so
      me
      and
      my
      twin
      sister
      have
      been
      playing
      parents
      to
      my
      two
      little
      sisters.
      The
      most
      recent
      one
      has
      been
      the
      hardest.
      we
      will
      call
      him
      Hoover.
      Hoover
      got
      dishonorably
      discharged
      from
      the
      military,
      brags
      about
      fucking
      a
      girl
      and
      her
      mom
      in
      highschool,
      talks
      about
      my
      little
      sisters
      inappropriately
      and
      blackmails
      my
      mom
      whenever
      she
      tries
      leaving
      him.
      he
      is
      literally
      scum
      on
      earth.
      the
      man
      has
      nothin
      going
      for
      him
      since
      he #8217;s
      50
      and
      just
      lives
      off
      of
      the
      state
      because
      of
      his
      PTSD.
      He
      is
      not
      a
      stable
      man.
      In
      January
      my
      mother
      attempted
      suicide.
      I
      do
      not
      want
      to
      go
      into
      detail
      but
      I
      will
      say
      I
      was
      the
      one
      who
      found
      her
      and
      called.
      The
      night
      before
      my
      moms
      suicide
      attempt
      I
      was
      arguing
      with
      her
      because
      I
      did
      not
      want
      my
      little
      sisters
      to
      move
      in
      with
      hoover.
      I
      was
      afraid
      of
      their
      safety
      and
      I
      did
      not
      want
      to
      risk
      them
      going
      through
      any
      sort
      of
      misery
      because
      of
      this
      clearly
      unstable
      man
      my
      unstable
      mother
      loves.
      I
      have
      been
      struggling
      with
      accepting
      that
      reality
      is
      real.
      my
      mother
      goes
      on
      charades
      of
      saying
      how
      much
      she
      hates
      him
      to
      saying
      how
      much
      she
      needs
      him
      in
      her
      life.
      this
      man
      has
      a
      calendar
      and
      dishes
      out
      time
      for
      her.
      I
      can
      say
      so
      fucking
      much
      about
      this
      man
      that
      just
      resonates
      an
      awful
      feeling
      within
      me.
      he
      had
      me
      and
      my
      sisters
      sit
      and
      listen
      to
      him
      like
      he
      was
      a
      drill
      sergeant
      essentially
      telling
      us
      it
      was
      his
      way
      or
      you #8217;re
      never
      seeing
      your
      mom
      again.
      I
      was
      pissed,
      and
      I
      still
      am
      extremely
      pissed
      with
      how
      controlling
      this
      man
      is.
      Im
      sorry
      if
      this
      all
      makes
      no
      sense.
      I
      am
      beyond
      baffled
      and
      it
      hurts
      me
      so
      much
      that
      it #8217;s
      hard
      to
      write
      out
      coherently.
      He
      will
      not
      go.
      all
      he
      does
      is
      have
      time
      because
      the
      state
      provides
      for
      him
      because
      of
      his
      ptsd.
      whenever
      my
      mom
      tries
      breaking
      up
      with
      him
      he
      sends
      her
      documentary
      length
      film
      episodes
      of
      texts
      and
      emails
      and
      calls
      her
      on
      different
      phones
      when
      she
      blocks
      him.
      it
      feels
      like
      there
      is
      no
      escape.
      He
      blackmails
      her
      with
      legal
      documents
      and
      sends
      her
      pictures
      of
      documents
      filled
      out
      against
      her.
      I
      am
      so
      crushed,
      I
      don #8217;t
      know
      what
      to
      do.

      Global

      for
      awhile
      now.
      we #8217;re

      going

      bed
      ODing
      off

      maybe

      ive
      been
      struggling
      with
      life
      feeling
      unreal
      ever
      since
      i
      saved
      my
      mom
      from
      her
      suicide
      attempt.
      a
      few
      days
      earlier
      I
      watched
      my
      grandfather
      pass
      away
      as
      well
      and
      my
      mother
      attempted
      suicide
      two
      days
      after
      his
      funeral.
      It
      was
      pretty
      rough
      for
      me
      as
      the
      oldest
      of
      four.
      I #8217;ve
      always
      struggled
      with
      mental
      health
      problems
      like
      anxiety
      /
      panic
      disorder
      and
      I
      am
      a
      massive
      insomniac.
      i
      feel
      incredibly
      slow
      and
      careless
      and
      I
      can #8217;t
      be
      bothered
      to
      do
      shit
      about
      it
      especially
      since
      things
      don #8217;t
      feel
      real
      and
      I
      feel
      like
      I #8217;m
      in
      some
      other
      world.
      nothing
      makes
      sense
      to
      me.

      I
      get
      you.
      I
      just
      drink,
      I
      don #8217;t
      do
      anything
      else
      because
      alcohols
      the
      only
      thing
      in
      the
      house
      I
      have
      easy
      access
      to.
      its
      easy
      to
      get
      addicted
      to
      things
      when
      your
      heads
      fucked.
      this
      morning
      I
      woke
      up
      feeling
      the
      same
      shitty
      way
      I
      felt
      when
      I
      fell
      asleep
      so
      I
      just
      ended
      up
      drinking
      it
      away.
      I
      don #8217;t
      have
      access
      to
      therapy
      or
      proper
      meds.
      I
      hate
      how
      I
      push
      away
      my
      friends
      and
      girlfriend
      and
      I
      don #8217;t
      know
      how
      they #8217;re
      still
      here
      and
      what
      it
      will
      take
      for
      them
      to
      just
      leave
      so
      I
      can
      disappear
      quietly
      without
      any
      reciprocation.
      It
      feels
      terrible,
      I
      don #8217;t
      know
      if
      it
      gets
      better.
      but
      I
      wanted
      you
      to
      know
      that
      you
      aren #8217;t
      alone
      with
      these
      feelings
      and
      if
      you
      ever
      want
      to
      talk
      about
      shit
      more
      ill
      listen.

      depends,
      if
      you #8217;re
      tilted
      to
      the
      point
      of
      no
      return
      take
      a
      break
      :,)
      otherwise
      you
      might
      perform
      terribly.

      yeah!
      it
      counts
      the
      game
      as
      completed
      and
      gives
      you
      the
      rank
      you #8217;d
      have
      gotten
      if
      you
      lost
      the
      final
      placement
      even
      if
      u
      come
      back.
      pretty
      interesting

      i
      mean
      besides
      the
      noise
      i
      kinda
      see
      where
      ur
      coming
      from
      but
      it
      personally
      doesn #8217;t
      bother
      me
      that
      the
      animations
      are
      similar.
      its
      really
      easy
      to
      tell
      when
      an
      orisa
      dropped
      her
      bongo
      and
      that
      it #8217;s
      coming
      from
      the
      bongo.
      I
      feel
      like
      there
      would
      be
      too
      much
      visual
      clutter
      if
      orisa
      had
      a
      distinct
      animation
      for
      the
      ui
      itself
      especially
      if
      you #8217;d
      get
      boosted
      by
      a
      mercy
      as
      well.
      sometimes
      consistency
      for
      similar
      actions
      is
      okay.

      ive
      seen
      people
      leave
      in
      any
      rank,
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      there #8217;s
      a
      direct
      correlation
      with
      rank

      someone

      I
      mean
      maybe
      people
      get
      frustrated
      when
      they
      can #8217;t

      seeing

      tbh
      with
      you
      I
      don #8217;t
      really
      notice
      much

      difference
      player
      mentality
      wise
      bronze
      thru
      low
      plat.
      I
      just
      wouldn #8217;t
      sweat
      about
      it
      and
      perform
      as
      best
      as
      you
      can.
      might
      as
      well
      since
      you
      can
      only
      sweettalk
      your
      teammates
      to
      success
      only
      so
      much
      haha.

      My
      mental

      has
      become
      pretty
      destructive
      to

      and
      I
      am
      pretty
      self
      destructive
      in
      general.
      i
      am
      not
      medicated
      but
      I
      am
      diagnosed.
      would
      it

      worth
      trying
      to
      take
      meds

      my

      in

      because
      someone
      I
      don #8217;t
      like
      was
      obsessed
      with
      zerotwo.
      I
      watched
      it,
      stopped
      associating
      her
      with
      it
      and
      my
      life
      is
      much

      because

      tried

      to
      not

      inadvertently

      me.
      i
      know
      it #8217;s
      hard
      to
      move
      on

      nice
      essay
      but,
      I
      am
      a
      gm
      dps
      player
      and
      I
      battle
      mercy
      on
      smurfs
      whenever
      I
      want
      to
      because
      its
      fun
      and
      it
      would
      be
      silly
      not
      to
      encourage
      it.
      I #8217;m
      not
      saying
      do
      it
      all
      the
      time
      silly,
      take
      it
      with
      a
      grain
      of
      salt
      all
      you
      want
      lol
      it
      doesn #8217;t
      really
      matter
      too
      deeply
      to

      I
      keep
      relapsing
      pretty
      badly
      and
      it
      just
      gets
      worse
      and
      worse
      each
      time.
      I
      hate
      my
      head
      more
      than
      anything
      in
      the
      world
      and
      I #8217;m
      sick
      of
      how
      self
      destructive
      I
      am.
      I #8217;ve
      ruined
      so
      many
      opportunities
      mostly
      because
      of
      my
      mental
      health
      and
      it
      just
      builds
      up
      man
      I
      don #8217;t
      do
      anything
      with
      my
      life
      other
      than
      blast
      music
      and
      occasionally
      text
      friends
      and
      sleep
      and
      I #8217;m
      hardly
      motivated
      to
      take
      care
      of
      myself
      anymore.

      I #8217;ve
      had
      a
      lot
      of
      them
      and
      over
      the
      years
      and
      they #8217;ve
      gotten
      different.
      I
      didn #8217;t
      notice
      them
      first
      as
      panic
      attacks
      and
      I
      thought
      I
      actually
      had
      been
      clean
      for
      a
      month
      or
      two
      because
      I
      was
      used
      to
      them
      appearing
      in
      different
      ways
      in
      the
      past.
      but
      I
      hate
      the
      absolutely
      overwhelming
      nature
      of
      them.
      I
      hate
      having
      one
      at
      night
      because
      I
      still
      feel
      those
      feelings
      of
      dread
      and
      deep
      anxieties
      when
      I
      wake
      up
      in
      the
      morning
      sometimes
      and
      sleeping
      it
      off
      doesn #8217;t
      cut
      it.
      I
      just
      want
      it
      all
      to
      end.

      they

      its

      it #8217;s
      helped
      my
      head
      a
      little
      bit.
      I
      have
      a
      hard
      time
      motivating
      myself
      to
      do
      pretty
      much
      anything,
      normally
      I
      freeze
      up
      pretty
      badly
      and
      give

      I
      spend
      a

      of
      my
      time
      just
      laying
      in
      bed
      or
      sleeping.
      but
      today
      and

      across

      from
      my

      and
      it
      felt
      really
      nice.

      I
      am
      a

      and

      me
      how

      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      you
      should
      leave
      her
      if
      you
      guys
      both
      love
      each
      other
      as
      much
      as
      you
      say.
      it
      looks
      like
      she
      is
      actively
      making
      an
      effort
      for
      the
      better,
      and
      that
      she
      is
      in
      a
      rough
      spot
      right
      now.
      getting
      therapy
      in
      itself
      can
      be
      very
      hard
      for
      people
      to
      deal
      with.
      i
      want
      you
      to
      know
      that
      I
      gave
      my
      mother
      space
      and
      she
      attempted
      to
      kill
      herself
      in
      that
      short
      time
      period
      of
      me
      thinking
      backing
      away
      would
      have
      benefited
      her
      more
      than
      not.
      I
      am
      an
      unstable
      person
      as
      well,
      the
      least
      you
      want
      to
      do
      is
      leave
      and
      I
      realize
      that
      now.
      space
      isn #8217;t
      a
      bad
      thing,
      but
      being
      there
      constantly
      could
      be
      overwhelming
      to
      her
      if
      that #8217;s
      what
      you
      guys
      are
      thinking.
      if
      you
      back
      away
      for
      a
      bit
      make
      sure
      to
      let
      her
      know
      that
      you #8217;re
      still
      there
      if
      she
      needs
      you,
      even
      if
      it #8217;s
      just
      a
      little
      text
      it
      can
      really
      go
      a
      long
      way.

      Oh
      yeah
      man.
      its
      pretty
      wrenching.
      I
      cant
      even
      open
      up
      to
      my
      romantic
      partner
      about
      it
      right
      now
      without
      shying
      away,
      I
      never
      could
      properly
      with
      a
      therapist
      and
      it
      just
      leaves
      me
      feeling
      very
      frustrated
      and
      sort
      of
      helpless.
      I
      know
      it
      sounds

      I
      used
      to
      lie
      to
      one
      of
      my
      therapists,
      say
      I
      was
      participating
      in
      hobbies
      and
      such
      just
      because
      I
      never
      wanted
      to
      admit
      that
      I
      lost
      interest
      in
      most
      things
      for
      a
      long
      time
      now.
      it
      took
      me
      such
      a
      long
      time
      to
      open
      up
      to
      her
      about
      pretty
      much
      most
      things.
      Sometimes
      it #8217;s
      easier
      to
      talk
      to
      strangers
      about
      it,
      but
      a
      therapist
      becomes
      a
      sort
      of
      acquaintance.
      exactly,
      I
      don #8217;t
      want
      to
      bring
      her
      down
      with
      me
      either.
      I
      know
      I #8217;m
      a
      lot
      to
      take
      in.
      sometimes
      I #8217;ve
      said
      some
      things
      here
      and
      there,
      but
      it #8217;s
      still
      incredibly
      hard
      to
      not
      want
      to
      emotionally
      run
      away
      from
      it
      all.
      thank
      you
      though.
      for
      what
      it #8217;s
      worth
      I #8217;m
      going
      to
      try
      and
      get
      a
      professional
      to
      help
      me
      again,
      you #8217;ve
      opened
      my
      eyes
      a
      little.

      my
      mom
      constantly
      puts
      herself
      through
      terrible
      boyfriends
      who
      always
      abuse
      her.
      I #8217;ve
      had
      to
      help
      her
      through
      all
      of
      the
      shit
      I #8217;ve
      lived
      to

      her
      go

      pocket
      therapist,
      including
      her

      too.

      I
      like

      my
      twin
      sisters
      dog
      is
      mine
      because
      I
      take

      of
      her
      during

      my

      works
      night
      shifts

      I

      work
      for

      I
      can
      never

      ride
      it
      through
      it.
      I

      dogs
      helped

      sorry
      if
      this
      is
      the
      wrong
      place
      for
      this,
      but
      why
      doesn #8217;t
      the
      United
      States
      pick
      a
      president
      who
      is
      moderate?
      why
      do
      they
      have
      to
      pick
      sides?
      In
      theory
      wouldn #8217;t
      it
      be
      better
      to
      pick
      a
      candidate
      that
      both
      sides
      could
      agree
      on
      and
      keeps
      both
      sides
      in
      mind
      when
      making
      decisions?
      Or
      is
      that
      just
      me
      thinking
      wistfully.

      i
      used
      to
      have
      these
      attacks
      where
      I
      would
      hyperfixate
      on
      my
      breathing
      and
      hyperventilate
      and
      I #8217;d
      focus
      on
      my
      heartbeat
      and
      swallowing
      and
      convince
      myself
      I
      couldn #8217;t
      swallow
      and
      it
      was
      not
      a
      fun
      experience,
      however
      it #8217;s
      been
      a
      year
      or
      two
      now
      since
      I
      last
      experienced
      a
      panic
      attack
      like
      that.
      I
      didn #8217;t
      notice
      these
      as
      panic
      attacks
      at
      first
      but
      I
      think
      I #8217;ve
      been
      having
      less
      severe
      ones
      with
      the
      unwanted
      thoughts,
      heart
      racing,
      trembling
      shit
      etc.
      I
      mean
      I #8217;m
      glad
      I #8217;m
      not
      hyperfocusing
      anymore.

      no
      like
      you
      seriously
      can,
      I #8217;ve
      had
      accounts
      where
      I
      was
      in
      gold
      and
      I #8217;d
      place
      high
      plat/diamond
      the
      next
      season.
      winning
      doesn #8217;t
      always
      net
      large
      sums
      of
      sr.
      the
      game
      factors
      in
      a
      sort
      of
      win
      streak
      bonus
      as
      well
      so
      if
      you
      consecutively
      win
      placements
      and
      not
      loose
      games
      in
      between
      you #8217;ll
      get
      a
      whopping
      amount
      of
      sr
      per
      win.
      It
      also
      factors
      in
      performance,
      usually
      k/d
      and
      that
      sort
      of
      things
      like
      damage
      blocked
      or
      healing
      per
      10
      depending
      on
      the
      role
      you
      play.
      Especially
      if
      you #8217;re
      playing
      on
      hero #8217;s
      with
      high
      win
      percentages.
      The
      game
      will
      try
      and
      balance
      your
      win
      percentage
      out
      by
      placing
      you
      in
      higher

      well
      sure,
      I #8217;m
      not
      talking
      about
      bad
      onetricks.
      but
      contrary
      to
      popular
      belief
      quickplay
      isn #8217;t
      really
      a
      grand
      place
      to
      learn
      heros
      for
      competitive.
      personally
      I
      started
      this
      game
      in
      silver
      and
      playing
      against
      smurfs
      opened
      my
      eyes
      to
      new
      playstyles
      and
      tactics
      and
      I
      would
      like
      to
      credit
      as
      one
      of
      the
      key
      reasons
      I
      was
      able
      to
      climb
      to
      gm.
      If
      you
      want
      to
      improve
      at
      this
      game
      competitively
      tossing
      yourself
      into
      competitive
      is
      the
      best
      thing
      you
      can
      do
      for
      yourself,
      really.

      yeah,

      you
      wanna
      get
      better
      at
      competitive
      you
      have
      to
      play
      competitive.
      quickplay
      has
      very
      little
      to
      no
      structure
      its
      not
      going
      to
      teach
      you
      how
      to
      climb
      very

      people
      aren #8217;t
      understanding
      that
      quickplay
      wont
      teach
      people
      competitive
      very
      well.
      forcing
      people
      to
      play
      that
      shit
      for
      what,
      it
      takes
      about
      24
      hours
      to
      get
      to
      level
      25
      solo.
      so
      it
      would
      take
      around
      like
      67
      hours
      to
      get
      to
      70,
      maybe
      more
      because
      I
      believe
      you
      need
      more
      exp
      the
      higher
      level
      you
      get.
      that #8217;s
      a
      lootttt
      of
      time
      doing
      garbage.

      noo.
      most
      people
      don #8217;t
      take
      quickplay
      seriously.
      U
      wont
      be
      able
      to
      learn
      the
      hero
      competently.
      why
      do
      u
      think
      there #8217;s
      so
      many
      mercy
      mains
      who
      play
      widow
      everywhere
      else?
      or
      plats
      who
      wreck
      at
      widow
      ffa?
      they
      just
      don #8217;t
      have
      the
      game
      sense.
      most
      of
      the
      times
      it #8217;s
      because
      they
      don #8217;t
      know
      how
      to
      play
      widow
      at
      the
      level
      they
      play
      mercy
      at.
      if
      you
      want
      to
      learn
      heroes
      competitively
      u
      gotta
      play
      comp.

      sure,
      but
      if
      your
      intent
      is
      to
      learn
      the
      game
      competitively
      the
      best
      thing
      you
      can
      do
      for
      yourself
      is
      to
      throw
      yourself
      into
      comp
      if
      you
      want
      to
      learn
      quickly.
      some
      people
      have
      all
      the
      time
      in
      the
      world,
      other
      people
      have
      full
      time
      jobs
      or
      college
      courses.
      i
      know
      not
      everybody
      likes
      getting
      thrown
      right
      in
      though,
      everyone #8217;s
      different.
      some
      people
      wait,
      others
      don #8217;t.
      you
      can #8217;t
      expect
      to
      place
      very
      high
      your
      first
      placement
      either
      way,
      but
      you
      can
      learn
      to
      get
      out
      of
      there
      through
      grinding
      competitive
      more
      efficiently.

      I
      think
      its
      in
      the
      nature
      of
      quickplay
      itself
      for
      people
      to
      throw.
      people
      prefer
      to
      get
      high
      or
      drunk
      in
      quickplay
      than
      comp
      because
      there
      are
      no
      punishments.
      but
      that
      in
      itself
      depends
      on
      the
      person
      lol,
      I #8217;ve
      met
      many
      drunk
      ppl.

      well
      yeah,
      I
      started
      in
      silver,
      1900
      myself
      on
      my
      old
      toaster
      pc.
      I
      feel
      like
      smurfs
      helped
      me
      learn
      the
      game
      better
      quickly,
      not
      all
      of
      them
      are
      sitting
      there
      wrecking
      noobies.
      some
      Smurf #8217;s
      actually
      introduce
      team
      compositions
      etc
      and
      help
      point
      the
      team
      to
      a
      win
      more
      efficiently
      than
      someone
      in
      silver
      might
      not
      know
      exactly,
      which
      is
      why
      I
      credit
      it
      to
      helping
      me
      climb
      to
      gm.
      Sure
      it #8217;s
      not
      fun
      going
      against
      a
      smurf
      in
      low
      elo,
      but
      I
      think
      it
      should
      be
      taken
      as
      a
      learning
      experience,
      seeing
      how
      they
      rolled
      you
      sort
      of
      thing
      and
      using
      it
      whenever
      u
      can
      next
      time
      to
      roll
      more
      people
      and
      climb
      out
      of
      elos.

      only
      really
      teaches
      newbies
      how
      to
      play
      soldier
      sort
      of.
      and
      we
      all
      know
      soldier
      isn #8217;t
      really
      the
      only
      thing
      to
      this
      game
      lol.
      Maybe
      if
      they
      revamped
      it
      and
      elaborated
      on
      things
      new
      people
      might
      not
      get
      off
      the
      bat
      it
      would
      serve
      more
      of
      a
      purpose
      than
      it
      has
      currently.
