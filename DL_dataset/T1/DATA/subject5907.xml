      Suppose
      I
      put
      interesting
      titles,
      proper
      seo,
      tags,
      and
      consistent
      videos
      but
      no
      advertising.
      Will
      I
      be
      discovered?
      I'm
      planning
      to
      start
      out
      on
      a
      Pok #233;mon
      focused
      youtube
      channel.
      Audio
      and
      video
      editing
      skills
      are
      okay.
      But
      will
      I
      be
      discovered?
      Will
      views
      simply
      roll
      in
      by
      themselves
      if
      I
      keep
      uploading?

      Was
      scrolling
      down
      through
      some
      pokemon
      content
      on
      youtube
      today
      when
      I
      saw
      a
      video
      titled
      route
      209
      DPPT.
      It's
      been
      playing
      nonstop
      for
      the
      past
      hour.
      I
      also
      looked
      up
      the
      leaf
      green
      SS.Anne
      music
      and
      its
      playing
      as
      I
      write
      this.
      If
      you
      have
      a
      few
      seconds
      to
      spare,
      please
      play
      them.
      (don't
      click
      on
      the
      remixes
      tho,
      they're
      terrible)
      I
      used
      to
      get
      bullied
      a
      lot
      when
      I
      was
      a
      kid.
      So,
      when
      my
      parents
      decided
      to
      move,
      I
      was
      happy
      and
      sad
      at
      the
      same
      time
      because
      I'd
      be
      losing
      what
      little
      friends
      I
      had.
      Things
      blew
      up
      on
      the
      first
      day.
      It
      was
      apparently
      show
      and
      tell
      and
      I
      brought
      my
      DS
      with
      diamond
      in
      it.
      Apparently,
      the
      other
      were
      also
      into
      gen
      iv
      and
      when
      they
      saw
      I
      had
      a
      shiny
      bidoof
      things
      literally
      exploded.
      Everyone
      wanted
      to
      talk
      to
      me.
      Diamond
      was
      my
      first
      pok #233;mon
      game
      and
      it's
      probably
      the
      only
      reason
      I
      have
      two
      very
      amazing
      friends
      right
      now.
      So
      when
      I
      listened
      to
      route
      209
      today,
      nostalgia
      rushed
      me.
      I
      was
      smiling
      and
      literally
      crying
      at
      the
      same
      time.
      Something
      tells
      me
      all
      I'll
      be
      listening
      to
      for
      the
      next
      few
      weeks
      is
      pure
      pok #233;mon
      music.
      What
      are
      your
      thoughts
      on
      pok #233;music?

      So
      I'd
      created
      a
      youtube
      channel
      a
      week
      ago
      and
      had
      asked
      friends
      and
      family
      to
      subscribe
      to
      it.
      They
      did
      and
      I
      was
      supposed
      to
      have
      14
      subs.
      But
      when
      I
      went
      on
      youtube
      it
      showed
      that
      I
      only
      had
      1
      subscriber.
      I
      looked
      it
      up
      and
      people
      told
      me
      to
      wait
      two
      days
      for
      the
      sub
      count
      to
      update.
      But
      its
      been
      over
      a
      week
      now
      and
      its
      still
      stuck
      at
      1.
      I've
      checked
      youtube
      analytics
      and
      they
      all
      show
      1.
      Meanwhile,
      my
      channel
      name
      is
      fully
      unique
      but
      even
      so
      when
      I
      search
      for
      it
      (with
      filters)
      I
      can't
      find
      it.
      Am
      I
      suspended
      or
      banned?
      Here's
      a
      link
      to
      my
      channel:

      Started
      this
      morning
      when
      my
      flash
      drive
      started
      popping
      up
      random
      shortcuts.
      I
      ran
      a
      proper
      licensed
      kaspersky
      scan.
      It
      found
      a
      few
      infected
      files
      which
      it
      then
      proceeded
      to
      delete.
      I
      plugged
      in
      my
      drive
      a
      while
      ago
      and
      this
      time
      its
      started
      to
      convert
      all
      my
      files
      into
      .exes
      and
      shortcuts
      are
      everywhere.
      The
      scan
      doesnt
      seem
      to
      have
      helped
      anyhow.
      I've
      tried
      usb
      fix
      but
      apparently
      the
      'clean
      all'
      button
      isn't
      budging.
      I
      have
      important
      data
      on
      that
      drive.
      Any
      help?
      EDIT:
      Usbfix
      has
      made
      a
      few
      files
      usable
      but
      there
      are
      still

      Just
      started
      playing
      tdu2.
      I've
      played
      with
      controller
      configutations
      but
      no
      matter
      what
      I
      do,
      everyone
      i
      turn
      the
      wheel,
      the
      steering
      jerks
      to
      the
      left
      or
      right.
      I'm
      using
      an
      Xbox
      360
      controller.
      Any
      help?

      So
      I
      plugged
      in
      my
      360
      controller
      yesterday
      and
      messed
      with
      the
      controller
      confgurations,
      but
      when
      I
      went
      to
      drive,
      the
      steering
      kept
      jerking
      to
      the
      left
      or
      right,
      even
      if
      I
      slowly
      moved
      the
      analog.
      I'd
      hoped
      for
      a
      smooth
      steering
      like
      in
      forza
      horizon
      3
      but
      here
      in
      TDU
      its
      just
      terrible.
      As
      most
      racing
      games
      do
      not
      allow
      smooth
      steering,
      I'm
      deft
      with
      jerk
      steering
      but
      on
      keyboard
      and
      mouse
      but
      not
      on
      my
      controller.
      Any
      suggestions?

      Factors
      you
      might
      want
      to
      consider:
       #8226;
      There's
      a
      radio
      broadcasting
      station
      down
      the
      avenue
      and
      a
      television
      broadcasting
      one
      up.
       #8226;Directly
      in
      front
      of
      the
      apartment
      I
      live
      in
      is
      a
      bank
      with
      a
      lot
      of
      open
      space.
      Same
      goes
      for
      both
      broadcasting
      stations.
      Lots
      of
      open
      space.
       #8226;
      Idk
      whether
      this
      is
      important
      but
      on
      clear
      days
      the
      wifi
      from
      the
      radio
      station
      can
      reach
      my
      apartment.
       #8226;
      Problem
      started
      when
      I
      unplugged
      my
      CPU
      for
      maintenance
      and
      replugged
      it.
       #8226;
      Been
      using
      the
      same
      speakers
      and
      computer
      for
      over
      5
      years,
      never
      had
      the
      problem.
      I
      moved
      into
      my
      current
      apartment
      around
      9
      months
      ago
      and
      problem
      started
      last
      month.
      Any
      form
      of
      help
      would
      be
      appreciated.

      downvoted
      into
      oblivion
      by
      you
      people
      for
      this.
      But,
      I
      used
      to
      do
      youtube
      an
      i
      know
      some
      stuff
      and
      uh
      you
      can't
      get
      on
      trending
      unless
      the
      views
      come
      from
      outside
      the
      subscribers.
      All
      of
      the
      few
      mill
      views
      we
      have
      are
      from
      subbed
      accounts.
      So
      STOP
      being
      a
      piece
      of
      shit
      and
      think
      about
      it.
      The
      videos
      that
      are
      currently
      on
      trending
      target
      all
      kinds
      of
      people.
      You
      don't
      have
      to
      know
      anything
      beforehand
      to
      watch
      these.
      And
      so
      a
      lot
      of
      unsubscribed
      people
      find
      these
      when
      they
      search
      for
      something
      and
      watch
      and
      maybe
      subscribe.

      Please
      let
      me
      explain.
      I
      used
      to
      do
      youtube
      and
      i
      know
      some
      stuff
      if
      not
      all.
      To
      get
      on
      trending
      a
      video
      has
      to
      have
      a
      high
      view
      count
      in
      a
      short
      time.
      BUT,
      there's
      another
      condition.
      The
      video
      has
      to
      be
      appealing
      to
      all
      sorts
      of
      audience
      which
      means
      unsubscribed
      people
      have
      to
      watch
      it.
      So
      those
      furiously
      increasing
      views
      in
      a
      *short
      time*
      have
      to
      come
      from
      all
      kinds
      of
      people.
      So
      please
      stop
      saying
      trending
      videos
      are
      staff
      pick
      in
      the
      name
      of
      pewds
      before
      we
      embarass
      him.
      The
      videos
      that
      are
      currently
      on
      trending
      can
      be
      watched
      by
      all
      sorts
      of
      people
      and
      you
      don't
      have
      to
      know
      anything
      beforehand
      to
      see
      how
      teens
      react
      to
      Google
      searches.
      And
      those
      channels
      release
      one
      good
      video
      every
      five
      or
      six
      videos
      so
      people
      don't
      have
      a
      reason
      to
      subscribe.
      If
      we
      want
      to
      get
      on
      trending,
      we
      are
      to
      make
      another
      alt
      account
      and
      watch
      the
      video
      from
      start
      to
      end,
      all
      within
      the
      first
      12
      hours
      of
      the
      video's
      release.

      I'll
      upvote
      this
      every
      single
      time
      you
      post.
      But
      I
      guess
      what's
      stopping
      you
      from
      getting
      on
      LWIAY
      is
      your
      title.
      If
      getting
      on
      LWIAY
      is
      what
      you're
      after
      rather
      than
      showing
      your
      love
      for
      Felix,
      then
      I
      guess,
      uh,
      your
      post
      is
      uh
      less
      likely
      to
      be
      acknowledged
      by
      him.
      Felix
      probably
      feels
      the
      same
      and
      that's
      likely
      to
      be
      what's
      keeping
      him
      from
      actually
      responding
      to
      your
      post.

      lmao
      trust
      me
      I've
      never
      seen
      a
      big
      youtuber's
      music
      get
      on
      trending.
      Smaller
      ones
      like
      the
      odd1sout
      are
      "family
      friendly"
      and
      music
      producers
      can
      be
      on
      trending.
      I
      think
      you
      missed
      that
      family
      friendly
      part.
      I
      doubt
      families
      would
      want
      to
      watch
      hej
      monica
      rather
      than
      music
      from
      a
      family
      friendly
      youtuber
      called
      "life
      is
      fun"

      Well
      thats
      because
      in
      places
      like
      sweden,
      the
      majority
      of
      the
      people
      watch
      poods.
      This
      has
      prompted
      the
      yt
      algorithm
      to
      think
      that
      everyone
      in
      the
      country
      likes
      the
      shit
      so
      it
      must
      be
      good.
      But
      I
      doubt
      pewda
      has
      the
      majority
      in
      UK

      Jesos,
      like
      I
      SAID
      THE
      CONTENT
      HAS
      TO
      BE
      APPEALING
      TO
      ALL
      KINDS
      OF
      PEOPLE.
      Its
      just
      a
      goddamn
      music
      video.
      You
      do
      NOT
      have
      to
      know
      anything
      to
      listen
      to
      some
      fucking
      music.
      Why
      don't
      you
      try
      asking
      your
      parents
      to
      watch
      pewds'
      rewind.
      I
      doubt
      they'd
      understand
      what
      its
      about
      unless
      they
      watch
      him.
      If
      I
      could
      explain
      Youtube's
      algorithm
      to
      you,
      maybe
      I
      would
      be
      rich-ass
      tech
      guy
      with
      a
      startup
      instead
      of
      a
      student.
      Instead
      of
      arguing
      with
      a
      random
      guy
      over
      the
      internet,
      take
      a
      moment
      to
      think
      about
      this.
      I
      understand
      the
      point
      of
      view
      you
      are
      looking
      at
      this
      and
      I
      hope
      you'd
      take
      a
      moment
      to
      look
      at
      mine.
      Please
      be
      patient
      and
      I
      hope
      you
      aren't
      turned
      off
      by
      long
      columns
      of
      text.
      Here
      goes.
      Youtube
      cares
      about
      money.
      A
      lot.
      Do
      the
      Paul
      Brothers
      ever
      get
      demonetised?
      No.
      How
      about
      Felix?
      Yes.
      And
      very
      frequently.
      Something
      about
      Felix's
      content
      scares
      away
      advertisers
      or
      doesn't
      spark
      interest
      in
      them.
      And
      what
      could
      that
      reason
      be?
      Felix
      hasn't
      made
      himself
      into
      a
      brand.
      The
      Paul
      brothers
      and
      other
      glamorous
      youtubers
      have
      done
      so
      and
      succesfully.
      Moreover,
      almost
      every
      single
      person
      in
      in
      the
      world
      can
      *understand*
      vlogs.
      I'll
      be
      explaining
      what
      I
      mean
      by
      "understand"
      later
      on.

      this
      opportunity
      to
      put
      their
      ads
      on
      Paul's
      video
      because
      Paul
      is
      a
      brand.
      He
      can
      influence
      people.
      If
      someone
      looks
      up
      vlogs
      which
      they
      are
      very
      likely
      to
      do
      the
      advertiser
      gets
      even
      more
      people
      who
      see
      their
      ad
      and
      pay
      slight
      attention
      if
      not
      all
      to
      it
      because
      they
      are
      'discovering'
      a
      channel.
      This
      has
      made
      the
      youtube
      algorithm
      'favour'
      Paul
      because
      his
      videos
      get
      more
      revenue
      compared
      to
      other
      videos.
      Finally,
      here
      comes
      the
      foundation
      of
      my
      argument.
      Pewds'
      content
      is
      sub-centralised.
      By
      'understanding'
      I
      meant
      that
      people
      wouldn't
      have
      to
      know
      anything
      before
      watching
      the
      video
      to
      understand
      the
      content.
      They
      could
      understand
      what
      the
      vlog
      is
      concluding.
      Here's
      another
      point.
      Try
      being
      the
      everyday
      human.
      You
      don't
      know
      Felix.
      You
      haven't
      ever
      heard
      of
      him.
      Now
      tell
      me,
      how
      will
      you
      find
      Felix
      through
      the
      search
      bar
      if
      you
      don't
      know
      anything
      about
      him?
      Can't
      think
      of
      something?
      Memes?
      Only
      meme
      compilations
      will
      show
      up.
      Meme
      reviews?
      Felix
      won't
      show
      up.
      Even
      if
      he
      does,
      you
      are
      looking
      for
      meme
      'reviews'
      like
      with
      actual
      description
      about
      the
      meme.
      His
      content
      will
      mean
      nothing
      to
      you.
      Do
      you
      see
      where
      I'm
      going?

      Lets
      go
      back
      to
      the
      start
      and
      sum
      things
      up.

      PROFIT.
      2.
      Vlogs
      and
      ASMR?
      Yeah
      even
      my
      two
      year
      old
      cousin
      can
      understand
      that.
      So
      when
      people
      see
      videos
      like
      these
      on
      trending
      they
      click.
      And
      when
      they
      click,
      advertisers
      profit.
      Felix's
      content,
      on
      the
      other
      hand
      requires
      you
      to
      understand
      memes
      and
      see
      the
      fun
      in
      it.
      As
      a
      result,
      it
      will
      not
      get
      clicked
      on
      by
      everyday
      people
      or
      my
      two
      year
      old
      cousin.
      The
      algorithm
      sees
      how
      advertisers
      dislike
      it
      and
      reject
      it.
      If
      you
      have
      read
      the
      entire
      thing
      thoroughly,
      I
      thank
      you.
      If
      I
      still
      fail
      to
      convince
      you,
      then
      good
      luck
      to
      you
      dear
      sir
      on
      trying
      to
      find
      a
      flaw
      in
      *logic*
      that
      I
      have
      provided
      you
      with
      to
      make
      a
      comeback.
      If
      you
      do
      find
      one,
      please
      make
      sure
      to
      reply
      to
      express
      yourself
      although
      do
      not
      expect
      any
      replies
      from
      me
      because
      I
      feel
      I've
      spent
      enough
      time
      trying
      to
      show
      you
      a
      bit
      of
      logic,
      common
      sense,
      something
      that
      is
      more
      *likely*
      to
      happen
      than
      what
      you
      currently
      believe
      in.
      If
      I
      still
      haven't
      been
      able
      to
      convince
      you,
      then
      I
      believe
      its
      a
      griveous
      mistake
      in
      my
      part.
      Happy
      New
      Year
      and
      have
      a
      nice
      day.

      HOLY
      CARP
      ARE
      YOU
      MY
      ALT.
      This
      is
      amazing.
      I
      grew
      up
      JUST
      LIKE
      THAT.
      NO
      consoles,
      restricted
      PC
      gaming,
      actually
      none
      at
      all,
      but
      I
      borrowed
      from
      my
      friends.
      And
      then
      at
      9
      years
      of
      age
      I
      discovered
      emulators
      and
      played
      every
      single
      pok #233;mon
      game
      out
      there
      including
      mainstream
      rom
      hacks
      for
      gba
      and
      ds.
      I'm
      not
      an
      adult
      yet
      but
      my
      parents
      frequently
      take
      my
      phone
      away
      to
      zero
      out
      any
      possibility
      of
      me
      getting
      addicted
      to
      it.
      They
      are
      currently
      letting
      me
      run
      a
      year
      long
      streak
      without
      having
      it
      taken
      away.
      Thank
      you
      so
      much
      for
      existing
      and
      have
      a
      nice

      Yeah
      that
      does
      make
      sense
      because
      I
      doubt
      the
      try
      guys
      will
      make
      a
      video
      about
      something
      that
      won't
      make
      sense
      to
      millions
      of
      people.
      Do
      you
      guys
      not
      have
      common
      sense?
      Why
      the
      fuck
      would
      youtube
      check
      off
      Felix
      from
      everything?
      Him
      being
      on
      trending
      would
      just
      give
      them
      more
      money
      right?
      Except
      the
      fact
      that
      it
      won't.
      Try
      being
      the
      everyday
      person.
      No
      matter
      what
      you
      search
      for
      you
      will
      never
      find
      his
      videos.
      All
      you
      new
      fans
      out
      there
      are
      thinking
      that
      you
      are
      doing
      something
      productive
      while
      what
      you're
      doing
      is
      just
      embarrassing
      Felix.
      Advertisers
      can't
      predict
      what
      people
      look
      for
      in
      Felix's
      videos
      and
      so
      they
      tend
      not
      to
      place
      ads
      in
      his
      videos.
      As
      a
      result,
      Felix's
      videos
      are
      often
      not
      monetized.
      And
      so
      YouTube
      will
      not
      profit
      if
      they
      place
      his
      videos
      on
      trending.
      So
      stop
      bitching
      saying
      trending
      videos
      are
      staff
      pick
      and
      being
      a
      fucking
      tard
      and
      think
      about
      shit.

      Its
      over
      and
      done
      with.
      As
      long
      as
      we
      have
      a
      stable
      and
      constant
      government,
      there
      will
      be
      development,
      be
      it
      small
      and
      slow,
      there
      WILL
      BE
      DEVELOPMENT.
      Elect
      someone
      else
      other
      than
      the
      current
      government,
      and
      the
      two
      fucktards
      immediately
      start
      arguing.
      One
      fucktard
      after
      years
      without
      power
      steals
      money
      like
      theres
      no
      end
      and
      the
      other
      fucktard
      starts
      protesting
      causing
      businesses
      and
      educational
      facilities
      to
      shut
      down,
      yet
      another
      massacre
      and
      all
      we
      had
      fucking
      accomplished
      over
      the
      last
      few
      years
      will
      halt
      again,
      and
      we'd
      go
      back
      to
      where
      we
      started
      from.
      BE
      IT
      MONARCHY,
      we
      need
      development.
      I'd
      rather
      hand
      over
      my
      tax
      money
      to
      a
      king
      or
      queen
      and
      a
      stable
      government
      rather
      than
      some
      conserv
      pro-muslim
      unstable
      one.
      Why?
      BECAUSE
      BE
      IT
      THE
      BARE
      MINIMUM,
      WE'LL
      BE
      HAVING
      STABLE
      DEVELOPMENT.
      So
      shut
      the
      fuck
      up
      and
      be
      happy
      you
      can
      go
      out
      on
      the
      streets
      without
      always
      having
      to
      worry
      about
      that
      30%
      chance
      you
      might
      get
      bombed
      on
      your
      way.

      aye
      if
      you
      think
      I'm
      taking
      sides
      in
      this
      then
      you
      might
      as
      well
      be
      wrong.
      Try
      reading
      what
      I
      just
      said
      again,
      a
      bit
      more
      carefully
      this
      time.
      What
      do
      the
      other
      parties
      have
      to
      offer?
      They
      have
      been
      almost
      completely
      obliterated
      by
      the
      current
      government.
      Aside
      from
      that,
      they've
      been
      without
      power
      for
      years.
      IF
      they
      come
      back
      to
      power
      right
      now,
      they'd
      start
      feasting
      on
      our
      tax
      money.
      The
      current
      government
      has
      been
      in
      power
      for
      a
      long
      time
      and
      has
      stolen
      enough
      money
      and
      are
      now
      saturated.
      Compared
      to
      any
      other
      candidate,
      they'd
      be
      stealing
      relatively
      less
      money.
      You
      want
      democracy?
      Well
      THEN
      FUCKING
      TRAIN
      PEOPLE
      FOR
      IT?
      If
      libtards
      who
      can't
      even
      graduate
      from
      school
      are
      candidates
      for
      a
      seat
      in
      the
      office,
      like
      right
      now,
      then
      I
      doubt
      democracy
      is
      any
      help.
      I'd
      like
      you
      to
      run
      a
      simulation
      in
      your
      head.
      What
      would
      be
      happening
      right
      now
      if
      the
      government
      were
      changed?
      Would
      you
      like
      that?
      Would
      that
      help
      the
      country
      in
      any
      way?
      NO.
      A
      lot
      of
      people
      are
      annoyed
      with
      how
      the
      elections
      have
      turned
      out.
      You're
      right.
      WE
      DO
      NOT
      NEED
      DEMOCRACY.
      Monarchy
      would
      be
      a
      lot
      better
      and
      would
      put
      an
      end
      to
      this
      game
      of
      stealing
      money.

      You
      probably
      didn't
      quite
      catch
      that.
      I
      meant
      training
      people
      specifically
      before
      they
      run
      for
      a
      seat
      in
      the
      office,
      NOT
      training
      people
      before
      giving
      them
      free
      will.
      Lmao
      that
      would
      be
      RIDICULOUS.
      I
      do
      understand
      that
      not
      providing
      a
      citizen
      with
      free
      will
      is
      a
      violation
      of
      human
      rights.
      I'm
      completely
      aware.
      But
      in
      this
      case,
      the
      current
      government
      has
      stripped
      off
      almost
      all
      glory
      from
      its
      competitors
      but
      is
      still
      afraid
      some
      asshole
      will
      vouch
      for
      the
      other
      parties
      without
      thinking
      over
      the
      dire
      consequences
      first.
      And
      that
      is
      the
      reason
      the
      government
      has
      rigged
      the
      elections
      this
      year
      and
      I
      guess
      thats
      pretty
      obvious.
      And
      yes,
      they
      would've
      won
      anyway
      probably
      so
      i
      guess
      that's
      a
      grievous
      mistake
      on
      their
      part,
      again
      pretty
      obvious.
      However,
      what
      I
      have
      been
      suggesting
      all
      this
      time
      is
      to
      keep
      the
      government
      concrete
      until
      the
      country
      is
      developed.
      The
      people
      aren't
      yet
      ready
      and
      the
      majority
      of
      the
      voters
      are
      either
      bought
      or
      influenced.
      People
      who
      vote
      in
      their
      will
      vote
      blindly
      without
      actually
      taking
      their
      time
      to
      see
      what
      the
      candidate
      is
      about.
      Have
      you
      ever
      taken
      a
      look
      at
      the
      *type*
      of
      people
      who
      attend
      campaigns?
      NONE
      of
      them
      go
      on
      their
      will.
      They
      are
      either
      paid
      or
      forced
      and
      threatened.
      The
      common
      folk.
      We
      are
      not
      supposed
      to
      differentiate
      people
      anymore
      but
      just
      to
      explain,
      the
      kind
      of
      people
      who
      would
      be
      called
      peasants
      a
      few
      hundred
      years
      ago.
      There.
      Our
      country
      will
      be
      ready
      for
      democracy
      when
      we
      choose
      candidates
      who
      are
      educated
      rather
      then
      people
      who
      can't
      even
      graduate
      from
      high
      school.
      When
      citizens
      of
      all
      types
      attend
      political
      campaigns
      on
      their
      will
      and
      actually
      choose
      what
      kind
      of
      leader
      they
      want.
      And
      when
      will
      that
      happen?
      When
      the
      country
      is
      developed.
      And
      how
      do
      you
      develop
      a
      country?
      By
      constant
      improvement.
      I
      honestly
      hope
      the
      government
      won't
      be
      as
      afraid
      next
      time
      and
      won't
      rig
      the
      elections.
      But
      who
      knows.
      B.B.
      was
      our
      first
      and
      so
      far
      the
      last
      educated
      leader.
      People
      of
      all
      types,
      from
      CEOs
      to
      farmers,
      everyone
      attented
      his
      campaigns.
      But
      now,
      we
      have
      one
      who
      couldn't
      even
      pass
      high
      school,
      another
      one
      a
      former
      army
      officer
      who
      has
      stolen
      enough
      money
      to
      live
      off
      the
      rest
      of
      his
      life
      in
      luxury
      and
      one
      who
      never
      knew
      and
      prepared
      for
      being
      a
      leader.
      Our
      best
      bet
      is
      to
      hold
      on
      and
      forget
      everything
      else
      until
      the
      country
      is
      well-developed.

      I

      we're

      Has
      he
      taken
      you
      to
      visit
      his
      parents
      yet?
      Most
      Bangaldeshi
      parents
      resent
      the
      idea
      of
      their
      children
      having
      a
      SO.
      If
      he
      has,
      note
      how
      they
      behave
      and
      if
      they
      are
      feeling
      uncomfortable
      with
      you
      around.
      If
      they
      do,
      then
      try
      complimenting
      their
      personalities.
      Doing
      this
      will
      ensure
      a
      stable
      marriage
      if
      you
      wish
      to
      do
      so
      in
      the
      future
      as
      well
      as
      rule
      out
      possibilities
      of
      having
      people
      talk
      behind
      your
      back.
      If
      you're
      an
      introvert
      tho,
      then
      you
      might
      want
      to
      ask
      your
      SO
      for
      help
      with
      fitting
      in
      with
      them.
      Secondly,
      a
      lot
      of
      people
      here
      are
      ranting
      on
      how
      you
      should
      learn
      a
      few
      mainstream
      Bangladeshi
      dishes.
      DO
      NOT
      TRY
      THAT.
      I
      REPEAT
      DO
      NOT
      TRY
      THAT.
      If
      you
      haven't
      had
      Bangladeshi
      cuisine
      before;
      it
      literally
      burns.
      It'll
      be
      spicier
      than
      anything
      you've
      ever
      tasted.
      No
      matter
      how
      innocent
      it
      looks.
      Born
      Bangladeshi,
      I
      can't
      see
      the
      difference
      but
      I
      learned
      how
      it
      was
      when
      an
      Aussie
      aunt
      of
      mine
      insisted
      that
      she
      had
      the
      beef
      curry
      and
      literally
      started
      crying
      after
      the
      first
      bite.
      Instead,
      you
      should
      try
      learning
      far
      better
      tongue
      sweetening
      desserts
      like
      the
      semai,
      kheer,
      rabri.
      Those
      are
      a
      good
      start.
      Finally,
      I
      doubt
      there
      are
      schools
      in
      South
      Asia
      that
      actually
      feature
      the
      Bengali
      language
      and
      provide
      teachers
      for
      it.
      I
      recommend
      getting
      a
      personal
      tutor
      of
      your
      choice
      if
      you
      insist
      on
      learning
      as
      you'll
      soon
      discover
      how
      diverse
      the
      language
      is.
      Also,
      since
      both
      of
      you
      are
      almost
      indifferent
      to
      your
      religions,
      I
      ^would
      ^suggest
      ^becoming
      ^atheists
      and
      instead
      embrace
      the
      cultures
      of
      both
      your
      countries
      of
      origin.
      It'd
      really
      hurt
      too
      see
      two
      amazing
      and
      happy
      people
      seperate
      because
      of
      some
      phony
      religion.
      Cheers
      and
      please
      keep
      us
      updated

      Even
      so,
      for
      someone
      coming
      from
      bethesda,
      warband
      is
      a
      fresh
      change.
      Just
      last
      year
      (ahem
      2017),
      I
      was
      looking

      stuff
      to
      play
      with
      the
      exact

      description
      as
      OP
      when
      I
      stumbled
      across
      warband.
      It
      has
      been
      my
      favorite
      ever
      since.
      Just
      thought
      to
      drop
      it
      off
      there
      in
      case
      OP
      stumbled

      Do
      you
      play
      with
      your
      laptop
      plugged
      in
      or
      out?
      Idk
      why
      but
      some
      laptops
      including
      mine
      seem
      to
      run
      everything
      smooth
      when
      plugged
      in.
      I
      discovered
      this
      the
      day
      I
      had
      almost
      given
      up
      trying
      to
      play
      pok #233;mon
      ORAS
      and
      was
      trying
      for
      the
      last
      time
      in
      the
      evening
      while
      my
      laptop
      was
      fortunately
      plugged
      in.
      I
      couldn't
      believe
      my
      eyes
      when
      it
      ran
      over
      60
      fps.
      Try
      plugging
      your
      laptop
      in
      and
      then
      go
      to
      your
      power
      options
      and
      set
      everything
      to
      max
      for
      when
      your
      laptop
      is

      If
      you
      have
      a
      3ds
      or
      switch,
      you
      might
      want
      to
      look
      into
      fire
      emblem
      series.
      Here's
      a
      bit
      of
      gameplay
      from
      Fire
      Emblem:
      Shadows
      of
      Valentia
      for
      the
      3ds
      https://youtu.be/bC5jtGjOpNA
      The
      ones
      for
      the
      switch
      have
      better
      gear/playstyle
      but
      the
      main
      theme
      remains
      the
      same
      as
      seen
      from
      the
      video
      I
      linked
      up
      there.
      If
      you
      don't
      have
      a
      console,
      but
      are
      interested
      in
      the
      fire
      emblem
      series,
      emulating
      a
      3ds
      console
      is
      possible
      allowing
      you
      to
      play
      on
      PC.
      If
      you
      don't
      have
      a
      console
      and
      are
      interested
      in
      playing
      Fire
      Emblem
      please
      DM
      me
      because
      theres
      a
      bit
      to
      explain.
      If
      you've
      heard
      of
      fire
      emblem
      before
      or

      I'm
      not
      much
      of
      a
      PC
      gamer
      but
      I've
      played
      a
      lot
      of
      console
      and
      I
      think
      I've
      got
      just
      the
      game
      for
      you.
      If
      you
      have
      a
      DS,
      thats
      great
      but
      if
      you
      don't,
      it
      can
      easily
      be
      emulated
      on
      PC.
      Its
      a
      lot
      like
      a
      puzzle
      rpg
      game,
      where
      you
      solve
      obstacle
      puzzles
      in
      dungeons.
      Whats
      more
      is
      that
      the
      battle
      is
      completely
      turn
      based
      to
      your
      liking.
      IMO
      it
      provides
      everything
      you
      asked
      for.
      RPG,
      turn
      based
      and
      has
      almost
      no
      action,
      none
      really.
      Brace
      for
      it...
      [Golden
      Sun:
      Dark
      Dawn]
      on
      the
      NDS
      Here's
      an
      IGN
      review
      for
      it
      https://youtu.be/HYjFOdiWqgQ
      They
      rant
      about
      how
      there's
      a
      lot
      of
      talking
      and
      shit
      but
      that's
      a
      JRPG
      for
      you
      and
      trust
      me
      this
      is
      one
      of
      the
      most
      underrated
      games.
      The
      game
      is
      literally
      amazing.
      I
      doubt
      you
      can
      buy
      ds
      games
      anymore
      and
      if
      you
      don't
      own
      a
      DS,
      then
      like
      I
      said
      earlier
      please
      DM
      me
      if
      you
      aren't
      familiar
      with
      emulators.
      If
      you
      are,
      awesome.
      Also,
      if
      you've
      already
      played
      this
      one
      as
      well
      then
      I
      don't
      know,
      try
      looking
      into
      final
      fantasy
      I
      guess?

      You
      do
      realise
      you're
      on
      enemy
      grounds,
      right?
      *Journal
      Articles*
      That
      would
      be
      one
      of
      your
      morning
      *designer*
      magazines
      where
      they
      tell
      you
      *how
      to
      lose
      weight*,
      my
      dear
      sir,
      and
      not
      an
      established
      and
      verified
      scientific
      journal
      that
      is
      based
      on
      the
      research
      of
      intellectuals
      from
      all
      over
      the
      world.
      I
      understand
      that
      it
      is
      important
      to
      win
      every
      argument
      possible,
      but
      its
      best
      if
      you
      know
      that
      *pretending*
      to
      let
      your
      opposition
      win
      with
      an
      air
      of
      mockery
      so
      that
      you
      can
      have
      at
      least
      part
      of
      the
      last
      laugh
      is
      very
      cowardly.
      It
      just
      goes
      to
      prove
      how
      stupidly
      stubborn
      you
      are
      and
      that
      even
      though
      YOU
      DO
      NOT
      HAVE
      ANY
      RESPONSE
      OR
      REASON
      TO
      BACK
      YOU
      UP
      because
      the
      opposition
      literally
      shattered
      you,
      you
      try
      to
      *escape*
      the
      debate
      by
      trying
      to
      mock
      them
      one
      last
      time.
      Truly
      pathetic.
      Also,
      WHO
      THE
      FUCK
      PUTS
      'YAWN'
      IN
      THE
      MIDDLE
      OF
      THEIR
      TEXT?
      This
      is
      literally
      the
      cringiest
      shit
      I've
      seen
      this
      week.
      Your
      grammar
      is
      frightfully
      wrong
      and
      your
      vocabulary
      looks
      as
      if
      it
      has
      been
      picked
      off
      a
      thesaurus.
      I
      would
      NOT
      at
      all
      be
      surprised
      if
      you're
      actually
      a
      walmart
      cashier
      googling
      and
      making
      your
      sentences
      unintelligible
      on
      purpose
      so
      that
      people
      have
      to
      waste
      brainpower
      reading
      it
      and
      then
      losing
      the
      willpower
      to
      actually
      respond
      to
      your
      bullshit.

      This
      is
      the
      usual
      with
      most
      children's
      books.
      I
      guess
      its
      meant
      to
      give
      them
      the
      sensation
      of
      having
      finished
      reading
      a
      big
      fat
      book.
      Or
      it
      could
      be
      thickened
      on
      purpose
      to
      prevent
      crumpling
      and
      to
      make
      it
      easier
      to
      hold
      for
      the
      baby.
      And
      also
      so
      that
      the
      baby
      doesn't
      accidentally
      swallow
      it,
      let
      alone
      fit
      the
      book
      inside
      his/her
      mouth.
      I'd
      say
      this
      is
      a
      smart
      design.

      Is
      this
      a
      file
      that
      randomly
      spawned
      on
      your
      external
      or
      have
      you
      done
      something
      that
      prompted
      this
      to
      happen,
      i.e
      using
      file
      restoring
      programs?
      If
      this
      is
      a
      file
      that
      you're
      not
      familiar
      with
      and
      has
      appeared
      out
      of
      nowhere
      I
      would
      not
      recommend
      interacting
      with
      it.
      Run
      a
      scan
      on
      it
      if
      you
      have
      antivirus.
      Even
      so,
      check
      for
      missing
      files
      on
      the
      external.
      That
      icon
      looks
      tarnished
      and
      suspicious
      as
      well.

      Here
      we
      go
      again.
      Oh
      boy
      I
      love
      helping
      people.
      *Plug*
      your
      laptop
      in,
      turn
      off
      power
      saving
      mode
      and
      set
      your
      power
      mode
      to
      something
      that
      favours
      high
      performance.
      *After*
      you
      do
      that,
      turn
      on
      citra
      and
      you
      should
      get
      the
      desired
      fps.
      Idk
      how
      or
      why
      it
      works
      but
      since
      no
      one
      else
      has
      ever
      suggested
      this
      anywhere
      else
      I
      guess
      I
      kinda
      discovered
      this
      so
      yeah
      have
      fun

      At
      least
      for
      me,
      yes.
      Keeping
      your
      battery
      plugged
      in
      won't
      do
      it
      any
      harm.
      However,
      if
      you
      insist
      running
      it
      on
      battery,
      then
      you
      have
      to
      go
      to
      your
      power
      settings
      and
      set
      everything
      to
      favouring
      high
      performance
      including
      manually
      setting
      all
      the
      power
      options
      in
      your
      GPU
      settings.
      If
      it
      still
      doesn't
      work
      then
      just
      plug
      it
      in.
      Saves
      you
      a
      lot
      of
      time.

      I
      suppose
      some
      people
      simply
      lack
      creativity.
      Guess
      what
      OP?
      You're
      one
      of
      them.
      Please
      don't
      repost.
      I
      understand
      you're
      stupid
      but
      at
      least
      try
      to
      keep
      away
      from
      stealing
      someone
      else's
      work.
      Also,
      this
      subreddit
      is
      NOT
      for
      posting
      memes.

      I've

      wondered:
      do
      people
      put
      holes
      in
      the
      box?
      If
      they
      didn't,
      wouldn't
      the
      puppies
      feel
      suffocated?
      Even
      so,
      the
      puppies
      are
      very
      likely
      to
      be
      scared

      linked
      to
      have
      the
      entire
      game
      inside
      and
      ready
      to
      run.
      If
      the
      going
      ever
      gets
      tough,
      or
      you
      want
      to
      make
      it
      easier
      for
      your
      daughter,
      here's
      a
      game
      save
      editor
      that
      allows
      you
      to
      alter
      the
      items
      you
      carry
      including
      your
      money
      and
      pok #233;mon.
      I
      wouldn't
      recommend
      changing
      the
      pok #233;mon
      levels
      or
      any
      other
      data
      though.
      It
      would
      ruin
      the
      experience.
      What
      you
      can
      do
      is
      add
      a
      few
      rare
      candies
      to
      your
      bag
      and
      elevating
      pok #233;mon
      levels.

      If
      you
      need
      help
      with
      using
      the
      save
      editor
      feel
      free
      to
      DM
      me.
      As
      for
      your
      computer
      specs,
      nothing
      can
      be
      done
      except
      closing
      all
      programs
      except
      citra.
      However,
      if
      you
      are
      on
      a
      laptop,
      be
      sure
      to
      *plug
      it
      in*
      before
      you
      play.
      It
      makes
      a
      huge
      difference
      in
      your
      fps
      and
      quality
      of
      gameplay.
      Cheers.
      If
      your
      daughter
      really
      loves
      pok #233;mon,
      I
      recommend
      she
      start
      with
      the
      GBA
      classics
      like
      fire
      red
      and
      leaf
      green.
      They
      aren't
      too
      complex
      like
      the
      recent
      pok #233;mon
      games
      and
      don't
      require
      you
      to
      mix
      berries
      to
      make
      juices
      and
      petting
      your
      pok #233;mon
      regularly
      to
      keep
      them
      happy.
      If
      your
      PC
      has
      trouble
      running
      citra,
      check
      them
      out.

      LMAO
      he
      wants
      to
      be
      a
      teacher
      in
      Bangladesh?
      I
      don't
      think
      we
      do
      that
      here
      without
      money.
      Poor
      kid
      thought
      he
      was
      going
      to
      be
      a
      legitimate
      teacher.
      Should've
      known
      Bangladesh
      is
      the
      place
      for
      foul
      thieves
      and
      cheap
      greasers
      who
      rise
      up
      by
      dint
      of
      money
      and
      their
      political
      influence.
      LMFAO
      the
      police
      are
      telling
      us
      to
      *pray*
      for
      him?
      FR?
      *PRAY*!?
      This
      is
      hilarious.
      Rather
      than
      wasting
      time
      doing
      something
      phony
      I
      say
      we
      strip
      the
      authorities
      of
      their
      titles
      for
      failing
      to
      do
      their
      duty.
      Oh
      wait,
      I'm
      in
      Bangladesh.
      I
      forgot
      we
      don't
      do
      justice
      here.
      I
      forgot
      we
      don't
      have
      democracy.
      Wack,
      I
      must've
      gone
      crazy

      The

      I
      believe
      we
      call
      female
      adults
      *women*,
      not
      *girl*
      Not
      sure
      whether
      you
      should
      be
      receiving
      dating
      advice
      here
      but
      the
      attention
      you're
      currently
      being
      provided
      with
      by
      the
      people
      around
      you
      is
      probably
      because
      you
      came
      hopping
      from
      the
      States.
      Strip
      off
      that
      title
      and
      you
      become
      a
      normal
      Bengali
      and
      people
      may
      even
      start
      ignoring
      you
      if
      they
      don't
      like
      your
      company.
      Unless
      you
      want
      a
      bunch
      of
      gold
      diggers
      on
      your
      back,
      introduce
      yourself
      to
      your
      date
      as
      the
      average
      Bengali
      and
      see
      how
      they
      react.
      People
      think
      living
      in
      the
      States
      means
      you're
      rich,
      not
      taking
      into
      account
      whether
      the
      person
      in
      analysis
      works
      at
      a
      caf #233;
      or
      is
      the
      CEO
      of
      a
      startup.
      Try
      stripping
      yourself
      off
      the
      title.
      Will
      do
      for

      I
      recommend
      not
      trying
      the
      mods.
      IMO
      they'll
      ruin
      the
      experience.
      Both
      sun
      and
      moon
      have
      the
      exact
      same
      pok #233;mon
      except
      that
      sun
      has
      sungaleo
      and
      moon
      has
      lunala.
      If
      you
      play
      sun
      you
      get
      to
      catch
      sungaleo
      and
      then
      using
      pkhex
      you
      can
      just
      spawn
      the
      lunala
      in
      the
      box
      storage.
      Play
      with
      her
      and
      help
      her
      if
      she
      ever
      gets
      stuck.
      But
      don't
      generate
      pok #233;mon.
      Let
      her
      catch
      them.
      The
      developers
      designed
      the
      game
      so
      its
      fairly
      easy
      to
      beat.
      Let
      her
      enjoy
      the
      game
      to
      the
      fullest
      and
      feel
      how
      its
      like
      to
      grind
      and
      train
      pok #233;mon.

      Hi
      Could
      you
      make
      me
      a
      logo
      of
      a
      crowned
      griffin?
      I'm
      imagining
      a
      griffin
      like
      that
      of
      the
      Scania
      logo
      with
      a
      golden
      crown
      on
      its
      head.
      Thanks

      What's
      annoying
      is
      that
      you
      keep
      doubting.
      Like
      that's
      going
      to

      No

      has

      At

      not

      As
      the
      youngest
      of
      my
      grade
      I
      totally
      agree
      As
      a
      kid,
      I
      was
      easily
      manipulated
      by
      my
      *friends*
      who
      were
      older
      and
      thus
      a
      lot
      more
      clever
      than
      I
      was.
      I
      fell
      for
      a
      lot
      of
      shit.
      I
      was
      terrible
      at
      sports,
      them
      being
      the
      bigger
      and
      older
      and
      all
      and
      so
      certainly
      not
      the
      most
      popular
      kid
      either.

      I'll
      try
      to
      be
      a
      bit
      helpful
      and
      specific
      and
      cut
      the
      bootless
      yapping.
      Pedestrian
      crossings
      basically
      don't
      exist,
      so
      jaywalking
      isn't
      a
      thing
      here.
      Thats
      how
      we
      cross
      the
      street.
      Sidewalks
      are
      actually
      reserved
      places
      for
      cheap
      vendors
      so
      you
      have
      to
      hit
      the
      road
      to
      walk.
      Some
      overbridges
      have
      extremely
      steep
      flights
      of
      stairs
      and
      the
      railings
      are
      filthy
      with
      pathogens
      and
      muck
      so
      get
      ready
      for
      a
      bit
      of
      Desi
      Ninja
      Warrior.
      We
      also
      don't
      have
      lanes
      and
      road
      rules,
      but
      apparently
      most
      drivers
      know
      what
      they're
      doing
      so
      yeah,
      no
      need
      to
      panic.
      I
      guess
      that
      covers
      up
      road
      safety.
      If
      you're
      looking
      to
      venture
      then
      go
      to
      any
      of
      the
      tourist
      attractions.
      They're
      overrated
      and
      lack
      facilities
      so
      badly
      it'll
      feel
      like
      a
      real
      adventure.
      But
      thats
      Bangladesh
      for
      you.
      The
      prizes
      dish
      out
      quite
      well
      at
      the
      end.
      Personally,
      if
      you're
      visiting
      around
      Sylhet,
      I
      recommend
      dropping
      by
      The
      Palace
      Resort
      (probably
      in
      Hobigong
      or
      Bahubal
      maybe
      I
      forgot).
      Contrary
      to
      its
      clich #233;
      name,
      its
      actually
      a
      5
      star
      and
      one
      of
      the
      best
      places
      I've
      ever
      stayed
      in.
      I'll
      drop
      a
      link:
      http://www.thepalacelife.com
      I
      rarely
      travel
      inside
      Bangladesh,
      but
      when
      I
      do,
      I
      like
      to
      quiet
      down
      and
      relax
      and
      live
      in
      luxury
      for
      a
      day
      or
      two.
      There's
      a
      lot
      to
      see
      in
      the
      resort
      itself
      and
      its
      facilities
      match
      my
      standard
      and
      tend
      to
      every
      possible
      need.
      If
      you
      haven't
      had
      a
      vacation
      in
      a
      while,
      I
      recommend
      staying
      for
      a
      while.
      Whats
      better
      is
      that
      the
      accomodation
      is
      actually
      pretty
      cheap.
      Roughly
      what
      emirates
      takes
      for
      the
      two
      flights
      connecting
      Dhaka
      and
      Heathrow.
      Good
      Luck
      and
      have
      fun!

      Saw
      a

      comments
      that
      explained
      in
      detail
      how
      to
      delete
      search
      history.
      One
      explained
      how
      to
      open
      incognito

      So
      this

      Sorting

      I

      of
      unanswered
      questions
      that
      actually
      need

      Which
      ones
      get

      *How
      to
      write
      something

      *How

      Its
      fucking
      obvious
      that
      OP
      KNOWS
      HOW
      TO

      his

      tech
      you

      Ahh
      mate
      you
      relieved
      my
      arse.
      I've
      been
      off
      reddit
      for
      a
      few
      weeks
      and
      now
      I'm
      back
      and
      boom.
      Reddit's
      blocked.
      Wasted
      a
      few
      hours
      trying
      to
      get
      a
      cracked
      vpn
      and
      then
      got
      a
      free
      vpn
      instead
      and
      so
      I'm
      here.
      The
      problem
      only
      persists
      for
      wifi
      users
      tho.
      I've
      asked
      a
      friend
      and
      she
      says
      cellular
      network
      works
      just
      fine.
      Using
      a
      vpn,
      especially
      a
      free
      one
      is
      a
      pain.

      Reddit
      is
      apparently
      working
      in
      cellular
      network.
      However,

      have
      reported
      that
      cellular
      is
      also
      having

      If
      you're
      on

      I'm
      from
      Bangladesh.
      Its
      funny
      how
      just
      a
      few
      months
      ago,
      ok
      maybe
      last
      year
      I
      was
      literally
      one
      of
      the
      *few*
      thousands
      of
      people
      who
      actually
      watched
      pewds
      in
      my
      country.
      I
      was
      done
      with
      trying
      to
      convince
      friends
      and
      fam
      to
      watch
      after
      a
      few
      months
      of
      trying.
      They
      were
      like
      yeah
      maybe
      I'll
      check
      him
      out
      yeah
      yeah
      ok.
      Thats
      when
      T
      series
      came
      out
      of
      hiding
      and
      the
      *war*
      started.
      Boom.
      *THREE*
      months
      later,
      the
      news
      reached
      my
      country.
      People
      were
      suddenly
      like
      HEY
      dO
      yOu
      wAtCh
      pEwDiepIe?
      Frens
      who
      I'd
      tried
      convincing
      for
      months
      were
      like
      yo
      mate
      do
      *you*
      watch
      pewds?
      Then
      there's
      these
      people.
      Out
      of
      nowhere,
      people
      started
      to
      emerge,
      claiming
      they've
      been
      watching
      felix
      for
      years.
      People
      dont't
      watch
      him
      because
      he's
      amazing
      and
      fun,
      but
      because
      *watching
      pewdiepie
      is
      the
      trend*.
      I
      even
      got
      called
      a
      ahem
      *fake
      friend*
      by
      one
      of
      my
      best
      friends
      just
      because
      she
      had
      claimed
      to
      have
      been
      watching
      for
      years
      and
      I
      made
      a
      remark
      saying
      how
      she
      didn't
      even
      know
      Felix
      existed
      just
      two
      months
      ago.
      All
      of
      this
      sounds
      pretty
      darn
      stupid
      but
      its
      true.
      Watching
      pewdiepie
      has
      become
      a
      trend
      here.
      I'm
      sorry
      I
      just
      needed
      to
      vent

      You
      asked
      for
      something
      illegal,
      so
      here
      you
      go.
      Do
      you
      neighbours
      have
      wifi?
      If
      they
      do,
      try
      to
      get
      on
      their
      good
      side,
      anything
      really
      just
      get
      in
      the
      house.
      Once
      in
      scoot
      over
      near
      the
      router
      and
      either
      have
      your
      mom
      distract
      them
      or
      sneak
      and
      press
      the
      wps
      button.
      Its
      usually
      the
      smallest
      button
      on
      the
      back
      Pull
      out
      your
      phone.
      There
      should
      be
      a
      connect
      via
      WPS
      option.
      Press
      it
      and
      done
      you're
      connected.

      I
      wonder
      how
      a
      lot
      of
      people
      suddenly
      say
      they
      watch
      pewds
      from
      2012
      after
      the
      big
      exposure
      from
      the
      war
      happened.
      Could
      they
      be
      the
      new
      subs?

      AskReddit
      has
      become
      a
      place
      for
      farming
      karma.
      Just
      use
      the
      format:
      _____
      of
      reddit,
      what
      is
      ______?
      Make
      sure
      to
      make
      your
      question
      vague
      as
      to
      allow
      all
      sorts
      of
      people
      to
      chip
      in.
      Sit
      back
      and
      watch
      people
      comment
      and
      upvote.
      But
      of
      course,
      you
      won't
      be
      reading
      them
      because
      you
      have
      no
      interest
      towards
      the
      subject.
      Boom
      there
      you
      go.
      In
      just
      a
      few
      hours
      you'll
      be
      sitting
      counting
      fresh
      karma.

      And
      the
      fact
      that
      Dr.
      Bouman
      did
      as
      much
      as
      the
      rest
      of
      the
      team,
      nothing
      much,
      nothing
      less.
      There's
      this
      guy
      in
      the
      team
      that
      wrote
      850000
      lines
      of
      code
      and
      the
      number
      of
      Bouman's
      lines
      of
      codes
      is
      only
      a
      fraction
      of
      that
      number.
      A
      part
      of
      the
      reason
      she
      is
      everywhere
      is
      because
      the
      photo
      that
      went
      viral
      featured
      her.
      The
      entire
      team
      deserves
      credit.
      Stop
      being
      an
      asshole.

      I'm
      not
      questioning
      what
      she
      did.
      The
      problem
      is,
      the
      media
      is
      misinterpreting

      this
      is
      ridiculous
      I'm
      sorry
      but
      Bangladesh
      isn't
      as
      far
      behind
      as
      you
      think.
      I
      order
      things
      off
      the
      internet
      all
      the
      time.
      Takes
      from
      a
      week
      to
      a
      month
      to
      get
      through
      customs
      but
      it
      arrives
      in
      one
      piece.
      Just
      order
      something
      off
      of
      Amazon
      or
      whatever
      and
      ship
      it
      to
      them.
      And
      there's
      always
      DHL
      if
      you're
      sending
      something
      delicate
      and
      expensive.

      However,
      I
      *would*
      recommend
      DHL
      if
      what
      you're
      sending
      is
      available
      near
      you.
      Packages
      are
      often
      roughly
      handled
      by
      the
      customs
      and
      whoever
      delivers
      them
      does
      the
      same.
      The
      inner
      contents
      come
      in
      one
      piece,
      but
      the
      external
      covering
      often
      looks
      unpleasent
      after
      layers
      of
      wrapping
      and
      tearing.
      DHL
      will
      take
      care
      to
      prop
      it
      up
      to
      make
      it
      look
      like
      a
      proper
      gift.

      Pewdiepie.
      Not
      trying
      to
      get
      myself
      on
      r/gatekeeping.
      Guy
      was
      great.
      I
      loved
      him.
      But
      too
      many
      people
      drag
      behind
      him
      now,
      panting
      for
      attention.
      It
      wasn't
      until
      the
      end
      of
      last
      year
      that
      I
      realised
      how
      quickly
      his
      fanbase
      was
      filling
      up
      with
      abnormal
      newcomers,
      people
      getting
      on
      board
      just
      because
      of
      peer
      pressure
      and
      such.
      And
      they
      were
      influencing
      him,
      maybe
      in
      a
      manner
      only
      I
      misliked.
      The
      result?
      I
      can't
      go
      through
      his
      videos
      without
      clicking
      away
      in
      a
      few
      seconds
      from
      the
      *cringe*.
      I'm
      sorry
      I
      don't
      have
      a
      better
      word.
      You
      can
      also
      see
      the
      consequences
      yourself
      by
      going
      on
      r/pewdiepiesubmissions
      and
      then
      sorting
      by
      new.

      At
      a
      mall.
      More
      specifically,
      I
      was
      a
      tourist
      at
      a
      city
      called
      Kota
      Kinabalu
      and
      the
      mall's
      parking
      had
      these.
      I
      am
      guessing
      this
      is
      the
      exact
      same
      place
      because

      Your
      hands
      are
      too
      stiff.
      This,
      along
      with
      putting
      excessive
      force
      on
      strumming
      is
      causing
      the
      mute
      sounds
      and
      making
      it
      sound
      unpleasent.
      Secondly,
      your
      arms
      are
      doing
      the
      strumming
      which
      is
      a
      big
      NO.
      This
      movement
      will
      prevent
      you
      from
      strumming
      softly
      which
      is
      what
      we're
      trying
      to
      achieve
      here.
      Here's
      what
      you
      can
      do.
      How
      you
      hold
      the
      pick
      is
      immaterial.
      However,
      I
      do
      recommend
      holding
      the
      pick
      with
      the
      tip
      of
      your
      first
      two
      fingers
      and
      letting
      the
      rest
      of
      your
      fingers
      idle
      instead
      of
      clenching.
      This
      will
      help
      you
      to
      relax
      your
      grip
      allowing
      for
      softer
      strumming.
      Your
      arms
      should
      be
      moving
      as
      less
      as
      possible.
      Instead,
      strum
      with
      the
      wrist.
      This
      will
      take
      some
      time
      but
      once
      you're
      used
      to
      it
      you'll
      have
      outstanding
      strumming.
      Finally,
      instead
      of
      memorising
      strumming
      patterns,
      play
      the
      song
      in
      your
      head
      and
      strum
      along
      to
      the
      rhythm.

      Words
      don't
      just
      spawn
      randomly.
      People
      figure
      out
      something
      to
      express
      themselves.
      The
      best
      word
      spreads
      out
      and
      is
      ackknowledged.
      The
      word
      'word'
      as
      it
      is
      right
      now
      probably
      is
      wildly
      different
      to
      what
      it
      was
      a
      few
      hundred
      years
      ago.
      What
      you
      did
      there
      is
      not
      a
      shower
      thought.
      You've
      only
      described
      how
      words
      are
      formed
      in
      the
      first

      I
      doubt
      people
      can
      be
      called
      Bangladeshi
      just
      because
      of
      their
      ethnicity.
      He
      probably
      has
      an
      US
      citizenship.
      And
      so
      Bangladesh
      gets
      NO
      credit
      for
      this
      feat.
      That's
      whats
      great
      about
      this
      country.
      We
      have
      the
      intellect,
      the
      determination,
      every
      bit
      that's
      needed
      to
      triumph.
      Yet
      the
      government
      seems
      to
      hardly
      care.
      And
      then
      when
      someone
      on
      the
      other
      side
      of
      the
      planet
      whose
      grandfather
      was
      from
      Bangladesh
      gets
      exposure
      for
      something,
      we're
      overjoyed.
      This
      dude
      has
      no
      connection
      or
      whatsoever
      to
      Bangladesh.
      The
      US
      provided
      him
      with
      opportunities,
      he
      took
      it
      and
      honed
      his
      skills,
      eventually
      returning
      the
      favour
      with
      this.
      Even
      if
      he
      is
      still
      holding
      on
      to
      his
      Bangladeshi
      citizenship,
      it
      means
      nothing.
      Bangladesh
      has
      no
      right
      to
      claim
      responsibility
      for
      his
      deeds.
      Therefore,
      I
      can
      safely
      say
      that
      a
      more
      appropriate
      title
      is
      '
      (name
      of
      institute
      e.g.
      Yale)
      Scientist
      introuduces
      levitating
      trains
      to
      the
      US'.

      I
      remember
      the
      first
      time
      this
      meme
      was
      posted.
      Last
      year.
      And
      then
      about
      two
      months
      ago.
      Welp
      heres
      another
      checkpoint

      controversial
      opinion
      ahead
      Most
      of
      these
      people
      work
      their
      way
      up
      there.
      Be
      it
      in
      an
      unethical
      way
      or
      a
      legal
      way.
      I'm
      not
      saying
      its
      right
      to
      misuse
      that
      power
      like
      the
      drawing
      depicts.
      But
      again,
      the
      world
      is
      full
      of
      possibilities.
      Instead
      of
      brooding
      over
      the
      rich,
      the
      'common
      people'
      should
      at
      least
      make
      an
      effort
      to
      get
      up
      there
      and
      make
      the
      world
      a
      better
      place.

      He
      was
      probably
      experimenting
      the
      phenomenon
      because
      these
      people
      were
      lectured
      over
      and
      over
      how
      to
      move
      and
      act
      in
      a
      spacecraft
      and
      he
      wouldn't
      just
      go
      weeee
      and
      get
      stuck
      with
      nothing
      to
      hold
      on
      to.
      Also,
      someone
      appears
      to
      filming

      Guys
      I
      just
      had
      the
      most
      absurd
      thought.
      Mary
      Ham
      has
      had
      enormous
      support
      from
      Felix.
      Why
      would
      Felix
      do
      such
      a
      thing?
      Unless,
      he's
      been
      secretly
      replaced
      by
      someone
      evil
      who's
      also
      acting
      as
      Mary
      Ham.
      Maybe
      during
      the
      interview?
      If
      you
      look
      closely,
      Mary
      Ham
      looks
      kinda
      like
      the
      apparent
      guy
      posing
      as
      pewds;
      some
      features
      are
      common
      in
      both
      of
      them.
      This
      is
      oddly
      suspiscious.

      Sure
      each
      and
      every
      Stark
      had
      to
      go
      through
      the
      illusion
      of
      losing
      their
      entire
      family
      but
      at
      that
      point
      only
      personal
      survival
      meant
      primal
      to
      them.
      But
      in
      the
      Reed's
      case,
      Meera
      had
      left
      GW
      with
      Jojen
      and
      was
      returning
      without
      him
      on
      the
      trip
      back.
      The
      entire
      family
      would
      be
      haunted
      by
      his
      absence
      for
      years
      to
      come.

      Actually
      most
      people
      have
      it
      wrong.
      The
      problem
      with
      nimses
      barely
      has
      to
      do
      anything
      with
      privacy.
      It's
      sketchy
      because
      it's
      a
      supposed
      pyramid
      scheme.
      These
      schemes
      are
      designed
      to
      be
      tempting
      and
      appear
      to
      have
      no
      loopholes.
      They
      start
      with
      offering
      people
      profit
      (in
      this
      case
      nims)
      for
      sharing
      the
      scheme
      with
      others
      and
      spreading
      it.
      And
      then
      it
      starts
      to
      spread
      like
      wildfire.
      Just
      before
      the
      whole
      idea
      collapses
      in
      itself,
      the
      creator
      pulls
      out
      all
      the
      money
      he's
      collected
      and
      abandons
      it.
      Here's
      a
      video
      that
      explains
      this
      in
      the
      best
      way
      possible

      Yeah
      that

      a

      one
      will

      was

      Its

      that
      he
      accidentally
      carried
      it
      along
      with
      him.
      Their
      current
      location
      is
      about
      200
      miles
      from
      me.
      If

      can

      the
      phone
      is
      not

      thats

      a

      is
      a

      miles
      feasible?
      The

      Thats
      a
      post
      with
      a
      decent
      number
      of

      meaning
      it
      has
      at
      least
      15
      comments.
      The
      woooosh
      comment
      seems
      to
      be
      at
      the
      top
      and
      I
      can
      see
      that
      OP
      hasn't
      collapsed
      any
      threads.
      That
      is,
      either
      the
      comment
      is
      forged
      and
      photoshopped
      into
      by
      OP
      or
      it
      was
      satire
      and
      OP
      wooooshed
      themselves.
      Now
      that
      I
      think
      of
      it,
      a
      lot

      Sorry
      guys
      but
      this
      one's
      a
      glitch.
      Either
      everyone
      who
      reports
      her
      gets
      the
      message
      or
      the
      glitch
      happens
      to
      only
      a
      few.
      In
      any
      case,
      a
      lot
      of
      people
      seem
      to
      have
      been
      getting
      it.
      Its
      true
      that
      the
      thot's
      account
      has
      been
      taken
      down,
      but
      its
      probably
      due
      to
      the
      thousands
      of
      reports
      from
      mgtow
      all
      over
      the
      world,
      not
      for
      a
      single
      person.

      We
      have
      barely
      started
      to
      very
      slowly
      leave
      facebook
      and
      migrate
      to
      instagram.
      However,
      because
      of
      the
      enormously
      different
      foundation
      here
      in
      reddit
      where
      you
      function
      as
      a
      member
      of
      a
      community
      instead
      of
      using
      it
      as
      a
      medium
      for
      connecting
      to
      friends
      and
      family,
      they
      probably
      won't
      even
      look
      this
      way.
      If
      they
      decide
      to
      do
      so
      however,
      being
      far
      behind
      the
      trend
      will
      take
      a
      huge
      toll
      on
      them
      and
      they'd
      simply
      be
      lost.
      Also,
      because
      of
      having
      terrible
      satirical
      sense,
      most
      won't
      be
      able
      to
      catch
      references
      and
      that
      literally
      just
      defeats
      the
      purpose
      of
      a
      lot
      of
      golden
      subreddits.
      So
      yeah,
      I
      say
      facebook
      will
      be
      completely
      down
      in
      about
      10
      years
      or
      so
      and
      thus
      we'll
      hopefully
      experience
      a
      spike
      in
      traffic
      here
      in
      about
      5
      years.

      hi
      mister
      welcome
      to
      reddit
      idk
      about
      you
      but
      we're
      the
      type
      of
      people
      that
      like
      to
      laugh
      at
      pictures
      of
      corn
      on
      the
      internet
      I
      understand
      that
      you
      might
      not
      be
      familiar
      with
      r/thathappened
      and
      that's
      probably
      the
      reason
      you
      feel
      lost.
      But
      that's
      just
      how
      it
      is
      here.
      The
      image
      and
      the
      subreddit
      reference
      are
      all
      the
      context
      you
      need.
      Don't
      worry
      though;
      spend
      a
      bit
      more
      time
      here
      and
      you'll
      be
      able
      to
      hopefully
      catch
      most
      references
      and
      inside
      jokes.

      I
      found
      this
      in
      a
      drawer
      and
      I'm
      concluding
      that
      I
      bought
      this
      (which
      I
      firmly
      believe).
      But
      some
      people
      may
      be
      skeptical,
      insisting
      this
      was
      from
      some
      sort
      of
      event.
      Which
      is
      why
      I'm
      urging
      that
      this
      actually
      happened
      and
      I'm
      not
      bluffing.

      Amongst

      bastards,
      there
      might
      actually
      be

      don't
      know
      what
      to
      do.

      post
      won't

      posers
      flinch

      to

      this
      post
      is

      a
      performer
      and
      an
      artist.
      OP
      isn't
      implying
      that
      those
      who
      don't
      come
      up
      with
      their
      own
      work
      are
      insignificant
      but
      rather
      that
      they
      should
      be
      referred
      to
      as
      performers
      and
      not
      artists.
      Calling
      performers
      artists
      is
      simply
      wrong
      and
      disrespectful
      to
      the
      people
      who
      actually
      put
      effort
      to
      create
      the
      work.

      Oh
      my
      god
      you're
      such
      a
      monster.
      Its
      because
      of
      people
      like
      you
      women
      are
      facing
      discrimination
      all
      over
      the
      world.
      Now
      if
      you'll
      excuse
      me,
      I
      must
      go
      out
      for
      dinner
      with
      my
      5"11,
      slightly
      muscular
      but
      super
      fit
      rich
      boyfriend
      because
      my
      fridge
      is
      literally
      empty.
      Hopefully
      he
      won't
      try
      to
      talk
      to
      me
      or
      whatever.

      Actually,
      I'm
      not
      lol
      I
      just
      randomly
      switch
      between
      color
      and
      colour
      and
      z
      and
      s.
      While
      making

      I
      realised
      I
      put
      color
      in
      one
      of
      the
      panels
      so
      I
      played
      along.

      Hey
      there
      friend!
      Welcome
      to
      Reddit!
      The
      mods
      told
      us
      to
      be
      nice
      and
      that's
      exactly
      what
      I'm
      doing.
      You
      see,
      there's
      this
      post
      on
      r/comics
      (https://www.reddit.com/r/comics/comments/crn1mn/expectations_oc/?utm_medium=android_app amp;utm_source=share)
      and
      the
      artist
      is
      also
      on
      instagram,
      from
      where
      he/she
      crossposted.
      Now,
      when
      borrowing
      the
      comic
      for
      this
      meme,
      I
      left
      their
      watermark
      on
      purpose
      because
      after
      all,
      its
      their
      comic.

      Your
      presence
      in
      this
      sub
      has
      been
      super
      controversial
      so
      far.
      Heck,
      your
      chain
      of
      posts
      are
      probably
      the
      subreddit's
      highlight
      for
      this
      month.
      I've
      been
      meaning
      to
      comment
      for
      quite
      a
      while
      now,
      but
      the
      effort
      just
      didn't
      seem
      ^worth
      ^it.
      Guess
      I'll
      do
      it
      now.
      A
      few
      months
      ago,
      I
      wrote
      a
      similar
      post,
      though
      quite
      strongly
      worded
      and
      cast
      down
      by
      the
      first
      few
      people
      who
      saw
      it.
      Its
      practically
      the
      same
      idea,
      except
      that
      I
      referred
      to
      it
      as
      white
      supremacy.
      Which
      in
      my
      opinion,
      fits
      perfectly
      into
      this
      cacophony.
      Its
      literally
      embedded
      into
      these
      people,
      professionals
      and
      common
      people
      alike.
      I've
      seen
      flight
      attendants
      contact
      ground
      handling
      for
      additional
      vehicles
      to
      separately
      transport
      *foreigners*
      to
      the
      terminal
      despite
      the
      presence
      of
      elderly
      countrymen
      on
      board
      who
      would
      actually
      appreciate
      those
      services.
      And
      from
      the
      look
      of
      it,
      the
      action
      is
      probably
      promoted
      by
      their
      superiors.
      People
      reduce
      themselves
      to
      insignificance
      in
      the
      presence
      of
      *white
      skin*,
      gawking
      at
      the
      otherworldly
      creatures.
      You
      get
      the
      point.
      Next
      up,
      awareness.
      Bangladeshi
      people
      are
      literally
      years
      behind
      the
      trend.
      In
      fact,
      most
      of
      my
      associates
      will
      probably
      never
      know
      that
      theres
      a
      fire
      raging
      in
      the
      Amazon
      rainforest
      right
      now.
      They're
      too
      busy
      sharing
      whatever
      basic
      humour
      they
      can
      comprehend
      or
      whatever
      has
      managed
      to
      reach
      facebook.
      They're
      unable
      to
      catch
      basic
      references
      or
      sarcasm.
      Which
      ultimately
      results
      in
      them
      not
      being
      aware
      of
      their
      basic
      rights
      and
      what
      they're
      worth.
      Ah,
      the
      irony
      of
      it.
      I
      honestly
      don't
      have
      any
      respect
      for
      my
      countrymen
      at
      all.
      They've
      turned
      me
      into
      a
      narcissist.
      tldr;
      sad
      stuff

      the

      now?
      WOW.
      They're
      both
      crazy.
      Guy
      was
      probably
      having
      a
      bad
      day
      and
      came
      looking
      for
      comfort
      and
      was
      stupid
      enough
      to
      be
      aggressive
      about
      it.
      And
      rather
      than
      understanding
      the
      situation
      and
      having
      a
      civilised
      discussion
      about
      the
      issue,
      she
      began
      to
      undermine
      him
      just
      so
      that
      she
      could
      stand
      her
      ground.
      They're
      both
      trying
      to
      exert
      superiority
      over
      one
      another
      and
      thats

      OP,
      survival

      Fingers
      crossed.

      To
      those
      wondering,
      the
      guy
      probably
      had
      traffic
      behind
      him
      which
      left
      him
      no
      choice
      other
      than
      to
      risk
      a
      rush
      through
      to
      prevent
      the
      gates
      from
      damaging
      the
      car.
      She
      probably
      got
      nervous
      and
      bailed
      as
      the
      driver
      fumbled
      with
      the
      wheel.
      Just
      shows
      how
      strong
      bonds
      are.

      If
      you
      take
      a
      careful
      look
      at
      the
      situation,
      the
      driver
      had
      traffic
      behind
      him
      and
      the
      gates
      were
      closing
      on
      him.
      There
      was
      no
      way
      he
      could've
      reversed
      out
      of
      that
      deadlock.
      So
      he
      decided
      to
      keep
      going
      and
      was
      about
      to
      turn
      when
      she
      got
      freaked
      out
      and
      ditched
      the
      car.
      Why
      not?
      Her
      life
      was
      certainly
      was
      more
      important
      to
      her
      rather
      than
      maybe
      helping
      the
      driver
      navigate
      through
      the
      tight
      spot
      by
      providing
      info
      on
      the
      blind
      spots.
      But
      I
      agree
      with
      you.
      This
      post
      is
      not
      at
      all
      fitting
      for
      this
      sub.
      We
      don't
      always
      think
      straight
      and
      criticising
      her
      for
      it
      is
      simply
      misogyny.
      I
      took
      it
      down.

      Yes
      but
      lets
      say
      you're
      some
      kind
      of
      employer.
      Would
      you
      hire
      me
      just
      because
      I'm
      a
      guy
      or
      hire
      someone
      who
      is
      actually
      fit
      for
      the
      job?
      The
      answer
      is
      predictable.
      Woman
      who
      put
      effort
      into
      their
      work
      and
      genuinely
      deserve
      it
      get
      the
      job.
      The
      same
      goes
      for
      men.
      It
      isn't
      the
      1960s
      anymore.
      She's
      literally
      implying
      that
      anyone,
      despite
      education
      and
      ability
      should
      be
      hired
      just
      because
      they're
      a
      woman.

      Ah
      if
      we're
      talking
      about
      cars,
      its
      always
      been
      like
      this.
      Bangladesh
      may
      not
      be
      as
      poor
      as
      you
      think
      .
      Because
      of
      the
      heavy
      tax,
      most
      cars
      on
      the
      street
      can
      be
      compared
      to
      bottom
      class
      BMW
      like
      the
      X1
      and
      X5
      and
      c
      class
      Benz.
      And
      luxury
      cars
      like
      Audi
      and
      Bentley
      can
      be
      literally
      compared
      to
      performance
      car
      prices,
      like
      those
      by
      Ferrari
      or
      Mclaren.

      Stardew
      Valley
      Been
      very

      with
      schoolwork
      lately,
      GCE
      is
      next
      year.
      Can't

      see
      the

      of
      carrying
      the

      I

      yet
      but
      I've
      heard
      its
      a
      relaxing
      retreat
      from
      reality.
      And
      that's
      something
      I'd
      really
      be
      happy
      to
      have
      right
      now.
      Anyway,
      thanks
      for

      I'd
      say
      its
      easy.
      Simply
      walk
      chin
      up
      and
      assume
      you're
      dominant
      over
      everyone
      else.
      More
      confidence,
      better
      impressions.

      Hey!
      I
      don't
      like
      the
      people
      at
      work
      and
      its
      really
      stressing,
      um
      so
      could
      you
      just
      you
      know
      marry
      me
      and
      financially
      support
      me
      so
      I
      can
      wake
      up
      at
      9
      in
      the
      morning
      and
      watch
      TV
      all
      day?
      Like
      I
      said,
      working
      is
      kinda
      stressing...
      Oh
      and
      I'll
      take
      care
      of
      the
      kids
      for
      one
      half
      and
      you
      do
      the
      other
      after
      coming
      back
      from
      work.
      But
      I
      think
      you'll
      have
      to
      do
      the
      dishes
      because
      oh
      boy
      raising
      kids
      is
      hard.
      I
      know
      this
      offer
      sounds
      too
      good
      to
      be
      true
      but
      I'm
      ready
      when
      you
      are!
      So
      will
      you
      marry
      me?

      I
      agree.
      A
      lot
      of
      posts
      in
      this
      sub
      are
      simply
      woman-hating
      even
      though
      MGTOW
      is
      all
      about
      simply
      ignoring
      women
      and
      being
      careful
      now
      that
      nothing
      is
      fair
      to
      men.
      Global
      warming
      is
      100%
      real.
      But
      this
      kid
      is
      overreacting.
      No
      human
      has
      died
      from
      climate
      change
      yet,
      and
      the
      ecosystems
      that
      are
      disrupted
      are
      caused
      by
      other
      forms
      of
      human
      influence.
      The
      tears
      and
      anger
      she
      is
      showcasing
      just
      adds
      up
      to
      the
      fun
      made
      off
      of
      her.
      But
      this
      post
      has
      nothing
      to
      do
      with
      climate
      change.
      Its
      just
      using
      a
      photo
      to
      illustrate
      a
      point.
      The
      comments,
      however...
      She's
      just
      a
      kid,
      going
      through
      a
      phase
      and
      probably
      very
      badly
      set
      on
      a
      specific
      point.
      This
      might've
      been
      enforced
      by
      her
      parents,
      the
      media,
      whatever.
      Hopefully
      the
      rage
      will
      die
      down
      and
      she'll
      come
      to
      realise
      that
      she's
      just
      making
      a
      fool
      of
      herself.

      Dude.
       gt;Overnight
      Are
      you
      kidding
      me?
      Do
      you
      know
      what
      it
      takes
      to
      build
      a
      nuclear
      plant
      and
      keep
      it
      up,
      assuming
      third
      world
      countries
      don't
      exist?
      This
      process
      would
      literally
      take
      decades
      if
      we're
      being
      optimistic.
      Besides,
      there's
      this
      thing
      called
      radioactive
      waste
      and
      we
      definitely
      still
      don't
      know
      what
      to
      do
      with
      it.
      Again,
      assuming
      that
      third
      world
      countries
      are
      able
      to
      contain
      it.
      Nuclear
      energy
      is
      the
      distant
      future;
      we
      need
      a
      tonne
      of
      more
      research
      to
      undergo
      full
      conversion.

      I
      agree
      that
      the
      magnitude
      has
      been
      exaggerated
      and
      I'd
      call
      for
      a
      good
      30
      years
      before
      something
      serious
      happens.
      But
      a
      slow
      conversion
      *is*
      happening.
      A
      lot
      of
      things
      are
      politically
      and
      economically
      influenced,
      usually
      by
      those
      with
      power
      to
      ensure
      they
      retain
      their
      position.
      This
      is
      why
      we're
      unable
      to
      do
      a
      faster
      conversion.
      But
      the
      population
      bomb,
      the
      hole
      in
      the
      ozone
      layer,
      all
      of
      that
      is
      completely
      real,
      at
      least
      in
      my
      opinion.
      Climate
      change
      won't
      kill
      us.
      Too
      big
      of
      a
      population
      might,
      and
      probably
      will.

      I
      haven't
      done
      any
      strong
      research
      yet
      so
      I'll
      just
      stand
      with
      you
      on
      the
      hotter
      climates=better
      ecosystems
      point.
      But
      I
      still
      wholeheartedly
      believe
      that
      the
      ozone
      layer
      is
      punctured.
      And
      that
      is
      bad
      for
      us
      because
      cancer.
      But
      in
      the
      end,
      I
      really
      would
      say
      nothing
      serious
      is
      going
      to
      happen
      in
      the
      next
      half

      A

      But
      then
      it
      turned
      out
      like
      this.
      How

      This
      is
      Maslow's
      hierarchy
      of
      needs.
      https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/aRair_KoQ73X5OzkYogzWfrfH87N9LhXFBN30mpnKdi7ADsnn2Fa3B_JMALDHwNsefs5z0lmJ1qbHdDH86ulrSygMu_MLMunM9rqPZc1bl-9JLsmMKP2_c8=w399-h368
      Those
      poor
      kids
      in
      the
      picture
      are
      at
      the
      bottom
      of
      the
      pyramid,
      happy
      only
      if
      they
      meet
      basic
      needs
      like
      food,
      shelter
      and
      sanitation.
      As
      we
      go
      up,
      the
      people
      above
      tend
      to
      overlook
      what's
      below
      them
      on
      the
      pyramid,
      they
      take
      their
      existing
      status
      for
      granted.
      Therefore,
      as
      we
      go
      up,
      people
      forget
      about
      things
      like
      food
      and
      basic
      rights
      while
      focusing
      on
      really
      minuscule
      things
      like
      whether
      the
      CEO
      of
      their
      favourite
      toilet
      paper
      company
      is
      a
      woman.
      Greta
      Thunberg
      is
      a
      citizen
      of
      one
      of
      the
      most
      developed
      countries
      in
      the
      world.
      Not
      only
      does
      she
      enjoy
      complete
      rights
      and
      needs
      but
      also
      additional
      facilities
      that
      even
      solvent
      people
      in
      the
      third
      world
      countries
      do
      not
      receive.
      So
      now
      that
      she's
      plump
      and
      soft,
      she
      can
      forget
      about
      what
      she
      has
      and
      instead
      focus
      on
      the
      part
      of
      pyramid
      above
      her.
      Which
      is
      why
      she's
      nagging
      about
      trivial
      things
      because
      she
      doesn't
      have
      them.
      Its
      basic
      human
      psychology,
      really.
      The
      more
      you
      have,
      the
      more
      you'll
      want.
      But
      come
      on
      MGTOW!
      Stop
      trying
      to
      wrong
      her.
      She's
      just
      a
      kid
      without
      basic
      awareness
      about
      what
      happens
      in
      the
      world.
      Also,
      those
      who
      are
      reacting
      angrily
      by
      saying
      posts
      like
      these
      don't
      belong
      in
      this
      sub,
      think
      about
      what
      would
      happen
      if
      this
      was
      posted
      in
      other
      subs.
      MGTOW
      are
      flexible
      and
      open
      to
      discussion.
      That
      is
      why
      I
      like
      this
      sub!

      Its

      the

      Heck
      Yeah!
      I
      was
      almost
      starting

      I
      was
      generally
      being

      asshole
      by
      being
      narcissistic
      over
      these
      people.
      Feels
      good
      to
      know
      there
      are
      like
      minded
      people.
      They
      literally
      know
      nothing
      about
      what's
      happening
      in
      the
      world,
      are
      completely
      behind
      trend
      and
      all
      they
      can
      do
      is
      gape
      at
      Bollywood
      and
      Indian
      actors.

      Please.
      No
      one
      cares.
      Unless,
      you
      intentionally
      dress
      up
      to
      flaunt
      your
      identity.
      This
      makes
      you
      stand
      out
      amongst
      the
      crowd.
      Everyone
      will
      be
      gaping
      at
      you
      then
      because
      their
      brains
      find
      you
      as
      distinct,
      a
      diversion
      from
      reality.
      Human
      Psychology.
      Or
      if
      you
      and
      your
      partner
      start
      being
      intimate
      in
      public.
      For
      this,
      there's
      zero
      toleration
      for
      *EVERYONE*.
      Straight
      or
      non
      binary
      alike,
      people
      performing
      these
      acts
      will
      be
      swooped
      up
      by
      the
      police
      for
      disturbing
      the
      environment.
      Because
      its
      taboo
      here.
      But
      I
      would
      have
      to
      say,
      some
      people
      are
      homophobic,
      actually
      a
      lot
      of
      people
      are
      homophobic
      because
      they
      don't
      know
      the
      science
      behind
      it,
      but
      not
      to
      worry,
      they're
      quite
      closeted
      and
      won't
      speak
      up
      about
      it
      or
      attack
      you.
