      I
      hate
      to
      collect
      the
      Sacred
      Tears
      in
      the
      Silent
      Realm,
      in
      Skyward
      Sword,
      because
      there
      are
      some
      kind
      of
      guardians
      that
      always
      beat
      the
      shit
      out
      of
      me
      because
      I'm
      not
      a
      quality
      gamer
      and
      I
      never
      collect
      em
      on
      the
      specified
      time,
      but
      is
      quite
      fun
      collecting
      them
      in
      Twilight
      Princess

      Yess,
      but
      is
      a
      festival,
      I
      missed
      yesterday's
      show
      at
      El
      Paso
      due
      to
      my
      lack
      of
      money
      so
      I
      set
      all
      my
      hopes
      on
      that
      tour
      they

      That's
      amazing!
      I
      watched
      some
      clips
      of
      that
      presentation,
      pretty
      awesome,
      how
      was
      your
      experience
      there??
      I've
      heard
      some
      people
      here
      are
      trying
      to
      bring
      them
      to
      my
      city,
      but
      I'm
      reluctant,
      I
      hope
      they
      include
      Mexico
      in
      their
      tour

      So
      today
      is
      my
      first
      day
      on
      keto,
      this
      weekend
      I
      tried
      to
      get
      as
      much
      information
      as
      possible,
      I
      did
      the
      keto
      calculator
      and
      I'm
      using
      MFP
      to
      plan
      my
      meals
      and
      track
      my
      macros,
      I
      had
      some
      trouble
      getting
      enough
      protein,
      the
      food
      fits
      the
      macros
      but
      I'm
      not
      sure
      if
      it
      is
      nutritious
      and
      appropiate.
      [This](http://imgur.com/NcVxTLY)
      is
      how
      day
      meal
      looks
      and
      these
      are
      my
      results
      in
      the
      keto
      calculator.

      Thanks!
      I
      don't
      like
      avocado
      but
      I
      will
      definitely
      go
      on
      almonds
      and
      pecans,
      I
      haven't
      considered
      them
      tbh,
      and
      I
      would
      love
      to
      hear
      those
      ideas!
      thanks!!

      I
      wasn't
      sure
      if
      I
      was
      doing
      the
      things
      right,
      that's
      why
      I
      came
      here.
      I
      come
      from
      years
      of
      unhealthy
      diets,
      deprivation,
      binge
      disorder
      so
      I
      have
      really
      bad
      ideas
      stuck
      in
      my
      head
      about
      food
      and
      eating,
      this
      is
      so
      new
      for
      me
      I'm
      trying
      to
      learn
      and
      I
      want
      to
      be
      sure
      that
      I'm
      on
      the
      right
      pat
      so
      I
      can
      start
      sticking
      good
      ways
      of
      eating
      into
      my
      head.

      I
      got
      this
      recipe
      of
      arroz
      con
      leche
      with
      cauliflower
      instead
      of
      rice
      some
      time
      ago
      but
      didn't
      pay
      atention
      because
      I
      love
      arroz
      con
      leche
      and
      that
      didn't
      sound
      any
      good,
      but
      now
      that
      I
      am
      in
      keto
      I
      reconsidered
      the
      recipe,
      I
      tried
      myself
      last
      night
      and
      got
      it
      for
      lunch
      to
      work
      and
      it
      came
      really
      good,
      even
      my
      non-keto
      workmates
      loved
      it!!
      I
      couldn't
      find
      it
      here,
      but
      if
      it
      were
      already
      uploaded
      let
      me
      know!
      250
      grs
      Raw
      Cauliflower
      2
      cups
      unsweetened
      coconut
      and
      almond
      milk
      6
      pkg
      Splenda
      (or
      another

      and
      the
      amount
      you
      need)
      1/2
      cup
      Heavy
      whipping
      cream
      1/2
      tsp
      Vanilla
      extract
      2
      Cinnamon
      Sticks
      Just
      cut
      the
      florets
      and
      add
      them
      to
      boiling
      water
      until
      it's
      cooked
      and
      remove
      the
      water
      and
      smash
      it
      until
      you
      get
      tiny
      cauliflower
      pieces.
      Boil
      the
      milk
      with
      the
      vanilla
      and
      cinnamon
      (stirring
      so
      it
      doesn't
      burn),
      add
      it
      to
      the
      cauliflower,
      add
      the
      heavy
      cream
      and
      keep
      stirring,
      add
      the
      sweetener
      until
      is
      good
      for
      you,
      boil
      for
      a
      few
      minutes,
      (always
      stirrring).
      Let
      it
      cold
      and
      put
      it
      in
      the
      fridge,
      I
      left
      it
      in
      the
      fridge
      the
      whole
      night
      and
      it
      got
      better.
      I
      made
      it
      in
      three
      servings
      and
      it
      has
      8g
      net
      carbs
      per
      serving

      I
      felt
      like
      sharing
      it
      because
      it
      came
      delicious
      and
      I'm
      so
      thankful
      to
      this
      community!

      I
      made
      a
      water
      fasting
      from
      Sunday
      to
      Wednesday
      (I
      was
      already
      in
      ketosis)
      I
      planned
      water
      fasting
      for
      5-7
      days
      but
      I
      had
      to
      stop
      because
      on
      Wednesday
      I
      felt
      disgusted
      while
      drinking
      my
      water
      with
      salt,
      I
      liked
      it
      the
      other
      days,
      but
      that
      day
      it
      was
      so
      disgusting
      I
      almost
      threw
      up
      ,
      I
      felt
      like
      that
      the
      whole
      day,
      I
      couldn't
      drink
      water
      with
      salt
      anymore,
      today
      if
      I
      think
      about
      it
      it
      makes
      me
      wanna
      throw
      up
      again.
      I
      learned
      some
      good
      things
      while
      fasting,
      but
      I
      also
      realised
      it's
      not
      for
      everybody.

      I
      got
      late,
      but
      oh
      my
      glob
      I'm
      on
      the
      same
      boat,
      it's
      like
      reading
      my
      own
      story,
      I've
      been
      on
      and
      off
      keto
      since
      I
      started
      a
      month
      and
      a
      half
      ago,
      the
      most
      I
      sticked
      to
      keto
      was
      almost
      three
      weeks,
      but
      now
      it
      seems
      I
      can't
      get
      on
      track
      again.
      I
      have
      only
      two
      friends
      on
      MFP
      but
      I'd
      love
      getting
      more,
      and
      I'd
      be
      glad

      Magnesium
      is
      relaxing
      and
      could
      make
      you
      sleepy,
      it

      Thank
      you!
      Exactly
      what
      I
      needed,
      I'll
      be
      printing
      the
      graph
      for
      when
      my
      brain
      says:
      "nothing
      will
      happen
      if
      you
      eat
      the
      whole
      herd
      of
      cows"

      I
      feel
      you,
      last
      week
      I
      woke
      up
      stressed
      because
      in
      my
      dreams
      I
      drank
      a
      can
      of
      regular
      coke,
      and
      days
      before
      that
      I
      ate
      a
      burrito
      in
      another
      dream,
      I
      mean
      food
      that
      isn't
      worth

      It's
      not
      just
      your
      head!!
      I
      had
      the
      same
      question
      when
      you
      made
      this
      post,
      and
      saved
      it
      in
      case
      someone
      knew
      the
      answer,
      today
      I
      was
      listening
      to
      the
      song
      and
      I
      still
      can't
      remember
      the
      song
      so
      I
      came
      to
      the
      post
      to
      see
      if
      someone
      had
      posted
      the
      answer,
      if
      you
      remember
      it
      please
      let
      me
      know!!

      I
      didn't
      realize
      about
      yesterday's
      QOTD
      The
      tiny
      habits
      and
      triggers
      would
      be:
      *1.
      Not
      steping
      on
      the
      scale*
      -
      Weigh
      in
      my
      self
      daily
      always
      leads
      to
      discourage,
      but
      I'm
      always
      too
      anxious
      to
      see
      if
      I
      lost
      some
      weight,
      so
      when
      I
      wake
      up
      I
      go
      directly
      to
      the
      kitchen
      and
      drink
      water,
      so
      I
      know
      the
      wight
      won't
      be
      accurate
      and
      I
      don't
      step
      on
      the
      scale.
      *2.
      Drink
      water*
      -
      Every
      Morning
      I
      pack
      my
      4
      litres
      of
      water
      in
      two
      bottles,
      If
      I
      don't
      carry
      my
      water
      to
      work
      I
      probably
      won't
      be
      drinking
      water
      due
      to
      my
      self
      sabotage
      *3.
      Stick
      to
      an
      addictive
      tv
      serie*
      -
      That's
      an
      easy
      one,
      I
      have
      a
      friend
      who
      is
      always
      recommending
      me
      good
      stuff,
      doing
      this
      makes
      me
      forget
      about
      food.

      Hello
      people!
      I've
      been
      doing
      keto
      for
      about
      two
      weeks
      because
      I
      want
      to
      lose
      weight,
      and
      as
      an
      insulin
      resistant
      I
      haven't
      been
      able
      to
      do
      it
      with
      the
      conventional
      diets,
      I
      just
      discovered
      the
      thing
      about
      carbs
      and
      insulin,
      I
      discovered
      5:2
      some
      days
      ago
      and
      I
      want
      to
      give
      it
      a
      try
      (along
      with
      keto
      foods)
      5:2
      sounds
      more
      sustainable
      for
      long
      term
      than
      keto,
      (I
      will
      do
      keto
      if
      it's
      the
      only
      answer)
      I
      thought
      about
      doing
      just
      5:2
      after
      I
      reach
      my
      goal
      weight
      if
      it
      helps
      me
      to
      maintain
      my
      weight
      as
      an
      insulin
      resistant.
      Is
      anyone
      here
      an
      insulin
      resistant
      and
      had
      good
      responses
      with
      just
      5:2?
      Thanks
      in
      advance!

      I'm
      doing
      IF
      16:8
      and
      I
      enjoy
      a
      lot
      having
      two
      fullfilling
      meals,
      it
      satisfies
      my
      hunger
      for
      the
      rest
      of
      the
      day,
      instead
      of
      the
      three
      tiny
      meals
      and
      the
      two
      tinier
      snacks
      I
      used
      to
      have
      with
      one
      of
      those
      typical
      diets
      given
      by
      a
      nutritionist
      that
      actually
      made
      me
      more
      hungry
      and
      put
      me
      in
      a
      bad
      mood.
      I'm
      still
      having
      problems
      with
      my
      salt
      intake,
      on
      my
      last
      water
      fast
      I
      stopped
      at
      the
      third
      day
      because
      water
      with
      salt
      became
      disgusting
      for
      me,
      I'm
      trying
      to
      find
      a
      way
      since
      I
      want
      to
      make
      regulars
      water
      fasts
      longer
      than
      24
      hours.

      That's
      awesome!
      A
      pretty
      long
      time
      doing
      if,
      also
      you've
      got
      self
      control,
      just
      ate
      the
      pizza
      enjoyed
      it
      and
      moved
      on,
      and
      it's
      impressive,
      eating
      pizza
      would
      have
      leaded
      me
      to
      a
      binge
      episode
      full
      of
      guilt.
      Are
      you
      eating
      low
      carb?

      Well
      it's
      still
      Friday
      at
      my
      city,
      but

      I'll
      finally
      br
      making
      a
      recipe
      of
      keto
      pancakes
      a
      found
      this
      week,
      I
      even
      mixed
      togheter
      the
      dry
      ingredients
      some
      day
      and
      I
      ended
      up
      putting
      them
      in
      a
      ziploc
      bag
      and
      eating
      something
      else,
      maybe
      this
      Saturday
      I'll
      be
      eating
      them

      how
      much
      I
      love
      that

      he
      said:

      don't

      That
      will
      help
      me
      to
      think
      it
      twice
      tomorrow!
      My
      parents
      are
      coming
      and
      that
      means
      going
      out
      to
      eat
      and
      a
      lot
      of
      carby
      and
      fatty
      food,
      I'm
      worried
      today
      because
      my
      brain
      loves
      to
      sabotage
      me,
      the
      times
      I've
      failed
      I
      keep
      well
      until
      the
      waiter
      is
      going
      to
      take
      my
      order,
      and
      the
      moron
      brain
      changes
      everything
      and
      suddenly
      I'm
      convinced
      that's
      the
      way
      to
      happiness
      when
      is
      exactly
      the
      opposite.
      Unfortunately
      I
      haven't
      found
      out
      a
      plan
      to
      beat
      that.

      Checking
      in!
      My
      IF
      went
      pretty
      well,
      I
      actually
      managed
      to
      keep
      the
      things
      well
      this
      Saturday,
      kept
      my
      carb
      intake
      under
      20
      grams
      and
      just
      ate
      during
      my
      window,
      but
      my
      I
      went
      over
      my
      calorie
      goal
      ,
      I
      need
      to
      work
      on
      that
      and
      improve
      my
      eating
      patterns,
      still
      doing
      the
      habits,
      and
      somehow
      focusing
      on
      doing
      my
      tiny
      habits
      has
      helped
      me
      to
      stay
      strong
      during
      my
      fast,
      and
      to
      eat
      proper
      amounts
      of
      food
      during
      my
      eating
      window,
      I
      think
      all
      this
      has
      helped
      me
      against

      Agree!
      I
      listened
      to
      Subvision
      because
      of
      Ghost
      and
      I
      just

      them,
      and
      then
      listened
      MCC
      and
      loved
      them,
      I
      love
      Ghost,
      but
      MCC
      stole
      my
      soul.

      I
      want
      to
      be
      in!
      **01a**
      My
      current
      weight
      is
      168lbs,
      realistically
      I
      would
      like
      to
      be
      at
      145
      lbs
      by
      the
      end
      of
      the
      year,
      buy
      my
      major
      goal
      is
      to
      set
      a
      healthy
      relationship
      with
      the
      scale
      and
      food.
      **01b**
      My
      goal
      with
      this
      challenge
      is
      achieving
      a
      prolonged
      fasting.
      I
      want
      to
      fast
      for
      the
      solid
      28
      days,
      I
      need
      to
      get
      my
      life
      back,
      at
      the
      ending
      of
      2015
      and
      beggining
      of
      2016
      I
      was
      building
      confidence,
      exercising
      and
      healing
      relationship
      with
      food,
      but
      then
      I
      went
      into
      a
      downward
      spiral,
      keto
      has
      been
      helping
      me
      the
      last
      few
      weeks,
      but
      I
      need
      to
      do
      something
      to
      prove
      myself
      what
      I'm
      capable
      of.
      **02**
      Water
      fast
      as
      long
      as
      I
      can,
      and
      5:2
      if
      my
      water
      fast
      ends
      before
      the
      28
      days
      challenge
      **03**
      I'll
      be
      checking

      similar
      goals,
      we
      both
      want
      to
      lose
      around
      10-15
      (22
      -
      33lb)
      kg
      by
      the
      end
      of
      the
      year,
      and
      at
      least
      5
      kg
      (11lb)
      by
      the
      end
      of
      the
      challenge,
      also
      we
      are
      intending
      to
      do
      a
      full
      water
      fast.
      Wanna
      pair
      up?
      **01**
      I
      want
      to
      lose
      around
      2
      kg
      this
      week
      (4lbs)
      **02**
      The
      best
      celebration
      would
      be
      wearing
      a
      new
      pair
      of
      jeans
      I
      haven't
      been
      able
      to
      wear
      for
      about
      a
      year.

      **QOTD:**
      Yesterday
      was
      my
      first
      day
      water
      fast
      and
      uber
      had
      "Pan
      de
      muertos"
      (Mexican
      Day
      Of
      The
      Death
      bread)
      and
      a
      cookie
      for
      free,
      my
      mom
      made
      cookies
      with
      my
      favourite
      frosting,
      some
      of
      my
      workmates
      brought
      chocolates
      and
      my
      dad
      made
      tortillas
      de
      harina
      (flour
      tortillas),
      but
      somehow
      I
      stayed
      strong.
      I
      hope
      I
      can
      be
      like
      this
      the
      rest
      of
      the
      challenge!

      Wow
      your
      comment
      helps
      a
      lot!
      Yesterday
      was
      fully
      motivated
      and
      today
      I
      feel
      really
      overwhelmed,
      but
      that
      helps
      me
      to
      go
      through
      the
      day,
      thanks!

      Thank
      you!
      So
      after
      a
      few
      days
      it'll
      become
      less
      hard?
      I
      have
      no
      experience
      with
      fasting,
      and
      even
      when
      I
      don't
      feel
      hungry
      it's
      being
      hard!
      How's
      your
      fast
      going??

      I
      never
      thought
      people
      would
      be
      that
      concerned!
      Workmates
      are
      getting
      worried,
      I
      don't
      know
      what
      excuses
      I'll
      be
      using
      the
      next
      days.
      I'm
      feeling
      mostly
      fine,
      I
      had
      some
      moments
      of
      tiredness
      but
      I
      feel
      more
      "energetic".
      I'm
      still
      on
      my
      second
      day
      so
      I'll
      see
      how
      my
      body
      reacts.
      Wow
      that's
      pretty
      awesome!
      I'm
      struggling
      to
      get
      through
      this
      fast
      haha
      and
      I
      think
      it
      would
      be
      impossible
      to
      me
      fasting
      on
      holidays

      I
      haven't
      told
      anyone
      but
      they're
      concerned
      because
      they
      don't
      see
      me
      eat.
      I'll
      figure
      it

      to
      make

      **QOTD:**
      Honestly
      I
      got
      into
      the
      challenge
      for
      the
      weight
      loss,
      I
      wanna
      fit
      into
      my
      sweaters
      since
      cold
      is
      coming,
      and
      mental
      health,
      but
      since
      my
      family
      has
      noticed
      that
      I
      haven't
      been
      eating
      they
      told
      me
      a
      bunch
      of
      things
      (I
      know
      they're
      worried)
      but
      they
      basically
      said
      they
      thought
      I
      was
      smart,
      and
      doing
      the
      stupid
      things
      I
      was
      doing
      wouldn't
      make
      me
      any
      good.
      So
      that
      talk
      became
      the
      most
      poignant
      reason.
      I
      started
      putting
      post
      its
      on
      places
      I
      will
      see
      reminding
      me
      why
      I
      am
      doing
      this.
      Also
      I
      have
      a
      days
      counter
      for
      christmas
      at
      work
      and
      I
      set
      the
      days
      for
      the
      challenge,
      I
      love
      to
      see
      the
      number
      going
      down.

      Yes,
      I'm
      weighing
      daily,
      (not
      sure
      if
      I
      should
      do
      it
      weekly)
      and
      yes!
      It's
      really
      motivating
      see
      the
      scale
      going
      down,
      I
      wanna
      feel
      confortable
      with
      the
      scale
      so
      I
      set
      the
      scale
      to
      lbs
      instead
      of
      kg,
      kg
      is
      the
      unit
      I've
      used
      my
      whole
      life
      and
      I
      have
      those
      numbers
      really
      stick
      in
      my
      head
      and
      since
      I'm
      not
      that
      familiarized
      with
      the
      usage
      of
      pounds
      those
      numbers
      doesn't
      have
      a
      huge
      impact
      in
      my
      mind,
      and
      helps
      me
      not
      to
      desperate
      easily.
      I
      read
      your
      QOTD
      and
      I
      find
      it
      admirable!!
      You
      went
      through
      difficult
      and
      hard
      situations
      and
      you
      are
      keeping
      it
      going
      and
      doing
      it
      well,
      your
      story
      it's
      really
      inspiring!

      Well
      the
      problem
      I
      encountered:
      Yesterday
      had
      a
      major
      break
      down
      due
      to
      excessive
      hunger
      pain
      and
      ended
      the
      fast
      with
      unplanned
      food,
      feeling
      that
      a
      was
      such
      a
      failure
      because
      I
      didn't
      even
      make
      it
      to
      wich
      leaded
      me
      to
      a
      regular
      binge
      episode,
      and
      at
      night
      I
      was
      determined
      to
      go
      back
      to
      my
      old
      eating
      habits
      and
      stop
      all
      this
      and
      eveen
      planned
      a
      major
      binge
      day
      for
      today,
      but
      this
      morning
      I
      sarted
      thinking
      about
      the
      challenge
      and
      all
      the
      support
      here
      and
      realized
      that
      I
      have
      keep
      going,
      forgive
      myself
      and
      keep
      going,
      and
      I
      decided
      to
      go
      some
      weeks
      on
      IF
      and
      5:2
      to
      train
      myself
      and
      then
      try
      another
      extended
      fast
      again
      but
      with
      a
      feasible
      goal,
      and
      keep
      going
      until
      I
      reach
      a
      month
      fast
      or
      so.
      So
      thanks
      for
      your
      comments
      and
      recomendations!!
      Really
      helped
      me
      this
      morning
      to
      avoid
      a
      huge
      binge
      episode

      Great
      number!
      And
      a
      really
      good
      and
      motivating
      way
      to
      brake
      a
      fast
      ;)
      I
      read
      that
      /u/melisasunshine
      is
      also
      breaking
      their
      fast
      for
      a
      date.
      Congrats
      to
      you
      both!!
      and
      have
      a
      good

      Thanks!!
      I
      was
      disappointed
      because
      I
      was
      thinking
      that
      I**only**
      made
      it
      to
      the
      third
      day.
      But
      you're
      right,
      I
      need
      to
      be
      kind
      and
      patient.
      So
      I'll
      be
      proud
      of
      what
      I
      achieve
      and
      countinue
      learning
      about
      fast,
      I
      just
      decided
      to
      fast
      on
      the
      regular
      basis,
      and
      try
      to
      fix
      my
      relationship
      with
      food.
      Thanks
      for
      your
      support!

      Second
      day
      of
      IF
      and
      keto!
      Workmates
      will
      be
      having
      sushi
      for
      lunch,
      searched
      for
      some
      low
      carb
      meals
      but
      they
      don't
      have
      any
      so
      I'll
      just
      skip
      lunch
      (hopefully).
      I've
      lost
      5
      pounds
      since
      the
      challenge
      started.
      I'll
      take
      that
      as
      a
      motivation
      to
      keep
      going!
      Edit:
      **TOTD**
      Done!
      Edit
      2:
      How's
      your
      day
      going
      /u/Toecart
      ??

      Hahaha
      you're
      right,
      I
      can
      do
      it!
      I
      don't
      want
      to
      regain
      the
      lbs
      I've
      lost.
      Also
      I
      prefer
      saving
      that
      money.
      Thanks!

      So
      that's
      why
      I
      failed
      my
      water
      fast.
      It's
      still
      giving
      me
      nausea
      just
      seeing
      the
      container.

      I'm

      tempted
      and
      is

      keep

      Definitely
      my
      parents
      coming,
      they #180;ll
      leave
      on
      wednesday
      so
      it
      will
      be
      rough
      until
      then,
      even
      when
      my
      dad
      has
      diabetes
      they
      always
      bring
      all
      kind
      of
      carby
      food
      and
      they
      follow
      religiously
      the
      rule
      of
      breakfast-lunch-dinner.
      I #180;m
      currently
      skipping
      dinner
      and
      I #180;m
      sure
      they
      will
      be
      having
      their
      typical
      extra
      carby
      and/or
      sugary
      dinners,
      I
      don #180;t
      know
      exactly
      what
      I
      will
      do,
      maybe
      I #180;ll
      keep
      my
      cross
      puzles
      with
      me
      all
      the
      time
      to
      distract
      myself.
      I
      mean
      yesterday
      I
      spent
      almost
      4
      hours
      at
      my
      brother #180;s
      place
      taking
      care
      of
      my
      nieces
      and
      there
      were
      two
      boxes
      of
      chocolate
      and
      chocolate
      chip
      costco
      muffins
      looking
      at
      me
      while
      listening
      to
      my
      brother
      saying
      *feel
      free
      to
      take
      anything
      you
      want*
      so
      if
      I
      overcame
      that,
      at
      least
      I
      have
      to
      fight
      this,
      maybe
      is
      time
      to
      go
      back
      and
      finish
      Skyward
      Sword.

      1.
      My
      friend
      talked
      to
      me
      about
      them
      and
      refused
      to
      listened
      ot
      them,
      until
      one
      day
      showed
      me
      a
      video
      and
      I
      thought
       #168;here
      we
      go
      again
      with
      one
      of
      those
      bands #168;
      put
      the
      earphone
      and
      it
      blowed
      my
      mind
      how
      they
      sounded,
      love
      at
      first
      sight.
      2.
      Con
      Clavi
      Con
      Dio,
      Infestissumam
      and
      Mummy
      Dust
      3.
      The
      respect,
      somehow
      Ghost
      atracted
      a
      really
      diverse
      fandom,
      and
      people
      here
      are
      always
      nice
      and
      helpful.
      4.
      Tool,
      NIN,
      Oasis,
      Noel
      Gallagher,
      Magna
      Carta
      Cartel,
      QOTSA,
      The
      Beatles
      5.
      Female
      orgasm
      6.
      I
      probably
      listen
      to
      them
      daily,
      and
      talk
      about
      them
      with
      my
      workmate,
      I
      mostly
      owe
      that
      friendship
      to
      Ghost.
      7.
      Talking
      only
      about
      r/GhostBC
      I
      would
      say
      respect
      and
      the
      passion
      for
      Ghost,
      as
      I
      already
      said
      there #180;s
      so
      much
      diversity
      of
      Ghost
      fans,
      so
      I
      don #180;t
      know
      if
      there #180;s
      general
      beliefs.
      8.
      It #180;s
      a
      cool
      community,
      also
      if
      someone
      feels
      there #180;s
      something
      that
      could
      be
      improved,
      they
      do
      something
      about
      it,
      like
      the
      theme
      someone
      put
      their
      time
      and
      effort
      to
      make
      it
      look
      better.

      It
      was
      a
      good
      week,
      ups
      and
      downs
      but
      mostly
      learned
      a
      lot,
      mentally
      it
      was
      a
      great
      week
      **01.**
      *High
      point*
      probably
      that
      I
      achieved
      a
      three
      day
      fast.
      *Low
      point*
      I
      broke
      the
      fast
      unexpectedly
      and
      with
      a
      semi
      binged,
      but
      I
      instead
      of
      giving
      up
      I
      went
      keto
      and
      IF
      the
      next
      day
      **02.**
      I
      took
      a
      cheat
      day
      today
      today
      to
      have
      breakfast
      with
      the
      family,
      so
      I
      need
      to
      go
      back
      on
      track
      tomorrow,
      my
      kaizen
      will
      be
      planning
      a
      feasable
      goal
      of
      fasting
      days
      adn
      break
      the
      fast
      with
      keto.
      **03.**
      I
      lost
      almost
      5
      pounds,
      how
      did
      you
      do
      /u/Toecart

      I
      don't

      how
      many
      miles
      (barely
      two
      miles,

      I
      do
      15
      min
      of
      jog
      and
      15

      is
      doing
      five
      minutes
      of
      jog
      more.
      I'll
      see
      how
      is
      it
      going.
      I
      hope
      I
      can
      reach
      6
      miles
      soon!

      Naah,
      I'm
      a
      total
      newbie,
      basically
      been
      doing
      this
      since
      the
      challenge
      started.
      But
      I
      dream
      a
      lot
      about
      it,
      when
      I
      fasted
      I
      dreamt
      that
      I
      ate
      and
      couldn't
      stop
      my
      self
      from
      doing
      it,
      and
      currently
      I
      dream
      that
      I
      eat
      non
      keto
      foods
      and
      outside
      of
      my
      eating
      window
      and
      it
      takes
      me
      some
      time
      to
      realize/accept
      it
      is
      just
      a
      dream,
      I
      wake
      up
      scared
      and
      full
      of
      guilt.
      I
      guess
      it
      will
      only
      be
      during
      the
      first
      weeks.
      Edit:
      Check-in:
      Second
      day
      of
      IF,
      still
      on
      the
      same
      weight
      I
      was
      after
      the
      water
      fast,
      it
      doesn't
      bother
      me
      since
      I
      had
      a
      cheat
      sunday
      though.
      I
      just
      realized
      the
      daily
      check-in
      was
      actually
      a
      daily
      check-in
      and
      not
      just
      answering
      the
      QOTD
      as
      I
      stupidly
      thought
      **sorry**

      I
      tried
      a
      fast
      some
      time
      ago
      and
      I
      stopped
      at
      the
      third
      day
      because
      I
      felt
      extremely
      nauseus
      about
      water
      with
      lite
      salt,
      I
      still
      find
      it
      disgusting
      (when
      I
      started
      the
      fast
      it
      was
      tasty
      for
      me)
      and
      few
      days
      ago
      I
      read
      supplementation
      of
      potassium
      may
      cause
      nausea,
      especially
      on
      an
      empty
      stomach,
      so
      take
      care
      with
      that.

      **QOTD:**
      I
      plan
      my
      fasts
      extremely
      conservative
      and
      as
      days
      go
      by
      brain
      becomes
      suddenly
      liberal,
      so
      it's
      a
      transition
      from
      Conservative
      Monday
      to
      Liberal
      Sunday.
      I'm
      currently
      on
      third
      day
      of
      IF
      keto
      (trying
      to
      prepare
      for
      a
      water
      fast)
      and
      struggling
      because
      on
      friday
      is
      my
      boss's
      birthday,
      I
      planned
      starting
      a
      water
      fast
      on
      that
      day
      and
      it'll
      be
      hard
      because
      of
      the
      cake
      and
      pizza.
      *Check-in:*
      Weight
      still
      the
      same
      163.5
      pounds,
      kinda
      dissapointing.
      I
      haven't
      succeed
      with
      my
      water
      fast
      protocols
      but
      still
      going
      back
      to
      the
      train,
      so
      I
      guess
      that's
      fine
      for
      now.

      10
      since
      monday!
      I
      almost
      decided
      not
      to
      go
      yesterday,
      but
      I
      remembered
      the
      challenge
      and
      immediatly
      went
      out.

      **QOTD:**
      I
      haven't
      broken
      a
      fast
      intended
      :(
      *Check-in:*
      Fourth
      day
      of
      IF
      keto,
      but
      I
      just
      ate
      a
      tiny
      chocolate
      bar,
      couldn't
      resist.
      Been
      going
      out
      for
      a
      walk
      the
      past
      three
      days.
      I
      decided
      to
      water
      fast
      tomorrow,
      but
      I'll
      just
      take
      a
      normal
      eating
      day
      for
      my
      boss's
      birthday
      and
      I'll
      fast
      this
      Saturday,
      I'm
      obligated
      since
      I
      need
      the
      money
      I
      usually
      use
      on
      groceries
      for
      something
      else,
      so
      I
      have
      to
      last
      a
      week
      at
      least,
      I
      hope
      I
      can
      make
      it
      longer.

      Go
      ahead
      with
      IF!
      if
      WF
      didn't
      work
      so
      well,
      maybe
      IF
      will
      do.
      Your
      emotional
      health
      is
      important
      too,
      if
      WF
      makes
      you
      grumpy
      and
      makes
      you
      feel
      bad
      about
      not
      being
      at
      your
      best
      with
      your
      family,
      you
      could
      try
      somethimg
      else.
      I
      know
      how
      overwhelming
      the
      time
      is,
      but
      I'm
      sure
      you
      will
      reach
      your
      goal
      and
      it
      doesn't
      matter
      if
      it
      takes
      a
      little
      longer
      because
      you're
      going
      to
      be
      in
      a
      better
      mood
      and
      spending
      time
      with
      your
      family,
      if
      you
      go
      on
      WF
      and
      lose
      weight
      rapidly
      but
      being
      stressed
      you
      may
      regret
      that
      later,
      the
      family
      time
      you
      lost.
      You're
      already
      doing
      a
      lot
      and
      you
      should
      be
      proud,
      and
      also
      you're
      finding
      out
      what
      works
      better
      for
      you.
      keep
      going!!
      even
      if
      you
      have
      a
      bad
      eating
      day,
      just
      keep
      going.

      Today
      is
      definitely
      not
      a
      good
      day
      for
      me,
      I've
      been
      binging,
      I've
      had
      worse,
      but
      still
      a
      binge.
      is
      what
      goes
      on
      my
      mind
      during
      the
      episodes
      what
      worries
      me
      the
      most,
      (and
      of
      course
      the
      idea
      of
      regaingn
      the
      weight
      lost)
      I
      just
      don't
      want
      to
      relapse,
      I
      don't
      want
      to
      go
      back
      to
      those
      awful
      days,
      but
      I
      feel
      I
      can't
      stop
      me
      from
      doing
      it.
      Any
      way
      I
      have
      to
      keep
      going,
      I
      try
      to
      do
      it
      even
      when
      I
      don't
      have
      any
      motivation.
      **TOTD:**
      I
      don't
      know
      that
      *TOTD*
      means
      but
      is
      done.

      I
      actually
      didn't
      eat
      lovely
      food,
      didn't
      even
      enjoy
      it
      but
      have
      to
      keep
      going
      and
      don't
      purge,
      I'll
      fast
      tomorrow
      to
      heal
      my
      mind.
      I
      just
      realized
      eating
      days
      stresses
      me
      out
      more
      than
      fasting.
      I'll
      keep
      this
      in
      mind
      "*if
      you
      must
      eat
      a
      lot,
      make
      sure
      you
      are
      eating*
      **lovely
      food**"
      and
      try
      to
      stop
      eating
      senseless
      and
      disgusting
      food.
      Thank
      you!

      Yessss
      I
      have
      an
      awful
      black
      and
      white
      mentality,
      which
      leads
      me
      anywhere
      actually,
      I
      plan
      super
      strict
      things
      to
      lose
      weight
      super
      rapidly
      and
      obviously
      I'm
      not
      strong
      enough
      to
      make
      them
      and
      I
      get
      frustrated
      when
      I
      didn't
      lose
      500
      pounds
      in
      five
      days.
      Like
      the
      last
      fast
      I
      did,
      lasted
      three
      days
      and
      I
      wanted
      to
      fast
      for
      a
      month.
      I'll
      start
      a
      fast
      tomorrow
      but
      my
      goal
      will
      be
      seven
      days.
      I
      think
      is
      more
      feasible
      and
      I'll
      be
      able
      to
      make
      it.
      I'll
      take
      your
      advice
      and
      start
      short
      term
      goals
      to
      grow
      my
      willpower.
      Thanks
      a
      lot!

      And

      I

      **AOTD:**
      Actually,
      inside
      of
      the
      realm,
      I #180;m
      thankful
      for
      the
      challenge
      and
      the
      sub.
      I
      just
      discovered
      fasting
      a
      short
      time
      ago,
      and
      I
      defied
      some
      of
      my
      old
      patterns
      due
      to
      this
      sub
      and
      the
      people
      here.
      Outside
      of
      the
      realm,
      I
      am
      so
      grateful
      (I
      know
      is
      cheesy)
      for
      my
      nieces,
      they
      are
      the
      ones
      I
      think
      about
      when
      I
      relapse
      nd
      make
      me
      force
      myself
      to
      get
      up
      again,
      and
      are
      the
      ones
      I
      know
      that
      love
      me
      despite
      my
      appeareance.
      *Check-in*
      I
      gained
      a
      pound
      after
      yesteday #180;s
      over
      eating,
      tha
      scale
      marked
      164,
      I #180;m
      intending
      a
      water
      fast
      today,
      I #180;ll
      be
      busy
      doing
      christmas
      shopping
      which
      will
      keep
      me
      distracted.

      *The
      Good*
      I
      did
      IF
      and
      keto
      this
      week,
      *The
      Bad*
      I
      succumbed
      on
      Friday
      eating
      cake
      and
      buritos,
      and
      didn't
      go
      out
      for
      a
      walk*The
      Ugly*
      It's
      reaaally
      cold,
      I'm
      not
      sure
      if
      it's
      the
      fasting
      or
      it's
      actually
      really
      cold,
      or
      both
      but
      it
      doesn't
      matter
      because
      *The
      Glorious*
      is
      that
      I'm
      on
      my
      second
      day
      of
      water
      fast
      and
      feeling
      great,
      cold,
      but
      great,
      I
      haven't
      felt
      real
      hungry,
      also
      yesterday
      did
      the
      Christmas
      shopping,
      and
      didn't
      eat
      anything
      at
      the
      mall,
      I
      really
      wanted
      a
      Starbucks
      and
      a
      burger
      but
      I
      made
      it
      pretty
      well.
      How

      I've

      I
      keep
      going!
      My
      fourth
      day
      is
      almost
      finished.
      I
      never
      thought
      that
      I
      could
      make
      more
      than
      three
      days,
      but
      it
      gets
      a
      little
      easier.
      Haha
      I'm
      glad
      we
      don't
      celebrate
      thanksgiving
      it
      makes
      the
      fast
      less
      harder,
      I
      would
      ended

      eating

      Fortunately
      for
      my
      fast,
      in
      Mexico
      we
      don't
      celebrate
      thanksgiving,
      but
      the
      biggest
      challenge
      will
      be
      this
      weekend,
      going
      out
      for
      breakfast
      with
      the
      family.
      I
      got
      some
      work
      for
      the
      weekend,
      so
      probably
      I'll
      be
      working
      at
      home
      during
      that
      time.

      I'm
      here
      to
      read
      the
      advices,
      I
      haven't
      broken
      a
      fast
      in
      a
      propper
      way,
      and
      since
      I'm
      intending
      at
      least
      ten
      days
      I
      want
      to
      be
      well
      informed.
      *Check
      in:*
      On
      my
      fifth
      day
      of
      wf
      6.5
      lbs
      down
      since
      then.
      I'm
      feeling
      lethargic
      today.
      I
      hope
      it
      passes
      away,
      I'll
      get
      some
      pink
      salt
      to
      see
      if
      it
      helps.
      *Edit:*
      I
      had
      no
      idea
      that
      fancy
      salt
      were
      that
      expensive,
      so
      no
      no.
      I'll
      wait
      to
      home
      to
      get
      some
      sea
      salt.

      Haha
      actually
      I've
      been
      driving
      daily,
      I
      think
      I've
      been
      feeling
      lethargic
      because
      I've
      been
      doing

      shifts
      for
      the
      last
      three
      weeks,
      but
      I
      feel
      well
      with
      the
      fast.
      I'm
      hesitant
      about
      breaking
      the
      fast,
      my
      parents
      are
      in
      town
      and
      mom
      is
      extremely
      worried,
      she
      thinks
      I'm
      gonna
      die,
      and
      she
      feels
      she
      has
      to
      do
      something
      about
      it,
      no
      matter
      what
      I
      say.
      You
      start
      tomorrow
      right?
      10
      days
      is
      amazing,
      I
      think
      you'll
      make
      12
      days
      pretty
      well

      **AOTD**
      I
      wanted
      to
      gain
      some
      control
      over
      my
      BED,
      instead
      of
      the
      food
      controling
      me,
      apparently
      has
      been
      working.
      And
      also
      I
      want
      to
      lose
      weight,
      every
      time
      I
      count
      calories,
      or
      restrict
      some
      group
      of
      food
      I
      become
      obsessed
      about
      it,
      I
      relapse
      into
      binging,
      binging-purging
      or
      self
      harming
      or
      mostly
      the
      three
      of
      them
      and
      I
      get
      frsutrated
      because
      I
      relapsed,
      and
      I'm
      not
      losing
      weight
      etc.
      So
      I
      decided
      to
      try
      fasting
      which
      is
      easier
      than
      counting
      calories,
      and
      it
      lets
      me
      have
      some
      normal
      eating
      days.
      I
      haven't
      had
      the
      thought
      of
      "lets
      eat
      everything
      today
      because
      tomorrow
      we
      will
      be
      dieting"
      the
      days
      before
      my
      fasts,
      I
      ate
      kinda
      normal.
      Still
      woking
      on
      it,
      but
      is
      the
      first
      time
      I
      see
      some
      proegress
      over
      my

      I
      think
      you're
      right!
      There's
      always
      more
      time
      later
      to
      fast,
      also
      you
      broke
      the
      fast
      at
      a
      new
      place

      so
      I
      think

      worthy.
      By
      the
      way,
      40
      hours
      is
      pretty
      good!

      **AOTD:**
      Well
      late
      to
      the
      party.
      Yesterday
      I
      spent
      the
      day
      sick,
      apparently
      I
      developed
      some
      IBS
      due
      to
      my
      binge
      eating
      disorder,
      I
      had
      a
      major
      break
      down
      on
      sunday,
      and
      yesterdey
      I
      felt
      like
      shit
      the
      whole
      day.
      It
      shocked
      me
      the
      fact
      that
      my
      mental
      disorder
      had
      such
      and
      impact
      over
      my
      physical
      health
      besides
      being
      overweight.
      I'm
      finally
      determined
      to
      eat
      well,
      control
      the
      overeating
      and
      fast
      regularly.
      Today
      Today
      I'm
      eating
      soft
      food,
      I
      don't
      feel
      well
      yet,
      but
      I'm
      not
      feeling
      like
      I
      did
      yesterday.
      WHat
      I
      wanted
      to
      acomplish
      with
      the
      challenge
      were
      some
      weight
      lost,
      but
      now
      I
      just
      want
      to
      recover
      and
      get
      better.

      We

      in

      we're
      both
      24,
      newbies,
      want
      to
      develop
      a
      healthy
      relationship
      with
      food
      and
      get
      a
      little
      more
      confident,
      and
      the
      part
      about
      going
      to
      a
      restaurant,
      that's
      exactly
      what
      I
      want
      to
      achieve
      as
      well!
      especially
      during

      a

      fella,
      I'm
      definitely
      too
      sensitive.
      I
      tried

      up
      someone
      who
      had

      Weeell
      my
      *secret
      weapon*
      by
      now
      is
      that
      I'm
      scared
      to
      get
      worse,
      I've
      caught
      my
      self
      these
      days
      wanting
      to
      eat
      foot
      that
      could
      damage
      me
      or
      I
      even
      thought
      about
      a
      binge,
      but
      my
      dad
      asked
      me
      if
      I
      was
      sick,
      he's
      worried
      because
      he
      says
      I
      look
      bad
      and
      sick,
      so
      and
      I'm
      kinda
      terrified
      about
      it
      now.
      I
      hope
      everything
      has
      gone
      well

      Definitely
      my
      triggers
      are
      *weekends*
      since
      I
      wake
      up
      my
      brain
      switches
      everything,
      but
      I
      think
      this
      will
      be
      a
      different
      weekend,
      I
      need
      to
      recover
      so
      I
      can
      hopefully
      start
      fasting
      again
      once
      I
      stop
      taking
      medications
      next
      week.
      :D
      What
      about
      you
      /u/TheNamelessOnesWife
      ?
      When
      do
      you
      need
      your
      *secret
      weapon*
      the
      most?

      haven't
      fasted
      enough
      to
      actually
      notice
      it.
      *Check-in*
      still
      eating
      keto,
      5
      days
      in
      a
      row,
      I
      almost
      failed
      today
      but
      I
      still
      doing
      well,
      I'm
      getting
      worried
      that
      despise
      my
      illness
      I
      still
      thinking
      in
      binging
      :(

      Wow!
      I
      struggle
      with
      that
      too,
      and
      loved
      the
      idea
      of
      the
      waterjug!
      I
      just
      got
      a
      pretty
      cute
      one
      last
      week
      and
      I'll
      be
      using
      it.
      I'm
      surprised
      with
      the
      things
      you
      said
      because
      I
      realized
      I
      have
      the
      two
      problems
      but
      I
      never
      actually
      realized
      which
      exactly
      my
      problem
      was.
      Thanks
      to
      this
      I
      think
      I'll
      be
      recognising
      my
      problems
      anf
      doing
      something
      about
      it
      Also
      I
      agree
      with
      the
      family
      part,
      is
      extremely
      exhausting
      dealing
      with
      a
      people
      and
      also
      dealing
      with
      food

      I
      already
      knew
      socialzing
      stresses
      me
      out
      but
      thanks
      to
      /u/TheNamelessOnesWife
      I
      realized
      that
      I
      rely
      on
      food
      for
      things
      just
      like
      not
      knowing
      what
      to
      do
      with
      my
      hands,
      I'll
      be
      using
      stuf
      like
      water
      bottles
      or
      a
      small
      item
      to
      play
      with
      and
      distract
      myself
      from
      food,
      it's
      been
      really
      good
      reading
      my
      partner's
      advices!
      Sorry
      I
      didn't
      give
      a
      response
      yesterday,
      I
      guess
      you
      can
      talk
      whatever
      is
      in
      our
      mind
      today
      :p
      Sorry
      to
      hear
      you're
      feeling
      awful
      today
      /u/stefanielaine
      I
      hope
      get
      well
      soon!
      and
      thanks
      for
      hosting
      this
      week
      :)
