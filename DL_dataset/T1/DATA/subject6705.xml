      Holy
      shit
      thanks,
      we
      literally
      have
      such
      glasses
      on
      our
      windows
      and
      never
      even
      realized
      that
      there
      was
      something
      behind
      that
      phenomenon.

      For
      those
      interested
      in
      knowing
      the
      name
      of
      that
      engineer,
      it's
      Sonam
      Wangchuk
      and
      he
      won
      Ramon
      Magsaysay
      award
      for

      Well
      circumstances
      and
      situations
      might
      be
      disparate,
      but
      I
      have
      experienced
      all
      the
      things
      you've
      mentioned
      in
      this
      post
      OP.
      I
      am
      not
      a
      person
      who
      you
      should
      be
      looking
      for
      to
      provide
      a
      solution
      but
      I
      can
      say
      with
      certainty
      that
      you're
      not
      the
      only
      one
      to
      have
      experienced
      these
      moments.
      Do
      try
      to
      invite
      your
      coworkers/friends
      for
      a
      nice
      drink
      or
      something,
      if
      you
      are
      a
      sports
      fanatic
      find
      an
      outside
      of
      work
      friend
      who
      would
      watch
      games
      with
      you.
      In
      my
      case,
      finding
      people
      who
      are
      interested
      in
      same
      topics/subjects
      as
      I
      do
      is
      imperative.
      Because
      that
      would
      mean
      I
      always
      have
      something
      to
      talk/discuss
      so
      that
      we
      don't
      feel
      awkward.

      When
      I
      feel
      extremely
      nervous
      or
      anxious
      I
      usually
      get
      a
      headache
      and
      it
      doesn't
      go
      away
      until
      my
      brain
      feels
      everything
      is
      fine.
      And
      I
      feel
      anxious
      for
      extremely
      trivial
      matters,
      adding
      to
      that
      my
      stutter
      never
      helped
      me
      either.
      Kinda
      think
      stutter
      is
      one
      of
      the
      culprits
      causing
      my
      anxiety.

      Well
      done
      and
      best
      of
      luck
      with
      that
      interview.
      You'll
      get
      through
      the
      interview,
      but
      if
      you
      don't
      you
      still
      progressed
      a
      little.
      From
      not
      getting
      an
      interview
      at
      all
      to
      atleast
      getting
      one.

      Better
      late
      than
      never!
      If
      there's
      another
      one
      of
      those
      gaming
      conventions
      around
      the
      corner,
      invite
      them,
      I
      know
      you
      have
      a
      fear
      of
      getting
      rejected
      but
      honestly
      I
      think
      they
      would
      not
      "reject"
      your
      invitation.
      Please
      keep
      in
      mind
      that,
      they've
      a
      busy
      life
      so
      if
      they
      couldn't
      attend
      it's
      probably
      because
      of
      their
      work
      schedule
      so
      no
      need
      to
      worry
      about
      that,
      just
      invite
      them.
      Now
      my
      suggestion?
      It's
      not
      that
      hard
      to
      find
      a
      friend
      with
      similar
      interests
      these
      days
      with
      social
      media
      etc,
      I'd
      suggest
      you
      to
      use
      social
      media
      to
      find
      people
      with
      similar
      interests
      and
      then
      ask
      them
      if
      you
      can
      join
      them
      in
      their
      activities
      related
      to
      the
      interests.
      Like
      for
      example,
      if
      you
      like
      sports
      you
      can
      probably
      watch
      a
      screening
      of
      a
      game
      with
      them.

      Thanks
      so
      much
      for
      these
      exercises.
      Hope
      it
      works
      out
      for
      me.
      And
      also
      if
      you
      don't
      mind
      me
      asking
      what
      were
      the
      previous
      exercises
      you
      were
      given?
      If
      you
      think
      that
      might
      help
      others,
      can
      you
      post
      them
      as
      well?

      I
      guess
      the
      idea
      behind
      this
      is
      same
      as
      stretching
      the
      vowels
      technique.
      When
      you
      talk
      in
      a
      normal
      speed
      you
      tend
      to
      stutter,
      that's
      why
      most
      speech
      therapy
      classes
      across
      the
      globe
      advocate
      stretching
      the
      vowels
      technique.
      While
      doing
      that
      won't
      make
      you
      sound
      normal,
      it
      might
      help
      you
      sound
      normal
      when
      you're
      putting
      it
      to
      use
      in
      real
      world.
      I
      have
      tried
      the
      AEIOU
      technique
      before
      and
      I
      think
      it
      helped
      me
      a
      little
      at
      least.
      [Try
      diaphragmatic
      breathing](https://youtu.be/kgTL5G1ibIo)
      along
      with
      the
      stretching
      technique,
      it
      might
      help
      you.
      Also,
      read
      out
      loud
      whatever
      you
      can
      like
      newspaper,
      on
      a
      daily
      basis.

      You
      could
      choose
      cash
      on
      delivery
      and
      refuse
      to
      receive
      the
      other
      one.
      And
      moreover,
      most
      of
      the
      time
      it's
      not

      Oh
      that's
      unfortunate.
      Amazon.in
      offers
      cash
      on
      delivery
      for
      products
      full
      filled
      by
      them
      (which
      constitutes
      at
      least
      70-80%
      of
      the
      total
      available
      products).
       gt;Aside,
      wouldnt
      they
      send
      the
      whole
      order
      as
      one
      package
      so
      how
      would
      you
      refuse
      half?
      It
      depends
      on
      what
      products
      you're
      purchasing,
      but
      mostly
      if
      you
      purchase
      two
      different
      items
      they
      ought
      to
      be
      packed
      in
      two
      different
      packages.
      But
      yeah
      you're
      right
      this
      probably
      isn't
      a
      good
      idea,
      coz
      refusing
      just
      one
      of
      them
      will
      be
      tough
      if
      they
      both
      arrive
      at
      the
      same
      time
      (if
      they
      don't,
      you
      could
      definitely
      refuse
      the
      one
      you
      don't
      need).

      Are
      you
      seeking
      or
      planning
      on
      seeking
      professional
      help?
      I
      would
      suggest
      you
      to
      do
      so.
      In
      the
      meantime,
      there
      are
      couple
      of
      things
      you
      could
      *try*
      which
      could
      potentially
      help
      you
      sleep,
      please
      remember
      these
      aren't
      sure
      shot
      solutions
      so
      these
      may
      or
      may
      not
      be
      of
      any
      help
      to
      you.
      1-
      Try
      massaging
      your
      head
      with
      some
      kind
      of
      oil
      15-20
      minutes
      before
      you
      sleep.
      Preferably
      choose
      an
      oil
      which
      has
      no
      chemicals
      in
      it.
      2-
      Try
      to
      imagine
      a
      favourable
      scenario,
      like
      having
      a
      vacation
      in
      the
      tropics.
      Having
      fun,
      relaxing.
      Don't
      worry
      about
      the
      reality,
      just
      sleep
      pretending
      you're
      actually
      in
      the
      tropics
      having
      fun.
      3-
      Buddy
      you're
      not
      the
      first
      one
      to
      have
      trouble
      while
      sleeping,
      try
      listening
      to
      sleep
      music
      while
      sleeping.
      Conveniently,
      there
      are
      applications
      available
      both
      on
      play
      store
      and
      applestore
      to
      stop
      the
      music
      after
      a
      while,
      to
      avoid
      having
      to
      play
      the
      music
      whole
      night
      and
      draining
      your
      phone's
      battery.

      Even
      I
      can't
      imagine
      how
      this
      could
      offend
      anyone.
      Just
      because
      a
      Muslim
      king
      executed
      a
      sikh

      after

      denied

      embrace
      Islam,
      commemorating
      his
      life
      would
      offend
      Muslim?
      What
      kind
      of
      logic
      is
      this
      from
      BBC?

      Haven't
      you
      heard
      of
      people
      admitting
      that
      they
      hate
      their
      recorded
      voice?
      It's
      not
      totally
      uncommon
      to
      see
      people
      hating
      their
      voice.
      If
      you're
      not
      a
      singer
      or
      in
      a

      voice
      quality
      is
      of

      you
      should
      be
      okay,
      how
      you
      sound
      doesn't
      really
      matter.
      Chin
      up,
      be
      confident
      and
      talk/express
      yourself
      wherever
      needed.
      Don't
      be
      hindered
      by
      the
      assumption
      that
      people
      might
      mock
      your
      voice
      or
      something.

      For

      sleeping
      is
      real

      on
      where
      you
      are

      All

      we

      is
      flourishing

      ours
      is
      in

      Bangladeshi
      textile

      have
      successfully
      found
      export
      destinations
      while
      we
      haven't.
      Service
      sector
      harbours
      only
      well
      educated
      citizens
      while
      manufacturing
      sector
      will
      employ
      way
      way
      more
      than
      the
      service
      sector.
      How
      the
      incumbent
      government
      hasn't
      taken
      any
      steps
      to
      address
      this
      issue
      is
      beyond
      my

      No,that

      an

      An

      probably
      isn't
      the
      one
      you'd
      wanna

      I

      which
      was
      totally

      Since
      that

      I
      started
      refraining

      from

      Well
      of

      me
      asking

      to
      pay
      more
      heed
      doesn't
      really

      I
      was
      saying,
      if
      we
      had
      paid
      more
      heed
      to
      the
      manufacturing
      sector
      instead
      of
      service
      sector
      we
      could
      have
      probably
      solved
      many
      current
      day
      problems

      we'd

      Exhibit
      A
      is

      Well
      okay,
      let
      me

      We

      to
      manufacturing
      sector
      along

      being

      Prior

      always
      "assumed"

      to

      not

      Try
      to
      get
      him
      involved
      in
      things
      you
      do,
      let
      him
      know
      that
      you're
      there
      for
      him.
      Do
      things
      together,
      like
      play
      a
      game
      with
      him
      or
      something
      but
      don't
      tell
      him(even
      if
      you're)
      that
      you're
      doing
      this
      because
      he
      is
      depressed.
      Also,if
      possible
      workout
      together,
      in
      a
      gym
      or
      at
      home.
      Working
      out
      is
      often
      a
      very
      good
      idea
      for
      people
      trying
      to
      cope
      with
      depression.
