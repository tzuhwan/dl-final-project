      When
      I
      was
      around
      14
      or
      15
      years
      old,
      my
      family
      had
      a
      trampoline
      in
      our
      backyard.
      I
      played
      on
      it
      almost
      daily,
      doing
      flips
      and
      such....you
      know,
      the
      things
      we
      are
      told
      NOT
      to
      do.
      Well
      anyway,
      one
      particular
      summer,
      I
      was
      doing
      partial
      back-flips.
      Ones
      where
      you
      land
      on
      your
      back
      and
      force
      yourself
      into
      a
      flip.
      I
      had
      been
      doing
      it
      a
      couple
      times
      with
      success
      and
      as
      such
      I
      was
      becoming
      increasingly
      stupid
      and
      adding
      greater
      amounts
      of
      force
      to
      the
      flips.
      One
      such
      flip,
      combined
      with
      the
      amount
      of
      air
      I
      had
      managed
      to
      get,
      had
      caused
      me
      to
      stall
      in
      a
      straight
      down,
      head
      first,
      position.
      In
      that
      split
      second
      before
      I
      hit
      the
      trampoline
      again,
      which
      would
      have
      surely
      broke
      my
      neck
      or
      worse,
      I
      threw
      my
      arms
      out
      to
      take
      the
      impact
      and
      I
      could
      hear
      my
      bones
      in
      my
      right
      arm
      snap,
      kinda
      like
      a
      soda
      can
      reforming
      in
      water.
      Of
      course,
      the
      shock
      was
      instantaneous
      and
      I
      felt
      not
      pain,
      just
      a
      dull
      throb,
      so
      I
      assumed
      my
      arm
      was
      fine.....until
      I
      stopped
      holding
      it
      and
      it
      went
      into
      a
      bow
      shape
      originating
      from
      the
      middle
      of
      the
      arm,
      that
      sent
      a
      horrid
      shot
      of
      pain
      up
      my
      arm
      as
      a
      result,
      at
      which
      point
      panic
      instantly
      struck
      and
      I
      began
      screaming
      for
      my
      parents.
      I
      sat
      there
      for
      quite
      a
      bit
      before
      my
      mother
      came
      onto
      the
      balcony
      and
      saw
      me,
      yelling
      for
      my
      stepfather
      to
      get
      me.
      When
      I
      actually
      got
      to
      the
      urgent
      care
      in
      town,
      I
      was
      told
      that,
      by
      holding
      my
      arm
      the
      way
      I
      had
      been
      on
      the
      way,
      I
      had
      snapped
      one
      of
      the
      bones
      back
      into
      place
      and
      saved
      the
      doctors
      having
      to
      do
      it
      themselves.
      I
      also
      should
      point
      out,
      as
      a
      humorous
      side-note,
      I
      needed
      to
      get
      a
      needle
      in
      the
      ass
      for
      painkillers
      and
      due
      to
      a
      fear
      of
      them,
      I
      was
      far
      more
      worried
      about
      the
      needle,
      than
      the
      fact
      I
      had
      snapped
      my
      arm.
      So
      in
      short,
      I
      had,
      in
      a
      quick
      act
      of
      self
      preservation,
      saved
      my
      neck
      and
      possibly
      my
      life
      by
      making
      my
      arm
      take
      one
      for
      the
      team.

      [Serious]
      Reddit,
      how
      do
      you
      deal
      with
      someone
      (be
      it
      friend,
      roommate,
      or
      SU),
      who
      refuses
      to
      admit
      they
      are
      wrong
      about
      something,
      even
      when
      presented
      with
      overwhelming
      evidence?

      To
      give
      an
      example,
      I
      have
      a
      friend
      that
      likes
      to
      say
      they
      "will
      never
      argue
      with
      you
      unless
      I
      know
      I
      am
      100%
      right
      about
      something."
      Of
      course
      this
      is
      not
      the
      case,
      and
      if
      you
      call
      them
      on
      it
      you
      are
      "causing
      a
      problem"
      or
      "getting
      emotional
      about
      it."

      Two
      Reasons:
      1.
      I
      am
      afraid
      of
      pain,
      and
      nothing
      I
      could
      think
      of,
      could
      be
      done
      without
      pain
      as
      a
      result.
      2.
      I
      couldn't
      bring
      myself
      to
      leave
      my
      family.
      The
      mental
      image
      of
      my
      mother,
      or
      worse,
      one
      of
      my
      little
      sisters
      finding
      me,
      was
      enough
      to
      keep
      me
      from
      doing
      it.
      Telling
      my
      mother
      this
      years
      later
      after
      a
      few
      drinks,
      we
      were
      both
      sobbing
      messes.
      I
      thank
      whatever
      power
      there
      is
      for
      giving
      me
      the
      mother
      and
      sisters
      I
      have,
      because
      if
      I
      didn't
      have
      them...I
      probably
      wouldn't
      still
      be
      here.

      don't
      want
      them.
      We
      already
      have
      enough
      stupid
      Canadians
      trying
      to
      make
      Canada
      like
      the
      US,
      let's
      not
      make
      them
      stronger.

      I
      can
      almost
      never
      come
      up
      with
      a
      good
      reason
      for
      being
      anxious.
      Bad
      anxiety
      will
      do
      that
      to
      ya.
      It
      could
      be
      anything
      from
      "Has
      my
      hair
      stayed
      exactly
      the
      way
      I
      styled
      it
      before
      leaving
      for
      work?"
      to
      literally
      just
      the
      thought
      of
      going
      out
      of
      my
      home
      to
      do
      laundry,
      but
      also
      feeling
      anxious
      about
      not
      getting
      it
      done
      and
      then
      feeling
      bad
      about
      it,
      which
      is
      a
      vicious,
      endless
      cycle.

      I

      as
      busy
      as

      I
      can
      tell
      you
      exactly
      why
      this
      is
      the
      case.....the
      reviews
      were
      bought
      for
      Call
      of
      Duty.
      It's
      common
      practice
      in
      the
      gaming
      industry
      to
      buy
      good
      reviews,
      especially
      if
      a
      review
      site
      wants
      to
      get
      the
      first
      "scoop"
      on
      a
      game.
      You
      can
      very
      easily
      tell
      when
      a
      review
      has
      been
      bought,
      such
      as
      a
      gap
      in
      critics
      v.s.
      user
      reviews.
      I'm
      sure
      this
      is
      known
      by
      a
      great
      number
      of
      people,
      however
      it
      should
      still
      be
      reiterated.
      The
      only
      one
      who
      can
      really
      decide
      if
      a
      game
      is
      good
      or
      not,
      is
      the
      individual
      player.
      Reviews
      CAN
      help,
      however
      they
      need
      to
      be
      looked
      at
      with
      suspicion.
      IGN
      is
      one
      such
      site
      that
      cannot
      be
      trusted
      when
      it
      comes
      to
      their
      reviews.

      Usually
      when
      I
      am
      feeling
      like
      crap,
      I
      want
      to
      make/build
      something.
      However
      that
      usually
      requires
      me
      to
      spend
      money
      I
      don't
      have,
      so
      I
      play
      a
      lot
      of
      crafting
      video
      games
      like
      Ark
      and
      Minecraft.
      Anything
      that
      requires
      my
      attention
      and
      gives
      me
      the
      ability
      to
      put
      my
      creative
      energies
      to
      work.
      If
      I
      find
      that
      isn't
      working,
      I
      will
      go
      "screw
      my
      room"
      and
      spend
      the
      whole
      day
      moving
      everything
      around.
      I
      spent
      an
      hour
      just
      shimmying
      my
      L-Desk
      from
      one
      side
      of
      my
      room
      to
      the
      other
      because
      I
      didn't
      want
      my
      roomie
      to
      help
      me
      move
      anything.
      Was
      a
      great
      workout,
      and
      it's
      a
      great
      feeling
      seeing,
      essentially,
      a
      whole
      new
      room.

      Good
      lord
      you
      are
      such
      a
      child.
      I'm
      not
      happy
      about
      the
      verdict
      either,
      nor
      do
      I
      sympathize
      with
      the
      man,
      however
      you
      should
      never
      tell
      someone
      to
      kill
      themselves
      or
      wish
      death
      on
      another
      person.
      Of
      course,
      being
      on
      the
      internet,
      you
      have
      not
      yet
      learned
      that
      your
      words
      can
      have
      consequences.....yet.
      This
      internet
      lynching
      mob
      is
      insane
      and
      only
      serves
      to
      enforce
      the
      stereotype
      that
      the
      internet
      only
      consists
      of
      people
      like
      you.
      Do
      us
      all
      a
      favor,
      and
      still
      your
      hand
      before
      typing
      something
      like
      that
      next
      time.

      Oh
      my,
      you

      one

      to

      aren't
      you?
      You
      must
      not
      have
      read
      my
      entire
      comment
      and
      immediately
      jumped
      to
      reply
      without
      doing
      so.
      I
      will
      make
      a
      TLDR
      for
      you.
      I
      don't
      agree
      with
      the
      sentence
      and
      agree
      he
      should
      have
      a
      harsher
      punishment,
      however
      he
      also
      should
      not
      be
      killed
      as
      that
      would
      not
      be
      a
      fair
      trial
      either.
      Let
      me
      know
      if
      I
      need
      to
      shorten
      it
      further.
      As
      for
      your
      comment
      to
      not
      talk
      to
      you
      about
      it,
      perhaps
      you
      should
      consider
      not
      posting
      on
      an
      open
      forum
      if
      you
      do
      not
      want
      someone
      to
      disagree/contradict
      your
      own
      statements.

      While
      I
      agree
      with
      some
      of
      the
      ideas
      behind
      these....having
      these
      put
      up
      on
      a
      wall
      is
      just.....just
      no.
      She's
      20
      years
      old,
      and
      while
      she
      doesn't
      need
      to
      be
      stuffy
      old
      granny,
      she
      should
      take
      some
      pride
      in
      her
      home
      and
      have
      enough
      class

      not
      hang
      this
      around
      where
      people
      see
      it.
      That's
      like
      leaving
      a
      sex
      toy
      on
      the
      living
      room
      coffee
      table.

      So
      does
      this
      mean
      I
      can
      excuse
      every
      white
      person
      who
      was
      shot
      by
      police,
      and
      were
      in
      the
      wrong
      too?
      Or
      do
      their
      lives
      not
      matter
      because
      of
      their
      skin
      color?
      I'd
      also
      like
      to
      talk
      about
      how
      much
      black-on-black
      violence/killings
      there
      are,
      but
      I
      guess
      that
      wouldn't
      further
      the
      narrative
      the
      BLM
      movement
      wants
      to
      push.

      Hey
      everyone!
      I
      apologize
      if
      this
      has
      already
      been
      asked,
      however
      after
      a
      search
      of
      the
      thread,
      I
      could
      not
      find
      anything
      specific
      to
      what
      I
      was
      looking
      for.
      I
      am
      looking
      for
      an
      emulator
      that
      will
      play
      PS1
      games
      that
      I
      have
      purchased
      from
      the
      PSN
      store,
      on
      my
      PC.
      Is
      there
      any
      such
      thing
      out
      there,
      and
      if
      so,
      which
      would
      be
      the
      best/safest
      to
      use?
      Thanks
      for
      any
      help
      that
      is
      given
      :)

      Hello
      Everyone!
      I
      just
      started
      doing
      Let's
      Plays
      after
      finally
      having
      the
      time
      and
      resources
      to
      do
      so.
      I
      thought
      that,
      aside
      form
      YouTube
      itself,
      Reddit
      would
      be
      the
      best
      place
      to
      "promote"
      myself,
      especially
      with
      how
      great
      the
      community
      here
      is.
      If
      you
      have
      any
      comments,
      suggestions,
      or
      questions,
      please
      don't
      hesitate
      to
      ask!

      it

      I
      got
      onto
      the
      wagon
      WAY
      late,
      however
      I
      decided
      to
      try
      American
      Horror
      Story:
      Hotel.
      Admittedly,
      it
      was
      because
      Lady
      Gaga
      was
      in
      it,
      however
      after
      the
      first
      episode,
      I
      was
      hooked.
      Sarah
      Paulson
      is
      an
      amazing
      actress
      and
      so
      far,
      My
      Roanoke
      Nightmare
      has
      been
      even
      better
      than
      Hotel.

      know
      from
      movie

      not

      it's
      originally

      It's
      called
      Osiris:
      New
      Dawn.
      It
      came
      out
      a
      few
      days
      ago
      on
      Steam
      Greenlight
      so
      it
      is
      very
      early
      stages.
      From
      the
      few
      hours
      I
      have
      spent
      playing
      the
      game
      (Which
      has
      given
      me
      all
      the
      current
      available
      content)
      The
      game
      is
      on
      the
      right
      track.
      Already
      I
      have
      had
      a
      much
      better
      time
      than
      another
      such
      space
      game
      that
      will
      not
      be
      named.
      I
      can
      see
      this
      game
      becoming
      what
      a
      lot
      of
      people
      had
      been
      hoping
      for.
      They
      have
      the
      ability
      to
      enter
      space,
      though
      only
      above
      the
      planet
      at
      the
      moment.
      For
      a
      game
      in
      it's
      early
      stages,
      you
      can
      already
      see
      the
      ground
      work
      that
      has
      been
      laid
      for
      future
      additions/updates.
      Now
      having
      said
      that,
      this
      game
      is
      certainly
      not
      for
      you
      if
      you
      are
      expecting
      a
      game
      that
      will
      entertain
      you
      for
      countless
      hours.
      There
      is
      a
      very
      definitive
      threshold
      for
      what
      you
      can
      do,
      and
      it
      IS
      in
      it's
      early
      stages,
      so
      bear
      that
      in
      mind.
      All
      in
      all,
      I
      would
      certainly
      recommend
      this
      game
      to
      people
      who
      are
      looking
      for
      a
      more....engaging
      space
      game,
      especially
      if
      the
      updates
      that
      are
      coming
      will
      be
      any
      indication.

      The
      graduating
      class
      before
      mine
      made
      their
      graduating
      "prank"
      be
      where
      they
      spray
      painted
      "Class

      on
      one
      of
      the

      outside
      the

      smashed

      the

      floor
      windows
      of

      it
      would
      be
      a
      great
      pairing.
      However
      that's
      just
      my
      opinion.
      It
      would
      be
      NICE
      to
      have
      a
      gay
      male
      pairing
      in
      Overwatch,
      but
      at
      the
      end
      of
      the
      day.....why
      does
      it
      REALLY
      matter?
      It
      wouldn't
      serve
      anything
      in
      the
      overall
      "story"
      so
      why
      do
      we
      even
      need
      to
      know
      any
      of
      the
      character's
      sexuality?

      And
      this
      is
      why
      religion
      has
      no
      place
      in
      school.
      If
      you
      want
      to
      be
      involved
      in
      it,
      it
      should
      be
      done
      outside
      of
      school.
      Otherwise,
      we
      can
      end
      up
      with
      places
      like
      this
      abomination.

      I
      personally
      have
      not
      had
      nearly
      as
      bad
      of
      a
      time
      as
      you,
      it
      would
      seem.
      However
      if
      I
      had
      to
      list
      my
      pet
      peeves,
      one
      of
      them
      would
      definitely
      be
      the
      "Choosing
      a
      character
      and
      refusing
      to
      change".
      Another
      would
      be
      when
      we
      have
      a
      Rein,
      who
      is
      shielding
      us
      but
      refuses
      to
      move
      in
      and
      push
      past
      the
      choke.
      I
      get
      sometimes
      it's
      not
      a
      good
      option,
      which
      I
      have
      no
      issue
      with.
      It's
      when
      there
      are
      only
      one
      or
      two
      people
      there
      and
      the
      person
      won't
      move
      in
      because,
      at
      least
      from
      my
      view,
      they
      don't
      wanna
      die.

      In

      my

      basically
      rented
      out
      an
      apartment
      for
      the
      students.
      Our

      faced

      across
      the
      street
      from

      One

      called
      us
      into
      the

      room(there
      were
      four

      points

      to
      an

      window

      a

      are
      in

      and
      doing
      it
      doggie
      style,
      completely

      would
      use
      me
      as
      the
      butt
      of
      his
      jokes
      during
      family
      gatherings.
      We
      don't
      speak
      much
      anymore
      because
      I
      have
      finally
      hit
      an
      age
      where
      I
      realized
      he
      was
      doing
      nothing
      to
      help
      my
      wellbeing.
      Their
      relationship
      was
      civil
      at
      best
      and
      hostile
      at
      worst,
      with
      my
      mother
      doing
      everything
      she
      could
      to
      let
      me
      see
      him(They
      divorced
      when
      I
      was
      7,
      am
      now
      25)
      while
      protecting
      me
      from
      the
      worst
      parts
      of
      him.(Which
      must
      have
      been
      hell
      for
      her).
      As
      I
      got
      older
      and
      started
      to
      see
      more
      of
      the
      negative
      side
      of
      things,
      my
      mother
      would
      let
      me
      do
      what
      I
      wanted
      in
      regards
      to
      seeing
      him,
      as
      I
      felt
      obligated
      to
      because
      he's
      my
      father.
      However
      my
      mother
      tends
      to
      also
      have....not
      the
      best
      taste
      in
      men.
      Because
      of
      this,
      it's
      made
      me
      feel
      pretty
      jaded
      in
      my
      view
      of
      relationships,
      not
      willing
      to
      let
      myself
      fall
      too
      deep
      for
      a
      person
      or
      even
      at
      all.
      I
      see
      no
      reason
      to
      get
      married
      to
      someone,
      as
      it
      has
      only
      ever
      caused
      grief
      in
      my
      family,
      and
      I
      refuse
      to
      let
      something
      like
      that
      impede
      me
      the
      way
      it
      did
      my
      mother.
      Being
      gay
      also
      doesn't
      help
      me....as
      I
      tend
      to
      be
      distrustful
      of
      men
      until
      I
      have
      known
      them
      far
      longer
      than
      most
      people.
      And
      even
      when
      I
      trust
      them...I
      find
      it
      hard
      to
      commit
      to
      a
      relationship
      with
      them.

      this
      is
      why
      the
      community
      needs
      to
      keep
      fighting
      this
      shit.
      EA
      has
      been
      and
      always
      will
      be,
      a
      trash
      company.
      They
      may
      have
      employees
      that
      care
      about
      the
      community,
      however
      the
      higher-ups
      do
      not.
      If
      they
      are
      given
      even
      a
      modicum
      of
      leeway
      after
      this,
      they
      will
      jump
      back
      to
      doing
      what
      they
      planned
      from
      the
      beginning.
      Keep
      fighting
      this,
      keep
      holding
      them
      accountable,
      do
      not
      buy
      their
      products!

      Hey
      Everyone!
      I
      am
      trying
      my
      damnedest
      to
      find
      out
      how
      to
      do
      the
      following:
      -
      Compare
      text
      in
      one
      Column
      in
      one
      sheet,
      to
      text
      a
      Column
      in
      another
      Sheet,
      on
      a
      cell
      by
      cell
      basis
      -
      Output
      the
      results
      and
      text
      of
      one
      sheet's
      column,
      into
      the
      empty
      column
      of
      another
      on
      a
      cell
      by
      cell
      basis
      Is
      this
      possible,
      and
      if
      so,
      how
      can
      I
      do
      it?
      I'm
      not
      the
      greatest
      at
      this
      stuff,
      and
      google
      searches
      have
      proven
      less
      than
      fruitful.

      For
      example:
      -
      In
      Sheet
      1,
      different
      kinds
      of
      produce
      are
      written
      individually
      in
      each
      cell
      of
      Column
      C
      -
      In
      Sheet
      2,
      the
      same
      is
      done
      for
      its
      own
      Column
      A,
      in
      a
      different
      order
      -
      Column
      D
      is
      empty
      in
      Sheet
      1
      -
      In
      Sheet
      2,
      "Fruit"
      or
      "Vegetable"
      is
      written
      beside
      its
      corresponding
      produce
      item
      in
      Column
      B
      -
      In
      Sheet
      1's
      Column
      D,
      whenever
      a
      produce
      item
      is
      added
      in
      column
      C,
      that
      matches
      an
      item
      in
      Sheet
      2's
      A
      Column,
      the
      equation
      will
      then
      put
      the
      same
      label
      beside
      said
      item
      in
      Sheet
      2's
      B
      Column,
      into
      the
      cell
      besides
      the
      item
      in
      C
       gt;
       gt;
      In
      Sheet
      1,
      I
      want
      to
      compare
      Column
      A,
      cell
      1-100
      to
      Sheet
      2
      Column
      A,
      cell
      1-100,
      cell
      by
      cell.
      So
      If
      I
      have
      "Apple"
      written
      in
      both
      Sheet
      1
      and
      Sheet
      2'
      A1
      Cells,
      and
      I
      have
      a
      second
      Column
      in
      Sheet
      2,
      with
      "Fruit"
      written
      in
      cell
      B1,
      it
      will
      then
      also
      put
      "Fruit"
      in
      Sheet
      1's
      B1
      Cell.
       gt;
       gt;
      In
      short.
      Have
      a
      bank
      of
      items
      in
      one
      sheet,
      write
      an
      item
      in
      another
      sheet,
      and
      acquire
      the
      label
      related
      to
      that
      item
      from
      the
      bank
      sheet,
      putting
      it
      in
      the
      column
      and
      cell
      beside
      the
      new
      item.
       gt;
       gt;
      I
      apologize
      if
      this
      is
      still
      hard
      to
      understand,
      however
      I
      also
      cannot
      figure
      out
      how
      to
      explain
      it
      any
      further
      and
      I
      unfortunately
      cannot
      provide
      my
      examples.

      Was
      bouncing
      on
      my
      family #8217;s
      trampoline
      in
      the
      backyard.
      I #8217;d
      recently
      learned
      how
      to
      do
      a
      half-backflip(basically
      you
      land
      on
      your
      back
      and
      then
      push
      yourself
      into
      a
      flip
      with
      your
      legs).
      Well
      I
      was
      doin
      just
      that,
      over
      and
      over,
      until
      I
      did
      something,
      I #8217;m
      not
      sure
      what,
      maybe
      too
      much
      force
      or
      something?
      But
      I
      caused
      myself
      to
      get
      a
      bunch
      of
      air,
      and,
      stall
      myself
      halfway
      through
      the
      flip.
      In
      that
      split
      second,
      I
      was
      upside-down,
      completely
      vertical
      with
      the
      trampoline
      and
      had
      to
      make
      a
      decision.
      Snap
      my
      neck
      on
      the
      way
      down,
      or
      throw
      my
      arms
      out
      and
      hope
      for
      the
      best.
      I
      chose
      the
      arms.
      Hearing
      a
      bone
      break
      is,
      and
      this
      is
      the
      most
      apt
      comparison
      I
      can
      think
      of,
      like
      hearing
      a
      pop
      can
      reform
      under
      water.
      When
      I
      landed
      I
      was
      immediately
      in
      shock
      and
      could
      not
      feel
      any
      pain
      in
      my
      arm,
      so
      I
      thought
      all
      was
      fine.
      Until
      I
      stopped
      holding
      it
      and
      it
      snapped
      into
      a
      shape
      like
      a
      bracket.
      (
       lt; #65533; #8212; #8212;That
      shape.
      Needless
      to
      say,
      once
      that
      happened,
      panic
      set
      in
      and
      I
      proceeded
      to
      scream
      like
      I
      was
      being
      murdered.
      My
      mother
      eventually
      realized
      it
      was
      the
      typical
       #8220;kids
      playing #8221;
      scream
      and
      sent
      my
      stepfather
      down
      to
      get
      me.
      The
      ride
      to
      urgent
      care
      consisted
      of
      me
      fruitlessly
      telling
      myself
      I
      had
      not
      just
      broken
      my
      arm.
      The
      funny
      part
      in
      all
      of
      this
      is,
      when
      it
      came
      time
      to
      put
      the
      cast
      on,
      I
      was
      more
      concerned
      about
      getting
      a
      shot
      of
      painkillers
      in
      my
      ass,
      than
      I
      was
      about
      my
      broken
      as
      fuck
      arm
      xD

      hold
      him
      as
      a

      so
      I
      wager
      that
      feelings
      are
      beyond
      his
      comprehension.
      Something
      totally
      unattainable...like
      his
      father #8217;s
      approval.

      OMG
      this.
      I
      was
      feeling
      this
      too.
      And
      honestly?
      Kennedy
      was
      giving
      me
      heavy
      back-up
      dancer
      vibes
      when
      she
      was
      dancing
      behind
      Trixie.
      Trixie
      was
      giving
      me
      the
      emotion
      behind
      the
      song.
      It's
      not
      a
      dancey
      stage
      number,
      it
      is
      an
      emotional
      song,
      which
      Trixie
      conveyed
      in
      spades.
      That
      being
      said,
      a
      huge
      congratulations
      to
      all
      the
      queens,
      and
      the
      top
      4.
      They
      gave,
      in
      my
      opinion,
      a
      heck
      of
      a
      season
      for
      me
      to
      enjoy.

      I
      think
      that
      Shangela
      player
      her
      "Game
      of
      Thrones"
      is
      what
      really
      came
      back
      to
      bite
      her.
      She
      was
      responsible
      for
      3
      queens
      being
      sent
      home,
      yes
      it's
      "what
      the
      gig
      is"
      but
      I'm
      sure
      they
      all
      noticed
      her
      shady
      moments
      as
      well,
      and
      did
      not
      do
      her
      any
      favors.
      That
      being
      said.
      Did
      she
      deserve
      to
      be
      in
      the
      top
      2?
      Damn
      right
      she
      did.
      I
      was
      all
      for
      Trixie
      winning,
      but
      even
      I
      could
      see
      what
      a
      crock
      it
      was
      that
      Shangie
      wasn't
      in
      the
      top.
      If
      anyone
      wants
      to
      be
      mad
      at
      someone
      for
      that
      not
      happening....it
      should
      be
      at
      the
      "Jury"
      Ru
      never
      picked
      the
      top
      2.

      I
      was
      so
      pleased
      for
      her,
      this
      week.
      She
      did
      the
      best
      she
      could
      in
      the
      challenge,
      and
      she
      killed
      that
      runway.
      Especially
      since
      she
      managed
      to
      not
      only
      put
      the
      eyebrows
      Michelle
      clocked
      her
      for
      last
      week,
      but
      also
      managed
      to
      put
      dots
      on
      every
      bit
      of
      her
      clothes
      and
      face.
      Such
      an
      awesome
      look.

      the

      keep

      done
      the
      same
      for
      mine.
      I #8217;d
      say
      take
      good
      care
      of
       #8216;em,
      but
      you
      seem

      be
      doing
      just
      fine

      Easier
      said
      than
      done.
      I
      worked
      at
      EA,
      for
      their
      contract
      company
      named
      VOLT
      or
      VMC
      Solutions,
      for
      three
      years.
      Had
      a
      good
      guy
      I
      was
      working
      with,
      try
      to
      organize
      people
      to
      unionize
      because
      of
      the
      horrible
      wages
      and
      overworking
      we
      experienced.
      Soon
      as
      HR
      caught
      wind,
      they
      fired
      him,
      and
      pulled
      everyone
      else
      in,
      to
      tell
      us
      we #8217;d
      lose
      our
      jobs
      too
      if
      anyone
      talks
      about
      wages
      or
      unions
      again.

      They
      really
      are
      one
      of
      THE
      worst
      companies
      I
      have
      had
      the
      displeasure
      of
      working
      for.
      The
      HR
      department
      is
      so
      transparent
      in
      how
       #8220;company
      first #8221;
      they
      are.
      That,
      and
      they
      will
      hire
      anyone
      and
      everyone
      off
      the
      street
      they
      can
      find,
      and
      are
      more
      inclined
      to
      keep
      friends
      of
      EA
      employees,
      rather
      than
      actually
      good
      workers.
      Working
      at
      EA
      is
      akin
      to
      playing
      the
      modern
      version
      of
      Game
      of
      Thrones.
      Kiss
      every
      ass
      you
      can,
      while
      scheming
      to
      take
      out
      the
      competition
      at
      the
      best
      opportunity.

      I #8217;ve
      always
      been
      fascinated
      by
      big
      guys
      with
      bigger
      bellies.
      I
      didn #8217;t
      understand
      it
      as
      a
      kid,
      of
      course,
      however
      looking
      back,
      I
      was
      also
      into
      the
      transformation
      aspects
      of
      a
      thin
      guy
      either
      getting
      really
      buff
      or
      really
      fat.
      I
      think
      for
      me,
      it
      was
      the
      thought
      of
      just
      giving
      in
      and
      getting
      big
      and
      fat.
      It #8217;s
      the
      taboo
      aspect
      as
      well,
      I
      think.
      I
      was
      rail
      thin,
      all
      my
      life,
      to
      the
      point
      that
      people
      asked
      if
      I
      was
      anorexic/bulimic.
      I
      hated
      it
      and
      was
      in
      a
      bad
      state
      mentally
      because
      of
      it.
      I
      had
      tried
      gaining
      in
      the
      past,
      however
      my
      ridiculous
      metabolism
      made
      any
      gains
      go
      away
      fast,
      which
      fed
      into
      my
      depression.
      Then,
      one
      day,
      I
      realized
      my
      jeans
      were
      tighter
      and
      I
      nearly
      screamed
      in
      joy.
      I
      had
      gained
      weight
      and
      was
      seeing
      a
      started
      belly!
      Since
      that
      time,
      I
      have
      gone
      from
      130
      to
      nearly
      180
      pounds.
      I
      feel
      big,
      confident,
      and
      sexy.
      And
      I
      have
      only
      excitement
      for
      the
      person
      I
      will
      be
      once
      I
      reach
      my
      goal
      of
      300
      pounds.

      What
      I
      find
      more
      disgusting
      than
      this....is
      the
      lack
      of
      action
      any
      country
      has
      taken
      to
      stand
      up
      and
      go
      "This
      is
      so
      wrong
      and
      we
      can't
      stand
      idly
      by
      and
      let
      it
      happen"
       #8203;
      What
      happened
      to
      our
      moral
      compasses,
      where
      we
      have
      reached
      the
      point
      of
      "It's
      not
      happening
      to
      me,
      so
      I
      don't
      care."?
      I'll
      tell
      you
      what
      happened.
      We
      have
      elected
      morally
      compromised
      men
      and
      women
      to
      lead
      our
      countries,
      simply
      because
      politics
      have
      been
      turned
      into
      a
      game
      of
      football
      with
      one
      side
      trying
      to
      win
      over
      the
      other.
      We
      now
      have
      the
      "Well
      as
      long
      as
      my
      side
      wins,
      that's
      all
      I
      care
      about"
      without
      considering
      the
      actual
      consequences
      of
      that
      happening.
      It's
      just
      "I
      wanna
      be
      the
      winner"
      now

      What
      a
      fucking
      idiot.
      I
      thought
      you
      had
      to
      have
      a
      brain
      to
      be
      in
      politics,
      but
      evidently
      all
      you
      need
      is
      the
      most
      powerful
      guy #8217;s
      dick
      in
      your
      mouth

      The
      key
      is
      to
      learn
      that
      happy
      balance
      so
      they
      can #8217;t

      Having

      younger
      sisters
      taught
      me
      this
      masterful

      I
      have
      the
      fondest
      memories
      of
      reading
      my
      sister
      to
      sleep.
      I
      had
      just
      left
      for
      College
      and
      Twilight
      was
      all
      the
      craze.
      I
      had
      read
      the
      book
      out
      of
      a
      "why
      is
      everyone
      so
      into
      this?"
      and
      so
      she
      wanted
      to
      read
      it
      too.
       #8203;
      So
      every
      time
      I
      came
      back
      to
      visit,
      usually
      every
      three
      months,
      for
      two
      weeks
      I
      would
      read
      her
      the
      books
      until
      she
      fell
      asleep.
      We
      got
      through
      the
      whole
      series.
      It
      is
      a
      memory
      that
      I
      will
      cherish
      for
      the
      rest
      of
      my
      life.
       #8203;
      On
      a
      funny
      note,
      I
      am
      the
      oldest
      brother
      in
      a
      family
      of
      younger
      sisters.
      When
      the
      oldest
      of
      them
      tried
      to
      read
      to
      her,
      she
      wouldn't
      let
      her
      because
      she
      "Couldn't
      do
      the
      right
      Bella
      voice"
      xD

      if
      a

      is
      good
      or
      not.
      Is
      Lion
      worth
      investing
      it?
      Or
      should
      I
      take
      the
      free
      Gems
      and
      run?

      Too
      bad
      most
      of
      the
      world
      depends
      on
      China
      for
      so
      much
      to
      actually
      want
      to
      do
      anything
      meaningful
      about
      the
      country.
      Let #8217;s
      all
      just
      admit
      that
      China
      is
      a
      hellhole
      and
      will
      continue
      to
      remain
      as
      such
      until
      we
      pull
      our
      heads
      out
      of
      the
      sand.
      Not
      buying
      China-made
      goods
      is
      so
      damned
      hard
      that
      it #8217;s
      a
      challenge
      for
      the
      normal
      citizen
      to
      do.
      The
      people
      who
      can
      and
      won #8217;t
      do
      anything,
      are
      the
      politicians
      elected.

      Oh
      god
      I
      cannot
      recommend
      how
      much
      more
      enjoyable
      a
      waterpik
      has
      made
      flossing
      for
      me.
      I
      hate
      the
      whole
      process
      of
      traditional
      flossing,
      I
      just
      cannot
      stand
      it
      for
      some
      reason.
      However
      I
      asked
      for
      a
      waterpik
      for
      Christmas
      one
      year
      and
      never
      looked
      back.
      I
      used
      to
      be
      terrible
      at
      mouth
      hygiene,
      but
      an
      electric
      brush
      and
      waterflosser
      has
      made
      me
      manage
      to
      at
      least
      brush
      and
      floss
      every
      night
      before
      bed

      Look
      up
      the
      Waterpik
      WP-660
      Aquarius
      Professional
      Water
      Flosser
      on
      Amazon.
      It's
      $99.99,
      comes
      with
      10
      pressure
      settings,
      and
      a
      bunch
      of
      different
      flossing
      heads.
      I
      will
      say
      it
      is
      a
      bit
      loud,
      so
      I
      don't
      recommend
      trying
      to
      use
      it
      in
      the
      dead
      of
      night
      if
      someone
      is
      in
      the
      vicinity
      of
      your
      bathroom.
      But
      it
      really
      is
      worth
      it

      by
      no
      means
      living
      the
      good
      life.
      I #8217;m
      barely
      over
      the
      poverty
      line
      and
      each
      month
      is
      a
      game
      of
       #8220;can
      I
      afford
      a
      full
      dinner
      this
      week? #8221;
      40
      k
      in
      Vancouver
      does
      not
      buy
      much
      and
      I
      have
      student
      loans
      to
      pay
      off,
      so
      I
      imagine
      I
      am
      plenty
      motivated.
      Excuse
      me
      for
      wanting
      to
      at
      least
      be
      able
      to
      enjoy
      my
      job
      and
      have
      a
      life
      outside
      it.
      Just
      because
      people
      don #8217;t
      work
      retail,
      does
      by
      no
      means
      mean
      they
      are
      making
      $75k.
      Maybe
      take
      a
      hard
      look
      at
      yourself
      before
      you
      accuse
      people
      of
      lacking
      in
      something.
      This
      was
      a
      civil
      discussion,
      but
      you
      decided
      to
      start
      trashing
      people.
      Call
      me
      defensive
      or
      whatever,
      but
      that
      stuff
      does
      not
      fly
      with
      me.

      I
      definitely
      agree
      that
      the
      overworking
      and
      underpayment
      of
      retail
      employees
      is
      awful,
      especially
      since
      we
      would
      not
      get
      a
      majority
      of
      the
      things
      we
      need
      without
      them.
      Sure
      we
      could
      go
      to
      an
      unmanned
      store...but
      that
      has
      obvious
      problems.
      I
      guess
      my
      whole
      thing,
      is
      I
      just
      want
      people
      to
      be
      treated
      like
      people
      who
      need
      to
      live
      as
      well.

      I
      still
      don't
      understand
      the
      critiques
      she
      got.
      Especially
      the
      "no
      family
      resemblance".
      Out
      of
      all
      of
      them,
      I
      thought
      her
      and
      her
      husband
      looked
      the
      most
      similar.
      This
      isn't
      me
      hating
      on
      Monet,
      because
      she
      is
      fierce,
      however
      her
      and
      her
      judy
      were
      so
      vastly
      different
      looking
      that
      I
      felt
      it
      was
      a
      shoe-in
      for
      bottom
      2.
       #8203;
      However,
      based
      on
      what
      Manila
      has
      said
      since,
      she
      was
      gonna
      be
      in
      the
      bottom
      because
      of
      their
      dance
      number
      anyway.
      Just
      wish
      that
      the
      producers
      could
      do
      a
      better
      job
      and
      show
      us
      what
      we
      really
      need
      to
      see.
      The
      attempt
      at
      a
      storyline
      this
      season
      was
      hard
      to
      sit
      through....especially
      the
      "Shade
      Rattles"
      when
      there
      was
      no
      shade....even
      from
      a
      look.
       #8203;
      Overall
      I
      am
      happy
      for
      Monet
      and
      Trinity,
      however
      this
      season
      was
      a
      complete
      mess
      and
      a
      really
      telling
      sign
      that
      All
      Stars
      should
      not
      be
      more
      than
      once
      every
      3-4
      years
      for
      queens
      to
      improve
      and
      grow.

      Looking
      at
      the
      thread
      here,
      I
      just
      wanted
      to
      chime
      in
      and
      say
      that
      you
      are
      absolutely
      handsome
      and
      have
      nothing
      to
      feel
      ashamed
      of!
      Hard
      to
      feel
      that
      way,
      I
      know.
      I #8217;ve
      been
      on
      the
      opposite
      end
      of
      the
      spectrum,
      but
      still
      felt
      not
      the
      greatest
      about
      myself.
      Sometimes,
      you
      just
      need
      someone
      to
      be
      genuine
      and
      reassure
      you
      that
      the
      devil
      on
      your
      shoulder
      is
      lying.
      And,
      at
      least
      in
      my
      view,
      your
      devil
      is
      dead
      wrong
      :)
      If
      you
      ever
      need
      to
      chat,
      slip
      a
      DM
      at
      me!

      As
      soon
      as
      Ru
      mentioned
      spinoff,
      I
      was

      I
      was
      being
      held
      hostage
      like

      What
      a
      fucking
      piece
      of
      scum.
      Glad
      he
      is
      alive
      though,
      so
      he
      can
      be
      subjected
      to
      every
      bit
      of
      misery
      he
      deserves.

      Wow....woooow.
      it's
      one
      of
      those
      things
      where
      it's
      great
      he
      was
      caught
      so
      he
      can
      be
      brought
      to
      justice.
      But
      at
      the
      same
      time,
      there
      is
      that
      deep
      desire
      to
      just
      subject
      him
      to
      the
      worst
      kind
      of
      torture
      humanly
      possible,
      because
      we
      all
      know
      he
      is
      gonna
      get
      off
      on
      the
      media
      frenzy.

      Congrats!
      Glad
      you
      are
      enjoying
      the
      game
      still.
      Doesn #8217;t
      make
      what
      I
      have
      said,
      any
      less
      valid.
      It #8217;s
      not
      a
      matter
      of
      entitlement.
      It #8217;s
      a
      matter
      of
      seeing
      this
      pattern
      many
      times
      before
      and
      knowing
      the
      direction
      things
      will
      go.
      It #8217;s
      still
      EA,
      and
      they
      can
      say
      EA
      is
      hands
      off
      all
      they
      want,
      however
      that
      is
      proven
      many
      times
      in

      That #8217;s
      a
      fair
      point,
      however
      I
      would
      say
      the
      reason
      EA
      was
      not
      as
      involved
      in
      Apex
      as
      Anthem,
      is
      because
      they
      clearly
      expected
      Anthem
      to
      be
      a
      bigger
      profit
      than
      Apex.
      Now
      that
      they
      know
      that
      isn #8217;t
      the
      case,
      they
      are
      inevitably
      going
      to
      exert
      more
      control
      on
      Apex
      to
      fit
      their
      bottom
      line,
      until
      it
      isn #8217;t
      making
      their
      investors
      happy
      and
      they
      cancel
      it.
      This
      isn #8217;t
      new
      behaviour
      for
      EA,
      and
      honestly,
      the
      company
      needs
      some
      serious
      consequences
      from
      the
      gaming
      community.
      It #8217;s
      a
      cancer
      on
      the
      industry
      that
      cannibalizes
      once-great
      companies
      and
      IPs.
      I
      know
      you
      aren #8217;t
      trying
      to
      put
      me
      on
      blast,
      however
      I
      am
      on
      the
      other
      side
      of
      frustration
      and
      am
      more
      frustrated
      that
      people
      are
      still
      falling
      for
      the
      same
      tactics
      again
      and
      again.
      We #8217;ve
      seen
      how
      the
      community
      can
      affect
      these
      companies.
      As
      a
      community,
      EA
      needs

      Awesome
      progress!
      I
      hit
      my
      highest
      of
      180
      in
      the
      last
      month,
      after
      starting
      at
      135
      a
      little
      over
      2
      years
      ago.
      It #8217;s
      been
      the
      best
      decision
      I
      have
      made!
      Good
      luck
      with
      your
      future
      gains!

      This

      way
      too
      real.
      Being

      myself,
      this
      is
      a

      issue
      that
      not
      many

      talk

      EA

      Wtf
      was
      this
      episode?
      That
      bottom
      two
      was
      a
      load
      of
      horse
      shit.
      Nina
      should
      not
      have
      been
      bottom
      three
      and
      Silky
      was
      the
      hottest
      mess
      during
      the
      lipsync
      that
      she
      should
      have
      been
      a
      shoe-in
      for
      elimination.
      Everytime
      she
      opens
      her
      mouth,
      I
      feel
      like
      Detox

      Girl,
      I
      agree
      this
      was
      bull,
      but
      saying
      Nina
      and
      Sugah
      have
      no
      charisma?
      I
      don #8217;t
      agree.
      Brooke
      is
      slaying
      the
      fashion
      challenges,
      however
      she
      isn #8217;t
      the
      most
      outwardly
      charismatic
      one
      and
      she
      is
      still
      there.
      Silky
      and
      Vanjie
      I
      agree
      with
      though.
      They
      may
      have
      charisma,
      but
      it #8217;s
      so
      one
      note
      that
      it
      has
      gotten
      to
      be
      grating.

      Soju
      was
      a
      breath
      of
      fresh
      air
      this
      episode.
      She
      was
      so
      innocent
      and
      I
      felt
      so
      bad
      for
      her.
      Like...should
      she
      maybe
      learn
      to
      use
      heels
      a
      bit?
      Maybe.
      But
      the
      time
      that
      was
      spent
      on
      it
      like
      she
      had
      murdered
      Ru
      and
      pissed
      on
      Lady
      Bunny #8217;s
      grave?
      Was
      not
      needed.

      Long
      short
      of
      it
      is:
      He #8217;s
      a

      that
      gives
      Drag
      Race
      fans
      a
      really
      bad
      name.
      He
      likes
      to
      manufacture
      drama
      and
      if
      a
      Queen
      even
      so
      much
      as
      looks
      at
      him,
      he
      sensationalizes
      it.
      Think
      Perez
      Hilton,
      but
      with
      less
      journalistic
      talent.

      Just
      Dany
      now
      xD
      After
      all
      the
      death
      of
      innocents
      she
      saw,
      she
      is
      what
      amounts
      to
      Sansa #8217;s
      raven.
      If
      Arya
      makes
      it
      out
      of
      this
      alive,
      Sansa
      will
      know
      exactly
      what
      happened.
      And
      because
      of
      the
      mother/daughter
      she
      watched
      burn,
      she
      has
      more
      than
      enough
      reason
      to
      kill
      Dany.
      However
      I
      worry
      that,
      if
      she
      doesn #8217;t
      kill
      Grey
      Worm
      first,
      he
      will
      kill
      her
      before
      she
      has
      a
      chance
      to
      attack
      Dany.
      I
      also
      worry
      about
      Dany
      using
      the
      same
      torture
      her
      father
      used
      on
      Ned #8217;s
      father
      and
      brother
      during
      the
      rebellion,
      on
      Arya
      and
      Jon.

      I
      think
      the
      issue
      is
      that
      most
      people
      have
      that
       #8220;Ends
      justify
      the
      means #8221;
      mentality.
      My
      thoughts
      on
      it
      is
      this.
      If
      you
      have
      no
      problem
      with
      her
      taking
      an
      entire
      city #8217;s
      rich,
      and
      subjecting
      them
      to
      immeasurable
      tortures
      simply
      based
      on
      their
      social
      status,
      you
      don #8217;t
      get
      to
      go
       #8220;We
      like
      this,
      but
      not
      when
      done
      to
      X #8221;
      The
      nailing
      of
      slavers
      to
      poles
      were
      the
      biggest
      red
      flag.
      And
      not
      every
      person
      she
      did
      it
      to,
      deserved
      it.
      Dany
      has
      always,
      and
      still
      does,
      believed
      that
      her
      actions
      are
      justified,
      simply
      because
      she
      wants
      to
       #8220;free
      people
      from
      tyrants #8221;
      which
      is
      a
      very
      subjective
      label
      and
      differs
      from
      person
      to
      person.
      If
      she
      wants
      to
      be
      loved
      as
      a
      just
      ruler,
      she
      needed
      to
      be
      willing
      to
      bend
      a
      bit
      in
      her
      ideals.
      She
      has
      a
      dangerously
      black
      and
      white
      view
      of
      things,
      which
      has
      resulted
      in
      what
      can
      only
      be
      called
      a
      genocide
      or
      holocaust
      that
      makes
      Cersei
      look
      like
      a
      war
      hero.

      Honestly,
      Tati
      is
      just
      as
      disgusting
      as
      JC,
      but
      in
      a
      different
      way.
      She
      was
      okay
      with
      excusing,
      by
      her
      own
      admission
      in
      her
      own
      video
      I
      might
      add,
      his
      behaviour.
      She
      would
      have
      continued
      to
      do
      so,
      if
      he
      had
      promoted
      her
      brand
      instead
      of
      her
      competitor
      and
      to
      say
      otherwise
      is
      just
      bogus.
      And
      as
      a
      gay
      man,
      he
      is
      everything
      that
      is
      wrong
      with
      the
      gay
      community.
      Now
      what
      I
      mean
      by
      that,
      is
      he
      embodies
      every
      negative
      stereotype
      and
      view
      others
      have
      of
      us.
      And
      he
      was
      allowed
      to
      do
      this!
      As
      a
      woman
      in
      her
      late
      30 #8217;s,
      Tati
      should
      have
      known
      better
      and
      if
      she
      truly
      cared,
      she
      would
      have
      called
      this
      out
      much
      sooner!
      But
      then
      she
      wouldn #8217;t
      have
      gotten
      to
      ride
      his
      coattails
      to
      the
      top.
      And
      now
      she
      gets
      to
      play
      the
       #8220;victim #8221;
      in
      all
      of
      this
      and
      like
      she
      is
      being
      the
      good
      guy,
      when
      she
      knowingly
      posted
      this
      video
      to
      sabotage
      his
      career,
      because
      he
      didn #8217;t
      promote
      her
      brand.
      Both
      of
      them
      are
      gross
      people
      and
      their
      true
      colors
      have
      been
      laid
      on
      display
      because
      of
      this.
      All
      because
      of
      a
      bottle
      of
      vitamins....

      I
      did
      watch
      her
      video.
      And
      rather
      than
      take
      further
      steps
      to
      deal
      with
      the
      situation,
      she
      decided
      to
      drop
      a
      video
      dragging
      him.
      I #8217;m
      by
      no
      means
      saying
      he
      is
      the
      victim
      here,
      that #8217;s
      not
      my
      intent.
      What
      I
      AM
      saying
      is
      that
      if
      the
      claims
      she
      is
      making
      are
      true,
      she
      should
      have
      escalated
      this
      to
      the
      authorities
      (sexual
      harassment),
      and
      distanced
      herself
      from
      it.
      Unless
      asked
      about
      it.
      There
      is
      a
      way
      to
      deal
      with
      it
      in
      a
      private
      way
      that
      doesn #8217;t
      involve
      blasting
      it
      all
      on
      social
      media!
      Now
      that
      said,
      JC
      is
      an
      adult,
      albeit
      a
      young
      one,
      and
      he
      as
      a
      person
      should
      know
      better!
      If
      he
      is
      as
      bad
      as
      what
      I
      am
      hearing,
      he
      would
      not
      be
      in
      a
      very
      good
      spot
      to
      avoid
      charges
      for
      his
      actions,
      and
      he
      would
      absolutely
      have
      the
      facts
      come
      out
      because
      of
      it.

      more
      equipped

      I
      think
       #8220;Prophecies #8221;
      are
      meant
      to
      not
      foreshadow
      the
      endings,
      but
      show
      that
      if
      people
      believe
      something
      will
      happen,
      they
      inadvertently
      make
      it
      come
      to
      pass.
      Using
      the
      show
      for
      a
      moment:
      Cersei
      was
      given
      a
      prophecy
      her
      kids
      would
      all
      die
      before
      her
      and
      she
      would
      die
      at
      the
      hands
      of
      her
      brother.
      Her
      kids
      all
      died
      because
      of
      her
      own
      actions
      and
      she
      did
      technically
      die
      because
      of
      her
      brother.
      In
      her
      desire
      to
      prevent
      a
      prophecy
      given
      to
      her
      as
      a
      child,
      she
      unintentionally
      made
      it
      come
      true.
      A
      Self-Fulfilling
      Prophecy,
      if
      you
      will.

      a

      very

      much

      in

      already.
      They
      literally

      complete
      redo

      Jesus
      the

      of
      entitlement
      boggles
      my

      So
      let
      me
      get
      this
      straight.
      A
      known
      rare
      resource
      is
      not
      a
      common
      resource
      and
      therefore
      that #8217;s
      why
      everyone
      is
      whining?
      I #8217;ve
      been
      playing
      MAYBE
      2
      months
      and
      just
      finished
      Second
      Dream.
      I
      checked
      the
      items
      it
      needs
      and
      this
      is
      for
      mostly
      Prime
      parts
      and
      top
      tier
      weapons.
      So...I
      have
      no
      sympathy
      for
      you
      guys.
      Manage
      your
      inventory
      more
      effectively
      perhaps

      I
      can
      understand
      why
      people
      were
      offended
      by
      Sansa #8217;s

      I
      think
      people
      are
      acting
      as
      if
      Sansa
      speaks
      for
      everyone,
      instead
      of
      just
      herself.
      People
      who
      are
      upset
      with
      it,
      causes
      it
      to
      come
      across
      as
       #8220;No
      you #8217;re
      wrong,
      you #8217;re
      supposed
      to
      be
      weak
      because
      of
      it. #8221;
      Whether
      intentional
      or
      not.
      And
      their
      arguments
      hold
      even
      less
      weight,
      since
      they
      can #8217;t
      say
      the
      line
      of
       #8220;young
      girls
      watch
      this #8221;...which

      I
      held
      out
      hope
      that
      the
      person
      getting
      said
      resume
      was
      being
      judgemental.....then
      I
      read
      where
      the
      applicant
      is
      licensed
      to
      work.
       #8203;
      I
      do
      wanna
      know
      the
      story
      that
      lead
      to
      said
      person
      being
      uncompromising
      in
      their
      disdain
      for
      Mayonnaise
      though.

      Welp,
      that #8217;s
      a
      nice
      $80
      saved.
      Quite
      rare

      a

      is
      the

      was

      Welp,
      I
      appreciate
      how
      upfront
      Gamefreak
      is
      about
      their
      laziness,
      even
      if
      they
      don #8217;t
      explicitly
      state
      it
      as
      such.
      You
      are
      a
      multimillion
      dollar
      company,
      but
      3D
      models
      are
      too
      much
      for
      you?
      This
      is
      just
      a
       #8220;test
      the
      waters #8221;
      move,
      to
      see
      how
      much
      they
      can
      get
      away
      with
      not
      doing
      until
      the
      community
      freaks
      and
      it
      affects
      their
      sales.
      Then
      if
      it
      does,
      they
      can
      complain
      that
      they
      still
      did
      too
      much,
      so
      fans
      feel
      like
      they
      need
      to
      accept
      what
      they
      are
      given

      Yep!
      Not
      paying
      for
      a
      pisspoor
      product
      that
      was
      rushed
      out
      to
      make
      a
      holiday
      release.
      They

      kiss
      my
      purchases
      of
      any
      Nintendo

      goodbye.

      I
      want
      to
      start
      this
      post
      off
      with
      a
      sidenote.
      If
      you
      are
      okay
      with
      the
      decision
      to
      cut
      all
      the
      old
      Pok #233;mon,
      that's
      fine.
      I
      really
      do
      hope
      that
      the
      game
      does
      whatever
      it
      wants
      for
      you
      and
      you
      find
      hours
      of
      enjoyment
      in
      it.
      Having
      said
      that,
      this
      post
      likely
      isn't
      for
      you.
       #8203;
      To
      everyone
      who
      has
      been
      angered
      or
      saddened
      by
      this
      news,
      I
      ask
      this.
      Please
      do
      NOT
      buy
      the
      game.
      I
      know
      it's
      hard
      not
      to
      buy
      it
      because,
      hey,
      it's
      Pok #233;mon.
      I
      have
      been
      a
      fan
      since
      '96
      when
      it
      first
      came
      to
      the
      West.
      I
      have
      spent
      countless
      hours
      playing
      with
      my
      friends
      and
      family
      and
      cultivating
      my
      faves.
      With
      that
      said,
      if
      you
      have
      any
      desire
      to
      see
      this
      decision
      reversed
      and
      rectified,
      PLEASE
      boycott
      the
      game.
      I
      understand
      if
      this
      comes
      across
      as...blunt.
      However,
      the
      reality
      is
      this.
      If
      you
      have
      issues
      with
      the
      terrible
      choices
      made
      with
      this
      Gen,
      but
      buy
      the
      game
      anyway,
      you
      are
      telling
      the
      company
      that
      they
      can
      continue
      this
      practice,
      because
      all
      they
      see
      in
      the
      end
      is
      your
      money
      in
      their
      pocket.
      Again,
      if
      we
      want
      to
      see
      ALL
      our
      Pok #233;mon
      make
      the
      leap
      into
      the
      next
      Gen,
      we
      need
      to
      make
      a
      statement
      and
      hit
      the
      companies
      in
      the
      only
      place
      they
      feel
      pain.
      Their
      wallets.
      I'd
      love
      to
      send
      this
      statement
      to
      the
      Japanese
      fans
      as
      well;
      but
      sadly,
      I
      have
      NO
      knowledge
      of
      Japanese
      and
      thus
      feel
      my
      message
      would
      be
      lost.
      If
      someone
      does
      happen
      to
      know
      how
      to
      translate,
      maybe
      take
      this
      and
      post
      it
      where
      those
      fans
      will
      see
      it
      too.
      **TLDR:**
      Don't
      buy
      the
      new
      game
      if
      you
      hate
      what
      Gamefreak
      is
      doing
      with
      it.

      **Edit:**
      Since

      have

      legitimately

      It
      really
      is!
      And
      I
      know
      how
      hard
      it
      can
      be
      for
      some
      people,
      because
      it
      doesn't
      feel
      like
      they
      can
      do
      anything
      about
      it.
      But
      we
      really
      *can*
      do
      something
      about
      it.
      We
      all
      just
      need
      to
      come
      together
      as
      a
      community
      and
      give
      them
      a
      resounding
      NO
      when
      it
      comes
      to
      their
      decision.
      That
      also
      comes
      to
      good
      decisions
      and
      direction
      as
      well!
      If
      we
      like
      something
      they
      do,
      we
      also
      need
      to
      make
      sure
      they
      know
      we
      enjoy
      whatever
      that
      is.

      I
      mean,
      yes
      that
      is
      a
      very

      And
      if
      that
      is
      the
      stance
      they
      take,
      we
      have
      to
      be
      prepared
      for
      that

      Yet,
      at

      we
      cannot
      allow

      either.

      Dude,

      completely
      unaware

      they
      made

      because
      they
      knew

      would
      be
      an
      issue
      if
      they
      didn #8217;t?
      Are

      fact
      that
      this

      out,
      yet
      they
      insist
      on

      anyway?
      I #8217;m
      not

      you #8217;re
      not
      allowed
      to
      enjoy
      the
      game,
      I

      you
      do,

      please
      don #8217;t
      come

      Nintendo
      honestly
      seems
      like
      they
      should
      be
      the
      ones
      taking
      over
      the
      development
      of
      Pokemon.
      At
      this
      point,
      I
      don #8217;t
      see
      how
      the
      games
      could
      get
      much
      worse,
      and
      maybe
      they
      would
      be
      more
      willing
      to
      take
      some
      creative
      chances,
      rather
      than
      take
      more
      features
      out
      like
      Gamefreak
      has

      Oh

      I

      the

      If
      they
      hadn't
      been
      able
      to
      bring
      it
      to
      the
      3DS
      before
      all
      of
      this,
      I
      would
      be
      more
      inclined
      to
      agree
      with
      you.
      However
      they
      *have*
      done
      it
      for
      the
      3DS.
      You
      can't
      seriously
      be
      trying
      to
      say
      that
      a
      multi-billion
      dollar
      company
      can
      manage
      to
      put
      every
      pokemon
      into
      a
      3DS
      cartridge,
      but
      can't
      somehow
      manage
      to
      put
      them
      onto
      a
      Switch,
      can
      you?
      And
      the
      people
      "Mad"
      about
      the
      game,
      are
      mad
      because
      Gamefreak
      has
      no
      leg
      to
      stand
      on
      with
      the
      flimsy
      excuses
      they
      have
      given.
      As
      I
      have
      said,
      and
      will
      say
      again,
      I
      hope
      you
      enjoy
      the
      game
      when
      it

      As
      a
      matter
      of
      fact,
      that
      is
      *exactly*
      what
      I
      am
      saying.
      Gamefreak
      has
      had
      a
      history
      of
      making
      poor
      decisions
      with
      the
      games
      in
      the
      past,
      and
      they
      are
      very
      well
      known
      for
      cutting
      corners.
      Regardless
      or
      not,
      the
      point
      of
      this
      thread
      was
      to
      say
      if
      people
      don't
      like
      the
      game's
      direction,
      do
      not
      buy
      it.
      I
      fail
      to
      see
      how
      this
      is
      a
      novel
      idea
      or
      how
      people
      choosing
      to
      do
      so
      are
      somehow
      in
      the
      wrong.
      Defend
      Gamefreak
      all
      you
      want,
      the
      decision
      is
      a
      terrible
      one
      and
      you
      are
      actually
      in
      the
      minority
      here.
      As
      for
      if
      I
      think
      Gamefreak
      is
      stupid,
      I
      do.
      Feel

      up
      to

      but
      I
      am
      not
      writing
      a
      novel
      about
      it

      So
      because
      we
      dislike
      a
      decision
      for
      a
      game
      we
      are
      expected
      to
      pay
      60+
      dollars
      for,
      we
      are
      being
      unreasonable,
      when
      we
      have
      ample
      proof
      from
      past
      games
      that
      they
      *can*
      and
      *have*
      put
      every
      pokemon
      into
      a
      game?
      I
      think
      saying
      otherwise
      is
      extremely
      ignorant.

      As

      They

      I #8217;m
      also
      not
      saying
      you
      cant
      like
      the
      game...but
      that
      is
      not
      the
      best
      example
      to
      use
      in
      this
      case
      because
      you
      will
      not
      find
      many
      sympathizers.
      As
      for
      the
       #8220;Toxic
      Fandom #8221;
      I
      wasn #8217;t

      being
      upset
      and
      passionate
      about
      something
      when
      it
      is
      clearly
      warranted,
      is

      Dude,
      you're
      using
      an
      awful
      example.
      That
      game
      is
      the
      whole
      reason
      Loot
      Boxes
      are
      being
      outlawed.
      You
      don't
      get
      to
      sit
      there
      and
      take
      credit
      for
      changing
      something,
      when
      the
      intention
      and
      hope
      was
      that
      players
      wouldn't
      be
      as
      pissed
      about
      it
      as
      they
      ended
      up
      being.
      That's
      like
      calling
      an
      arsonist
      a
      hero,
      when
      he
      doesn't
      light
      a
      building
      on
      fire
      because
      there
      are
      witnesses.
       #8203;
      I
      don't
      have
      to
      be
      mad,
      because
      he
      is.
      I
      already
      hate
      EA
      because
      they
      are
      cancer
      on
      the
      gaming
      industry.
      Just
      like
      I
      think
      the
      decision
      with
      the
      National
      Dex
      is
      asinine
      and
      lazy.
      He
      also
      didn't
      go
      into
      a
      hate
      fueled
      rant
      in
      his
      vid,
      so
      your
      point
      there
      is
      moot
      as
      well.
       #8203;
      And
      really?
      Battlefront
      2
      is
      "never
      more
      popular"?
      I
      can't
      find
      any
      indication
      of
      player
      numbers
      for
      the
      game,
      so
      I'm
      curious
      how
      you
      came
      to
      that
      conclusion.

      It

      die
      down,
      and
      it
      is
      absolutely
      not
      difficult
      for
      them
      to
      port
      them
      all
      over.
      How
      many
      times
      must
      this
      be
      said?
      They
      future
      proofed

      by
      getting
      all
      the
      pokemon
      3D
      models
      done
      gens
      ago!
      They
      literally
      have
      no
      excuse,
      aside
      from
      trying

      make
      as
      little
      effort
      for
      as
      much
      gain
      as
      they
      can.
      What
      they
      don #8217;t
      seem
      to
      get,
      especially
      Masuda,
      is
      they
      kicked
      the
      wrong
      hornet #8217;s
      nest!
      This

      is
      and
      will
      be
      the
      worst
      entry

      because
      we
      have
      now
      lost
      a
      basic
      and
      fundamental
      part
      of
      the
      series #8217;

      I
      absolutely
      agree
      that
      threatening
      the
      man
      is
      absolutely
      reprehensible.
      What
      I
      DON #8217;T
      agree
      with,
      is
      that
      it #8217;s
      all
      Gamefreak #8217;s
      doing.
      No
      one
      forced
      him
      to
      write
      the
      response
      that
      he
      did.
      It
      may
      have
      been
      doctored,
      yes,
      but
      the
      words
      came
      from
      him
      and
      him
      alone.
      He
      deserves
      as
      much
      of
      the
      anger
      as
      Gamefreak
      does.
      But
      PLEASE
      stop
      sending
      threats
      and
      other
      similar
      types
      of
      messages.
      Your
      anger
      is
      with
      his
      choices
      related
      to
      the
      game,
      not
      his
      life
      outside
      of
      it!

      They
      have
      every
      realm
      of
      possibility.
      They
      just
      refuse
      to
      do
      anything
      because
      they
      want
      to
      dip
      their
      toes
      in
      the
      EA-style
      sludge
      and
      see
      how
      much
      money
      they
      can
      make
      with
      as
      little
      effort
      as
      possible.
      Honestly?
      I
      would
      prefer
      a
      third
      release
      of
      Sun
      and
      Moon
      over
      this
      crapshoot
      of
      a
       #8220;Pokemon
      Game #8221;
      But
      then,
      they #8217;d
      probably
      just
      try
      changing
      the
      tile
      but
      repackaging
      unsold
      US/UM
      cartridges.
      So
      to
      answer
      your
      question.
      Give
      me
      all
      my
      Pokemon
      and
      they
      can
      have
      my
      money.
      Otherwise,
      I #8217;ll
      go
      support
      Digimon,
      since
      they

      And

      I
      can
      understand
      your
      reasoning
      behind
      it,
      and
      it
      does
      make
      sense.
      However
      speaking
      on
      how
      I
      would
      rather
      see
      them
      do
      it,
      is
      instead
      of
      the
      response
      we
      got,
      simply
      say
       #8220;We
      heard
      you
      and
      while
      we
      cannot
      make
      any
      guarantees
      or
      promises,
      we
      are
      looking
      into
      potential
      changes
      we
      can
      make #8221;
      That
      way,
      it #8217;s
      not
      them
      committing
      to
      anything
      concrete,
      while
      also
      not
      sounding
      tone-deaf
      and
      repeating
      everything
      we
      already
      know.

      And
      now
      Masuda
      has
      basically
      confirming
      he
      doesn #8217;t
      care
      about
      Pokemon
      and
      wants

      shut
      up
      and
      take
      what
      they
      give
      us.
      The
      only
      thing
      I #8217;m
      giving
      them
      is
      my

      I
      think
      the
      practice
      itself
      is
      not
      inherently
      toxic.
      What
      IS
      toxic,
      is
      making
      someone
      feel
      they
      MUST
      not
      buy
      it

      it.
      I #8217;ve

      posting

      issue
      with
      the

      doesn #8217;t
      bother

      while
      I
      may
      not
      understand
      why
      someone

      You
      imply
      they
      were
      making
      any
      progressive
      steps.
      In
      my
      mind,
      they
      are
      someone
      tripping
      with
      a
      box
      of
      puzzle
      pieces.
      Most
      end
      up
      in
      a
      trashy
      pile
      of
      nonsense.
      But
      every

      in
      a
      while,
      two
      pieces

      Dumb
      luck

      not

      make.

      That #8217;s

      flimsy

      reasons,
      is
      a

      trying

      get
      away
      with
      the
      least
      effort.
      This
      is
      them
      testing
      the
      waters,
      except
      they
      decided

      Dude...you
      miss
      the
      point.
      As
      I
      said,
      this
      is
      a
      cornerstone
      of
      the
      series
      they
      are
      removing
      due
      to
      nothing
      but
      laziness.
      It
      would
      be
      a
      nitpick,
      if
      they
      removed
      one
      pokeball
      and
      people
      complained.
      Because
      while
      pokeball
      is
      gone,
      you
      still
      can
      catch
      Pokemon
      with
      others.
      They
      removed
      an
      entire
      feature
      that
      was
      the
      basis
      of
      a
      lot
      of
      fan #8217;s
      enjoyment.
      I
      say
      with
      with
      no
      intention
      of
      insult,
      however
      I
      believe
      your
      definition
      of
      nitpick
      is
      being
      skewed
      by
      the
      fact
      the
      dex
      removal
      does
      not
      matter
      to
      you
      as
      much.
      At
      least
      based
      on
      the
      one
      conversation
      you
      have
      posted

      we
      PLEASE
      get
      a
      post
      that
      compiles
      EVERYTHING
      and
      stick
      it
      to
      the
      front
      of
      this
      subreddit?
      I'll
      do
      it
      myself
      if
      I
      have
      to.
      I
      do
      not
      want
      Gamefreak
      thinking
      that
      by
      releasing
      these
      statements,
      that
      it
      will
      cause
      us
      to
      quiet
      down.
      And
      Nintendo,
      if
      they
      actually
      are
      listening,
      needs
      to
      come
      in
      a
      force
      Gamefreak
      to
      fix
      all
      the
      shit
      they
      are
      doing,
      because
      until
      they
      do,
      I
      don't
      think
      Gamefreak
      or
      Masuda
      will
      listen
      to
      us.
      Masuda
      obviously
      doesn't
      care
      about
      the
      fans
      or
      the
      series
      in
      general.
      And
      don't
      comment
      on
      this
      saying
      it
      wasn't
      his
      choice.
      He
      quite
      literally
      said
      it
      was
      a
      "hard
      choice
      for
      me
      to
      make".
      So
      he
      DID
      call
      for
      the
      cut
      and
      is
      trying
      to
      get
      away
      with
      it.
      I
      say,
      if
      anything,
      people
      should
      rom
      hack
      the
      game
      and
      post
      it
      online
      for
      people
      to
      torrent.
      Normally
      I
      don't
      condone
      the
      action,
      however
      in
      this
      case,
      they
      deserve
      to
      lose
      every
      dollar
      they
      could
      have
      earned
      by
      making
      a
      real
      attempt
      at
      a
      good
      game.

      Trump
      has
      done
      one
      good
      thing
      since
      taking
      the
      Presidency.
      He #8217;s
      shown
      us
      how
      little
      power
      it
      actually
      has
      and
      as
      a
      result,
      exposed
      the
      real
      holders
      of
      power.
      If
      the
      President
      actually
      had
      power,
      you
      can
      bet
      that
      every
      other
      politician
      would
      do
      what
      they
      could
      to
      get
      rid
      of
      him.

      And
      yet
      there
      are
      fans
      going
      around
      defending
      his
      lousy
      excuses.
      Honestly?
      I #8217;ve
      moved
      from
      wanting
      to
      save
      the
      game,
      to
      wanting
      to
      watch
      Gamefreak
      crash
      and
      burn.
      At
      least
      then,
      Nintendo
      could
      swoop
      in
      and
      pull
      a
      Breath
      of
      the
      Wild
      with
      it.
      Masuda
      may
      have
      cared
      at
      one
      point
      in
      time,
      however
      it
      is
      obvious
      that
      is
      no
      longer
      the
      case
      and
      as
      a
      result,
      he
      should
      be
      relieved
      of
      his

      And
      as
      opposed
      to
      what,

      Asking
      nicely?
      That #8217;s
      already
      been
      tried.
      Eventually
      niceties
      need

      thrown
      at
      the

      and
      people

      kicking
      and
      screaming.
      Amazing
      how
      when
      someone
      tries
      being
      nice
      the

      few
      times
      no

      the

      they
      finally
      snap

      yell,
      people
      get
      all
      defensive
      and
      play
      the
      victim.
      Masuda
      forfeited
      that
      right,
      the
      second
      he
      posted
      that
      insulting
       #8220;update #8221;
      to
      the
      community
      and
      now
      he
      gets
      to
      see
      the
      result.

      it
      was

      guys,
      we
      heard
      you

      we
      don #8217;t
      care #8221;
      I
      could
      honestly
      forgive
      the
      decision(and
      it
      absolutely
      was
      a
      decision)
      to
      not
      include
      the
      transfer,

      announcing
      it,
      to
      lie
      about
      the
      reasons.
      At
      this
      point,
      the
      game
      is
      shit,
      it
      looks
      like
      shit,
      it
      costs
      60$
      for
      less
      content,
      and
      if
      you
      want
      examples
      of
      this,
      feel
      free

      read
      the
      multitude
      of
      people
      and
      watch
      the
      many
      videos
      explaining
      why
      Masuda
      is
      full
      of
      shit.
      They
      are
      so
      blatantly
      focused
      on
      Town
      and
      have
      admitted
      that
      Pokemon
      is
      only
      secondary
      in
      focus
      for
      them.
      Ya
      know,
      the
      thing
      that
      made
      it
      so
      they
      even
      have
      jobs
      to
      begin
      with.
      They
      can
      take
      their
      new
      IP
      and
      shove
      it.
      If
      they
      have
      no
      interest
      in
      making
      Pokemon,
      then
      they
      get
      the
      same
      disinterest
      in
      whatever
      swill
      they
      spit
      out.

      Thank
      You!
      I #8217;ve
      been
      trying
      to
      get
      this
      through
      to
      people
      for
      weeks
      now.
      Is
      it
      a
      Nintendo
      issue?
      Perhaps,
      however
      history
      shows
      that
      to
      not
      be
      the
      case
      so
      far.
      As
      it
      stands,
      this
      whole
      shit-show
      is
      squarely
      on
      Gamefreak,
      and
      by
      extension
      Masuda #8217;s,
      shoulders.

      is
      mostly
      raging
      "7

      so
      it

      their
      unbridled

      Was
      coming
      here
      just
      to
      say
      this.
      Since
      moving
      here,
      I
      have
      had
      to
      live
      with,
      at
      minimum,
      two
      other
      roommates
      to
      even
      be
      able
      to
      afford
      rent
      in
      this
      city.
      I
      don't
      even
      live
      downtown,
      I
      live
      a
      1
      hour
      train
      ride
      from
      where
      I
      work.
      Everyone
      I
      know
      is
      living
      with
      two
      roomies
      minimum,
      to
      be
      able
      to
      afford
      housing.
      And
      it's
      not
      people
      who
      are
      making
      money
      flipping
      burgers.
      These
      are
      people
      who
      making
      40+k
      a
      year
      in
      a
      full-time
      job.
      I'm
      not
      surprised
      people
      want
      nothing
      to
      do
      with
      China
      or
      their
      people
      who
      never
      set
      foot
      in
      this
      country,
      but
      own
      three
      houses
      that
      sit
      empty.
      The
      empty-housing
      tax
      was
      the
      first
      step.
      At
      this
      point,
      if
      you
      do
      not
      live
      here,
      it
      needs
      to
      be
      illegal
      to
      own
      more
      than
      one
      house/apartment.
      We
      aren't
      asking
      for
      free
      housing.
      We
      are
      asking
      for

      that

      guy's
      basement
      suite
      with
      3
      other
      people
      sharing
      two
      bedrooms
      (Have
      lived
      in
      an
      apartment

      you

      I

      have
      a
      problem
      with
      people
      owning
      property.
      But
      when
      little
      Jimmy
      comes
      over
      from
      wherever
      to
      go
      to
      school
      and
      his
      parents
      buy
      him
      a
      penthouse
      suite?
      Nah,
      fuck
      that.
      He
      can
      live
      in
      student
      housing
      with
      the
      rest
      of
      us.

      I
      hesitate
      to
      say
      it #8217;s
      due
      to
      an
      inability
      to
      actually
      see
      the
      impact
      a
      few
      players
      not
      buying
      something
      has,
      however
      I
      want
      to
      give
      people
      the
      benefit
      of
      the
      doubt
      here.
      Seeing
      people
      say
       #8220;There
      isn #8217;t
      much
      we
      can
      do #8221;
      is
      nothing
      short
      of
      a
      cop-out.
      We
      CAN
      do
      something.
      That
      much
      should
      be
      evident
      by
      the
      lootbox
      legislation
      and
      what
      even
      led
      to
      it
      in
      the
      first
      place.
      So
      not
      buying
      a
      game
      should
      be
      even
      easier.
      Hell,
      I
      convinced
      three
      friends
      not
      to
      buy
      a
      switch,
      because
      Pokemon
      was
      the
      sell
      point
      for
      them.
      As
      a
      result,
      they
      have
      told
      their
      friends,
      who
      outright
      cancelled
      pre-orders
      (which
      is
      another
      subject
      in
      itself)
      or
      decided
      to
      also
      forego
      the
      Switch.
      It
      may
      not
      seem
      like
      one
      person
      saving
      their
      money
      has
      an
      impact,
      however
      in
      this
      day
      and
      age,
      more
      then
      ever
      really,
      word
      of
      mouth
      has
      an
      even
      greater
      effect
      on
      sales.
      So
      we
      all
      DO
      need
      to
      vote
      with
      our
      wallets.
      Don #8217;t
      buy
      the
      game,
      especially
      if
      you
      say
      you
      won #8217;t
      or
      are
      upset
      with
      the
       #8220;decisions #8221;
      Gamefreak
      has
      made.
      Saying
      you
      won #8217;t
      and
      buying
      anyway,
      gives
      you
      even
      less
      right
      to
      complain
      than
      someone
      who
      wasn #8217;t
      aware
      of
      the
      changes
      and
      bought
      the
      game
      and
      was
      dissatisfied
      with
      the
      result.

      You
      assume
      a
      parent
      has
      complete
      control
      over
      everything
      their
      child
      does.
      I
      want
      to
      propose
      this
      idea
      to
      you.
      Sometimes,
      the
      child
      is
      just
      a
      shit
      person
      and
      rather
      than
      be
      a
      bad
      parent
      and
      defend
      their
      child #8217;s
      actions
      to
      the
      death,
      they

      said
      child
      is
      a
      little
      shit
      and
      apologize
      on
      their
      behalf.
      Imo,
      it
      takes
      a
      hell
      of
      a
      lot
      more
      maturity
      and
      presence
      of
      mind
      to
      admit
      when
      your
      kid
      is
      an
      asshole
      and
      try
      to
      apologize
      for
      it.

      Masuda
      is
      so
      full
      of
      shit,
      I #8217;m
      shocked
      her
      doesn #8217;t
      spit
      a
      giant
      turd
      out
      every
      time
      he
      opens
      his
      mouth.
      He
      no
      longer
      cares
      about
      Pokemon.
      If
      he
      did,
      he
      would
      have
      known
      that
      this
      would
      be
      a
      big
      problem
      and
      how
      betrayed
      fans
      would
      feel.
      But
      rather
      than
      fess
      up,
      he
      hopes
      people
      will
      just
      take
      the
      same
      swill
      and
      thank
      him
      for
      it
      because
      he #8217;s
       #8220;such
      a
      big
      pokemon
      fan #8221;
      He
      deserves
      nothing
      short
      of
      being
      fired
      and
      Pokemon
      should
      be
      stripped
      from
      Gamefreak
      and
      given
      to
      Nintendo
      completely.
      Then
      lets
      see
      how
      their
       #8220;Town #8221;
      takes
      precedence
      over
      their
      now
      bastardized

      They
      could
      have
      very
      easily
      prevented
      this
      in

      and
      during
      production
      before
      being
      revealed.
      Instead,
      Gamefreak
      and
      Masuda
      showed
      their
      true

      now
      expect
      us
      to
      be
      nice
      about
      it?
      Nah.
      Close
      Gamefreak
      and
      let
      Nintendo
      take
      Pokemon
      from
      them.

      no
      they
      aren #8217;t.
      The

      has
       #8220;gone
      gold #8221;
      which
      means

      and
      are

      the

      This
      is
      the

      Stop

      in

      accept
      the
      fact
      Gamefreak

      It #8217;s
      not
      a

      A

      upon
      the
      previous
      titles

      Nope.

      Good.
      Maybe
      he
      should
      lose
      everything,
      so
      he
      has
      to
      experience
      what
      the
      protesters
      have.
      He
      can
      cry
      me
      a

      while
      wiping
      with

      Not
      my
      kid,
      however
      I
      feel
      the
      need
      to
      mention
      said
      disappointment.
      I #8217;ve
      been
      friends
      with
      the
      disappointment #8217;s
      sister
      for
      10+
      years
      now.
      He
      is
      the
      youngest
      of
      the
      two
      and
      he
      has
      NO
      ambition,
      drive,
      or
      motivation.
      This
      is
      facilitated
      by
      his
      parents.
      My
      friend
      has
      always
      been
      dealt
      the
      brunt
      of
      her
      parent #8217;s
      unfair
       #8220;parenting
      skills #8221;,
      even
      as
      a
      child.
      I
      won #8217;t
      give
      specifics,
      but
      let #8217;s
      just
      say
      if
      the
      guy
      didn #8217;t
      want
      to
      do
      X,
      the
      parents
      would
      make
      my
      friend
      do
      it
      too,
      to
      shut
      him
      up
      and
      get
      him
      to
      do
      it(this
      includes
      taking
      medication).
      He
      progressively
      got
      worse
      as
      time
      went
      on
      and
      by
      the
      time
      he
      graduated
      highschool
      (a
      year
      after
      my
      friend
      and
      I),
      he
      had
      no
      plans
      or
      intention
      to
      get
      a
      job
      or
      go
      to
      college.
      He #8217;s
      a
      very
      self-important
      recluse
      who
      games
      all
      day
      and
      is
      every
      bit
      the
      stereotypical
      rage-gamer.
      If
      his
      parents
      wanted
      him
      to
      do
      something,
      all
      he #8217;d
      have
      to
      do
      is
      go
       #8220;Well
      X
      didn #8217;t
      do
      this
      so
      why
      am
      I
      doing
      it? #8221;
      To
      which
      then
      leads
      to
      my
      friend
      being
      punished
      instead
      and
      expected
      to
      do
      whatever
      the
      brother
      was
      originally
      asked
      to.
      The
      parents
      are
      hilariously
      pathetic
      in
      their
      handling
      of
      things.
      If
      the
      brother
      wouldn #8217;t
      get
      off
      the
      internet,
      they #8217;d
      shut
      the
      whole
      system
      down,
      which
      also
      prevented
      my
      friend
      from
      doing
      her
      school
      work,
      as
      it
      was
      online,
      and
      the
      brother
      had
      an
      ethernet
      cable
      build
      into
      his
      bedroom
      wall,
      so
      they #8217;d
      have
      to
      tear
      the
      house
      apart
      to
      take
      it.
      And
      even
      if
      they
      blocked
      him,
      he #8217;d
      take
      the
      router
      and
      hide
      it
      till
      they
      gave
      him
      the
      password.
      Now
      you
      may
      be
      wondering
       #8220;Why
      not
      just
      kick
      him
      out? #8221;.
      Well
      I #8217;ve
      often
      wondered
      and
      asked
      the
      same
      thing,
      and
      the
      parents
      just
      don #8217;t
      care
      enough.
      They #8217;d
      rather
      he
      be
      quiet
      and
      at
      home,
      than
      dealing
      with
      him
      in
      any
      capacity
      that
      requires
      effort.
      He
      is
      26
      years
      old
      and
      quit
      his
      first
      and
      only
      job
      on
      Day1,
      because
      he
       #8220;Didn #8217;t
      want
      to
      get
      up
      in
      the
      morning #8221;
      to
      do
      it.
      So
      since
      his
      parents
      won #8217;t
      say
      it,
      I #8217;ll
      say
      it
      for
      them.
      He #8217;s
      a
      failure
      and
      disappointment.

      on

      same
      animations
      from
      years
      ago
      The
      game
      looks
      like
      a
      high
      quality
      N64
      game
      They
      continually
      cut
      features
      with
      each
      subsequent
      title.
      If
      people
      want
      to
      get
      the
      game
      we
      should
      be

      are,
      no

      should
      buy

      I #8217;m

      this

      the

      make
      me
      lose
      all

      and
      see
      just
      how
      creatively
      bankrupt
      Gamefreak
      is
      and
      as
      a
      result,
      how
      lazy
      they
      are.

      The
      balancing
      issue
      is
      a
      straight
      up
      lie,
      since
      that
      hasn #8217;t
      been
      an
      issue
      in
      the
      past
      and
      their
       #8220;reason #8221;
      was
      apparently
      because
      the
      models
      that
      they,
      and
      I
      cannot
      stress
      this
      enough,
      paid
      a
      company
      to
      make
      to
      future
      proof
      them,
      supposedly
      had
      the
      rigging
      break
      when
      they
      brought
      them
      to
      the
      Switch.
      This
      is
      an
      excuse
      coming
      from
      the
      company
      that
      no
      less
      than
      a
      few
      months
      ago
      released
      a
      perfectly
      functioning
      red
      and
      blue
      remake
      AND
      had
      been
      teasing
      Sword
      and
      Shield
      even
      after
      Sun
      and
      Moon
      came
      out.
      Gamefreak
      has
      ABSOLUTELY
      no
      excuse
      for
      having
      a
       #8220;small
      dev
      team #8221;.
      They
      are
      not
      an
      indie
      company.
      They
      are
      the
      owners
      of
      the
      most
      financially
      successful
      franchises
      in
      the
      world
      and
      to
      say
      otherwise
      is
      ridiculous.
      They
      CAN
      make
      high
      quality
      animations,
      but
      they
      continually
      refuse
      to.
      I
      don #8217;t
      care
      about
      red
      blue
      and
      green,
      that
      is
      not
      the
      basis
      we
      are
      using
      for
      comparison
      here.
      As
      I
      stated,
      the
      graphics
      are
      on
      par
      with
      N64
      in
      a
      ton
      of
      places,
      not
      least
      of
      which
      the
      open
      areas.
      Cutting
      features
      is
      asinine
      on
      their
      part,
      because
      it
      becomes
      painfully
      apparent
      they
      are
      not
       #8220;features #8221;
      but
      are
      instead
      gimmicks
      that
      have
      no
      real
      impact
      on
      the
      game
      going
      forward.
      Gigantimax
      is
      perhaps
      one
      of
      the
      most
      pitiful
      gimmicks
      I
      have
      seen
      they
      make.
      They
      removed
      the
      Mega
      Evolution
      and
      Z-Moves
      for
      a
      mode
      that
      amounts
      to
      them
      increasing
      the
      scale
      if
      a
      model
      from
      1
      to
      2
      (I
      know
      this,
      because
      I
      work
      with
      artists
      and
      modellers
      daily)
      And
      I
      will
      not
       #8220;Chill #8221;
      when
      a
      company
      is
      flat
      out
      lying
      through
      their
      teeth
      and
      expecting
      me
      to
      buy
      into
      their
      BS
      anyway.

      Apologies
      to
      insert
      this
      here,
      however
      I
      feel
      since
      I
      was
      mentioned
      this
      is
      the
      best
      continuation
      point.
      If
      my
      tone
      is
      coming
      across
      wrong,
      it #8217;s
      because
      I
      was
      indeed
      in
      the
      heat
      of
      my
      frustration
      and
      it
      unfortunately
      came
      across
      in
      my
      response.
      I
      don #8217;t
      apologize
      for
      what
      I
      said,
      however
      I
      do
      apologize
      for
      HOW
      it
      was
      said.
      Part
      of
      said
      frustration
      is
      based
      in
      how
      excited
      I
      was
      for
      Sword
      and
      Shield
      and
      just
      how
      fast
      that
      excitement
      was
      doused
      in
      literally
      the
      span
      of
      30
      minutes
      as
      I
      saw
      the
      trailer
      for
      the
      features
      reveal,
      had
      30
      minutes
      of
      excitement,
      and
      then
      had
      the
      dex-cut
      revealed.
      So
      again,
      I
      in
      no
      way
      intended
      to
      come
      across
      attacking
      the
      OP
      of
      this
      thread,
      however
      I
      am
      sorry
      that
      it
      is
      what
      ultimately
      was
      communicated

      Seriously,
      the
      whole
      of
      Brazil
      (and
      the
      world)
      needs
      to
      get
      up,
      walk
      out
      of
      their
      houses,
      and
      swarm
      these
      rich
      assholes
      homes
      and
      drag
      them
      into
      the
      fires
      they
      set.
      Each
      and
      every
      one
      of
      them.
      Lets
      see
      how
      long
      they
      can
      breathe
      with
      smoke
      filling
      their
      lungs.
      The
      time
      for
      niceties
      has
      long
      passed.

      I'm
      considering
      purchasing
      the
      aforementioned
      earphones,
      as
      I
      have
      the
      OG
      earbuds
      they
      made
      a
      few
      years
      back.
      However
      I
      am
      wanting
      to
      know
      what
      people
      who
      bought
      them
      think.
      Finding
      reviews
      has
      been
      next
      to
      impossible,
      as
      the
      BEO
      H4
      are
      the
      ones
      that
      come
      up
      in
      search
      and
      they
      are
      not
      the
      same.
      If
      anyone
      needs
      to
      me
      clarify,
      I
      will
      DM
      a
      link
      to
      the
      headphones
      I
      am
      considering.

      I
      loved
      Morgan's
      promo
      look
      and
      was
      so
      excited
      to
      see
      her
      bring
      it
      in
      AS3.
      Was
      so
      sad
      to
      see
      her
      gone
      so
      soon.
      At
      least
      we
      got
      that
      amazing
      runway
      on
      her
      return
      for
      one
      episode.
      I
      think
      my
      issue
      with
      the
      promo
      look,
      is
      the
      hairpiece
      on
      the
      side
      of
      the
      wig
      really
      doesn't
      blend
      very
      well
      with
      the
      rest.
      When
      Jasmine
      said
      she
      would
      wing
      it
      for
      the
      talent
      show....I
      had
      that
      "DOOM"
      sound
      bite
      play
      and
      knew
      she
      was
      done.

      It #8217;s

      Have
      you
      tried
      updating
      your
      motherboard?
      Or
      computer
      in
      general?
      If
      you
      are
      on
      wifi
      for
      the
      PC,
      consider
      updating
      the
      card.
      If
      you
      are
      on
      ethernet,
      check
      if
      the
      cable
      is
      5e
      or
      higher.
      If
      not,
      definitely
      get
      one.
      I
      use
      cat6
      and
      have
      no
      issues.
      If
      you
      internet
      is
      still
      bad,
      I #8217;d
      suggest
      calling
      your
      ISP
      and
      reading
      them
      the
      riot
      act
      (after
      checking
      and
      diagnosing
      if
      the
      upload
      or
      download
      speed
      is
      a
      problem,
      of
      course)
      They
      could
      be
      throttling
      you
      during
      high
      internet
      traffic
      times(which
      they
      should
      not
      be
      allowed
      to
      do).
      Another
      potential
      cause
      is,
      if
      you
      router
      uses
      wifi
      as
      well,
      people
      could
      have
      gotten
      into
      it
      and
      are
      draining
      the
      available
      data
      (happened
      to
      me)
      so
      call
      the
      ISP
      to
      fix
      it
      if
      you
      arent
      sure
      how.
      Finally,
      make
      sure
      your
      router
      isn #8217;t
      from
      the
      stone
      age.
      If
      it #8217;s
      relatively
      old,
      you
      should
      look
      at
      getting
      a
      new
      one.
      Hope
      that
      helps
      :)

      had
      a
      personal
      rule:
      If
      I
      spend
      X
      amount
      of
      time
      on
      a
      game
      and
      love
      it,
      I
      buy
      the
      next
      thing
      that
      grips
      my
      interest.
      I
      want
      to
      reward
      a
      studio
      when
      they
      make
      content
      and
      games
      I
      get
      hours
      of
      enjoyment
      out
      of.

      Damn,
      OP.
      Now
      I
      have
      to
      have
      this
      as
      my
      phone
      background.
      Love
      the
      colour
      choices,
      especially
      how
      they
      appear
      on
      the
      top
      of
      the
      head.
      I #8217;m
      really
      glad
      I
      got
      this
      bundle
      because
      it
      is
      top
      notch!

      Yeah
      it #8217;s
      really
      just
      a

      You

      these

      manchildren
      will
      be
      there
      in

      I
      won #8217;t
      make
      any
      claim
      to
      have
      not
      been
      spoiled
      as
      a
      kid.
      I
      absolutely
      was.
      However
      I
      take
      some
      small
      sense
      of
      pride
      in
      the
      fact
      I
      still
      know
      that
      this
      behaviour...I
      could
      never
      think
      to
      react
      like
      this.
      I
      think
      it #8217;s
      both
      a
      combination
      of
      bad/insufficient
      parenting,
      a
      life
      of
      being
      able
      to
      scream
      and
      have
      people
      cave
      to
      what
      he
      wants
      (I
      know
      a
      few
      people
      like
      this),
      and
      the
      person
      just
      being
      an
      all-around
      tool
      themselves.
      Still
      though,
      the
      thought
      of
      going
      onto
      an
      open
      forum
      and
      calling
      someone
      out
      because
      they
      need
      money
      for
      their
      time
      and
      work?
      I
      cringe
      at
      the
      thought.

      Went
      and
      did
      an
      even
      greater
      job
      than
      I
      could
      have
      with
      compiling
      everything.
      My
      stance
      on
      the
      game
      is
      still
      to
      boycott
      it
      and
      that
      everyone
      who
      has
      issues
      with
      it
      should
      do
      the
      same.
      I #8217;m
      sad
      that
      a
      franchise
      that
      has
      been
      part
      of
      almost
      my
      entire
      life
      is
      being
      done
      in
      such
      a
      piss-poor
      fashion,
      with
      little
      to
      no
      regard
      shown
      to
      the
      fans.
      It
      feels
      like
      such
      a
      slap
      in
      the
      face
      and
      I #8217;m
      going
      to
      miss
      it.
      On
      a
      more
      personal
      note,
      Little
      Town
      Heroes
      was
      supremely
      underwhelming
      and
      really
      makes
      me
      miffed
      at
      the
      time
      wasted
      on
      such
      a
      boring
      looking
      game...

      This
      was

      the

      Look

      gimmicks
      that
      will
      be
      removed
      next
      game.
      They
      should
      have
      cut
      this
      to
      bring
      the
      Pokemon
      over,
      because
      it #8217;s
      what
      players
      would
      have
      cared
      more
      about.
      Hard
      to
      get
      excited
      for
      a
      poorly
      done
      gimmick
      when
      it
      overtook
      such
      a
      core
      feature
      of
      the
      series.

      It #8217;s

      Honestly,
      this
      sounds
      like
      a
      shitty
      way
      to
      test
      out
      their
      cooking
      mechanic
      before
      it
      gets
      implemented
      into
      Little
      Town
      Heroes.
      But
      sure,
      we
      totally
      needed
      this
      crap
      instead
      of
      the
      National
      Dex

      If
      they
      don #8217;t
      want
      to
      do
      it
      anymore,
      maybe
      they
      should
      hand
      it
      to
      someone
      who
      does.
      But
      I #8217;m
      getting
      ahead
      of
      myself.
      They
      know
      no
      one
      would
      be
      interested
      in
      their

      Maybe
      because
      instead
      of
      cutting
      a
      gimmicky
      feature
      that
      won #8217;t
      be
      in
      the
      next
      game,
      to
      gain
      time
      and
      resources
      for
      a
      core
      feature
      of
      the
      series,
      they
      decided
      to
      continue
      with
      their
      half-baked
      ideas
      and
      piss
      more
      fans
      off.
      This
      cooking
      mechanic
      looks
      like
      a
      half-baked
      dry
      run
      before
      they
      try
      to
      put
      it
      in
      Little
      Town
      Heroes.

      But
      guys,
      they
      had
      to
      cut
      content!
      It
      takes
      so
      much
      work
      to
      copy
      and
      paste!
      And
      they
      were
      working
      so
      hard
      on
      the
      gimmicks
      for
      this
      gen,
      so
      they
      can
      have
      more
      content
      to
      cut
      next
      gen.
      Seriously,
      at
      this
      point,
      no
      one
      should
      be
      buying
      these
      games...

      Probably

      I

      hold
      out
      some
      hope

      you
      think
      I
      need
      to
      be

      No
      worries
      there,
      friend!
      I
      won #8217;t
      be
      buying
      the
      game
      at
      all.
      My
      lest
      shining
      hope
      is
      that
      if/when
      they
      do
      the
      potential
      re-release
      they
      typically
      do
      in
      each
      gen,
      it
      has
      the
      National
      Dex
      as
      the
      big
      selling
      point.
      MAYBE
      then,
      I
      will
      consider
      picking
      it
      up,
      if
      only
      to
      vote
      with
      my
      wallet,
      that
      the
      Dex
      is
      whats
      important
      to
      me.
      Oh
      lordy
      I
      wish
      I
      could
      say
      I
      doubt
      that.
      However
      based
      on
      what
      they
      have
      been
      doing
      lately?
      I #8217;d
      say
      it
      is
      a
      very
      real
      possibility
      :(
      Makes
      me
      glad
      I
      got
      every
      one
      of
      my
      Pokemon
      transferred
      over
      to
      Sun
      and
      Moon
      when
      I
      did.
      I
      guess
      time
      will
      tell
      what
      decisions
      are
      made.

      I #8217;m
      glad
      to
      hear
      you
      got
      it
      back,

      you
      really
      should
      press
      charges,
      OP.
      I
      know
      it
      sounds
      drastic,
      however
      if
      he
      feels
      this
      is
      acceptable
      behaviour,
      there
      is
      no
      telling
      what
      else
      of
      yours
      he
      would
      just
      get
      rid
      of.
      And
      next
      time,
      he
      might
      just
      break
      it.

      Firstly,

      That #8217;s
      all
      well
      and
      good,
      and
      I
      won #8217;t
      pressure
      you,
      however
      I
      do
      feel
      that
      you
      need
      to
      think
      of
      this
      not
      as
      a
      one
      off
      thing.
      If
      someone
      is
      willing
      to
      do
      what
      he
      did
      once,
      he #8217;s
      willing
      to
      do
      it
      again.
      And
      next
      time,
      you
      can
      be
      sure
      he
      will
      do
      a
      better
      job
      of
      getting
      rid
      of
      whatever
      he
      decides
      to
      next.
      He
      is
      an
      adult
      and
      as
      such,
      he
      should
      be
      adult
      enough
      to
      face
      the
      consequences
      of
      his
      actions.
      Your
      mother
      being
      mad
      is
      not
      a
      consequence
      by
      any
      stretch.

      it
      will
      be
      enjoyable
      for
      everyone
      who
      doesn #8217;t
      care
      about
      the
      national
      dex,
      however
      I
      wonder
      how
      long
      the
      games
      will
      be
      fun
      for
      them,
      as
      Gamefreak
      continues
      to
      make
      more
      and
      more
      gimmicks
      they
      cant
      be
      bothered
      to
      refine
      in
      later
      titles.
      At
      this
      point,
      we
      as
      a
      fanbase
      either
      come
      together
      and
      punish
      Gamefreak
      for
      their
      laziness,
      or
      we
      can
      all
      kiss
      this
      franchise
      as
      we
      know
      it,
      goodbye.

      Because
      they
      are.
      They
      have
      had
      YEARS
      to
      future-proof.
      It's
      why
      they
      got
      the
      models
      in
      the
      first
      place.
      But
      instead
      they
      continue
      to
      feed
      us
      lies
      about
      why
      the
      dex
      can't
      happen.
      First
      is
      was
      time:
      False,
      considering
      they
      had
      the
      models
      already,
      when
      they
      did
      the
      3DS
      models
      Then
      it
      was:
      We
      are
      making
      high
      quality
      animations.
      Also
      false,
      since
      they
      clearly
      have
      copy-pasted
      a
      majority
      of
      the
      animations
      from
      the
      3-DS
      And
      now
      it's
      because
      the
      models
      broke:
      BS
      as
      well,
      considering,
      as
      I
      pointed
      out,
      they
      made
      the
      models
      with
      the
      future
      in
      mind.
      All
      in
      all?
      Gamefreak
      is
      trying
      to
      test
      how
      much
      lazier
      they
      can
      be,
      before
      their
      sales
      take
      a
      hit.
      Which
      is
      amazing,
      considering
      how
      boring
      and
      uninspired
      Town
      looks.

      Can
      the
      punishment
      be
      the
      liquidation
      of
      all
      their
      assets,
      the
      money
      being
      distributed
      back
      to
      the

      and
      then
      forcing

      to
      sit
      in
      a

      full
      of
      the
      emissions
      they
      pumped
      into
      our
      air?
      Seems
      fair,
      since
      they
      have
      no
      problem
      killing
      all
      of
      us.

      Gara
      is
      definitely
      one
      of
      the,
      in
      my
      opinion,
      top
      tier
      Defense
      and
      Survival
      characters.
      Reason
      being
      that,
      why
      I
      am
      sure
      people
      have
      a
      character
      they
      think
      is
      better,
      her
      kit
      provides
      a
      ton
      of
      options
      and
      gameplay
      to
      keep
      you
      from
      just...standing
      there
      and
      letting
      you
      skills
      do
      the
      work.
      Plus,
      she
      looks
      like
      a
      freaking
      bad-ass.
      One
      of
      my
      fave
      base
      Warframe
      designs
      and
      I
      am
      dying
      to
      see
      what
      they
      do
      for
      her
      inevitable
      Prime
      form.

      While
      I

      it #8217;s
      mostly
      being

      I
      do
      agree
      with
      basically
      everything
      you
      said
      here.
      I
      definitely
      use
      her
      1,
      mostly
      as
      a
      map-wipe
      AND
      a
      way
      to
      give
      a
      broken
      wall,
      one
      last
      hurrah
      before
      I
      rebuild.
      Her
      look
      in
      general
      makes
      her
      an
      8/10
      for
      me

      Honestly,
      this
      is
      the
      thought
      I
      have
      every
      time
      I
      see
      more
      news.
      It #8217;s
      like
       #8220;cool,
      they
      fixed
      this...but
      they
      couldn #8217;t
      be
      bothered
      to
      have
      the
      whole
      dex. #8221;
      It
      really
      does
      suck,
      because
      I
      see
      so
      much
      else
      that
      I
      am,
      at
      the
      very
      least,
      intrigued
      by
      with
      this
      new
      game.
      I #8217;ll
      hold
      out
      a
      glimmer
      of
      hope
      they
      reverse
      the
      decision
      in
      the
      future
      games
      or
      even
      the
      inevitable
      third
      version.

      Amazing
      that
      grown
      men
      and
      women
      would
      rather
      attack
      a
      16
      year
      old
      for
      things
      she
      has
      no
      control
      over,
      instead
      of
      take
      a
      hard
      look
      at
      reality
      and
      admit
      things
      are
      looking
      dire
      for
      everyone.
      Climate
      action
      isn't
      a
      Liberal/Socialist/Communist
      agenda.
      It's
      a
      human
      agenda.
      If
      people
      want
      to
      be
      able
      to
      see
      their
      children
      and
      grandchildren
      grow
      up
      free
      of
      suffering
      and
      disease,
      they
      need
      to
      get
      off
      their
      ass,
      swallow
      their
      pride,
      and
      do
      everything
      they
      can
      to
      save
      this
      Earth
      before
      it
      becomes
      impossible.
      We
      aren't
      going
      to
      Mars.
      We
      aren't
      going
      to
      be
      able
      to
      terra-form
      and
      make
      another
      planet
      habitable
      in
      time
      to
      save
      ourselves
      and
      our
      children.
      It's
      a
      now
      or
      never
      thing.
      If
      you
      fight
      this,
      you
      are
      condoning
      the
      death
      of
      your
      future
      generations
      and
      those
      of
      every
      other
      human
      on
      this
      planet.

      Honestly
      this
      seems
      pretty
      accurate
      with
      what
      has
      been
      going
      on
      in
      the
      past
      chapters.
       gt;!It
      was
      always
      alluded
      to
      by
      future
      Zethia
      that
      Euden
      get's
      killed,
      but
      it
      isn't
      explicitly
      stated.
      So
      it
      makes
      sense
      that
      they
      would
      eventually
      go
      the
      route
      of
      Euden
      actually
      being
      taken
      over
      once
      The
      Other
      gets
      powerful
      enough
      to
      do
      so.! lt;
      I'm
      curious
      to
      see
      how
      they
      weave
      Audric
      into
      the
      future
      story,
      as
      I
      feel
      they
      would
      miss
      an
      amazing
      opportunity
      to
      do
      so.

      of
      shit.
      They
      seem
      to
      have
      had
      no
      problem
      copy-pasting
      animations
      and
      models
      from
      years
      ago.
      Are
      you
      seriously
      telling
      me
      that
      Gamefreak
      doesn't
      have
      the
      resources
      to
      bring
      every
      pokemon
      into
      the
      main
      games
      of
      a
      franchise
      that
      rakes
      in
      billions
      in
      revenue?

      Not
      sure
      why
      you
      are
      getting
      down
      voted,
      when
      it's
      true.
      Gamefreak
      is
      the
      company
      behind
      the
      world's
      highest
      earning
      franchise.
      They
      have
      absolutely
      NO
      excuse
      not
      to
      bring
      every
      Pokemon
      back.
      It's
      laziness
      and
      really
      telling
      of
      what
      their
      corporate
      stance
      is:
      Make
      a
      ton
      of
      gimmicks
      they
      wont
      be
      bothered
      to
      bring
      back
      next
      gen,
      while
      doing
      as
      little
      work
      as
      possible
      on
      this
      game.
      Next
      thing
      we
      know,
      they
      will
      start
      selling
      generations
      in
      DLC
      bundles...

      If
      they
      did
      their
      job
      and
      actually
      brought
      them
      back,
      they
      wouldn't
      have
      to
      hear
      about
      #BringBackTheDex,
      now
      would

      Man,
      yes
      it
      does.
      Not
      sure
      what
      industry
      you
      think
      this
      is,
      but
      it
      isn #8217;t
      a
      very
      indie-artsy
      industry.
      If
      the
      player
      base
      ditches
      because
      of
      what
      they
       #8220;want
      to
      make #8221;,
      they
      won #8217;t
      be
      making
      games
      for
      much
      longer

      I #8217;m
      aware
      of
      what
      I
      said.
      I
      was
      speaking
      in
      a
      general
      sense.
      Regardless
      of
      what
      you
      feel
      on
      the
      subject,
      if
      Gamefreak
      pisses
      the
      player
      base
      off
      enough,
      it
      WILL
      start
      to
      affect
      their
      sales.
      Why
      do
      you
      think
      Pokemon
      is
      so
      huge?
      It #8217;s
      due
      in
      large
      part
      to
      the
      player
      base.
      Without
      it,
      they
      would
      have
      nothing
      and
      we
      would
      not
      be
      having
      this
      conversation.
