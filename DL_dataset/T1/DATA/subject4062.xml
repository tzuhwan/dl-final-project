    <TEXT>i would upvote the shit out of your comment if i could. i've been a format fan for years. seriously one of my favorite bands. i was happy when nate got the recognition with fun and thought they deserved the break. i mean hell, even fun's first album "Aim and Ignite" wasn't terrible. but the music that he is making now is complete and utter garbage.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Just three nights ago my girlfriend was over and decided to bring an oven pizza to cook. She started to preheat the oven without taking a look in the oven. Fast forward to about 15 minutes later and there is the terrible smell of burnt plastic mixed with something I can't quite put my finger on coming from the kitchen. I rush in to see the oven billowing smoke so I rip open the oven door and whatever is inside of the oven immediately catches fire. The smoke alarms went off and I literally had to use our fire extinguisher to put it out. Once the fire was out I called my roommate to try and figure out just what in the hell was left in the oven. It turns out he thought it was a perfectly fine practice to leave plastic bowls full of extra cooking oil sitting in the oven for storage. So, yeah. Don't put stupid shit in the oven. And always look in the oven before you turn it on.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>Also can confirm. My best friend (and lifelong family farmer) once fell on his long board and fractured both of his wrists so badly they both needed surgery. After contemplating what to do about the pain in his wrists for probably thirty minutes, he got up and drove himself to the hospital in his fucking '76 Chevy with no power steering. Doc couldn't believe it.</TEXT>
