      Tell
      him
      it #8217;s
      better
      than
      going
      into
      an
      overthinking
      spiral
      and
      going
      crazy.
      If
      he
      likes
      you
      perfect
      if
      he
      doesn #8217;t
      atleast
      you #8217;ll
      have
      closure.Also
      the
      guy
      sounds
      smart
      enough
      not
      to
      end
      a
      perfectly
      good
      friendship
      over
      something
      like
      this.Good
      luck #128077; #127995;
      PS
      I
      have
      a
      crush
      on
      someone
      so
      I
      can

      Since
      it #8217;s
      already
      messing
      up
      your
      head
      bad
      I
      say
      go
      for
      it.You
      already
      said
      you
      can #8217;t
      keep
      doing
      what
      you
      already
      are
      and
      maybe
      she
      feels
      the
      same
      and
      if
      she
      does
      that
      would
      be
      beyond
      perfect
      and
      if
      she
      doesn #8217;t
      atleast
      you #8217;ll
      get
      closure
      and
      stop
      the
      overthinking
      spiral.Also
      you
      don #8217;t
      necessarily
      have
      to
      end
      the
      friendship
      after
      confessing
      your
      feelings.

      Yeah

      put
      and
      said
      things
      I
      do
      for
      love.I
      know
      he
      doesn #8217;t
      have
      a
      girlfriend
      but
      could
      it
      possible
      he
      is
      considering
      someone
      else?He
      told
      me
      he
      doesn #8217;t
      have
      time
      for
      this
      way
      before

      I
      think
      that
      too
      but
      sometimes
      he
      would
      flirt
      or
      do
      something
      which
      actually
      make

      he

      cares
      about
      me
      and
      I
      get

      He
      won #8217;t
      be
      here
      till
      next
      year
      I

      it
      isn #8217;t
      the

      issue
      it

      the

      issue
      or
      the

      issue
      (he #8217;s
      25
      I #8217;m
      21)or
      simply
      I
      am
      just
      not
      what

      I
      shouldn #8217;t
      expect
      anything
      from

      what #8217;s
      the
      point
      of
      putting
      yourself
      out
      there

      I

      I

      and
      get

      I

      it #8217;s
      gonna
      be
      a
      no
      and
      I
      won #8217;t
      even
      be
      able

      mean
      who
      is
      stupid
      enough
      to

      But
      isn #8217;t
      it
      so
      hard

      to
      tell

      cause
      I
      know
      the
      answer
      is

      I
      sometimes
      think
      he
      likes
      me.Its
      really
      weird
      and
      complicated.I
      had
      a
      crush
      on
      him
      when
      he
      was
      here
      but
      it
      was
      one
      of
      those
      crushes
      where
      you
      just
      look
      at
      the
      guy
      and
      smile.I
      didn #8217;t
      even
      know
      his
      name.I
      found
      out
      a
      year
      ago
      added
      him
      on
      Instagram
      and
      we
      started
      talking
      but
      he
      lives
      in
      a
      different
      country
      now.We
      talk
      daily.Sometimes
      it
      does
      feel
      like
      he
      is
      into
      me
      but
      it #8217;s
      really
      confusing
      and
      he
      always
      says
      not
      to
      expect
      anything
      off
      him
      so
      there
      is
      really
      no
      point
      in
      my
      case.But
      if
      you
      think
      something
      can
      happen
      with
      your
      crush
      I
      say
      you
      go
      for
      it.Even
      I
      told
      this
      guy
      I
      had
      a
      crush
      on
      him
      once
      but
      then
      laughed
      it
      off
      and
      it
      was
      stupid.At
      this
      point
      I
      am
      considering
      clear
      cut
      telling
      him
      that
      what
      I
      feel
      for
      you
      is
      really
      strong
      and
      I
      can #8217;t
      keep
      talking
      to
      you
      and
      be
      friends
      hoping
      maybe
      one
      day
      you #8217;ll
      fall
      for
      me.

      we

      Thanks
      for
      being
      so
      supportive #10084; #65039;
      I
      really
      don #8217;t
      know
      how
      I
      feel
      but
      I
      am
      relieved
      he
      clearly
      knows
      now.No
      mixed
      signals
      or
      confusions.But
      he
      sometimes
      acts
      as
      if
      he
      doesn #8217;t
      give
      a
      fuck
      about
      me
      and
      other
      times
      I
      am
      the
      first
      person
      to
      know
      when
      anything
      good
      or
      bad
      happens.Makes
      me
      question
      what
      I
      exactly
      am
      in
      his
      life.This
      is
      why
      I
      told
      him
      in
      the
      first
      place
      but
      I
      still
      have
      so
      much
      uncertainty
      in
      this
      matter.I
      mean
      I
      know
      a
      relationship
      is
      out
      of
      the
      question
      but
      then
      what
      am
      I?
      Even
      prior
      to
      telling
      him
      one
      day
      I
      am
      his
      best
      friend
      other
      day
      excuse
      me
      who
      are
      you.So
      it #8217;s
      really
      confusing.

      you
      or

      Make
      your
      own
      notes
      especially
      of
      the
      stuff
      you
      find
      difficult.I
      am
      not
      sure
      of
      your
      syllabus
      but
      we
      had
      various
      cycles
      like
      ketogenesis,cholesterol
      synthesis
      etc
      and
      they
      took
      a
      lot
      of
      time
      to
      memorise.So
      it #8217;s
      best
      to
      make
      notes
      or
      something
      like
      that
      for
      it.Some
      teachers
      do
      prefer
      their
      notes
      but
      if
      your
      information
      is
      right
      they
      can #8217;t
      ignore
      that.Take
      someone
      else #8217;s
      notes
      and
      just
      look
      once
      so
      that
      you
      don #8217;t
      miss
      anything
      important
      that #8217;s
      only
      given
      in
      the
      notes.

      My
      friend
      texted
      my
      crush
      who
      I
      had
      been
      talking
      for
      quite
      some
      time
      and
      who
      kinda
      knew
      I
      had
      feelings
      for
      him
      that
      I
      was
      ready
      to
      marry
      him
      and
      have
      his
      kids.So
      I
      kinda
      get
      you.I
      think
      you
      should
      chill
      now
      and
      see
      how
      he
      reacts
      after
      break.Tell
      him
      it
      was
      a
      stupid
      joke
      or
      maybe
      you
      thought
      he
      was
      kinda
      cute
      and
      it #8217;s
      nothing.Try
      to
      keep
      it
      casual
      and
      cool.

      I
      have
      never
      been
      in
      a

      but
      I
      have

      someone
      very
      close
      to
      me
      be
      in
      one.You
      know
      it #8217;s
      abusive
      when
      there
      are
      more
      fights
      than
      you
      can
      even
      remember.Its
      abusive
      when
      he
      tries
      to
      control
      every
      aspect
      of
      your
      life,when
      he
      considers
      you
      his
      property
      or
      some
      possession,imposes
      restrictions
      on
      you.Bottomline
      when
      he
      doesn #8217;t
      let
      you
      be
      you.When

      let
      you
      hang
      out
      with

      all

      The

      thing
      though
      I
      can #8217;t
      even
      think
      about
      being
      with
      anyone

      this
      guy
      did
      make
      me
      feel
      special.It
      wasn #8217;t
      all
      in
      my
      head.Also
      I
      am
      21
      and
      he #8217;s
      25
      so
      the
      parents
      aren #8217;t
      the
      reason
      he
      isn #8217;t
      responding.He
      moved
      to
      a
      different
      country
      a
      couple
      of
      years
      back
      and
      he
      came
      back
      this
      year
      and
      totally
      surprised
      me.He
      made
      up
      some
      silly
      excuses
      and
      then
      he
      was
      like
      surprise
      I
      am
      home.We
      actually
      started
      talking
      when
      he
      had
      already
      moved
      to
      a
      different
      country.

      Yeah
      I
      get
      that.And
      I
      get
      the
      parents
      thing
      too.Where
      we
      live
      parents
      play
      a
      big
      role
      in

      who
      we
      date
      and
      can
      have
      as
      a
      partner
      and
      he
      is
      from
      a
      different
      religion.Frankly
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      I
      have
      a
      chance
      and
      I
      am
      so
      tired
      of
      trying.And
      he
      lives
      so
      far
      away.Maybe
      that #8217;s
      why
      he
      didn #8217;t
      want
      anything.Either
      ways
      I
      know
      I
      gotta
      stop.I
      just
      don #8217;t
      know

      I
      know

      it #8217;s
      really

      I

      want

      to

      get

      unhealthy.And
      I
      don #8217;t
      wanna
      do
      this
      cause
      he
      didn #8217;t
      reciprocate
      my
      feelings.Its
      cause
      he
      is
      still
      playing
      with
      this
      knowing
      exactly
      how

      You
      totally
      get
      it.I
      tried
      so
      hard
      to
      impress
      him.Picked
      up
      hobbies
      he
      was
      interested
      in.Cared
      for
      him.I
      would
      make
      sure
      he
      was
      up
      for
      his
      job,took
      medicines
      when
      he
      was
      sick
      blah
      blah
      and
      he
      is
      nothing
      to
      me.He
      isn #8217;t
      mine
      and
      will
      never
      be
      and
      I
      should
      move
      on.And
      frankly
      I
      am
      tired
      of
      trying
      to
      be
      good
      enough
      for
      him.Tired
      of
      trying
      to
      get
      him
      to
      talk
      to
      me.I
      should
      rather
      focus
      on
      myself
      now.So
      thank
      you
      for
      that.

      You
      think
      I
      am
      dumb
      enough
      to
      not
      care
      for
      my
      patients.First
      of
      all
      I
      am
      a
      student
      and
      not
      a
      clinician
      yet.I
      kick
      my
      ass
      studying
      the
      entire
      day
      something
      really
      tough.Its
      natural
      to
      be
      paranoid
      and
      to
      get
      too
      stressed
      or
      used
      to
      the
      monotonous
      life.Yes
      I
      wasted
      some
      time
      before
      my
      exams
      but
      that
      doesn #8217;t
      mean
      I
      didn #8217;t
      study
      before.I
      passed
      really
      tough
      exams
      to
      even
      get
      into
      this
      college
      and
      it
      wasn #8217;t
      all
      a
      fluke.I
      wouldn #8217;t
      have
      even
      cleared
      the
      first
      year
      if
      all
      my
      life
      was
      a
      fluke.Sure
      you
      have
      concerns
      about
      some
      doctors
      but
      all
      I
      am
      saying
      is
      when
      I
      put
      this
      post
      I
      was
      stressed
      out
      and
      losing
      focus
      and
      not
      that
      I
      didn #8217;t
      study
      everything
      beforehand
      or
      that
      I
      don #8217;t
      care
      about
      the
      field
      I
      have
      chosen.I
      am
      already
      preparing
      for
      the
      field
      I
      wanna
      specialise
      in
      and
      doing
      research
      work
      all
      on
      top
      of
      my
      regular
      classes.
      If
      you
      still
      think
      I
      am
      joke
      I
      can #8217;t
      help
      it.

      You
      don #8217;t
      even
      know
      my

      had

      for

      I

      I
      hadn #8217;t
      studied
      anything
      after
      send

      have
      studied
      regularly
      for
      a
      year.Of
      course
      I
      wanted
      to
      revise
      whatever
      I
      had
      studied
      before
      because
      everything
      is
      tough

      you

      forget
      so
      many
      symptoms
      and
      disorders.

      I
      went

      Switzerland
      a
      few
      months
      back
      and
      from
      a
      tourist
      view
      point
      it
      is
      very
      expensive
      but
      the
      beauty
      of
      the
      place
      is
      totally
      worth

      suddenly
      becomes

      so
      much
      information
      to
      memorise.I
      am
      a
      med
      student
      too.I
      suggest
      you
      make
      a
      plan
      of
      what
      you
      wanna
      accomplish
      in
      the
      next
      one
      hour
      or
      even
      20
      min
      and
      keep
      your
      phone
      aside
      during
      that
      time
      period.You #8217;ll
      feel
      a
      sense
      of
      accomplishment
      and
      will
      keep
      doing
      it.Thats
      what
      I
      usually
      do.I
      also
      tried
      deleting
      a
      couple
      of
      social
      media
      apps
      during
      my
      exam
      to
      help
      me
      focus.

      I
      don #8217;t
      have
      a
      chance
      with
      him
      but
      we #8217;ve
      been
      texting
      for
      over
      a
      year
      now.He #8217;s
      so
      Cute
      and
      so
      damn
      adorable.Never
      listens
      to
      me.Elder
      to
      me
      but
      still
      sometimes
      acts
      like
      a
      kid.Takes
      my
      breath
      away
      when
      he
      walks
      into
      a
      room.He #8217;s
      always
      very
      confident
      but
      gets
      all
      shy
      and
      nervous
      when
      he #8217;s
      talking
      to
      me
      in
      person.He
      can
      be
      a
      jerk
      too
      sometimes
      but
      I
      don #8217;t
      know
      why
      I
      still
      love
      him
      very
      much.he
      always
      calls
      me
      kiddo
      even
      though
      I
      tell
      him
      not

      One
      of
      two
      things.Either
      he
      likes
      you
      and
      is
      too
      shy
      to
      admit
      it.Probably
      wants
      you
      to
      make
      the
      first
      move.Or
      maybe
      it #8217;s
      nothing.I
      have
      been
      in
      both
      situations.This
      one
      guy
      had
      so
      much
      eye
      contact
      with
      me
      and
      even
      showed
      interest
      the
      one
      time
      we
      talked
      but
      then
      suddenly
      changed
      overnight.So
      I
      think
      you
      should
      make
      the
      move.Atleast
      you #8217;ll
      know.

      Trust

      no

      he #8217;s
      a

      a

      See
      you
      gotta
      focus.Think
      that
      you
      have
      to
      work
      your
      ass
      off
      this
      week
      and
      you
      don #8217;t
      have
      time
      to
      cry
      right
      now.You
      can
      cry
      as
      much
      as
      you
      want
      once
      you
      are
      done
      with
      exams.Keep
      your
      phone
      aside
      and
      just
      get
      to
      it.Realise
      you
      don #8217;t
      have
      time
      to
      cry.Thats
      what
      helped
      me
      go
      through
      finals
      week.I
      went
      through
      that
      exactly.But
      you
      have
      no
      choice

      He
      was
      my
      senior.He
      would
      always
      treat
      me
      a
      little
      special
      but
      I
      didn #8217;t
      think
      too
      much
      into
      it
      cause
      we
      were
      very
      very
      good
      friends.He
      wanted
      a
      picture
      together
      at
      the
      college
      fest
      but
      he
      had
      to
      leave
      a
      little
      early
      so
      he
      called
      me
      up
      to
      ask
      me
      where
      I
      was
      and
      I
      told
      him
      never
      mind
      we
      can
      take
      it
      next
      time
      and
      then
      I
      realised
      there
      would
      be
      no
      next
      time
      and
      this
      was
      it.That
      was
      the
      moment
      I
      knew(It
      was
      the
      last
      year
      of
      his
      college).

      It
      just
      got
      messy.He
      kinda
      got
      together
      with
      someone
      else
      and
      we
      lost
      our
      friendship
      too.He
      said
      he
      liked
      me
      but
      then
      talked
      about
      kissing
      someone
      else
      and
      got
      into
      a
      relationship
      with
      another.So
      I
      guess
      he
      was
      just
      confused
      and
      I
      got
      caught
      up
      in
      it
      trying

      if
      I
      read
      the
      signs
      wrong

      he

      sorry.I
      was
      just

      confused

      and
      had
      no
      idea
      where
      to

      out
      a
      little
      bit
      and
      now
      I
      am
      working
      with
      the
      stuff
      I
      know
      to
      make
      something
      good.And
      yes

      makes
      me
      wanna

      Perfect.Thats
      the
      word
      I
      used
      to
      describe
      him
      too.But
      work
      on
      yourself
      and
      believe
      in
      yourself.Thats

      I
      so
      needed

      this.I

      the

      is

      right
      from
      the
      moment
      I
      saw
      him
      and
      we
      hit
      it
      off
      so
      well.Even
      though
      we
      just
      text(he #8217;s
      in
      another
      country
      too)
      I
      can
      know
      what
      he #8217;s
      thinking
      it
      or
      if
      he #8217;s
      upset
      just
      like
      that.I
      don #8217;t
      know
      the
      exact
      reason
      why
      we #8217;ll
      never
      work
      out
      but
      I
      know
      we
      won #8217;t
      and
      I
      should
      work
      on
      myself
      first.
      Thank
      you
      sooooo
      much

      You
      need
      to
      change
      how
      you
      spent
      your
      breaks.I
      used
      to
      waste
      a
      lot
      of
      time
      on
      social
      media
      and
      my
      10
      minutes
      break
      turned
      into
      hours.I
      deleted
      it
      and
      it
      helped.Try
      to
      keep
      your
      phone
      aside.Maybe
      listen
      to
      some
      music
      and
      walk
      around
      a
      bit
      when
      you
      take
      a
      break.All

      I
      am
      not
      entirely
      sure
      of
      your
      test
      pattern
      but
      practice
      numericals
      and
      derivations
      again
      and
      again.Try
      to
      do
      different
      type
      of
      numericals.Like
      instead
      of
      doing
      10
      questions
      of
      the
      same
      type
      try
      to
      do
      10
      questions
      of
      different
      type
      so
      that
      you
      can

      any
      problem.Also
      focus
      on
      the
      reasoning
      questions.Again
      not
      sure
      if
      your
      test
      pattern
      but
      hope
      this
      was
      helpful.We
      used

      and
      derivations
      of
      formulae
      a

      Yes.Her
      boyfriend
      is
      too
      controlling.He
      demands
      to
      know
      where
      she
      is
      at
      all
      times,she
      has
      to
      take
      his
      permission
      before
      going
      out
      or
      even
      attending
      a
      class
      she
      wants.He
      even
      decides
      when
      she
      can
      go
      and
      see
      her
      parents
      and
      gets
      mad
      if
      she
      stays
      home
      too
      long
      as
      their
      relationship
      is
      secret
      and
      she
      can #8217;t
      talk
      too
      much
      when
      she #8217;s
      home.She
      doesn #8217;t
      see
      it
      cause
      she #8217;s
      dumb.There
      is
      one
      thing
      being
      blinded
      by
      love.This
      is
      whole
      another
      level
      of
      bullshit.She
      is
      also
      not
      allowed
      to
      spend
      too
      much
      time
      with
      her
      friends.And
      he
      can
      spend
      hours
      with
      his
      friend
      and
      not
      even
      pick
      up
      her
      call.Thats
      no
      1
      boolshit.

      caring

      This
      might
      not
      be
      the
      best
      advice
      but
      maybe
      you
      should
      talk
      to
      him.I
      mean
      if
      he
      reciprocates
      your
      feelings
      then
      perfect
      otherwise
      you
      have
      solid
      reason
      to
      move
      on
      and
      it #8217;ll
      be
      easier.Also
      just
      like
      you
      I
      have
      never

      years

      waiting
      for
      the
      perfect
      one
      but
      now
      I
      am
      thinking
      that
      maybe
      I
      shouldn #8217;t
      be
      so
      uptight
      and
      give
      it
      a
      chance.I
      mean
      if
      it #8217;s
      meant
      to
      last
      it
      will

      he
      read
      the

      too.Thats
      none

      respects

      enough

      not

      and
      her
      relationship
      is

      say
      too
      much.

      We

      usually

      we
      were
      home
      for
      the
      holidays
      texting
      was
      the
      only
      option.She
      doesn #8217;t
      use
      her
      phone
      too
      much
      at

      so
      calling

      is
      not

      as

      as
      a
      wedge
      between
      us
      is

      he

      we
      are
      not

      good
      friends
      now
      cause
      she

      he
      cheats

      Exactly.I
      have
      decided
      to
      handle
      my
      own
      shit
      myself.As
      far
      as
      the
      cheating
      and
      abuse
      is
      concerned
      I
      have
      tried
      telling
      her
      so
      many
      times.Its
      her
      choice
      what
      she
      wants
      in
      life.

      You
      have
      no
      idea
      how
      many
      times
      I
      have
      tried.When
      she
      recently
      found
      out
      she
      had
      old
      me
      to
      talk
      to
      him
      and
      I
      literally
      told
      the
      guy
      to
      fuck
      off
      and
      leave
      her
      alone.Then
      she
      told
      me
      she
      wants
      to
      give
      him
      another
      chance
      and
      I
      tried
      to
      convince
      her
      then
      said
      it #8217;s
      either
      him
      or
      me.She
      said
      she
      won #8217;t
      talk
      to
      him
      but
      kept
      persuading
      so
      I
      finally
      gave
      in
      provided
      he
      won #8217;t
      abuse
      her.But
      now
      I
      see
      her
      ignoring
      me
      cause
      of
      him
      and
      then
      saying
      I
      am
      the
      one
      walking
      away
      and
      even
      took
      his
      side
      when
      I
      confronted
      him
      and
      told
      him
      to
      leave
      her
      alone.You
      have
      no
      idea
      how
      shitty
      I
      feel
      right
      now.

      I
      don #8217;t
      know
      what
      to
      do.Her
      birthday
      is
      coming
      up
      and
      I
      wanna
      be
      there
      for
      her.But
      I
      hate
      being
      ignored.One
      thing
      is
      for
      sure
      that
      I
      am
      not
      giving
      her
      any
      advice
      or
      anything
      like
      that.The
      worst
      thing
      is
      I
      have
      been
      with
      her
      through
      everything.All
      fights,problems,every
      damn
      thing
      and
      now
      she
      says
      you
      are
      not
      in
      a
      relationship
      so
      you
      don #8217;t
      understand.Just
      basically
      rubs
      that
      in
      my
      face
      and
      that
      felt
      so
      bad.

      Yeah
      yeah.See
      we
      are
      still
      friends.I
      feel
      like
      we
      are
      just
      not
      as
      close
      as
      we
      used
      to
      be.Since
      we
      practically
      live
      together
      we
      spent
      a
      lot
      of
      time
      with
      each
      other.Her
      family
      is
      practically
      my
      family.Maybe
      all
      this
      is
      in
      my
      head.We
      have
      been
      away
      at
      home
      and
      I
      haven #8217;t
      seen
      her
      in
      a
      while.Maybe
      I
      am
      in
      a
      mental
      competition
      with
      her
      bf.I
      feel
      like
      she
      takes
      our
      time
      to
      talk
      to
      him
      but
      doesn #8217;t
      even
      drop
      me
      a
      single
      text.I
      know
      all
      this
      sounds
      really
      stupid
      but
      thank
      you
      so
      so
      much
      for
      listening.I
      really

      In

      this

      maybe
      try

      a

      she
      isn #8217;t
      what
      you
      want
      but
      you

      I
      am
      not
      really
      sure
      of
      your
      grade
      system.We
      have
      an
      entrance
      exam
      for
      med
      school
      but
      I
      was
      in
      your
      position
      once.I
      struggled
      with
      physics.I
      thought
      I
      couldn #8217;t
      make
      it.So
      I
      spent
      all
      my
      time
      doing
      numericals
      and
      working
      on
      my
      weak
      points.Again
      I
      am
      not
      sure
      how
      much
      time
      you
      have
      or
      when
      your
      admissions
      start
      but
      if
      you
      put
      your
      mind
      to
      it
      and
      start
      working
      you
      can
      do
      it.I
      start
      my
      final
      year
      of
      med
      school
      on
      Monday
      so
      it
      is
      possible
      as
      long
      as
      you
      believe
      you
      can
      do
      it.

      So
      there
      is
      this
      guy
      and
      we
      connect.Last
      night
      I
      told
      him
      the
      kind
      of
      guy
      I
      want
      and
      he
      told
      me
      that #8217;s
      exactly
      what
      he
      looks
      in
      a
      girl.Thats
      basically
      me.I
      don #8217;t
      wanna
      ask
      him
      out
      and
      make
      it
      awkward
      cause
      we
      are
      in
      the
      same
      college
      and
      it
      can
      get
      really
      weird.He #8217;s
      shy
      and
      awkward
      too
      and
      probably
      why
      he
      won #8217;t
      ask
      either.
      The
      last
      time
      I
      took
      a
      leap
      it
      didn #8217;t
      work
      out
      and
      I
      am

      Is
      it
      worth
      waiting
      for
      someone
      who
      might
      be
      too
      shy
      and
      awkward
      to
      ask
      you
      out
      when
      it
      isn #8217;t
      even
      clear
      if
      he #8217;s
      just
      shy
      or
      if
      he #8217;s
      not
      into
      you?

      So
      I
      have
      this
      friend.He #8217;s
      my
      senior
      and
      we
      usually
      just
      text.But
      if
      he
      runs
      into
      me
      in
      person
      he
      gets
      all
      awkward
      won #8217;t
      even
      say
      hi
      and
      pretend
      he
      didn #8217;t
      see
      him.we
      hit
      it
      off
      while
      chatting.We
      had
      a
      joke
      that
      we #8217;ll
      find
      someone
      for
      each
      other
      and
      I
      told
      him
      the
      kind
      of
      guy
      I
      want
      which
      is
      kinda
      like
      him.He
      told
      me
      he
      wants
      the
      same
      things
      in
      a
      girl
      which
      is
      basically
      me.He #8217;s
      told
      me
      before
      he #8217;s
      shy
      and
      awkward
      but
      I
      am
      not
      sure
      if
      he
      likes
      me
      or
      not.The
      things
      he
      said
      he
      looks
      for
      Ina
      girl,I
      fit
      the
      criteria
      but
      I
      am
      not
      sure
      if
      I
      should
      make
      the
      first
      move
      and
      ask
      him
      out.What
      if
      he
      doesn #8217;t
      like
      me?It
      would
      be
      very
      awkward
      and
      weird
      and
      I
      don #8217;t
      wanna
      embarrass
      myself.

      then
      college
      will
      be

      everybody

      Your
      situation
      is
      so
      similar
      to
      mine
      except
      it
      was
      in
      the
      gym.I
      searched
      for
      my
      guy
      for
      so
      long
      and
      eventually
      found
      him.I
      am
      not
      exactly
      sure
      how
      you
      should
      go
      about
      it
      but
      I
      hope
      you
      find
      him.Umm
      maybe
      check
      the
      followers
      of
      the
      guy
      who
      put
      his
      pic.If
      he #8217;s
      on
      Instagram
      he
      would
      be
      following
      him.Unless
      you
      really
      really
      like
      that
      coffee
      place
      and
      don #8217;t
      wanna
      risk
      ever
      going
      back
      there
      you
      should
      just
      ask
      someone
      there.Its
      easier
      and
      atleast
      you #8217;ll
      know.The
      guy
      did
      seem
      into
      you.

      The
      guy
      I
      like
      has
      this
      hot
      model
      friend.I
      check
      her
      profile
      religiously.Maybe
      he

      skinny

      obsession.The
      only
      insecurity
      I
      have
      is
      I
      think
      he
      would
      choose
      her
      over
      me
      even
      though
      we

      It

      when
      you
      clean
      her
      tears
      but

      her
      problems
      are

      a
      half
      case
      was
      a
      total
      bullshit
      phase
      of
      my
      life.Thats
      why
      I
      am
      scared
      for
      the
      other
      guy.Is
      he
      shy
      or
      just
      wants
      to
      be
      friend.He
      got
      shit
      drunk
      and
      flirted
      with
      some
      chick
      the
      other
      day
      but
      he
      won #8217;t
      even
      say
      hi
      to
      me
      in
      person.

      I
      made
      the
      move
      last
      time
      only
      to
      get
      hurt
      but
      I
      understand
      that
      was
      more
      of
      an
      impossible
      situation.This
      guy
      initiated
      conversations.Now
      I
      am
      falling
      and
      he #8217;s
      talking
      about
      other
      girls
      or
      the
      fact
      he
      wants
      to
      focus
      on
      his
      career
      and
      stuff
      like
      that.Plus
      he #8217;s
      in
      my
      college
      and
      I
      don #8217;t
      want
      to
      be
      laughing
      stock.So
      I
      am
      very
      scared.What
      if
      I
      am
      not
      his
      type.His
      friends
      all
      have
      very

      Maybe.He
      told
      me
      he
      got
      shit
      drunk
      and
      was
      flirting
      with
      some
      girl
      from
      another

      but
      he

      want

      serious
      so
      won #8217;t
      pursue

      saw
      him
      leave
      with

      around
      her
      that

      then

      and
      we
      again
      ended
      up

      he #8217;s
      gonna
      say

      and
      does
      he
      even
      deserve
      a
      confession
      if
      he
      can #8217;t
      even
      say
      hi
      to

      I
      confront
      him
      about
      it
      he #8217;ll
      be

      So
      basically
      I
      had
      a
      crush
      on
      this
      guy,he
      knew
      but
      we
      were
      still
      good
      friends.Recently
      he
      said
      he
      needs
      time
      off
      of
      social
      media
      and
      doesn #8217;t
      want
      to
      or
      can #8217;t
      talk.Basically
      we
      didn #8217;t
      end
      on
      great
      terms.After
      like
      a
      month
      of
      no
      contact
      he
      comments
      on
      my
      recent
      Instagram
      post
      and
      replied
      to
      one
      of
      my
      stories.My
      friends
      think
      he
      wants
      to
      talk
      but
      I
      shouldn #8217;t
      because
      he
      said
      pretty
      hurtful
      things
      the
      last
      time
      we
      talked
      and
      I
      was
      finally
      moving
      on.But
      I
      can #8217;t
      stop
      wondering
      whether
      I
      should
      send
      hey,have
      a
      little
      chat.I
      miss
      him
      Ofcourse.I
      am
      scared
      what
      if
      he
      ignores
      me
      or
      is
      rude
      again.

      So
      there
      is
      this
      really
      cute
      guy
      at
      the
      gym
      and
      we
      often
      exchange
      glances
      but
      I
      am
      too
      shy
      stupid
      piece
      of
      shit
      to
      go
      upto
      him
      and
      initiate
      a
      conversation.Its
      been
      a
      few
      days
      and
      today
      I
      thought
      if
      he
      looks
      this
      way
      I #8217;ll
      pass
      a
      smile
      or
      something.So
      it
      happens
      that
      we
      are
      getting
      water
      at
      the
      same
      time(purely
      coincidental
      lol)
      and
      I
      had
      my
      boxing
      gloves
      in
      one
      hand
      and
      my
      phone
      in
      the
      other.I
      strategically
      place
      my
      gloves
      on
      my
      arm
      to
      get
      some
      water
      when
      the
      guy
      asks
      me
      do
      you
      box?
      So
      this
      is
      him
      initiating
      a
      conversation
      and
      I
      am
      beyond
      excited.I
      take
      out
      my
      AirPod
      to
      talk
      to
      him
      and
      with
      so
      many
      things
      in
      my
      hands
      and
      me
      being
      an
      utterly
      stupid
      awkward
      being
      I
      drop
      my
      AirPod
      in
      the
      water
      while
      talking
      to
      the
      guy.Then
      I
      proceed
      to
      make
      an
      even
      bigger
      fool
      out
      of
      myself
      by
      cursing
      and
      panicking
      over
      the
      loss
      of
      my
      beloved
      babies.I
      don #8217;t
      think
      he #8217;ll
      make
      a
      move
      again
      after
      seeing
      the
      mess
      I
      am.
      TL;DR
      Cute
      guy
      approached
      me
      at
      the
      gym.Got
      nervous
      and
      dropped
      my
      airpods
      in
      a
      glass
      of
      water
      making
      a
      fool
      out
      of
      myself.

      self
      explanatory
      as
      confusing
      as

      since

      him
      she #8217;s
      naturally
      closer

      the

      as
      they

      two

      do
      I
      have
      no
      one
      in

      now
      I

      even
      have

      drive

      all
      day
      trying
      to
      cheer
      myself
      up
      but
      nothing
      works.They
      are
      always
      talking
      about
      their
      bfs
      and
      other
      common
      stuff.What
      am
      I
      supposed
      to
      do?
      Stare
      at
      their
      faces
      when
      they
      are
      texting
      their
      boyfriends.They
      can
      atleast
      have
      the
      decency
      to
      put
      the
      phone
      down
      when
      they
      are
      with

      bad

      My
      best
      friend #8217;s
      relationship
      is
      new.She
      recently
      got
      out
      of
      a
      very
      toxic
      relationship
      and
      I
      always
      supported
      her
      through
      that
      and
      she
      still
      ignored
      me
      then.I
      understood
      then
      cause
      she
      always
      blamed
      the
      guy
      and
      how
      he
      doesn #8217;t
      want
      her
      to
      spend
      much
      time
      with
      her
      friends.I
      don #8217;t
      wanna
      sound
      some
      attention
      seeking
      friend
      but
      I
      just
      hoped
      things
      would
      be
      a
      little
      different
      now
      after
      everything
      I
      supported
      her
      through
      and
      how
      the
      guy
      ultimately
      cheated
      and
      left
      her.I
      am
      extremely
      happy
      she
      found
      this
      new
      guy.He #8217;s
      really
      nice
      but
      I
      just
      wish
      she
      would
      just
      get
      off
      her
      phone
      once
      in
      a
      while
      and
      look
      at
      other
      people
      around
      her.

      This
      sounds
      like
      a
      desperate
      call
      for
      help.Maybe
      it
      is.I
      feel
      like
      I
      am
      stuck
      in
      a
      rut
      and
      I #8217;ll
      never
      be
      happy.I
      lost
      a
      ton
      of
      weight
      and
      that
      felt
      good
      for
      a
      while
      but
      then
      it
      didn #8217;t.Nothing
      makes
      me
      happy
      anymore.I
      know
      I
      should
      love
      myself
      before
      expecting
      anyone
      else
      to
      love
      me
      but
      why
      is
      it
      so
      damn
      hard?All
      my
      friends
      are
      in
      relationships
      and
      I
      have
      been
      single
      all
      my
      life.My
      friends
      say
      I
      am
      pretty
      or
      cute
      and
      I
      am
      interesting
      but
      I
      somehow
      refuse
      to
      believe
      that.I
      am
      constantly
      belittling
      myself
      thinking
      what
      is
      it
      that
      they
      have
      and
      I
      don #8217;t.Why
      doesn #8217;t
      anyone
      like
      me?Am
      I
      that
      bad?Don #8217;t
      I
      deserve
      to
      be
      happy.I
      am
      not
      exactly
      sure
      what
      I
      am
      doing
      here
      but
      if
      anyone
      of
      you
      can
      put
      a
      smile
      on
      my
      face
      even
      for
      a
      millisecond
      I
      will
      be
      eternally
      grateful
      to
      you.

      Yeah
      I
      agree.I
      usually
      listen
      to
      some
      music
      while
      studying.Helps
      me
      concentrate
      better.I
      was
      wondering
      if
      there
      was
      a
      podcast
      out
      there
      with
      something
      similar.
      Thanks
      for
      your
      help:)

      something

      there
      is
      a

      gym

      now
      nothing.I
      literally

      to
      go

      I
      used
      to
      love
      Neurology.So
      passionate
      about

      a
      research
      project
      in
      my

      motivated
      enough
      to
      finish
      or
      even
      read
      about
      the
      subject
      I
      loved
      so
      much.Nothing
      makes
      me
      happy
      anymore.

      the

      a

      he
      does

      this
      not

      just
      something
      he
      thinks
      dads
      are
      supposed
      to
      do.
      He
      stands
      for
      half
      an
      hour
      in
      line
      to

      chicken
      when

      he
      knows
      I

      goes
      out

      to
      make

      comfortable

      way.
      I

      exist
      in
      my
      life
      anymore.Thats
      what
      you
      wanted
      right.Ofcourse
      you
      made
      a
      few
      appearances
      when
      you
      wanted
      but
      no
      this
      time
      I
      wanted
      to
      keep
      my
      self
      respect.But
      today,I
      couldn #8217;t
      do
      it.The
      cutting
      didn #8217;t
      help,getting
      shit
      drunk
      didn #8217;t
      help,losing
      all
      my
      friends
      certainly
      didn #8217;t
      help
      and
      jumping
      from
      the
      fifth
      floor
      seemed
      like
      the
      only
      option
      when
      I
      decided
      maybe
      I
      should
      keep
      my
      self
      respect
      aside
      for
      just
      one
      night
      and
      text
      you.Literally
      beg
      you
      to
      talk
      to
      me
      cause
      I
      could
      really
      use
      someone
      to
      talk
      to.But
      you
      did
      what
      you
      do
      best.Left
      me
      on
      read.Thanks
      dude.Right
      now
      jumping
      off
      the
      fifth
      floor
      seemed
      like
      a
      much
      better
      option.

      I
      did
      a
      great
      boxing
      workout.I
      wore
      tank
      top
      for
      the
      first
      time
      in
      my
      life.I
      have
      always
      been
      really
      conscious
      about
      my
      fat
      arms.Never
      wore
      them.But
      today
      I
      did.Felt
      confident
      af.But
      then
      I
      was
      reminded
      of
      how
      lonely
      I
      am.How
      nobody
      would
      even
      know
      if
      I
      vanish.How
      my
      best
      friend
      thinks
      all
      I
      want
      is
      a
      guy.Basically
      how
      my
      life
      sucks.So
      now
      I
      have
      vodka
      in
      one
      hand
      and
      I
      am
      typing
      with
      the
      other
      how
      I
       #8220;almost #8221;
      had
      a
      good
      day.

      I
      watched
      the
      movie
      last
      night.There
      was
      applause
      hooting
      and
      everything.The
      movie
      portrays
      Kabir
      Singh
      as
      MCP.Sure
      he
      was
      a
      jerk
      and
      being
      a
      medical
      student
      myself
      I
      could
      see
      how
      many
      things
      are
      wrong
      there.I
      personally
      hated
      the
      girl #8217;s
      character.Kabir
      stood
      for
      her
      at
      every
      aspect
      and
      she
      let
      him.I
      presented
      a
      paper,I
      was
      critiqued
      but
      that
      taught
      me
      stuff.Him
      standing
      on
      the
      stage
      while
      she
      delivers
      a
      speech
      was
      fucking
      ridiculous
      .The
      girl
      couldn #8217;t
      do
      anything
      by
      herself.Come
      on.I
      could
      go
      on
      about
      the
      flaws
      honestly.
      But
      Maybe
      Kabir
      Singh
      had
      an
      obsession.Maybe
      he
      actually
      did
      love
      her
      very
      much
      even
      though
      his
      way
      of
      showing
      love
      is
      looked
      down
      upon.But
      what
      is
      shown
      in
      the
      movie
      actually
      happens.People
      feel
      so
      fucking
      vulnerable
      these
      days,scared
      of
      a
      broken
      heart
      and
      doing
      every
      possible
      thing
      to
      fix
      themselves
      and
      trust
      me
      it #8217;s
      not
      easy
      especially
      when
      you
      have
      the
      stress
      of
      mbbs
      on
      you.I
      would
      have
      loved
      to
      see
      him
      get
      out
      of
      it
      in
      a
      better
      way.Hell
      it
      might
      have
      helped
      me
      get
      out
      of
      my
      spiral.Hated
      the
      end.
      WHILE
      PEOPLE
      ARE
      GOING
      ON
      ABOUT
      HOW
      KABIR
      SINGH
      PORTRAYS
      LOVE
      AND
      SOCIETY
      SOMEBODY
      NEEDS
      TO
      SEE
      HOW
      IT
      ALSO
      SHOWS
      HOW
      BAD
      YOUR
      MENTAL
      HEALTH
      CAN
      GET
      AND
      HOW
      ITS
      A
      CRY
      FOR
      HELP.
      Edit:-
      PS
      I
      hated
      what
      he
      said
      about
      fat
      girls
      being
      teddy
      bear
      and
      nice
      and
      caring.I
      have
      been
      fucking
      rejected
      for
      being
      nice
      and
      caring.Guess
      what
      I
      am
      fit
      now
      still
      rejected
      still
      drinking
      myself
      to
      sleep
      so
      stop
      thinking
      fat
      girls
      are
      some
      cute
      pandas
      or
      something.We
      can
      be
      bad
      ass
      too.

      I
      have
      been
      in
      this
      situation.The
      first
      one
      lasted
      for
      over
      a
      year
      and
      half.Texting
      daily.Even
      after
      confession
      which
      somehow
      kept
      the
      hope
      alive(the
      confession
      was
      after
      a
      year
      of
      texting
      daily).
      The
      second
      case
      again.I
      am
      still
      talking
      to
      the
      guy
      daily
      but
      man
      it
      hurts
      when
      he
      talks
      about
      some
      other
      girl
      or
      he #8217;s
      too
      shy
      to
      talk
      in
      person
      or
      whatever.
      Just
      be
      careful.I
      don #8217;t
      want
      you
      to
      get
      your
      heart
      broken.

      One
      really
      good
      advice
      someone
      gave
      me
      was
       #8220;unless
      he
      says
      clearly
      I
      like
      you
      assume
      he
      doesn #8217;t #8221;
      And
      in
      case
      you
      really
      do
      and
      feel
      like
      telling
      him
      would
      take
      a
      load
      off
      of
      you
      go
      ahead
      and
      do
      it.Its
      better
      to
      be
      over
      with
      it
      now
      than
      to
      keep
      suppressing
      your
      feelings
      for
      so
      long.I
      know
      both
      these
      things
      sound
      contradictory
      but
      I
      hope
      you
      find
      happiness
      whatever
      the
      outcome
      maybe.

      People
      say
      if
      you
      pretend
      to
      be
      happy
      eventually
      you
      will
      be.When
      I
      was
      in
      a
      better
      mental
      space
      I
      gave
      so
      many
      fucks
      about
      people.Taking
      care
      of
      them.Basically
      being
      there
      when
      they
      needed
      me
      and
      here
      I
      am
      stuck
      and
      nobody
      is
      there
      to
      help
      me.I
      was
      always
      there
      for
      the
      person
      I
      called
      my
      best
      friend.From
      covering
      for
      her
      pregnancy
      and
      taking
      care
      of
      her
      during
      her
      abortion,supporting
      her
      through
      her
      abusive
      relationship
      and
      always
      making
      her
      my
      priority.She
      always
      has
      some
      guy
      as
      her
      priority
      and
      honestly
      I
      am
      sick
      of
      it.We
      cleared
      the
      air
      last
      week.I
      told
      her
      I
      have
      hit
      so
      low
      and
      you
      aren #8217;t
      even
      there.I
      am
      cutting
      myself,drinking
      to
      sleep,can #8217;t
      focus,crying
      all
      day.Its
      so
      so
      hard
      for
      me
      to
      ask
      for
      help
      but
      I
      still
      somehow
      gathered
      the
      courage
      and
      got
      shot
      down
      every
      damn
      time.I
      will
      deal
      with
      this
      alone.I
      will
      drink.I
      will
      cut
      myself.None
      of
      these
      people
      need
      to
      give
      a
      fuck
      about
      me.But
      atleast
      don #8217;t
      even
      pretend
      you
      do.
      Asking
      me
      not
      to
      drink
      my
      morning
      coffee
      is
      ridiculous.Its
      my
      life.I
      will
      drink
      the
      god
      damn
      coffee.You
      can #8217;t
      be
      here
      when
      I
      needed
      you.Now
      telling
      me
      not
      to
      drink
      coffee
      cause

      care
      about
      me
      and
      how
      it #8217;s
      not
      good
      for

      I
      have
      been
      feeling
      so
      unmotivated
      and
      hating
      myself
      and
      life
      in
      general.Been
      going
      through
      a
      dark
      phase
      of
      my
      life
      where
      I
      have
      been
      isolating
      myself
      and
      cutting
      and
      thinking
      things
      will
      never
      get
      better.Feeling
      empty.But
      walking
      out
      of
      the
      accounts
      office
      yesterday,it
      felt
      like
      how
      close
      I
      am
      to
      finishing
      this.I #8217;ll
      be
      a
      doctor
      by
      the
      end
      of
      this
      year.That
      is
      something
      to
      look
      forward
      to.Something
      that
      I
      used
      to
      be
      so
      passionate
      about.I
      don #8217;t
      how
      long
      this
      feeling
      of
      euphoria
      and
      motivation
      is
      gonna
      last
      but
      I
      sure
      as
      hell
      see
      myself
      as
      being
      something
      more
      than
      who
      I
      am
      today.

      It #8217;s
      hard

      professional
      help.Being

      Yeah
      they
      would
      but
      then
      again
      they
      are
      also
      my
      professors
      and
      talking
      to
      them
      would
      be

      for

      to
      talk
      to
      anyone
      really

      I

      my

      not
      big
      on
      the
      whole
      mental
      health
      thing.According
      to
      them
      I
      just
      need
      to
      think
      positively.

      This.I

      happened
      at

      the
      most

      year

      I
      can #8217;t
      even

      now.Its
      not
      like
      I
      don #8217;t
      try
      but
      it #8217;s
      really
      hard
      to
      focus
      when
      you
      are
      breaking
      down
      and
      barely
      managing
      to
      keep
      sane.The
      fact
      that
      nobody
      even
      checks
      up
      on
      me,the
      constant
      feeling
      of
      loneliness
      seems
      to
      suck
      the
      life
      out
      of
      me.

      I
      am
      in
      4th
      year
      now.Working
      out
      used
      to
      be
      my
      thing.I
      hit
      the
      gym
      even
      close
      to
      finals.But
      now
      it
      takes
      so
      much
      energy
      to
      even
      get
      off
      the
      bed.I
      have
      been
      hitting
      the
      gym
      pretty
      hard
      this
      week
      to
      keep
      myself
      sane
      but
      then
      I
      get
      so
      tired
      I
      can #8217;t
      study.I
      haven #8217;t
      experienced
      the
      post
      workout
      high
      in
      ages.I
      feel
      empty
      driving
      to
      the
      gym.Feel
      empty
      coming
      back.Just
      generally
      tired
      of
      feeling
      like
      this
      all
      the
      time.

      These
      kind

      people
      are
      the

      is
      for
      people
      who
      start
      a

      cause
      they
      are
      so
      self
      conscious.I
      remember
      being
      one
      of
      them,so
      conscious
      about
      my
      weight
      and
      the
      way
      I
      look
      and
      my
      physical
      incapabilities.Though
      I
      have
      met
      plenty
      of
      bullies
      who
      judged
      me
      for
      being
      fat
      I
      am
      just
      happy
      I
      met
      a
      couple
      of
      people
      who
      encouraged
      me
      and
      made
      me
      believe
      I
      can
      do
      it
      when
      I
      first
      started.

      I
      guess
      I
      will
      always
      be
      like
      that.I
      have
      accepted
      nobody
      is
      gonna
      magically
      appear
      to
      make
      it

      better
      but
      god
      I
      wish
      there
      was
      someone
      out
      there
      for
      me,just
      someone
      who
      gave
      a
      damn
      about
      me.

      literally
      turned

      I
      did
      eat
      after
      the

      What
      made
      me
      smile
      was
      the
      fact
      that
      my

      didn #8217;t
      get
      all
      annoyed
      cause
      I
      wanted
      to
      take
      a

      he
      helped
      me
      and
      then
      we
      had
      breakfast.

      Yeah
      sure
      :)
      I
      made
      it
      by
      approximation
      since
      I
      have
      been
      making
      it
      for
      quite
      some
      time
      so
      you
      might
      wanna
      look
      up
      the
      exact
      measurements
      online.
      Mix
      in
      oats,nuts,dried
      berries,chocolates
      basically
      anything
      you
      want
      in
      a
      big
      bowl.
      Melt
      some
      butter
      in
      a
      pan.Once
      it #8217;s
      melted
      and
      kinda
      sizzling
      add
      in
      some
      brown
      sugar,mix
      it
      in.Let
      it
      cook
      a
      little
      and
      add
      in
      honey.Thats
      the
      caramel
      thing
      which
      binds
      it
      all
      together.Make
      sure
      you
      make
      enough.Add
      it
      to
      the
      dry
      ingredients,mix
      it
      well
      enough
      and
      scoop
      it
      out
      in
      a
      tin
      lined
      by
      foil(I
      buttered
      the
      foil
      too
      to
      make
      sure
      it
      doesn #8217;t
      stick).Press
      it
      in
      nicely
      and
      refrigerate
      for
      3-4
      hours.Cut
      it
      into
      bars
      and
      you
      are
      good
      to
      go.
      Again
      really
      sorry
      I
      couldn #8217;t
      give
      the
      exact
      measurements.
      Individually
      wrapped
      the
      bars
      in
      foil
      so
      that
      I
      can
      carry
      them
      easily
      :)

      girl
      and
      I
      used
      to
      get
      so
      self
      conscious
      and
      not
      even
      go
      to
      weights
      room.Make
      sure
      you
      show
      up
      everyday.Thats
      how
      you
      gain
      the
      confidence
      to
      be
      there
      and
      you
      start
      getting
      comfortable.Remember
      everyone
      is
      there
      to
      better
      themselves
      .Sure
      there
      can
      be
      some
      judgemental
      assholes
      there
      and
      I
      was
      really
      lucky
      to
      have
      a
      couple
      of
      these
      big
      dudes
      who
      didn #8217;t
      put
      me
      down
      and
      motivated
      me
      but
      you
      are
      going
      to
      the
      gym
      for
      you.Not
      them.So
      don #8217;t
      give
      a
      shit
      what
      anyone
      thinks.Focus
      on
      your
      form(look
      up
      videos
      online
      if
      you
      don #8217;t
      have
      access
      to
      a
      good
      trainer)
      ,blast
      some
      music
      and
      have
      a
      kickass
      workout
      :)

      you
      deserve
      someone
      who
      pushes
      you
      and
      motivates
      you,not
      someone
      who
      lets
      you
      down.Find
      a
      trainer
      who
      is
      better
      suited
      to
      you.

      I

      so
      loud.I
      am
      tired

      depressed,then
      anxious,then
      full
      of
      rage.My
      teeth
      hurt
      from
      passively
      clenching
      them
      too
      much.The
      only
      thing
      that
      gave
      me
      peace
      was
      talking

       #8220;him #8221;.The

      person
      I
      am
      not
      supposed

      talk

      tell
      my
      best
      friend(who #8217;s
      like
      my
      biggest
      support
      system
      right
      now),she #8217;ll
      leave

      supposed

      I
      hate
      lying

      but
      I
      want
