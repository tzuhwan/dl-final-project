      I
      just
      distract
      myself
      using
      any
      means
      possible
      -
      YouTube
      or
      sleep

      Me
      too.
      I
      feel
      like
      I
      don't
      fit
      in
      even
      in
      so-called

      where
      everyone

      seems
      to
      make
      friends
      so
      easily.

      Honestly
      one
      of
      the
      reasons
      I'm
      still
      going
      is
      because
      there's
      always
      books
      coming
      out
      that
      I
      want
      to
      read.
      Can't
      read
      if
      I'm
      dead,
      so...

      Me
      too
      -
      even
      on
      good
      days
      when
      I'm
      waiting
      for
      the
      train
      I
      think,
      well
      I
      *could*
      theoretically
      throw
      myself
      under
      it,
      but
      meh.
      I
      see
      rafters
      and
      think
      about
      hanging
      myself.
      It's
      less
      of
      an
      emergency
      than
      something
      that
      just
      happens
      and
      I
      don't
      really
      feel
      the
      urge
      to
      act
      on
      suicidal
      thoughts.
      Kind
      of
      awkward
      when
      I
      don't
      look
      before
      crossing
      the
      street
      and
      my
      friend
      jokingly
      says,
      "I'm
      a
      college
      student
      who
      just
      got
      an
      assignment
      back,
      run
      me
      over!"
      How'd
      you
      know
      what
      I
      was
      thinking?

      I've
      had
      severe
      social
      anxiety
      and
      depression
      since
      7th
      grade.
      Six
      years
      of
      being
      a
      teenager
      and
      I've
      spent
      most
      of
      it
      at
      home
      in
      my
      room,
      I
      don't
      even
      remember
      what
      I
      did
      most
      of
      the
      time.
      I
      made
      a
      couple
      acquaintances
      that
      weren't
      really
      friends.
      I
      missed
      my
      prom
      and
      after-parties.
      I've
      never
      had
      a
      group
      of
      friends
      before.
      I'm
      in
      my
      first
      year
      of
      college
      now
      and
      my
      social
      and
      emotional
      growth
      is
      so
      stunted
      that
      it's
      difficult
      for
      me
      to
      connect
      with
      anyone.

      Got
      yelled
      at
      while
      walking
      in
      Paris
      for
      seemingly
      no
      reason.
      I've
      told
      people
      who
      aren't
      my
      parents,
      and
      most
      of
      them
      said,
      "It's
      probably
      because
      you're
      Chinese."
      On
      the
      plus
      side
      I'm
      the
      only
      person
      my
      parents
      know
      who
      didn't
      have
      anything
      stolen
      while
      in
      Paris.

      I've
      always
      been
      shy
      but
      in
      seventh
      grade
      I
      was
      bullied,
      generally
      by
      exclusion
      -
      people
      would
      act
      like
      I
      wasn't
      there
      and
      talk
      about
      me
      behind
      my
      back.
      I
      knew
      what
      was
      going
      on
      and
      they
      knew
      I
      knew
      what
      was
      going
      on.
      I
      just
      kind
      of
      stopped
      talking
      to
      anyone
      after
      that.
      I
      moved
      schools
      the
      next
      year,
      but
      that
      came
      with
      a
      healthy
      dose
      of
      severe
      anxiety
      that
      the
      same
      thing
      would
      happen.
      I
      had
      one
      friend
      at
      the
      school
      from
      before,
      but
      I
      didn't
      talk
      to
      anyone
      else.
      I
      was
      invisible
      and
      to
      me
      that
      was
      better
      than
      knowing
      I
      was
      being
      ridiculed.
      Rinse
      and
      repeat
      every
      year
      and
      now
      it's
      so
      bad
      I
      can't
      talk
      half
      the
      time
      I'm
      supposed
      to.

      This

      to
      me
      a

      too,
      because
      one
      little

      triggers

      I'm
      the
      opposite,
      I'm
      terrified
      of
      not
      knowing
      that
      I'm
      dying.
      Even
      if
      I
      can't
      do
      anything
      I'd
      rather
      just
      know.
      I
      had
      a
      period
      of
      a
      few
      months
      once
      where
      I
      barely
      slept
      because
      whenever
      I
      would
      start
      getting
      tired
      I'd
      start
      thinking,
      "This
      could
      be
      the
      last
      time
      I
      go
      to
      sleep."
      Not
      in
      a
      hurry
      to
      relive
      that
      (though
      I
      guess
      it'll
      be
      a
      while
      hopefully
      lol)
      I'd
      rather
      go
      the
      assisted
      suicide
      way
      -
      then
      I'd
      know
      beforehand
      AND
      not
      be
      lucid
      when
      that
      happens.

      I
      have
      social
      anxiety.
      Talking
      to
      people,
      asking
      strangers
      brief
      questions,
      ordering

      I

      ask
      someone
      to
      send
      it
      for
      me
      (I
      write
      them
      out
      and
      have
      someone
      else
      press
      the
      send
      button
      because
      I
      can't
      do
      it)

      I
      was
      fourteen
      and
      in
      the
      library
      reading
      when
      this
      college-age
      guy
      came
      up
      to
      me
      and
      started
      talking
      to
      me.
      (I'm
      short
      and
      look
      for
      my
      age,
      so
      he
      wouldn't
      have
      thought
      I
      was
      even
      in
      high
      school.)
      Anyways,
      he
      ended
      up
      asking
      for
      my
      shoe
      size,
      and
      puzzled,
      I
      replied.
      He
      asked
      if
      I
      could
      double-check,
      so
      I
      took
      my
      shoe
      off
      and
      I
      did,
      and
      while
      it
      was
      off
      he
      picked
      up
      my
      foot
      and
      started
      feeling
      it,
      talking
      about
      how
      he
      was
      an
      artist
      and
      needed
      to
      know
      for
      an
      art
      project.
      I
      was
      pretty
      naive
      and
      unassertive
      at
      the
      time
      so
      let
      this
      go
      on
      for
      about
      a
      minute
      growing
      increasingly
      uncomfortable
      and
      creeped
      out.
      And
      then
      I
      looked
      at
      his
      face,
      and
      he
      looked
      really
      excited.
      Pulled
      my
      foot
      from
      his
      grasp,
      put
      my
      shoe
      back
      on
      and
      ran
      off
      after
      that.
      It
      was
      really
      fucking
      weird.

      Always.
      Doesn't
      help
      that
      I've
      had
      a
      great
      childhood
      and
      supportive
      family,
      it
      only
      makes
      me
      feel
      worse
      because
      I
      should
      be
      glad
      my
      life
      is
      so
      great.
      I
      always
      feel
      like
      I'm
      pretending
      to
      be
      depressed
      so
      I
      can
      continue
      being
      lazy.
      Frankly,
      it's
      ridiculous.
      But
      if
      I
      was
      really
      just
      lazy
      and
      not
      depressed,
      I
      wouldn't
      feel
      so
      guilty
      about
      it,
      I'd
      be
      happy
      about
      all
      my
      free
      time
      and
      put
      it
      to
      use
      instead
      of
      not
      wanting
      to
      do
      anything.
      I'd
      play
      video
      games
      all
      day
      instead
      of
      feeling
      too
      awful
      to
      even
      enjoy
      video
      games.
      I
      wouldn't
      think
      about
      dying
      all
      the
      time.
      I
      wouldn't
      feel
      like
      I
      was
      a
      piece
      of
      shit
      for
      going
      to
      therapy
      and
      wasting
      people's
      time.
      I'd
      be
      elated
      about
      pulling
      off
      a
      deception,
      but
      I'm
      not.
      So.
      I
      guess
      that's
      how
      I
      try
      to
      convince
      myself.
      Still.
      It's
      irrational
      but
      I
      guess
      that's
      the
      nature
      of
      the
      illness.
