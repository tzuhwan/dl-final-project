      They #8217;re
      not
      useful
      enough
      to
      justify
      having,
      like
      couldn #8217;t
      hands
      just
      be
      attached
      without
      arms
      and
      we
      lean
      a
      bit
      further
      to
      use
      them?
      Having
      arms
      is
      so
      awkward
      because
      you
      never
      know
      where
      to
      put
      them,
      especially
      when
      walking.
      Everyone
      seems
      to
      be
      able
      to
      naturally
      swing
      their
      arms
      when
      they
      walk
      but
      I #8217;m
      never
      relaxed
      enough
      to
      do
      that
      so
      I
      have
      to
      concentrate
      to
      walk
      in
      a
      normal
      way.
      I
      just
      wish
      humans
      were
      born
      with
      something
      different
      that
      does
      the
      same
      thing.

      Yeah,
      I
      can
      watch
      tv
      shows
      all
      day

      watching
      a

      feels
      like
      such
      a
      commitment.
      And
      if
      I
      do
      decide
      to
      watch
      one
      I
      end
      up
      spending
      more
      time
      trying
      to
      decide
      which
      than
      it
      would
      take
      to
      watch
      it.

      so
      the
      other
      day
      I
      was
      getting
      some
      more
      razor
      blades
      and
      I
      always
      buy
      other
      shit
      I
      don #8217;t
      need
      so
      the
      self
      checkout
      supervising
      person
      doesn #8217;t
      look
      at
      me
      weird,
      so
      I
      tried
      to
      grab
      some
      orange
      tic
      tacs
      but
      I
      accidentally
      got
      peppermint
      ones
      and
      didn #8217;t
      realise
      until
      I
      had
      already
      taken
      a
      few
      steps
      away.
      If
      I
      had
      gone
      back
      and
      swapped
      them
      at
      that
      point
      the
      whole
      shop
      would
      think
      I #8217;m
      really
      weird
      (actually
      there
      was
      only
      1
      person
      nearby
      who
      likely
      wouldn #8217;t
      notice
      but
      I
      have
      social
      anxiety
      lmao)
      so
      I
      had
      no
      choice
      but
      to
      buy
      them
      And
      now
      I #8217;m
      eating
      them
      so
      that
      it #8217;s
      not
      a
      waste
      of
      money
      but
      they #8217;re
      so
      bad
      why
      do
      they
      even

      silently.
      I

      when
      I
      get
      home,
      never
      at

      way
      when

      was
      upset.
      When
      I
      was
      much
      younger,
      I
      would
      bang
      my
      head
      against
      a
      wall
      or
      punch
      myself,
      and
      when
      I
      was
      12
      I
      started
      cutting
      (just
      tiny
      scratches
      with
      scissors
      at
      first,
      and
      then
      with
      razor
      blades
      after
      a
      few
      months).
