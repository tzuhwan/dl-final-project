      Longtime
      reddit
      lurker,
      recently
      made
      an
      account
      so
      I
      could
      join
      this
      group.
      Without
      going
      into
      anything
      too
      personal,
      I'm
      at
      a
      place
      in
      my
      life
      right
      now
      where
      I've
      become
      trapped
      in
      an
      emotionally
      abusive
      situation,
      and
      Breaking
      Benjamin's
      music
      has
      been
      my
      peace
      from
      that.
      I've
      been
      a
      fan
      since
      I
      first
      heard
      "So
      Cold"
      on
      the
      radio,
      so
      going
      on
      15
      years
      or
      so
      now,
      but
      with
      my
      recent
      life
      events
      I've
      found
      myself
      relating
      to
      more
      and
      more
      of
      their
      songs;
      tracks
      that
      never
      jumped
      out
      at
      me
      before
      are
      coming
      back
      to
      me
      like
      old
      friends,
      providing
      much-needed
      comfort.
      Lately
      I've
      been
      playing
      BB's
      entire
      discography
      like
      a
      security
      blanket.
      My
      escape
      from
      the
      world.
      I
      dunno
      if
      Ben
      ever
      looks
      at
      reddit,
      but
      if
      he
      does,
      I
      hope
      he
      knows
      what
      a
      difference
      his
      music
      has
      made
      in
      my
      life,
      and
      in
      the
      lives
      of
      so
      many
      others.
      I'm
      truly
      proud
      to
      call
      myself
      a
      fan
      of
      this
      band.

      "Breath"
      is
      a
      pretty
      good
      description
      of
      how
      I
      feel.
      The
      lyrics
      in
      "Water"
      really
      resonate
      with
      me
      because
      it's
      like
      listening
      to
      a
      song
      about
      the
      way
      the
      guy
      talks
      to
      me.
      I'm
      also
      finding
      a
      lot
      of
      comfort
      in
      "Hollow",
      "Crawl",
      and
      "The
      Diary
      of
      Jane".
      But
      really,
      anything
      by
      them
      is
      a
      comfort.

      Beautiful
      tattoo!
      Thinking
      of
      getting
      one
      on
      my
      left
      arm.
      Just
      don't

      to
      ruin
      it
      at
      work.

      I
      would
      switch
      Ember
      and
      Dear

      but

      where

      Thank
      you,
      but
      I
      already
      know
      all
      of
      Dark
      Before
      Dawn
      (and
      Ember,
      for
      that
      matter).
      Those
      are
      just
      the
      songs
      I'm
      clinging
      to
      at
      the
      moment.
      "Defeated",
      too.
      "I
      know
      what
      I
      need,
      and
      it's
      not
      you!
      It's
      not
      you!"

      Thank
      you
      for
      the
      suggestions!
      I
      don't
      know
      that
      I'm
      even
      sad,
      more
      that
      I
      feel
      powerless
      to
      resolve
      my
      situation,
      because
      the
      person
      causing
      my
      pain
      seemingly
      can't
      be
      stopped.
      I
      think
      honestly,
      listening
      to
      Ben
      yell
      and
      proclaim
      such
      powerful
      things,
      i.e.
      "I
      can't
      feel
      anything
      at
      all!"
      or
      "You
      wish
      you
      were,
      you're
      not
      my
      friend!"
      or
      "You
      greedy
      little
      bastard,
      you
      will
      get
      what
      you
      deserve!"
      ...that
      makes
      ME
      feel
      powerful
      when
      I
      sing
      along
      with
      him,
      like
      for
      that
      moment
      I
      have
      control
      over
      what
      I'm
      going
      through.
      I've
      been
      keeping
      lyrics
      in
      my
      head
      like
      shields.

      Yeah
      I

      like
      these

      the

      is
      superb.
      Pretty
      awkward
      to
      sing
      out
      loud,
      though.

      I
      am
      a
      30
      year
      old
      single
      female
      born
      and
      raised
      in
      Massachusetts.
      I
      have
      relatives
      who
      live
      in
      Maine
      a
      little
      north
      of
      Belfast
      and
      it
      has
      always
      been
      a
      dream
      of
      mine
      to
      move
      up
      there,
      someday,
      somewhere.
      I
      currently
      make
      about
      $40,000
      a
      year
      as
      a
      line
      cook
      and
      recently
      got
      pre-qualified
      for
      a
      mortgage
      up
      to
      $200,000...in
      Massachusetts.
      Where
      I
      live,
      $200,000
      gets
      you
      either
      a
      piece
      of
      land,
      a
      mobile
      home,
      or
      a
      shack
      that
      needs
      to
      be
      torn
      down...none
      of
      which
      I'm
      interested
      in.
      In
      Maine,
      you
      can
      buy
      a
      3
      bedroom
      house
      for
      that
      kind
      of
      money.
      So
      I've
      shifted
      gears
      and
      finally
      started
      seriously
      considering
      making
      my
      dream
      a
      reality.
      I'm
      autistic,
      prefer
      my
      solitude,
      and
      love
      nature.
      I
      dream
      of
      living
      comfortably
      in
      a
      modest
      home
      surrounded
      by
      trees.
      My
      worry
      is
      finding
      a
      job.
      People
      who
      live
      in
      Maine,
      where
      would
      you
      say
      is
      the
      best
      area
      for
      me
      to
      find
      year-round
      work
      as
      a
      line
      cook?
      I
      want
      to
      be
      further
      north
      than
      Portland,
      but
      no
      further
      north
      than
      Bangor.
      I
      realize
      a
      lot
      of
      restaurants
      close
      for
      the
      winter
      up
      there,
      which
      scares
      me.
      Any
      advice
      would
      be
      greatly
      appreciated
      and
      help
      put
      my
      mind
      at
      ease.

      Yeah,
      I
      recognize
      that
      a
      lot
      of
      my
      money
      comes
      from
      overtime,
      too.
      I'm
      definitely
      going
      to
      have
      to
      live
      on
      a
      tighter
      budget
      if
      I

      If
      I
      did
      do
      Portland,
      I'd
      be
      looking
      at
      the
      surrounding
      towns
      as
      far
      as
      buying
      property
      and
      then
      commute
      into
      the
      city
      for
      work.
      But
      I
      realize
      there
      is
      a
      good
      restaurant
      community
      there.

      so
      much

      I
      figured
      this,
      and
      it
      sucks
      because
      Bangor
      was
      always
      where
      I
      wanted
      to
      live
      if
      I
      moved
      up
      there.
      But
      I
      kinda
      guessed
      it
      maybe
      wouldn't
      be
      a
      great
      place
      for
      me
      to
      make
      a
      living.
      Too
      far
      north.

      Ben
      and
      the
      band
      were
      everything
      I
      expected
      them
      to
      be
      and
      more.
      I
      love
      how
      much
      Ben
      interacts
      with
      the
      crowd,
      and
      I
      love
      that
      the
      other
      band
      members
      sang
      some
      of
      the
      songs.
      The
      energy
      in
      that
      place
      was
      amazing,
      you
      could
      just
      tell
      how
      happy
      everyone
      was,
      and
      Ben
      seemed
      like
      he
      was
      having
      a
      genuinely
      great
      time.
      Maybe
      two
      thirds
      through
      he
      gave
      a
      small
      speech
      about
      how
      much
      he
      appreciates
      all
      of
      us
      for
      supporting
      them,
      and
      that
      by
      listening
      to
      their
      music
      and
      singing
      it
      back,
      we're
      letting
      them
      vent
      to
      us,
      we're
      their
      therapy.
      I
      found
      that
      to
      be
      an
      especially
      beautiful
      sentiment,
      because
      BB's
      music
      is
      definitely
      a
      form
      of
      therapy
      for
      me.
      Maybe
      it's
      sappy,
      but
      I'm
      an
      extremely
      empathetic
      person,
      so
      looking
      up
      to
      a
      musician
      who's
      not
      afraid
      to
      share
      an
      emotional
      connection
      with
      his
      fans
      is
      pretty
      ideal
      for
      me.
      Incidentally,
      Chevelle
      was
      also
      absolutely
      flawless.
      I
      had
      never
      seen
      them
      live
      before
      either,
      and
      their
      performance
      perfectly
      matched
      their
      amazing
      music.
      Watching
      them
      was
      like
      watching
      their
      music,
      as
      I
      picture
      it,
      come
      to
      life,
      which
      is
      what
      I'd
      think
      any
      artist
      would
      hope
      to
      convey
      at
      a
      show.
      If
      I
      had
      to
      choose
      two
      bands
      to
      see
      together,
      it'd
      be
      these
      two.
      I
      hope
      they
      tour
      together
      again!
      Next
      time
      I'm
      buying
      a
      VIP
      ticket
      for
      sure.
