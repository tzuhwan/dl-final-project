      This
      is
      more
      of
      a
      practical,
      "what-if"
      solution,
      but
      when
      I
      was
      completing
      my
      thesis
      it
      helped
      to
      check
      what
      avenues
      I
      could
      take
      if,
      God
      forbid,
      I
      didn't
      finish
      on
      time
      or
      feel
      good
      about
      my
      progress.
      At
      my
      institution,
      for
      example,
      if
      we
      wanted
      to
      graduate
      in
      Spring
      we
      had
      to
      have
      the
      full
      draft
      in
      by
      like
      the
      third
      week
      of
      March,
      which
      felt
      stupidly
      early
      to
      me.
      So
      I
      looked
      into
      Summer
      and
      Fall
      graduation
      deadlines
      to
      give
      myself
      an
      emergency
      escape
      hatch--this
      made
      me
      feel
      a
      lot
      less
      anxious/stressed
      about
      the
      thesis.
      If
      I
      wasn't
      where
      I
      felt
      I
      needed
      to
      be
      by
      a
      certain
      point,
      I
      could
      just
      notify
      my
      advisors
      and
      work
      toward
      the
      Summer
      deadline
      instead
      (which
      was
      early
      June,
      much
      less
      scary).
      If
      you're
      heading
      into
      a
      PhD,
      most
      programs
      will
      be
      okay
      with
      you
      "technically"
      graduating
      in
      the
      fall,
      as
      long
      as
      you've
      completed
      all
      the
      requirements.
      The
      one
      downside
      is
      you'll
      likely
      have
      to
      pay
      for
      a
      thesis
      credit
      for
      each
      semester
      you
      stay
      enrolled.

      I'm
      a
      first
      year
      PhD
      at
      the
      Grad
      Center,
      and
      I
      know
      a
      few
      people
      in
      the
      MALS
      program,
      though
      not
      in
      your
      concentration.
      If
      you
      have
      specific
      questions,
      message
      me
      and
      I
      can
      give
      you
      some
      contact
      info.
      My
      own
      two
      cents--the
      best
      thing
      you
      can
      do
      to
      improve
      your
      chances
      at
      admission
      (besides
      working
      on
      your
      writing
      samples)
      is
      to
      create
      a
      relationship
      with
      a
      faculty
      member
      you
      really
      want
      to
      work
      with
      here.
      If
      you
      don't
      have
      one
      in
      mind
      right
      now,
      look
      through
      the
      program,
      scan
      some
      faculty
      research,
      and
      reach
      out
      to
      one
      or
      two
      via
      email
      to
      introduce
      yourself
      and
      ask
      some
      well-thought-out
      questions
      about
      their
      work
      as
      it
      relates
      to
      the
      GC.
      Avoid
      straight
      up
      administrative
      questions
      though,
      those
      should
      be
      directed
      to
      pro-staff
      instead
      of
      faculty.
      Best
      of
      luck!

      I
      don't
      think
      the
      reveal
      is
      much
      better,
      but
      smarter
      people
      than
      me
      should
      be
      the
      judge
      of
      that.

      Current
      GC
      student
      here.
      A
      good
      strategy
      is
      to
      reach
      out
      to
      your
      department,
      best
      bet
      is
      to
      the
      administrative
      assistant
      that
      you
      probably
      received
      emails
      from.
      Ask
      them
      if
      there's
      anyway
      they
      can
      forward
      your
      name/info
      to
      current
      students
      that
      may
      need
      a
      roommate
      come
      August.
      If
      this
      fails,
      check
      out
      the
      many
      NYC
      housing
      groups
      on
      facebook
      like
      Gypsy
      Housing
      if
      you
      haven't
      already.
      Users
      will
      post
      vacancies
      usually
      a
      month
      or
      so
      in
      advance
      with
      a
      variety
      of
      set-ups,
      eg
      on
      the
      lease
      or
      off
      the
      lease.
      If
      you
      end
      up
      needing
      a
      new
      apartment
      next
      year,
      put
      your
      name
      into
      the
      GC
      housing
      waitlist
      in
      like
      February
      for
      better
      results.
      Good
      luck,
      and
      let
      me
      know
      if
      you
      have
      any
      more
      specific
      questions!

      I
      haven't
      listened
      to
      these
      boys
      before,
      but
      I'm
      impressed!!
      It
      feels
      like
      they're
      playing
      off
      the
      post
      Stranger
      Things/Annabelle
      hype--not
      sure
      if
      those
      franchises
      are
      big
      in
      Korea
      or
      if
      it's
      part
      of
      a
      bigger
      push
      toward
      US
      fans.
      I
      can't
      imagine
      how
      their
      company
      could
      afford
      the
      rights
      to
      sample
      the
      Ghostbusters
      melody
      though.
       #8203;
      Also
      for
      some
      reason
      I
      got
      SHINee
      Sherlock
      vibes
      from
      the
      scene
      where
      they're
      all
      sitting
      at
      the
      desk
      and
      inspecting
      their
      equipment,
      lmao.

      Bring
      paper
      and
      a
      pen/pencil,
      even
      if
      you
      want
      to
      use
      your
      computer
      to
      take
      notes.
      Some
      profs
      don't
      let
      you
      use
      devices
      in
      class,
      or
      sometimes
      they'll
      give
      in-class
      assignments
      that
      require
      you
      to
      turn
      in
      some
      writing
      that
      day.
      If
      you
      have
      labs,
      they
      might
      have
      specific
      things
      you'll
      need
      to
      bring
      in,
      but
      the
      syllabus
      should
      lay
      those
      out
      on
      day
      one.
      Also,
      some
      large
      lecture
      halls
      may
      use
      clickers,
      which
      are
      remotes
      used
      to
      answer
      multiple
      choice
      questions
      in
      class.
      Again,
      though,
      that
      requirement
      would
      be
      placed
      in
      the
      syllabus.

      Be
      prepared
      for
      the
      worst
      case
      scenario--aka
      when
      only
      a
      few
      students
      have
      even
      done
      the
      reading.
      If
      this
      happens,
      discussion
      is
      viscerally
      painful,
      if
      not
      impossible.
      Before
      big
      discussion
      classes,
      I've
      gotten
      in
      the
      habit
      of
      excerpting
      a
      few
      important
      sections
      of
      the
      reading
      and
      making
      a
      2-3
      paper
      copies
      of
      each.
      So
      as
      a
      last
      resort,
      I
      can
      choose
      to
      break
      students
      into
      groups
      with
      their
      own
      text
      to
      read,
      summarize,
      and
      discuss
      with
      the
      class,
      giving
      us
      some
      actual
      material
      to
      talk
      about.
      If
      copies
      aren't
      possible
      for
      you,
      you
      could
      also
      see
      about
      using
      a
      slide
      instead.

      The
      Saxy
      Gamer
      does
      great
      guide
      videos
      on
      different
      aspects
      of
      the
      game,
      but
      his
      playthroughs
      tend
      to
      be
      more
      rushed
      with
      less
      explanation.
      I
      also
      find
      Potato
      McWhiskey's
      full
      games
      to
      be
      really
      enjoyable
      to
      watch,
      and
      he
      does
      take
      the
      time
      to
      explain
      his
      thought
      process.
      Recently,
      he's
      started
      to
      edit
      his
      in-game
      footage
      instead
      of
      posting
      it
      uncut,
      which
      I
      appreciate.
      He
      takes
      out
      a
      lot
      of
      the
      rote
      actions
      and
      unexciting
      turns
      so
      the
      game
      feels
      much
      smoother.

      I
      currently
      have
      a
      Surface
      Pro
      4--it
      mostly
      works
      fine,
      but
      a

      screen
      and

      battery
      life
      are
      starting
      to

      Before
      I
      upgrade,
      though,
      I
      was
      wondering
      whether
      the
      6
      is
      up
      for
      a
      price-cut
      any

      soon
      due
      to
      the
      7
      looming
      overhead.
      Any
      insight,
      friends?

      I
      first
      started
      watching
      it
      for
      the
      cringe
      but
      it's
      becoming
      a
      sort
      of
      quality
      app
      (minus
      the
      fuck
      boys
      ofc)

      I
      implemented
      a
      late
      pass
      system
      this
      semester.
      Each
      student
      gets
      two
      passes
      that
      can
      be
      used
      on
      any
      assignment
      (not
      tests
      or
      quizzes,
      obv).
      One
      pass=48
      more
      hours,
      and
      they
      can
      choose
      to
      use
      them
      both
      to
      get
      96
      more
      hours.
      Almost
      halfway
      through
      the
      semester
      and
      I've
      only
      had
      six
      students
      out
      of
      thirty
      use
      a
      pass.
      Also,
      it's
      saved
      me
      from
      their
      excuses
      because
      the
      passes
      are
      unconditional.
      We'll
      see
      how
      it
      pans
      out
      closer
      to
      December,
      though.
