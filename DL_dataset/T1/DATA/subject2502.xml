      Getting
      treated
      badly
      by
      a
      customer
      in
      retail.
      I
      work
      at
      a
      grocery
      store
      and
      you
      know
      most
      people
      tell
      you
      to
      brush
      it
      off
      when
      a
      customer
      is
      rude.
      But
      it
      can
      be
      so
      damn
      frustrating,
      especially
      knowing
      there's
      nothing
      you
      can
      do
      about
      it
      and
      when
      it's
      multiple
      people
      being
      dicks
      a
      shift.
      Such
      a
      a
      trivial
      thing
      but
      don't
      be
      ass
      hats
      to
      retail
      workers
      folks.

      Wondering
      if
      anyone
      knows
      the
      answer-
      doing
      an
      assignment
      and
      it
      only
      specifies
      that
      the
      word
      count
      is
      2000
      words,
      wondering
      if
      the
      +/-
      10%
      word
      count
      is
      universal
      at

      idk

      know
      to

      of
      "everyone

      I've
      never
      had
      anything
      close
      to
      a
      romantic
      relationship.
      To
      my
      knowledge,
      no
      one
      has
      ever
      had
      a
      thing
      for
      me
      and
      I
      just
      UGH,
      idk
      what
      to
      do,
      it's
      a
      weird/frustrating
      situation.

      aww
      (also
      thank
      you

      2.
      Honestly,
      I
      gave
      dating
      apps
      a
      try
      and
      they
      led
      to
      some
      fun
      conversations
      but
      for
      me
      personally
      I
      wasn't
      a
      massive
      fan,
      but
      who
      knows
      maybe
      I'll
      change
      my
      mind!

      Okay
      so
      maybe
      crisis
      is
      the
      wrong
      word
      BUT
      it's
      something
      that's
      been
      on
      my
      mind
      for
      a
      long
      time
      and
      keeps
      getting
      worse.
      So
      I'm
      F18
      and
      in
      uni,
      I
      feel
      so
      incredibly
      inexperienced
      and
      out
      of
      place,
      I've
      never
      been
      in
      love
      with
      someone
      and
      only
      really
      had
      base
      level
      attraction
      to
      people,
      I've
      never
      even
      kissed
      anyone.
      I
      know
      that
      there
      is
      too
      much
      pressure
      on
      people
      to
      have
      certain
      things
      done
      by
      a
      certain
      age
      but
      that
      doesn't
      erase
      the
      fact
      that
      I
      feel
      so
      behind.
      I
      don't
      know
      what
      to
      do,
      while
      to
      my
      knowledge
      I've
      never
      had
      anyone
      seriously
      attracted
      to
      me
      anytime
      the
      opportunity
      arises
      (e.g.
      at
      a
      club
      or
      whatever)
      I
      go
      into
      self
      sabotage
      mode
      and
      shut
      myself
      down.
      I
      don't
      know
      what
      to
      do,
      I
      don't
      want
      my
      first
      times
      to
      be
      a
      big
      deal
      at
      all
      but
      I
      feel
      like
      the
      older
      I
      get
      the
      bigger
      of
      a

      Crossways
      is
      great,
      Wonderbao
      which
      is
      just
      behind
      building
      80,
      honestly
      there
      are
      so
      many
      places
      that
      do
      lunch
      specials,
      most
      ramen
      places
      you
      can
      get
      a
      standard
      porkbelly
      ramen
      for
      around
      $13.
      Would
      recommend
      just
      giving
      it
      a
      quick
      google
      search
      then
      you
      can
      check
      out
      the

      Thoughts
      on
      the
      movie?
      I
      know
      it's
      old
      but
      like
      I
      really
      hated
      it,
      I
      don't
      understand
      the
      hype
      and
      the
      representation
      in
      the
      portrayal
      of
      the
      gay
      relationships
      in
      my
      opinion
      was
      horrible.
      Also
      after
      hearing
      about
      the
      shady
      stuff
      on
      set
      it
      doesn't
      sit
      well

      You
      can
      definitely
      be
      bi
      without
      experiencing
      same
      sex
      crushes-
      maybe
      you
      just
      haven
      found
      the
      right
      person
      yet.
      There's
      absolutely
      no
      set
      time
      on
      when
      you'll
      experience
      any
      of
      these
      things,
      it's
      great
      to
      question,
      explore
      and
      learn
      more
      about
      yourself
      and
      your
      sexuality
      but
      I
      wouldn't
      stress
      about
      finding
      a
      definitive
      answer.

      but
      you're

      blood
      not

      you

      "risky"
      sexual
      intercourse
      including
      unprotected
      sex
      altogether.
      All
      of

      prevent
      risk

      I'm
      sure
      they
      do
      but
      idk
      about
      everywhere
      else
      but
      blood
      donation
      is
      primarily
      run
      by
      non
      for
      profits
      like
      the
      red
      cross
      here,
      the
      actual
      collection
      of
      the
      blood
      takes
      a
      lot
      of
      time
      and
      resources
      not
      to
      mention
      the
      testing
      and
      distribution.
      While
      they
      obviously
      get
      paid
      for
      the
      blood,
      having
      people
      who
      participate
      in
      at
      risk
      sexual
      intercourse
      abstain
      from
      giving
      blood
      in
      the
      first
      place
      would
      prevent
      them
      from
      gathering
      the
      blood
      and
      using
      all
      those
      resources
      and
      then
      having
      to
      dispose
      of
      it
      because
      it's
      contaminated,
      which
      it
      would
      be
      at
      a
      much
      higher
      rate
      for
      those
      who
      participate
      in
      such
      activity.
      This
      is
      all
      what
      I'm
      assuming
      fyi
      I'm
      not
      well
      versed
      in
      the
      research
      and
      stuff.
      Believe
      me,
      blood
      banks
      are
      desperate
      as
      hell
      to
      get
      people's
      blood,
      the
      supply
      and
      demand
      is
      so
      out
      of
      balance,
      they
      would
      not
      write
      off
      a
      whole
      group
      of
      people
      if
      it
      wasn't
      absolutely
      necessary.

      I

      the
      facts
      are
      that
      specifically
      gay

      at

      They're
      literally
      trying
      to
      protect
      people's
      lives,
      especially
      because
      the
      people
      receiving
      these
      donations
      are
      already
      ill,
      they're
      not

      risk
      that
      because
      it's
      upsetting
      to
      some
      people.
      I
      understand
      that
      this
      sucks
      for
      a
      lot
      of
      people,
      I
      really
      really
      do,
      but
      the
      reality
      is
      experts
      and
      professionals
      have
      undertaken
      extensive
      research
      and
      found
      that
      it
      is
      a
      necessary
      step
      to
      protect
      people's
      health.
      It's
      not
      about
      prejudice
      it's
      about
      minimizing
      risk
      factors
      as
      much
      as
      possible.

      So
      doubt
      this
      is
      the
      right
      place,
      but
      basically
      I'm
      getting
      tutored
      Mandarin
      by
      a
      girl
      for
      free.
      She's
      Chinese
      and
      I
      wanted
      to
      get
      her
      a
      small
      thank
      you
      gift
      I
      was
      just
      wondering
      if
      anyone
      had
      any
      ideas,
      I
      could
      obvs
      get
      her
      standard
      chocolate
      or
      a
      sephora
      gift
      card
      or
      whatever
      but
      I
      was
      just
      wondering
      if
      there's
      any
      thing
      that
      would
      be
      nice
      for
      someone
      living
      away
      from
      home?
      Hmu
      with
      all
      your
      thoughts

      Why
      does
      everyone
      on
      Reddit
      assume

      else

      I'm
      sure
      I'll
      be
      down-voted
      into
      the
      depths
      of
      hell
      for
      this
      post
      but
      never
      the
      less
      (or
      just
      no
      one
      will
      give
      af
      oh
      well):
      As
      a
      university
      student
      and
      young
      person
      who
      is
      concerned
      for
      the
      future
      health
      of
      our
      planet
      I
      am
      just
      as
      concerned
      and
      empathetic
      to
      the
      cause
      of
      climate
      change
      as
      many
      of
      you.
      Our
      time
      on
      this
      planet
      is
      precious
      and
      it
      is
      vital
      that
      we
      leave
      it
      in
      a
      better
      condition
      then
      how
      we
      found
      it.
      The
      last
      three
      generations
      in
      particular
      have
      been
      instrumental
      in
      the
      change
      and
      destruction
      of
      many
      of
      our
      earth's
      precious
      resources
      as
      a
      result
      of
      things
      like
      globalisation
      and
      the
      rise
      of
      massive
      corporation.
      However,
      punishing
      the
      people
      going
      about
      their
      daily
      lives
      as
      you
      have
      been
      doing
      in
      Melbourne
      is
      not
      the
      way
      to
      go
      about
      making
      people
      listen
      to
      you.
      Every
      time
      you
      pull
      things
      like
      this
      you
      diminish
      your
      credibility
      and
      turn
      away
      those
      who
      can
      make
      a
      difference-
      the
      general
      people.
      Not
      only
      is
      this
      a
      poor
      political
      strategy
      but
      it
      takes
      away
      the
      work
      that
      those
      who
      are
      *constructively*
      trying
      to
      make
      change
      do.
      While
      each
      individual
      impacts
      our
      planet
      and
      has
      the
      ability
      to
      make
      change
      it
      is
      ultimately
      out
      of
      the
      general
      populations
      hands
      until
      it
      comes
      to
      election
      time-
      by
      which
      if
      you
      keep
      going
      at
      the
      rate
      you
      do,
      you
      will
      have
      turned
      away
      the
      people
      who
      matter.
      Rally
      big
      business

      your

      Personally,
      I
      think
      it
      boosts
      sympathy
      to
      the
      Liberal
      party
      they
      will
      go
      "Oh
      No
      look
      at
      all
      these
      radical
      greenies
      disrupting
      your
      lives
      blah
      blah
      blah
      they
      dont
      care
      about
      you
      OR
      the
      planet
      they
      just
      want
      attention".
      I
      think
      it's
      really
      important
      not
      to
      ignore
      the
      general
      public,
      it's
      (partially)
      someone
      like
      Trump
      won
      his
      election,
      he
      took
      advantage
      of
      what
      the
      left
      overlooked

      Look
      I
      think
      protests
      are
      a
      fundamental
      part
      of
      democracy
      they
      show
      that
      the
      people
      want
      change-
      which
      I
      would
      argue
      things
      like
      the
      School
      Strike
      4
      Climate
      successfully
      showed,
      it
      was
      a
      big
      movement
      and
      a
      great
      way
      to
      show
      the
      people
      want
      change.
      It's
      really
      great
      that
      in
      the
      case
      of
      Littleproud
      he
      was
      able
      to
      gain
      a
      new
      perspective.
      But
      what
      they
      are
      doing
      today/
      yesterday
      is
      only
      pissing
      off
      people
      to
      the
      point
      where
      they
      won't
      listen
      out
      of
      spite

      of
      view
      but
      I
      just
      think
      given
      the
      state
      of
      Australian
      politics
      at
      the
      moment
      it's
      the
      wrong
      angle
      to
      take,
      and
      who
      knows
      I
      could
      be
      proven
      completely
      wrong
      in
      a
      month
      or
      5
      years
      but
      yeah
      it's
      just
      my
      point
      of
