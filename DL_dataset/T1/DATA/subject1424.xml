      long

      can
      be

      have

      it
      to

      suggestions
      to
      help
      me
      out

      This
      happened
      to
      my
      friend
      but
      it's
      still
      pretty
      funny.
      He
      decided
      that
      he
      hasn't
      been
      active
      enough
      and
      out
      of
      the
      blue
      he
      decides
      to
      take
      a
      run.
      As
      he
      is
      finishing
      up
      the
      run
      and
      on
      the
      home
      stretch,
      a
      husky
      starts
      chasing
      him.
      As
      he
      is
      running
      the
      dog
      bites
      him
      in
      the
      ass
      and
      holds
      on
      for
      a
      couple
      seconds.
      When
      my
      friend
      got
      home
      he
      checked
      his
      ass
      and
      there
      were
      no
      marks
      but
      then
      he
      checked
      his
      phone
      that
      was
      in
      his
      back
      pocket,
      and
      sure
      enough
      the
      top
      part
      of
      the
      phone
      was
      cracked
      from
      where
      the
      dog
      bit
      him.
      Moral
      of
      the
      story,
      don't
      go
      on
      a
      run,
      sit
      on
      the
      couch.
      TL:DR
      My
      friend
      who
      never
      really
      exercises
      went
      on
      a
      run
      out
      of
      the
      blue
      and
      gets
      bit
      in
      the
      ass
      by
      a
      dog

      We
      started
      fooling
      around
      and
      her
      ex
      called
      her
      twice
      and
      after
      the
      second
      time
      she
      started
      to
      cry.
      After
      I
      left
      the
      next
      morning(I
      spent
      the
      night)
      she
      told
      me
      to
      text
      her
      when
      I
      got
      home
      and
      once
      I
      did,
      I
      haven't
      heard
      from
      her
      since.
      What
      should
      I
      do?
      I
      don't
      know
      if
      I
      should
      contact
      her
      or
      wait

      see
      if
      she
      reaches
      out
      to
      me
      or
      just
      move
      on.
      It
      just
      sucks
      because
      I
      have
      no
      explanation

      Lighting
      specialist
      here.
      If
      neither
      are
      working
      there
      is
      a
      good
      chance
      you
      accidentally
      put
      too
      high
      of
      wattage
      bulb
      in
      and
      that
      caused
      the
      socket
      to
      blow.
      Those
      are
      in
      fact
      GU10
      bulbs
      and
      they
      come
      LED
      now
      which
      is
      definitely
      worth
      checking
      out

      Lighting
      specialist
      here
      so
      I'll
      do
      my
      best
      to
      help.
      1.
      The
      number
      after
      the
      T
      is
      the
      size
      of
      the
      bulb
      in
      diameter.
      The
      bigger
      the
      number
      the
      thicker
      the
      bulb.
      T5's
      are
      relatively
      thin.
      2.
      You
      need
      to
      measure
      the
      length
      of
      the
      ballast
      the
      bulbs
      are
      going
      to
      be
      put
      in.
      General
      ballasts
      are
      standard
      48
      inches
      but
      they
      do
      come
      in
      24
      inch
      lenghts
      as
      well.
      3.
      Do
      not
      take
      the
      starter
      out
      of
      the
      ballast.
      This
      could
      cause
      malfunctioning
      in
      the
      wiring
      and
      then
      you
      are
      stuck
      with
      a
      useless
      fixture.
      If
      it
      isn't
      lighting
      to
      begin
      with,
      it's
      time
      to
      replace
      it.
      4.
      Look
      up
      the
      company
      Feit
      electric.
      They
      make
      LED
      shop
      lights
      that
      work
      a
      lot
      better
      than
      a
      traditional
      ballast
      and
      there
      is
      no
      bulbs
      to
      worry
      about.
      Search
      part
      number
      73985
      and
      this
      should
      get
      you
      started.
      Good
      luck,
      don't
      sweat
      it
      too
      much.
      Lighting
      isn't
      that
      stressful

      lately
      Europe
      uses
      decimal

      Hey
      man.
      I
      can
      appreciate
      where
      you
      are
      coming
      from
      but
      you
      have
      to
      take
      into
      consideration
      a
      few
      things.
      1.
      These
      guys
      are
      so
      busy
      practicing
      and
      scrimming
      that
      they
      don't
      have
      much
      time
      to
      interview
      or
      interact
      with
      the
      media
      team.
      They
      are
      focused
      so
      much
      on
      achieving
      the
      top
      in
      NA
      that
      this
      show
      is
      on
      a
      back
      burner
      for
      them
      at
      most.
      2.
      First
      season
      of
      the
      series
      is
      generally
      never
      the
      strongest
      for
      any
      show...like
      ever.
      It's
      a
      series
      that
      I'm
      sure
      will
      develop
      over
      time
      and
      gain
      unique
      content
      but
      that
      takes
      time
      and....
      3....money.
      Maybe
      C9
      didn't
      want
      to
      invest
      a
      lot
      of
      money
      for
      something
      they
      weren't
      sure
      how
      it
      would
      be
      received.
      I'm
      sure
      seeing
      how
      successful
      the
      series
      is,
      we
      can
      expect
      more
      down
      the
      road.
      These
      are
      simply
      my
      opinions
      but
      I
      think
      maybe
      you
      can
      understand
      it
      from
      a
      different
      perspective.
      I
      personally
      think
      the
      series
      is
      great
      and
      find
      myself
      wanting
      the
      next
      episode
      immediately!

      the
      game
      you
      are
      thinking
      of?
      Okay
      I
      misread
      your
      comment
      haha
      but
      this
      game
      is
      pretty
      epic
      to
      watch
      nonetheless.
      Any
      more
      info
      you
      can
      remember
      other
      than
      red
      side
      and
      a
      slow
      push
      bot?

      Lately
      I've
      put
      on
      some
      unwanted
      pounds
      and
      my
      gut
      is
      starting
      to
      take
      form.
      I
      want
      to
      start
      exercising
      but
      I
      have
      no
      idea
      where
      to
      start
      and
      I
      don't
      know
      how
      viable
      it
      is
      with
      being
      a
      fan
      of
      trees.
      Any

      from
      any
      of
      you
      that
      smoke

      Man
      this
      pun
      is
      great.
      I
      thought
      it
      was
      blinded
      like
      by
      the
      light
      and
      he
      ran
      through
      blinds
      because
      of
      that.
      Then
      I
      realized
      this
      mofo
      has
      blinds
      on
      him.
      He
      is
      literally
      blinded.
      Good
      shit

      I
      wouldn't
      be
      surprised
      to
      see
      bunny
      start
      game
      1
      or
      2.
      He's
      mechanically
      strong
      and
      that
      would
      trump
      the
      fuck

      of
      yellowstar
      giving
      bot
      lane
      stronger

      They
      would
      just
      have
      to
      play
      lane
      swaps
      correctly

      The
      way
      that
      I
      see
      it
      is
      this:
      C9
      picks
      up
      Impact
      to
      replace
      Balls
      who
      most
      will
      agree
      is
      past
      his
      prime.
      With
      Impact
      in,
      C9
      would
      have
      too
      many
      import
      slots
      thus
      forcing
      Rush
      or
      Jensen
      so
      not
      be
      a
      started.
      With
      Jensen
      clearly
      the
      top
      mid
      laner
      in
      NA
      currently,
      there
      is
      no
      way
      C9
      pulls
      him.
      With
      Rush
      getting
      practice
      time
      in
      with
      the
      challenger
      team,
      this
      allows
      him
      to
      keep
      up
      with
      the
      meta
      and
      not
      lose
      his
      mechanics.
      Once
      Spring
      2017
      rolls
      around
      Rush
      can
      get
      residency
      and
      thus
      freeing
      him
      from
      foreign
      roster
      rules
      and
      will
      most
      likely
      be
      the
      starter.

      What
      are
      thoughts
      on
      the
      expected
      starting
      lineup
      of:
      Impact,
      Meteos,
      Jensen,
      Sneaky,
      and
      Bunny?
      I
      personally
      think
      that
      with
      Impact
      having
      a
      diverse
      champ
      pool
      and
      Meteos
      handling
      macro
      play
      and
      Bunny
      on
      micro/teamfights,
      this
      team
      has
      a
      lot
      of
      potential
      to
      take
      a
      top
      spot
      and
      if
      not
      win
      the
      split,
      have
      another
      solid
      run
      in
      the
      gauntlet.

      Dude.
      This
      is
      legit
      as
      fuck.
      I
      was
      waiting
      for
      your
      post
      after
      you
      asked
      about
      the
      Hai
      quote
      and
      you
      delivered.
      The
      article
      reassured
      me
      why
      I
      love
      this
      team
      and
      can't
      wait
      to
      see
      what
      this
      split
      brings.
      Well
      done!

      You
      should
      take
      the
      video
      from
      the
      other
      angle
      so
      that
      it
      is
      not
      backlit.
      That
      way
      your
      bod
      will
      show
      better
      :)

      Hey
      OP
      are
      those
      cotton
      balls
      glued
      to
      the
      lightbulb?
      If
      so
      don't
      run
      the
      lamp
      for
      excessive
      amounts
      of
      time.
      The
      heat
      from
      the
      bulb
      can
      actually
      create
      a
      fire
      hazard.

      this.
      Second
      half
      just
      started.
      We
      lost
      to
      Immortals
      at
      the
      beginning.
      After

      we
      should
      be
      able
      to
      gain
      momentum
      by
      beating
      lower
      tier
      teams.
      Season
      is
      very
      much
      still
      alive
      and
      I
      expect
      us
      to
      bounce
      back.

      What
      a
      nightmare
      that
      marriage
      would
      have
      been.
      He

      happened
      to
      him.

      to
      get
      some
      ass
      or
      drugs.
      They
      are
      both
      perfectly
      flawed
      which
      makes
      them
      both
      great
      characters
      and
      equally
      terrible
      fathers.

      I
      had
      a
      customer
      special
      order
      product
      from
      us
      that
      was
      the
      wrong
      size.
      Our
      store
      policy
      states
      that
      we
      can
      take
      returns
      but
      charge
      a
      restock
      fee
      to
      send
      back
      because
      the
      company
      charges
      us.
      This
      guy
      has
      purchased
      stuff
      from
      us
      before
      and
      has
      returned
      stuff
      and
      we
      charged
      him
      restocking.
      Well
      the
      company
      he
      recently
      purchased
      stuff
      from
      through
      us,
      approved
      an
      exchange
      for
      the
       #249;right
      size
      with
      no
      restocking.
      I
      tell
      him
      this
      and
      think
      great,
      he
      is
      happy.
      This
      guy
      has
      to
      date
      brought
      in
      over
      $6000
      worth
      of
      business.
      Well
      my
      boss
      flips
      shit
      because
      that's
      not
      what
      the
      policy
      says
      and
      it
      doesn't
      matter
      what
      the
      company
      says.
      Here
      I
      am
      thinking,
      wow,
      this
      guy
      has
      brought
      us
      good
      business
      and
      probably
      continue
      to
      do
      so
      especially
      since
      we
      aren't
      going
      to
      charge
      him.
      This
      is
      where
      I
      want
      to
      know
      what
      others
      think.
      Was
      I
      right
      in
      not
      charging
      restocking
      and
      making
      a
      large
      purchaser
      happy,
      or
      should
      I
      have
      charged
      him
      restock
      even
      though
      we
      aren't
      being
      charged,
      potentially
      piss
      him
      off
      and
      lose
      his
      business,
      as
      well
      as
      him
      bad
      mouthing
      the
      company?
      The
      total
      amount
      was
      for
      $266
      and
      restocking
      is
      generally
      25%
      TLDR:
      I
      didn't
      charge
      I
      valuable
      customer
      a
      restock
      fee
      against
      our
      store
      policy
      only
      because
      we
      weren't
      being
      charged
      by
      the
      company.
      My
      boss
      however
      still
      wants
      to
      charge
      him
      even
      though
      he
      has
      brought
      over
      $6000
      worth
      of
      business
      to
      us.
      Edit:
      my
      boss
      wants
      to
      charge
      him
      because
      of
      the
      time
      and
      labor
      expensed
      to
      do
      this
      for
      him.
      I
      sent
      one
      email
      and
      made
      one
      phone
      call,
      all
      of
      which
      took
      about
      15
      minutes.

      Hey
      mate!
      The
      trick
      is
      to
      have
      the
      excitement
      higher
      than
      the
      fear.
      Usually
      you
      want
      an
      average
      of
      5-8
      fear
      and
      6+
      excitement.
      Your
      fear
      is
      way
      too
      high.
      Check
      to
      see
      if
      you
      have
      any
      tight
      turns.
      Watch
      the
      ratings
      during
      the
      test
      run
      so
      that
      you
      know
      where
      the
      fear
      is
      high
      and
      you
      can
      change
      that
      section.
      It's
      a
      lot
      of
      trial
      and
      error
      but
      super
      rewarding.
      Cheers!

      Actually
      the
      reason
      it
      says
      that
      is
      because
      they

      selling
      it
      at
      below
      cost

      get
      the
      price.

      I
      really
      didn't
      want
      the
      relationship
      to
      end
      even
      though
      it's
      only
      been
      a
      month,
      but
      it
      was
      hard
      not
      communicating
      and
      she
      said
      she
      didn't
      want
      to
      put
      me
      through
      it.
      I
      don't
      know
      if
      it's
      worth
      fighting
      for
      or
      to
      just
      move
      on.
      TLDR:
      My
      ex
      stopped
      talking
      to
      me
      because
      she
      is
      very
      depressed
      and
      thinks
      breaking
      up
      is
      better
      so
      she
      doesn't
      drag
      me
      through
      it,
      but
      I
      don't
      know
      if
      I
      want
      to
      give
      up
      on
      the
      relationship.

      more
      prevalent
      of
      the

      The

      I
      feel
      much
      more
      invested
      in
      wanting
      to
      be
      a
      couple
      but
      she
      isn't
      ready
      for
      a
      relationship.
      I'm
      afraid
      that
      if
      I
      act
      too
      boyfriend
      like,
      it
      might
      scare
      her
      off,
      but
      I
      also
      don't
      want
      to
      continue
      going
      along
      with
      it
      forever
      until
      she
      feels
      comfortable
      for
      a
      relationship.
      I
      know
      she
      really
      likes
      me
      but
      her
      last
      relationship
      makes
      her
      super
      hesitant
      to
      go
      into
      anything.
      How
      do
      I
      decide
      how
      long
      it's
      worth

      my

      The
      truth
      is
      they
      haven't
      transferred
      because
      I
      haven't
      taken
      the
      classes.
      I've
      led
      my
      Mom
      to
      believe
      that
      I've
      taken
      them,
      and
      now
      my
      lies
      have
      led
      up
      to
      being
      totally
      done
      with
      the
      credits
      and
      should
      get
      my
      degree.
      But
      when
      I
      told
      her
      one
      of
      the
      classes
      didn't
      count
      because
      it
      wasn't
      taken
      at
      the
      right
      college,
      she
      called
      and
      found
      out
      I
      still
      have
      15
      credits
      left
      (which
      I
      do)
      but
      thinks
      they
      just
      haven't
      transferred
      them
      correctly.
      I
      don't
      know
      how
      to
      approach
      this
      because
      she
      wants
      answers
      and
      will
      dig
      deeper
      with
      the
      college
      to
      find
      them
      if
      need
      be.
      **TL:DR**
      my
      Mom
      doesn't
      know
      I've
      been
      lying
      to
      her
      about
      finishing
      college
      credits,
      but
      called
      the
      school
      and
      they
      told
      her
      I
      have
      15
      left,
      and
      now
      I
      don't
      know
      how
      to
      approach
      the
      situation.

      Hello
      friends.
      To
      clarify,
      she
      helped
      pay
      for
      my
      college
      on
      top
      of
      student
      loans.
      I
      gave
      her
      permission
      because
      she
      wouldn't
      co-sign
      the
      loans
      without
      that
      permission.
      In
      terms
      of
      the
      15
      credits
      left,
      I
      would
      be
      paying
      for
      those
      by
      myself.

      Disclaimer
      :
      I
      am
      emotional
      and
      paranoid
      when
      it
      comes
      to
      relationships.
      i.e.
      I
      get
      worried
      when
      I
      feel
      like
      the
      girl
      isn't
      being
      completely
      honest
      or
      just
      not
      giving
      me
      the
      answer
      that
      is
      really
      on
      her
      mind.
      I
      have
      been
      seeing
      this
      girl
      for
      a
      little
      over
      a
      month
      and
      I
      feel
      more
      invested.
      I
      pay
      for
      everything
      date
      wise.
      She
      says
      she
      likes
      me
      but
      doesn't
      want
      to
      put
      a
      label
      on
      it
      because
      her
      last
      relationship
      messed
      her
      up.
      She
      doesn't
      text
      me
      very
      often
      throughout
      the
      day
      and
      practically
      never
      when
      she
      is
      with
      friends.
      I
      feel
      like
      I
      initiate
      the
      texting
      most
      of
      the
      time.
      I
      don't
      know
      how
      to
      gauge
      why
      she
      wouldn't
      even
      send
      a
      message
      saying
      what
      she
      is
      up
      to.
      I
      really
      like
      her
      a
      lot
      I
      just
      don't
      know
      how
      to
      work
      around
      the
      communication
      issue.
      **TLDR**
      having
      communication
      concerns
      with
      a
      girl
      I've
      been
      seeing
      for
      a
      month
      which
      is
      leading
      me
      to
      believe
      I'm
      the
      only
      one
      invested.

      The
      first
      month
      went
      great
      but
      right
      before
      I
      left
      for
      vacation
      where
      I
      would
      have
      no
      contact
      with
      her
      for
      a
      week,
      things
      seemed
      to
      get
      weird.
      She
      started
      talking
      to
      me
      what
      felt
      more
      like
      a
      friend
      than
      anything.
      We
      are
      not
      officially
      together
      and
      I
      know
      she
      just
      updated
      her
      online
      dating
      profile
      pic
      (I
      don't
      think
      she
      knows
      that)
      so
      it
      seems
      like
      she
      may
      have
      moved
      on?
      How
      do
      I
      approach
      her
      how
      I'm
      feeling
      or
      do
      I
      just
      stop
      talking
      with
      her
      altogether.
      I
      have
      feelings
      for
      her
      but
      I
      don't
      know
      where
      hers
      lie.
      **TLDR**
      girl
      I
      have
      been
      casually
      seeing
      has
      gotten
      weird
      through
      texting
      and
      I
      don't
      know
      how
      to
      bring
      it
      up
      or
      just
      move
      on?
      Edit:
      I
      got
      back
      early
      from
      vacation
      and
      was
      hoping
      she
      would
      have
      texted
      me
      just
      to
      be
      cute
      or
      show
      some
      interest
      (which
      she
      didn't)
      so
      I
      texted
      her
      and
      it
      was
      the
      most
      generic
      text
      back
      from
      her
      or
      at
      least
      I
      think
      so.

      So

      you
      have

      you

      about

      Ask
      him
      this

      and
      if
      you

      We
      have
      only
      been
      seeing
      each
      other
      for
      a
      little
      over
      a
      month
      and
      she
      doesn't
      want
      to
      put
      a
      label
      on
      anything
      because
      of
      recently
      getting
      out
      of
      a
      long
      term
      relationship.
      However,
      we
      both
      have
      expressed
      how
      much
      we
      really
      like
      each
      other.
      Anyway,
      I
      left
      for
      vacation
      a
      week
      ago
      and
      live
      in
      the
      States
      went
      to
      Canada
      where
      I
      would
      have
      no
      cell
      service
      or
      WiFi.
      The
      day
      I
      left
      I
      texted
      her
      a
      usual
      cute
      message
      with
      'babe'
      and
      such
      and
      she
      responds
      back
      'hey
      OP
      I'll
      miss
      ya'
      and
      it
      felt
      weird.
      Fast
      forward
      to
      today
      when
      I
      get
      back
      in
      the
      States
      I
      text
      her
      (since
      she
      didn't
      text
      me
      anything
      while
      I
      was
      away)
      and
      say
      Hi
      and
      that
      I
      missed
      her
      and
      all
      she
      said
      was
      'Hey
      OP
      hope
      you
      had
      a
      good
      vaca'
      and
      it
      just
      feels
      like
      she
      doesn't
      care?
      We
      are
      supposed
      to
      hang
      out
      Sunday
      but
      my
      question
      is,
      should
      I
      just
      not
      text
      her
      until
      then
      and
      bring
      it
      up
      when
      we
      meet
      or
      should
      I
      just
      ask
      her
      through
      a
      text
      if
      something
      is
      wrong?
      I've
      told
      her
      I'm
      insecure
      in
      relationships
      because
      I
      can
      never
      tell
      if
      I'm
      upsetting
      her
      and
      I
      don't
      want
      to
      annoy
      her
      by
      asking
      that
      too
      much.
      Any
      advice?
      Also
      as
      I
      side
      note,
      we
      met
      on
      Bumble
      and
      I
      saw
      that
      she
      updated
      her
      main
      profile
      picture.
      **TLDR**
      not
      in
      a
      labeled
      relationship
      with
      a
      girl
      who
      I've
      been
      seeking
      for
      a
      month,
      and
      texting
      all
      of
      a
      sudden
      feels
      weird
      right
      before
      and
      after
      I
      left
      for
      a
      week
      vacation
      with
      no

      The
      3
      time
      world
      champions
      SKT
      are
      in
      a
      slump
      too.
      Do
      you
      really
      think
      they
      won't
      make
      worlds?
      We
      will
      get
      over
      this
      slump
      and
      be
      just
      fine.
      Fighting!!
      Edit:
      I'm
      not
      comparing
      SKT
      to
      C9,
      I'm
      comparing
      the
      fact
      that
      top
      teams
      can
      slump
      and
      bounce
      back.
      Edit
      2:
      Holy
      fuck
      some
      of
      you
      dense.

      Whenever
      you
      press
      z
      to
      look
      at
      all
      conversation,
      you
      have
      to
      manually
      click
      the
      scroll
      bar
      and
      scroll
      up.
      It
      would
      be
      so
      much
      easier
      if
      I
      could
      press
      z
      and
      use
      the
      mouse
      wheel
      to
      scroll
      up
      and
      see
      when
      my
      lane
      opponent
      flashed.
      It
      is
      inconvenient
      and
      time
      consuming
      to
      have
      to
      manually
      click.
      Plus
      I
      still
      will
      try
      the
      scroll
      wheel
      and
      just
      have
      to
      spend
      time
      zooming
      back
      out.
      If
      in
      an
      engage
      I
      want
      to
      make
      sure
      I
      can
      flash
      and
      have
      no
      response
      from
      opponent,
      I
      need
      to
      know
      quicker
      and
      my
      mind
      isn't
      focusing
      on
      the
      flash
      timer.
      It's
      focusing
      on
      how
      I
      want
      to
      play
      the
      fight.
      But
      if
      I
      can
      quickly
      scroll
      to
      see
      when
      my
      opponent
      flashed,
      this
      would
      be
      life
      saving
      and
      improve
      the
      way
      the
      game
      is
      played.
      Maybe
      I'm
      the
      only
      one
      that
      has
      this
      problem
      though?
      Is
      there
      a
      hotkey
      to
      fix
      this
      by
      chance?

      I
      feel
      like
      when
      I
      open
      up
      the
      app
      I
      will
      start
      swiping
      and
      then
      I
      hit
      a
      patch
      of
      girls
      that
      I've
      seen
      before.
      And
      this
      has
      been
      happening
      for
      a
      week
      now.
      Anyone
      else
      experience
      this?
      Also,
      completely
      different
      topic,
      but
      do
      you
      have
      to
      have
      tinder
      plus
      to
      get
      the
      notification
      how
      many
      people
      liked
      you

      So
      I
      had
      a
      similar
      procedure
      done
      when
      I
      was
      17
      but
      mine
      was
      a
      spinal
      fusion.
      Anyway,
      I
      was
      around
      5'1
      before
      the
      operation
      and
      off
      the
      operating
      table
      was
      5'4.
      So
      essentially
      yes,
      the
      spine
      gets
      straight
      right
      away.
      The
      procedure
      took
      12
      hours
      and
      I
      was
      only
      supposed
      to
      be
      in
      the
      hospital
      for
      10
      days
      but
      my
      lung
      collapsed
      from
      too
      much
      fluid
      build
      up
      and
      I
      ended
      up
      being
      there
      2
      weeks.
      They
      wake
      up
      you
      enough
      mid
      procedure
      to
      ask
      you
      to
      move
      your
      fingers
      and
      toes
      just
      to
      make
      sure
      you
      aren't
      paralyzed.
      I
      don't
      remember
      much
      from
      the
      first
      few
      days
      after
      the
      surgery
      because
      they
      have
      you
      so
      drugged
      up
      for
      the
      pain,
      but
      I
      can
      tell
      you
      I
      remember
      having
      to
      do
      physical
      therapy
      very
      early
      on
      after
      the
      surgery.
      It's
      to
      make
      sure
      you
      keep
      your
      circulation
      going.
      It
      was
      about
      a
      full
      year
      recovery
      and
      I
      can't
      do
      heavy
      lifting
      or
      physical
      sports
      but
      other
      than
      that,
      having
      this
      surgery
      was
      life
      changing.
      If
      I
      didn't
      have
      it,
      my
      spine
      would
      have
      become
      so
      crooked
      that
      it
      would
      have
      interfered
      with
      my
      organs.
      TLDR
      Had
      a
      similar
      12
      hour
      surgery
      with
      a
      full
      year
      recovery.
      My
      spine
      went
      from
      very
      crooked
      to
      almost
      straight
      after
      the
      surgery.
      They
      get
      you
      up
      and
      moving
      fairly
      soon
      to
      make
      sure
      you
      don't
      get
      blood
      clots.

      I

      just
      under
      $1600
      a

      I

      of
      which
      about
      $450
      goes
      to
      bills.
      Usually

      I
      have

      My
      friends
      want
      me
      to
      join
      their
      group
      but
      I'm
      super
      overwhelmed
      with
      all
      the
      information
      that
      I
      need
      to
      read
      to
      be
      able
      to
      understand
      how
      DnD
      is
      played.
      My
      question
      is,
      is
      there
      a
      beginners
      guide
      or
      something
      that
      I
      can
      look
      up
      that
      gives
      a
      more
      basic
      introduction
      into
      DnD?
      TLDR:
      I
      am
      really
      interested
      in
      joining
      a
      DnD
      campaign
      but
      the
      amount
      of
      beginning
      info
      needed
      overwhelms
      me
      so
      I'm
      wondering
      if
      there
      is
      a
      beginner's
      guide?

      I
      work
      in
      a
      lighting
      store
      and
      the
      reason
      this
      happened
      is
      probably
      because
      they
      didn't
      pull
      the
      wire
      taught
      through
      the
      chain
      causing
      the
      kink.
      This
      is
      bad
      for
      the
      chandelier
      because
      it
      is
      making
      it
      so
      the
      weight
      of
      the
      fixture
      is
      supported
      by
      the
      wire
      not
      chain.
      OP
      needs
      to
      fix
      this
      before
      it
      becomes
      a
      hazard
      of
      potentially
      falling.
      Edit:
      after
      looking
      at
      the
      picture
      again
      it
      also
      appears
      that
      there
      is
      too
      much
      chain
      being
      used,
      but
      that
      could
      be
      caused
      from
      the
      kink
      in
      the
      chain.

      a
      cat
      from
      a
      shelter
      on
      Saturday
      and
      have
      some
      things
      I
      wanted
      to
      mention
      and
      see
      if
      any
      other
      cat
      owners
      could
      give
      me
      encouragement
      because
      I'm
      pretty
      disheartened.
      1.
      I
      made
      the
      mistake
      of
      letting
      her
      explore
      the
      whole
      apartment
      within
      20
      minutes
      of
      getting
      her
      home
      which
      I've
      read
      you're
      supposed
      to
      keep
      them
      confined
      in
      a
      room
      for
      a
      while
      potentially
      days.
      2.
      She
      is
      eating
      and
      drinking
      water
      but
      hadn't
      gone
      to
      the
      bathroom
      until
      last
      night
      I
      walked
      into
      my
      room
      and
      she
      had
      peed
      all
      over
      my
      jeans
      and
      covered
      up
      her
      poop
      with
      them.
      I
      didn't
      get
      mad
      at
      her
      I
      just
      cleaned
      it
      up
      and
      dropped
      her
      in
      the
      littet
      box
      but
      she
      quickly
      jumped
      out.
      3.
      I
      got
      her
      two
      uncovered
      litter
      boxes
      today
      and
      put
      two
      different
      types
      of
      litter
      in
      them
      and
      put
      them
      in
      the
      bathroom.
      I'm
      just
      super
      discouraged
      that
      she
      isn't
      using
      the
      litter
      box
      yet,
      as
      the
      shelter
      said
      she
      was.
      4.
      She
      meows
      a
      lot
      as
      if
      she
      is
      in
      heat.
      Is
      this
      maybe
      because
      she
      is
      trying
      to
      tell
      me
      something
      is
      wrong?
      Thanks
      for
      any
      words
      of
      advice
      or
      encouragement!
      TL:DR
      got
      a
      new
      shelter
      cat
      which
      I
      let
      explore
      the
      whole
      apartment
      within
      20
      mins
      of
      being
      home,
      she
      has
      only
      gone
      to
      the
      bathroom
      once
      and
      it
      was
      on
      my
      clothes.
      She
      hasn't
      used
      litter
      box
      yet
      and
      she
      meows
      a
      lot.
      Edit
      1.
      Pretty
      much
      I'm
      just
      really
      worried
      about
      her.

      I
      have
      a
      cat
      that
      I
      adopted
      about
      5
      months
      ago
      and
      she
      has
      really
      grown
      on
      me.
      She
      is
      my
      first
      pet
      while
      living
      on
      my
      own
      and
      it
      brings

      joy

      take
      care
      of
      something
      that
      relies
      on
      me.
      She
      is
      super
      affectionate
      and
      playful
      but
      has
      her
      cat
      time
      too.
      It's
      a

      feeling
      waking
      up
      to
      a

      Pets
      are

      distinguish
      a
      new
      comment
      thread

      indent
      is
      on
      the
      bevel
      of

      Is
      there
      a
      way
      to
      change
      that
      so
      I
      can
      more
      easily
      tell
      when
      I
      new
      comment
      starts?

      Question

      First
      off,
      I
      don't
      know
      if
      this
      is
      the
      place
      to
      ask
      this
      but
      figured
      I'd
      try.
      I
      have
      the
      SB6183
      which
      is
      rated
      for
      download
      speeds
      of
      686Mbps
      but
      my
      internet
      provider
      of
      WowWay
      says
      that
      it
      can
      only
      download
      up
      to
      100Mbps.
      I
      currently
      pay
      for
      500Mbps
      but
      get
      just
      under
      the
      100Mbps.
      My
      question
      is,
      is
      that
      100Mbps
      max
      set
      by
      WowWay?
      Why
      would
      my
      router
      say
      it
      can
      handle
      over
      the
      500Mbps
      I'm
      paying
      for
      but
      then
      get
      nowhere
      close
      to
      it?

      Hi
      Anksohims,
      if
      you
      look
      at
      the
      compatibility
      list
      you
      linked,
      it
      shows
      the
      SB6183
      as
      up
      to
      100Mbps
      but
      the
      modem
      definitely
      is
      labeled
      as
      being
      able
      to
      get
      higher.
      So
      I'm
      thinking
      it
      must
      be
      on
      Wows
      end.
      How
      do
      they
      prevent
      the
      modem
      from
      getting
      the
      full
      download
      speed
      that
      it
      is
      capable
      of?

      Maybe
      I'm
      the
      only
      one
      here,
      but
      honestly,
      I
      don't
      like
      the
      zombies.
      I
      feel
      like
      it
      is
      a
      completely
      different
      mode
      and
      they
      interfere
      with
      the
      core
      gameplay.
      That
      is
      why
      I
      think
      having
      the
      mode
      separate
      for
      the
      Halloween
      season
      is
      better
      and
      would
      allow
      more
      players
      like
      myself
      to
      enjoy
      the
      core
      game
      as
      it
      is
      meant
      to
      be
      played.

      So
      I
      am
      color
      blind
      (protanope
      which
      is
      red/green
      deficiency)
      and
      my
      favorite
      mode
      to
      play
      is
      duo
      fills.
      When
      in
      the
      battle
      bus
      and
      starting
      over
      the
      map,
      if
      my
      teammate
      is
      red
      and
      I'm
      blue,
      and
      they
      mark
      the
      map,
      I
      can't
      find
      it
      in
      time
      to
      make
      a
      good
      jump.
      When
      I
      turned
      on
      the
      protanope
      color
      blind
      it
      changes
      the
      color
      tints
      of
      the
      guns
      but
      not
      the
      player
      marker
      colors.
      Maybe
      make
      it
      an
      option
      to
      pick
      what
      colors
      you
      and
      your
      teammate
      will
      show
      up
      as,
      or
      factor
      it
      into
      the
      color
      blind
      settings.
      **TLDR**
      I'm
      red/green
      color
      blind
      and
      have
      trouble
      seeing
      the
      red
      player
      marker
      on
      the
      map.
      Suggesting
      either
      allow
      to
      choose
      player
      marker
      color
      or
      have
      it
      built
      into
      the
      color
      blind
      settings.

      I
      will
      be
      heading
      home
      for
      the
      holidays
      and
      have
      about
      a
      4
      hour
      drive.
      This
      will
      be
      my
      first
      time
      bringing
      my
      cat
      on
      this
      trip.
      I've
      never
      driven
      her
      farther
      than
      15
      minutes
      so
      I'm
      not
      sure
      what
      to
      expect.
      Do
      I
      need
      to
      get
      a
      carrier
      different
      from
      her
      normal
      small
      one?
      Should
      I
      be
      worried
      about
      water/food
      and
      litterbox?
      What
      do
      I
      do
      if
      she
      starts
      freaking
      out
      while
      driving?
      Can
      I
      let
      her
      roam
      around?
      Once
      at
      my
      parent's
      place,
      I
      plan
      to
      keep
      her
      in
      my
      room
      for
      the
      stay.
      Should
      I
      be
      worried
      about
      her
      being
      too
      stressed
      and
      how
      can
      I
      make
      sure
      she
      is
      relaxed?
      Maybe
      I'm
      overreacting
      but
      I
      want
      to
      make
      sure
      I
      take
      proper
      actions
      before
      just
      going
      for
      it.
      I
      appreciate
      any
      advice
      and
      Happy
      Thanksgiving
      to
      all
      of
      you
      and
      your
      kitties.

      So
      today
      while
      playing
      some
      duos
      I
      learned
      that
      depending
      on
      what
      weapon
      you
      have
      equipped,
      when
      you
      request
      ammo
      from
      the
      scroll
      wheel,
      it
      will
      request
      the
      type
      of
      ammo
      for
      the
      gun
      you
      have
      equipped.

      Lately
      I've
      [M27]
      been
      coming
      across
      Facebook
      posts
      on
      my
      feed
      of
      a
      girl
      [F27]
      who
      I
      used
      to
      like
      back
      in
      the
      day.
      But
      all
      her
      posts
      I
      find
      funny
      and
      she
      seems
      just
      as
      cool
      and
      fun
      as
      from
      the
      past.
      We
      don't
      have
      a
      history
      outside
      of
      a
      basic
      high
      school
      friendship.
      So
      my
      question
      is,
      is
      it
      weird/creepy
      to
      reach
      out
      to
      her
      considering
      we
      haven't
      talked
      since
      high
      school?
      **TLDR**
      is
      it
      weird/creepy
      to
      reach
      out
      to
      a
      girl
      from
      high
      school
      that
      I
      keep
      coming
      across
      her
      Facebook
      posts
      on
      my
      timeline?

      2
      questions:
      1.
      Is
      there
      a
      subreddit
      or
      a
      place
      to
      check
      out
      that
      has
      a
      beginner's
      guide
      to
      playing.
      2.
      Is
      there
      any
      easy
      way
      to
      maneuver
      between
      your
      characters
      than
      clicking?
      I
      feel
      like
      every
      time
      I
      click
      I
      accidentally
      reposition
      the
      piece
      when
      all
      I
      really
      want
      to
      do
      is
      look
      at
      the
      piece
      attributes
      to
      see
      what
      I
      can
      combine
      to
      make
      more
      powerful

      So
      when
      I'm
      gaming
      or
      just
      at
      my
      computer
      in
      general,
      I
      sit
      most
      comfortably
      cross
      legged.
      The
      chair
      I
      currently
      have
      is
      a
      general
      office
      chair
      and
      when
      sitting
      cross
      legged
      doesn't
      have
      the
      greatest
      of
      back
      support.
      I
      was
      hoping
      for
      some
      suggestions
      for
      a
      new
      chair
      with
      good
      back
      support
      and
      if
      at
      all
      possible
      accommodates
      sitting
      across
      legged
      comfortably.

      Girls,

      bother
      matching

      someone
      if

      I
      think
      that
      is
      more
      aggravating
      than
      matching
      and
      getting
      one
      word

      date

      things

      have
      gone
      well
      and
      we
      tentatively
      set
      up
      another
      date.
      We
      texted
      a
      little
      later
      in

      day
      just

      question
      is,
      how
      should
      I
      approach
      chatting
      with
      her?
      Should
      I
      wait
      for
      her
      to
      reach
      out
      to
      me?
      I
      don't
      want
      to
      look
      desperate
      but
      I
      also
      don't
      want
      to
      look
      like
      I'm
      not
      interested.

      Why
      is
      talking
      about
      sex
      so
      taboo
      and
      frowned
      upon
      on
      Tinder,
      a
      hookup
      app
      and
      just
      in
      general?

      This
      rant
      stems
      from
      my
      recent
      experience
      on
      tinder.
      Now
      this
      app
      is
      best
      known
      for
      being
      a
      hookup
      app
      as
      most
      people
      know.
      Anyway,
      I
      get
      to
      talking
      with
      a
      couple
      of
      different
      chicks
      and
      sex
      comes
      up
      in
      discussion.
      Immediately
      the
      tone
      of
      conversation
      changes
      and
      "I'm
      not
      really
      into
      sex
      talk"
      and
      "My
      sex
      life
      is
      none
      of
      your
      business"
      I
      don't
      get
      why
      talking
      about
      sex
      is
      such
      a
      big
      deal.
      It's
      a
      natural
      thing.
      Yet
      people
      treat
      it
      like
      it
      has
      to
      be
      a
      secret
      or
      that
      it's
      too
      vulgar.

      Hey
      everyone
      I'm
      coming
      here
      to
      see
      if
      anyone
      can
      throw
      in
      their
      two
      cents
      about
      my
      situation
      so
      that
      I
      don't
      have
      to
      ponder
      this
      on
      my
      own.
      I've
      had
      my
      cat
      Domino
      for
      a
      year
      and
      a
      half
      and
      over
      the
      span
      of
      this
      time
      I
      have
      had
      her
      on
      two
      different
      topical
      flea
      medication.
      Both
      medications
      resulted
      in
      her
      having
      an
      allergic
      reaction
      where
      she
      lost
      hair
      where
      the
      medication
      was
      applied
      and
      then
      it
      would
      scab
      over
      before
      hair
      starts
      to
      grow
      back.
      I've
      only
      had
      her
      on
      the
      second
      medication
      for
      three
      months
      and
      the
      reaction
      didn't
      really
      appear
      until
      the
      last
      one
      where
      it
      is
      still
      taking
      time
      for
      the
      hair
      to
      grow
      back.
      The
      vet
      recommended
      another
      topical
      medication
      called
      bravecto.
      Anyone
      have
      experience
      with
      this
      medication?
      Domino
      is
      a
      strictly
      indoor
      cat.
      Is
      a
      monthly
      flea
      medication
      worth
      it?
      The
      only
      other
      option
      is
      a
      sort
      of
      flea
      collar
      but
      I'm
      not
      wanting
      to
      go
      that
      route
      as
      she's
      never
      worn
      a
      collar
      before.
      I'm
      thinking
      of
      going
      a
      month
      without
      the
      flea
      meds
      as
      well
      to
      see
      what
      happens.
      She
      does
      lick
      herself
      to
      the
      point
      where
      the
      hair
      is
      thinned
      out
      and
      I'm
      wondering
      if
      there
      is
      a
      connection
      between
      that
      and
      the
      flea
      meds?
      Any
      and
      all
      advice
      is
      greatly
      appreciated

      **TLDR**
      My
      strictly
      indoor
      cat
      has
      had
      allergic
      reactions
      to
      two
      flea
      meds.
      I
      do
      not
      know
      whether
      to
      try
      a
      3rd
      or
      go
      a
      month
      without.
      She
      also
      licks
      her
      hair
      thin
      in
      places
      and
      I'm
      wondering
      if
      this
      has
      to
      do
      with
      the
      medication.
