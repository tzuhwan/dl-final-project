      a
      new
      way

      get
      high.
      it
      went
      from
      inhalants,
      to
      alcohol
      and
      laughing
      gas,
      and

      relatively
      similar
      situation,
      but
      not
      with
      drugs.
      my
      parents
      havent
      found
      out
      about
      the
      drug
      use
      yet
      (
       #865; #176;
       #860; #662;
       #865; #176;)
      my
      parents
      had
      found
      out
      that
      I
      was
      cutting
      myself
      around
      5
      months
      ago.
      my
      parents
      severely
      overreacted.
      they
      tried
      to
      cut
      off
      access
      to
      my
      friends
      (they
      thought
      it
      was
      their
      fault.
      it
      wasn't
      at
      all
      .)
      and
      took
      me
      to
      the
      hospital,
      and
      searched
      my
      room
      for
      blades,
      etc.
      this
      was
      in
      the
      beginning
      of
      7th
      grade.
      i
      feel
      kinda
      the
      same
      way,
      except
      with
      cutting
      and
      not
      weed.

      idk.
      i
      went
      the
      60
      hours
      of
      sleep
      without
      any
      stimulants
      actually.
      (not
      even
      caffeine)
      so
      if
      I
      was
      getting
      to
      dangerous
      levels
      of
      sleep
      deprivation,
      my
      brain
      would
      force
      me
      to
      sleep.
      when
      your
      on
      speed,
      or
      coke,
      or
      whatever
      drug
      your
      taking
      to
      stay
      awake
      that
      long,
      it
      may
      be
      different.
      some
      studies
      show
      that
      over
      72
      hours
      without
      sleep
      can
      cause
      brain
      damage,
      so
      don't
      do
      that.
      40
      hrs
      would
      definitely
      reset
      your
      circadian
      rhythm,
      but
      thats
      not
      a
      huge
      deal.
      I
      think
      if
      you
      don't
      do
      it
      all
      the
      time,
      you'll
      be
      fine.
      (no
      more
      than
      once
      every
      2
      weeks
      or
      so)

      I
      was
      looking
      into
      a
      normal
      dose
      for
      someone
      with
      low
      tolerance,
      and
      someone
      told
      me
      to
      take
      20
      mg.
      I
      thought
      this
      was
      a
      bit
      high
      (pun
      definitely
      intended)
      so
      I
      ended
      up
      taking
      a
      starting
      dose
      of
      7.5mg.
      holy
      FUCK
      I
      am
      glad
      that
      I
      did
      that.
      I
      was
      trippin
      balls
      at
      just
      7.5mg.
      I
      was
      hallucinating
      for
      45
      mins
      to
      an
      hour
      after
      the
      comeup,
      and
      afterward
      I
      had
      a
      really
      nice
      relaxed
      and
      unwinded
      feeling
      for
      an
      hour.
      is
      this
      just
      because
      I
      have
      low
      tolerance
      and
      haven't
      done
      ambien
      before?
      idk...

      fuckin
      80's
      ish
      battle
      scene
      on
      the
      wall
      like
      it
      was
      a
      projector,
      the
      walls
      were
      breathing,
      field
      of
      view
      increasing
      and
      decreasing,
      and
      sensation
      of
      shooting
      backwards,
      tiles
      coming
      off
      the
      wall
      and
      rearranging.
      thats
      all
      I
      can
      remember,
      but
      I'm
      sure
      it
      was
      way
      more
      stuff.
      shit
      it
      was

      something
      happened
      today
      that
      made
      me
      want
      to
      fuckin
      die
      so,
      I
      was
      already
      annoyed
      at
      this
      person
      because
      she
      had
      told
      the
      school
      counselor
      about
      my
      self
      harm
      a
      couple
      weeks
      prior.
      (even
      though
      my
      parents
      already
      knew.)
      so,
      I
      was
      just
      in
      my
      ELA
      class
      talking
      to
      some
      friends,
      and
      as
      I
      was
      walking
      back
      to
      my
      desk,
      she
      tells
      me
      to
      come
      over,
      and
      I
      do.
      she
      says
      "guess
      what
      I
      stole
      from
      the
      astronomy
      teacher"
      and
      I'm
      like
      "okay
      what"
      and
      she
      shows
      me
      a
      fucking
      scalpel.
      I
      was
      a
      bit
      worried
      for
      her,
      because
      she
      is
      an
      ex-self
      harmer.
      and
      she
      says
      "it's
      okay
      I'm
      not
      gonna
      use
      it"
      but
      my
      main
      problem
      is
      that
      it
      fucking
      triggered
      me.
      bad.
      I
      was
      2
      weeks
      clean
      at
      that
      point,
      and
      I
      just
      said
      "you
      don't
      need
      to
      fucking
      show
      this
      to
      me"
      and
      go
      back
      to
      my
      desk.
      I
      ended
      up
      taking
      the
      blade
      right
      out
      of
      my
      pencil
      sharpener
      and
      relapse
      right
      there
      in
      the
      middle
      of
      class.
      at
      the
      end
      of
      class
      she
      comes
      over
      and
      says
      "is
      it
      still
      your
      sad
      boi
      hour"
      in
      a
      condescending
      voice.
      a
      minute
      later
      she
      notices
      that
      i'm
      limping
      and
      says
      "OP
      what
      did
      you
      do!"
      and
      I
      said
      point
      blank
      "I
      cut
      my
      thigh
      because
      of
      the
      scalpel
      you
      showed
      me."
      then
      she
      says
      "it's
      not
      my
      fault!
      you're
      responsible
      for
      your
      own
      feelings."
      I
      stormed
      off,
      and
      haven't
      spoke
      to
      her
      since.
      this
      person
      has
      been
      toxic
      in
      the
      past,
      and
      I'm
      considering
      dropping
      ties
      but
      we
      have
      so
      many
      mutual
      friends
      that
      it'd
      be
      tough.
      also,
      my
      crush
      is
      very
      good
      friends
      with
      her.
      I
      just
      needed
      to
      get
      this
      off
      my
      chest.
      thanks
      guys.
