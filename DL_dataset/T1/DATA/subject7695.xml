      of

      about
      money.
      Well

      I've
      moved
      from
      Romania
      to
      England
      and
      my
      social
      skills
      skyrocketed
      in
      three
      months
      time.
      English
      people
      are
      very
      outgoing
      and
      friendly
      and
      the
      fast
      peace
      environment
      in
      this
      country
      really
      helped
      me
      develop
      my
      social
      skills.
      I
      think
      you'll
      make
      the
      right
      decision.
      Good
      luck!

      Most
      of
      the
      times
      you
      feel
      unsecure
      because
      you
      have
      to
      much
      time
      to
      think.
      You
      need
      more
      activities
      in
      your
      life
      and
      your

      will
      just
      fade
      away.
      The
      more
      things
      you
      do,
      the
      more
      your
      self
      confidence
      will
      grow
      and
      you'll
      start
      discovering
      your
      self
      worth.

      Hi,
      I
      have
      about
      $4000
      invested
      in
      it.
      I
      bought
      at
      0.7
      and
      0.4
      and
      if
      it
      goes
      again
      to
      0.2
      I'll
      buy
      some
      more.
      I'm
      not
      concerned
      about
      the
      price
      going
      up
      at
      all
      because
      I
      know
      for
      sure
      that
      it
      will
      hit
      at
      least
      0.11
      again
      soon.
      Once
      it's
      listed
      on
      coinmarketcap
      and
      binance,
      people
      will
      look
      into
      it
      and
      they
      will
      start
      buying.
      Based
      on
      the
      coin
      value
      and
      the
      hype
      to
      come
      I
      see
      this
      coin
      going
      to
      .50
      before
      April.
      Keep
      your
      faith
      and
      hold
      no
      matter
      what
      until
      you
      reach
      your
      goal.
      The
      market
      will
      always
      go
      up
      and
      down,
      nothing
      to
      be
      worried
      about.
      For
      me,
      OCN
      it's
      a
      gamble
      I'm
      willing
      to
      take!

      Go
      there
      and
      have
      a
      nice
      time.
      If
      things
      turn
      sexual,
      just
      say
      that
      you'd
      rather
      not
      have
      your
      first
      time
      while
      she's
      on
      her
      period.
      Ask
      for
      a
      blowjob
      instead
      and
      promise
      her
      that
      you'll
      return
      the
      favour
      once
      she's
      finished
      with
      her
      period.
      Being
      virgin,
      you
      wouldn't
      want
      your
      first
      time
      to
      see
      blood
      while
      having
      sex,
      trust
      me.
      You'll
      probably
      remember
      that
      moment
      all
      your
      life
      and
      I
      bet
      you
      wouldn't
      want
      to
      cary
      that
      "bloody"
      image
      with
      you
      forever.
      After
      your
      first
      time,
      you
      can
      have
      sex
      at
      any
      time
      of
      the
      month
      with
      whoever,
      but
      please,
      just
      not
      first
      time.

      Stop

      every

      She
      was
      just
      being
      herself!
      Why
      don't
      you
      just
      ask
      her
      why
      was
      she
      like
      that?
      It's
      not
      weird
      to
      ask
      her
      questions
      and
      she
      might
      even
      be
      impressed
      that
      you
      noticed,

      starter.
      For
      future
      reference,
      people
      are

      Some
      scratch

      some
      blink
      very
      often
      and
      others
      do
      other
      things.
      That
      doesn't
      mean
      anything,
      they
      are
      just
      being
      themselves
      and
      if
      you
      are
      curious
      about
      something,
      always
      ask
      politely.

      I've
      ghosted
      more
      women
      than
      I
      can
      remember.
      The
      reasons
      are:
      -
      Just
      wanted
      sex
      and
      once
      I
      was
      getting
      it,
      I
      was
      out.
      Spending
      time
      or
      having
      sex
      with
      that
      woman
      again
      means
      that
      she
      will
      develop
      feelings
      and
      since
      I
      didn't
      wanted
      a
      relationship,
      I
      didn't
      wanted
      to
      hurt
      her.
      -
      I
      was
      founding
      out
      throughout
      the
      date
      or
      text
      that
      she
      is
      not
      someone
      I
      would
      want
      to
      see
      again.
      Most
      of
      the
      times
      she
      was
      saying
      something
      which
      would
      make
      me
      think
      "Jesus,
      I
      better
      get
      out
      of
      here".
      However,
      I
      would
      still
      behave
      nice
      to
      her
      until
      the
      end
      of
      the
      date,
      then
      block
      her.
      -
      I
      really
      liked
      her,
      but
      she
      was
      too
      needy.
      Texting
      or
      calling
      all
      the
      time.
      Not

      No

      when
      someone
      ends
      that
      relationship
      with
      you,
      you
      need
      to
      think
      about
      the
      bigger
      picture.
      Why
      it
      happened?
      What

      you
      learned

      or
      shall
      I
      move

      use
      that
      frustration
      towards
      something
      positive
      /

      Of
      course
      everyone
      is
      allowed
      to
      get
      annoyed
      about
      whatever
      they
      think
      it's
      annoying.
      I'm
      just
      saying
      that
      it
      is
      not
      effective
      nor
      productive.
      I
      get
      annoyed
      about
      many
      things
      daily,
      and
      I
      think
      :
      -
      Can
      I
      do
      something
      about
      that
      in
      order
      to
      change
      the
      result
      at
      the
      moment
      or
      at
      least
      for
      the
      future?
      If
      yes,
      I
      try
      and
      do
      it
      if
      it's
      worth
      it.
      If
      it's
      not
      worth
      it,
      I
      just
      let
      it
      go
      and
      move
      on
      to
      something
      more
      important.

      I've
      been
      on
      more
      than
      500
      dates
      and
      I
      can
      tell
      you
      that
      if
      I
      wasn't
      getting
      at
      least
      a
      kiss
      from
      the
      first
      date,
      I
      would
      ghost
      her.
      As
      for
      the
      second
      date...if
      there
      was
      no
      touching
      or
      some
      sort
      of
      sexual
      tension,
      I
      would
      ghost
      her.
      You
      might
      be
      a
      decent
      woman
      and
      have
      all
      my
      respect
      for
      that.
      However,
      you
      need
      to
      understand
      that
      for
      each
      woman
      who
      refuses
      sex
      or
      any
      sort
      of
      sexual
      contact,
      there
      are
      1000
      women
      ready
      to
      offer
      that.
      So
      yes,
      you
      might
      be
      really
      nice
      and
      decent,
      but
      why
      shall
      I
      lose
      my
      time
      with
      you
      when
      I
      could
      invest
      the
      same
      time
      seeing
      others
      and
      getting
      the
      wanted
      result.
      No
      matter
      if
      a
      man
      wants
      just
      sex
      or
      a
      relationship,
      I
      can
      tell
      you
      that
      he
      will
      always
      look
      for
      sexual
      attraction.
      And
      if
      there
      is
      sexual
      attraction
      but
      the
      woman
      holds
      back,
      if
      he
      is
      a
      confident
      man,
      he
      will
      always
      move
      on
      to
      someone
      who
      doesn't
      hold
      back.
      If
      I
      was
      to
      date
      you
      with
      the
      thought
      that
      I
      wanted
      just
      sex,
      spent
      all
      this
      time
      with
      you
      and
      I
      didn't
      even
      got
      a
      kiss,
      I
      would
      definitely
      had
      ghosted
      you.
      If
      I
      was
      to
      date
      you
      with
      the
      thought
      of
      wanting
      a
      relationship,
      spent
      all
      this
      time
      with
      you
      and
      I
      didn't
      even
      got
      a
      kiss...I
      would
      run
      like
      hell.
      I
      wouldn't
      want
      a
      girlfriend
      who
      is
      scared
      of
      showing
      emotions.
      I
      want
      a
      girlfriend
      who
      is
      sexualy
      confident
      and
      she's
      not
      afraid
      to
      show
      it.
      I
      want
      to
      know
      that
      she's
      open
      about
      this
      things
      and
      I
      can
      talk
      freely
      and
      do
      whatever
      things
      to
      her
      without
      her
      being
      afraid
      of
      being
      judged.
      If
      you
      haven't
      even
      kissed
      me
      at
      our
      second
      date,
      how
      can
      I
      even
      dare
      to
      expect
      sex
      anytime
      soon,
      not
      to
      mention
      that
      I
      won't
      even
      dare
      to
      think
      about
      oral,
      anal
      and
      other
      stuff.
      Always
      remember
      that
      a
      confident
      man
      is
      a
      man
      of
      options.
      For
      him,
      probably
      you
      were
      just
      a
      bad
      bet.
      I'm
      not
      saying
      to
      go
      full
      on,
      on
      the
      next
      date.
      But
      show
      more
      interest.
      Try
      and
      be
      more
      sexual,
      even
      if
      it
      means
      kissing
      him
      with
      passion.
      Let
      him
      know
      that
      there
      is
      so
      much
      more
      to
      discover.
      Make
      him
      crave
      you.
      Make
      his
      imagination
      run
      wild.
      Make
      him
      phantasize
      about
      you.
      Tease
      him.
      Show
      him
      that
      if
      he
      is
      ready
      to
      fight
      for
      you,
      you'll
      make
      his
      wildest
      dreams
      come
      true.
      I've
      dated
      a
      girl
      who
      kissed
      me
      so
      hard,
      that
      I
      wasn't
      sure
      who's
      air
      I
      was
      breathing.
      She's
      my
      girlfriend
      now.
      Hope
      it
      helps.

      billion
      people
      are
      fighting
      one
      way
      or
      another
      to
      survive
      and
      you're
      thinking
      to
      kill
      yourself?
      You're
      a
      disgrace
      just
      for
      thinking
      about
      it.
      You're
      ungrateful
      for
      something
      which
      was
      given
      to
      you
      for
      free
      and
      which
      is
      the
      most
      precious
      thing
      ever
      -
      life.
      Get
      your
      lazy
      ass
      of
      the
      bed,
      put
      your
      bones
      in
      motion
      and
      go
      do
      something
      with
      your
      life.
      Look
      on
      YouTube
      about
      poor
      people
      in
      Africa.
      They
      have
      no
      hopes
      for
      tomorrow,
      they
      have
      almost
      nothing
      to
      eat
      or
      drink,
      but
      they
      have
      the
      strength
      to
      smile
      and
      get
      on
      with
      life.
      Stop
      pitting
      yourself
      and
      go
      out
      and
      do
      something.
      Anything.
      Start
      small.
      Get
      rich
      or
      die
      trying!

      Stop
      pitting
      yourself.
      I
      have
      Asperger's
      too
      and
      I'm
      currently
      at
      work,
      working
      as
      a
      manager
      in
      a
      care
      home
      with
      people
      with
      autism
      and
      learning
      disabilities.
      I've
      been
      homeless
      when
      I
      was
      15
      years
      old.
      I've
      had
      my
      first
      business
      at
      18
      and
      bought
      my
      own
      house
      with
      cash
      when
      I
      was
      23.
      There
      might
      be
      no
      cure,
      but
      if
      you
      let
      your
      illness
      take
      over
      your
      life,
      that
      a
      choice.
      You
      do
      what
      you
      think
      it's
      best
      for
      you,
      I'm
      just
      saying
      that
      you're
      a
      coward
      if
      you're
      doing
      it.
      P.S.
      Those
      "lazy
      niggers"
      have
      more
      dignity
      and
      respect
      for
      themselves
      than
      you'll
      ever
      have.

      That
      why
      whenever
      I'm
      about
      to
      sleep
      with
      anyone,
      I'm
      asking
      for
      a
      copy
      of
      their
      ID,
      copy
      of
      their
      birth
      certificate,
      a
      video
      of
      her
      stating
      that
      she
      wants
      to
      have
      sex
      with
      me
      and
      she
      takes
      full
      responsibility
      for
      whatever
      I'll
      do
      to
      her.
      I
      also
      put
      her
      to
      sign
      a
      contract
      where
      it
      says
      that
      I
      cover
      the
      cost
      of
      condoms
      and
      I'm
      offering
      her
      no
      reward
      for
      any
      sexual
      thing
      she's
      about
      to
      do.
      Also,
      she
      needs
      to
      agree
      with
      being
      filmed
      at
      all
      times
      and
      give
      her
      permission
      to
      share
      her
      intimate
      as
      well
      as
      personal
      data
      with
      the
      appropriate
      authorities
      if
      needs
      be.
      Once
      we
      start
      having
      sex,
      I
      keep
      ask
      her
      every
      two
      minutes
      "You
      like
      that?"
      not
      really
      caring
      if
      she
      does
      or
      not,
      but
      just
      making
      sure
      that
      she
      is
      still
      breathing
      and
      hasn't
      lost
      speech.
      If
      there
      is
      no
      movement
      from
      her
      side
      for
      more
      than
      a
      minute,
      I
      usually
      slap
      her
      ass
      a
      few
      times
      to
      see
      if
      her
      nervous
      system
      reacts
      to
      my
      actions.
      I've
      always
      played
      safe
      and
      never
      had
      problems.
      Haha,
      just
      joking.
      Stop
      worrying
      about
      what
      happened.
      From
      a
      legal
      point
      of
      view,
      it
      cannot
      be
      considered
      as
      rape
      since
      she
      was
      engaged
      in
      the
      act
      and
      hasn't
      made
      it
      crystal
      clear
      that
      you
      need
      to
      stop,
      and
      also
      she
      didn't
      put
      up
      any
      fight.
      If
      she
      goes
      to
      the
      police,
      they
      will
      laugh
      at
      her,
      trust
      me.
      I
      have
      a
      female
      friend
      who
      actually
      got
      rapped,
      she
      scratched
      the
      guy
      and
      she
      even
      had
      some
      bruieses
      and
      the
      guy
      got
      away
      with
      it.
      It's
      not
      all
      about
      her
      saying
      no,
      but
      it's
      more
      of
      a
      matter
      of
      circumstances.
      Now
      chill.

      I'm
      sorry
      to
      break
      it
      to
      you,
      but
      you
      haven't
      gained
      any
      confidence.
      You
      can't
      gain
      a
      lot
      of
      confidence
      in
      a
      week,
      haha.
      Confidence
      is
      something
      you
      build
      over
      time.
      Confidence
      comes
      from
      the
      things
      you
      achieved.
      Confidence
      is
      the
      result
      of
      hours
      and
      days
      and
      weeks
      and
      years
      of
      hard
      work
      and
      dedication.
      When
      you're
      a
      confident
      man,
      it
      means
      one
      way
      or
      another
      that
      you
      don't
      give
      a
      fu*k
      about
      what
      other
      people
      think.
      Real
      confidence
      is
      only
      attractive
      when
      it #8217;s
      supported
      by
      actual
      merit
      and
      comes
      from
      a
      place
      of
      integrity.
      You
      don't
      just
      wake
      up
      one
      day
      and
      that
      it,
      you're
      confident.
      What
      is
      actually
      happening
      to
      you
      now
      is
      that
      because
      of
      some
      reason,
      you
      feel
      good
      about
      yourself.
      Your
      self
      esteem
      grew
      a
      bit
      and
      that
      amazing,
      keep
      going,
      but
      don't
      confuse
      confidence
      with
      just
      having
      a
      good
      week.
      A
      confident
      man
      doesn't
      care
      about
      the
      fact
      that
      others
      feel
      a
      certain
      way
      about
      them,
      that
      their
      problem.
      If
      you
      think
      about
      the
      fact
      that
      you
      come
      across
      as
      cocky
      or
      arrogant,
      it
      means
      that
      you're
      insecure
      about
      yourself
      and
      you're
      afraid
      that
      someday,
      someone
      will
      see
      past
      your
      new
      found
      "confidence"
      and
      will
      discover
      a
      shy,
      vulnerable
      and
      insecure
      boy.

      I
      always
      look
      people
      in
      the
      eye.
      I
      look
      so
      deep
      that
      sometimes
      I
      can
      see
      deep
      down
      into
      their
      soul.
      It's
      not
      awkward
      at
      all,
      and
      if
      someone
      has
      a
      problem
      with
      it,
      it's
      their
      problem.
      Why
      would
      you
      avoid
      a
      good
      social
      technique?
      The
      more
      you
      do
      it,
      the
      less
      awkward
      it
      becomes.

      Good
      thing
      is
      that
      if
      you'll
      ever
      ask
      her
      to
      marry
      you,
      you'll
      know
      that
      she
      will
      say
      yes
      as
      she's
      too
      nice
      to
      say
      no.
      Don't
      over
      think
      things.
      Just
      go
      with
      the
      flow
      and
      see
      what
      happens.

      No
      one
      can
      say
      for
      sure,
      but
      on
      how
      things
      look
      at
      the
      moment,
      I'm
      predicting
      about
      $10
      by
      the
      end
      of
      the
      year.
      Obviously
      it
      can
      reach
      way
      higher
      or
      way
      lower
      but
      if
      things
      go
      alright...that
      what
      I'm
      personally
      thinking
      of.

      Hi
      Mr
      non
      stalker
      journalist.
      Think
      about
      what
      a
      journalist
      would
      do
      in
      this
      very
      intriguing
      situation.
      A
      journalist
      usually
      puts
      questions.
      A
      lot
      of
      questions
      (because
      apparently
      they
      are
      curious)
      and
      by
      putting
      questions
      they
      usually
      find
      answers.
      So
      I
      recommend
      you
      that
      next
      time
      when
      you're
      texting
      /
      chatting
      with
      the
      lady,
      ask
      her
      what
      happened
      to
      her
      last
      boyfriend?
      You
      could
      put
      it
      somehow
      like
      "So
      how
      come
      you're
      single?"
      Give
      her
      a
      chance
      to
      explain
      herself.
      She
      might
      be
      single
      or
      she
      might
      not
      be
      single,
      but
      you'll
      never
      know
      if
      you
      don't
      ask.
      The
      fact
      that
      they
      are
      in
      a
      relationship
      on
      Facebook
      doesn't
      mean
      much.
      I've
      split
      up
      with
      my
      ex
      and
      she
      even
      got
      a
      new
      boyfriend
      but
      a
      year
      later
      on
      Facebook
      we
      were
      still
      in
      a
      relationship.
      Some
      people
      don't
      pay
      much
      attention
      to
      Facebook
      as
      others
      do.
      Some
      choose
      to
      stay
      in
      a
      relationship
      on
      Facebook
      to
      keep
      the
      appearances
      for
      different
      reasons.
      Your
      best
      bet
      is
      to
      ask
      her.

      If
      you
      can't
      make
      your
      penis
      grow
      over
      10
      inch
      by
      the
      weekend,
      I
      suggest
      you
      to:
      -
      Be
      clean,
      showered
      and
      groomed.
      -
      Don't
      be
      pushy
      or
      arrogant.
      -
      Try
      and
      show
      interest
      in
      them
      and
      be
      flirty.
      -
      Masturbate
      two
      hours
      before
      you
      go
      so
      you
      can
      last
      longer
      while
      you're
      there.
      It's
      an
      orgy,
      not
      an
      IQ
      test.
      Girls
      there
      will
      only
      be
      interested
      in
      looks,
      sizes,
      sexual
      skills.

      I
      could
      of
      been
      a
      billionaire
      if
      I
      bought
      bitcoin
      when
      it
      was
      worth
      pennies.
      I

      lottery
      if
      I
      had
      chose
      the
      right
      numbers.
      I
      could

      done
      loads
      of
      things,
      but
      I
      didn't.
      We
      learn
      from

      and
      move
      on.
      We

      now.
      We

      new
      opportunities.
      We
      might
      have
      not
      been
      ready
      in

      now
      that
      we

      better,
      stronger,

      we
      definitely
      are
      ready
      for
      the
      future.
      Living
      in

      doesn't

      What

      Sometimes
      it
      works
      out
      great
      and
      sometimes
      it
      doesn't.
      It
      depends
      if
      people
      involved
      are
      emotionally
      strong
      enough
      and
      know
      exactly
      what
      they
      want.
      I
      had
      numerous
      friends
      with
      benefits.
      With
      some
      it
      was
      great
      and
      never
      had
      a
      problem.
      With
      some
      it
      wasn't
      great
      as
      they
      would
      develop
      feelings
      down
      the
      road
      -
      and
      that
      when
      I
      would
      put
      a
      stop
      to
      everything.

      How
      exactly
      does
      a
      car
      shows
      that
      you're
      fun
      and
      have
      a
      caring
      nature?
      Having
      a
      dog
      might
      show
      that
      but
      definitely
      not
      a
      car,
      haha.
      And
      a
      car
      definitely
      doesn't
      show
      that
      you're
      "wealthy
      enough".
      Your

      might
      be
      paying
      your
      insurance
      or
      repairing

      I've
      had
      a
      lot
      of
      nice
      cars
      and
      a
      lot
      of
      dirt
      cheap
      cars.
      With
      a
      nice
      car
      you're
      more
      prone
      to
      pick
      up
      gold
      diggers,
      rather
      than
      a
      decent
      and
      down
      to
      earth
      woman.
      While
      driving
      a
      luxury
      car,
      I
      can
      say
      that
      I
      definitely
      had
      more
      sex,
      but
      I
      haven't
      considered
      for
      a
      second
      to
      have
      a
      relationship
      with
      any
      of
      those
      girls.
      A
      woman
      would
      definitely
      feel
      good
      to
      be
      seen
      in
      a
      nice
      car,
      but
      definitely
      won't
      choose
      the
      man
      based
      on
      the
      car
      he
      is
      driving.
      I've
      met
      my
      girlfriend
      when
      I
      had
      no
      car
      (between
      cars)
      and
      she
      picked
      me
      up.

      Yes
      obviously,
      after
      you
      get
      to
      date
      the
      woman
      and
      can
      speak
      with
      her
      about
      it.
      But
      at
      first
      impressions,
      from
      driving
      around
      in
      your
      car
      or
      just
      from
      a
      car
      picture
      on
      Facebook,
      they
      can't
      say
      that
      you're
      fun
      and
      kind
      and
      they
      can't
      even
      know
      if
      it's
      your
      car
      or
      not,
      if
      you're
      paying
      for
      it
      or
      not.
      You
      might
      be
      just

      I've
      been
      at
      a
      table
      once
      and
      a
      lady
      was
      passing
      the
      plates.
      Prior
      to
      that,
      I've
      noticed
      that
      lady
      scratching
      her
      nose.
      I'm
      not
      going
      to
      touch
      or
      eat
      from
      a
      plate
      who
      has
      her
      DNA
      on
      it.
      Most
      people
      have
      hygiene
      standards
      and
      also
      they
      don't
      like
      other
      people
      touching
      their
      stuff.
      Maybe
      you've
      scratched
      your
      ass
      and
      then
      you
      touch
      my
      plate?
      No
      thanks.

      Hey,
      it's
      "name".
      Thanks
      for
      giving
      me
      an
      autograph
      on
      my
      cast
      (wink).
      Do
      you

      go
      round
      looking
      for
      girls
      to
      sign
      their
      cast?
      (Insert
      laughing
      emoji)
      It's
      ice
      breaking.
      It's
      funny.
      Gives
      him
      the
      chance
      to
      reply
      with
      something
      funny.
      It's
      a
      little
      flirty.

      If
      I
      was
      in
      your

      I
      would

      her
      to
      chose
      between
      me
      and
      her
      friend.
      The
      rest
      is

      If
      a

      puts

      around

      her
      friend
      from
      50
      years

      but
      I
      would
      chop
      his
      arm
      and
      make
      him
      eat
      it.
      Then,
      if
      she
      has
      a
      problem
      with
      that,
      I'll
      put

      eat
      his
      arm
      too
      while
      I'm
      taking
      my
      stuff
      and
      I'm
      out

      Same
      happened
      to
      me.
      I
      had
      100%
      USDT
      worth
      $1548.
      Today
      I
      logged
      in
      so
      I
      can
      buy
      some
      xrp
      but
      my
      account
      balance
      is
      $200
      out
      of
      $1548
      and
      apparently
      I
      bought
      5
      VIA
      coins
      and
      exchanged
      my
      USDT
      to
      BTC
      while
      I
      was
      in
      the
      gym?
      I
      have
      2FA
      enabled.
      I
      don't
      use
      any
      API
      or
      boots
      or
      anything
      and
      I'm
      level
      2
      verified
      on
      Binance.
      Stupid
      thing
      is
      that
      in
      "trade
      history"
      shows
      that
      I've
      bought
      successfully
      $1548
      worth
      of
      USDT
      and
      nothing
      else.
      However,
      my
      money
      are
      missing.
      I've
      already
      opened
      a
      ticket
      with
      Binance.

      No

      I
      went

      gym.
      When
      I
      came
      out,
      my
      account
      was
      showing

      I
      bought
      5
      VIA
      coins
      and
      the
      total
      value
      of
      my
      account
      is
      $200.
      In
      trading
      history
      it
      shows
      that
      I've
      bought
      USDT
      and
      5
      VIA
      coins,
      but
      never
      sold
      anything.
      However,
      I'm
      missing
      $1348.
      Hopefully
      everything
      will
      be
      sorted
      soon.

      Hopefully

      statement
      with
      what
      actually
      happened
      and
      how
      can
      it
      be
      avoided
      in
      the

      Me

      Drink
      your
      tea
      because
      it's
      getting

      Drink

      Grandma
      -
      What?
      Me
      -
      (after
      repeating
      few
      times)
      Oh,
      never
      mind.
      It
      doesn't
      matter
      anyway
      now.
      Grandma
      -
      I
      better
      drink
      my
      tea
      because
      it's
      getting
      cold.
      Joking
      aside,
      I
      keep
      repeating
      the
      same
      thing
      until
      they
      understand.
      The
      more
      I
      repeat,
      the
      more
      I
      increase
      my
      tone
      and
      if
      that
      doesn't
      work
      either,
      I
      try
      explain
      in
      a
      different
      way.
      When
      I
      was
      little,
      someone
      told
      me
      to
      live
      bold.
      Making
      someone
      understand
      what
      you're
      trying
      to
      say,
      even
      if
      you
      have
      to
      shout
      or
      repeat
      yourself,
      it's
      about
      you
      being
      bold,
      and
      definitely
      not
      awkward.

      8+
      inch
      here,
      slept
      with
      over
      300
      women
      and
      let
      me
      tell
      you
      that
      size
      does
      not
      matter.
      I
      enjoy
      going
      down
      on
      a
      woman
      and
      I
      became
      really
      good
      at
      it.
      I
      also
      love
      playing
      with
      my
      fingers
      and
      I
      like
      using
      different
      toys
      on
      them.
      Nowadays,
      by
      the
      time
      I
      want
      to
      have
      sex,
      they
      say
      they
      can't
      take
      it
      anymore
      and
      I
      end
      up
      having
      a
      blowjob
      or
      worse,
      a
      handjob.
      However,
      when
      I
      am
      having
      sex,
      if
      I
      go
      all
      in
      they
      complain
      that
      it
      hurts,
      I
      shouldn't
      go
      all
      in,
      I
      should
      move
      slower,
      etc,
      which
      sometimes
      can
      be
      frustrating.
      Again,
      a
      woman
      would
      prefer
      someone
      not
      very
      big
      because
      they
      will
      always
      try
      and
      compensate
      that
      with
      acts
      of
      love.
      And
      the
      most
      important
      thing
      is
      that
      a
      woman
      in
      a
      relationship
      looks
      for
      security.
      She
      wants
      to
      know
      that
      you
      won't
      cheat
      and
      being
      small
      down
      there
      it
      will
      give
      her
      the
      confidence
      that
      you
      won't
      cheat
      as
      you're
      insecure
      about
      your
      thing.
      With
      me,
      women
      never
      feel
      secure
      as
      they
      know
      that
      I
      am
      a
      man
      of
      options
      and
      if
      I
      want
      another
      woman,
      I
      can
      find
      one
      really
      fast.
      Not
      feeling
      secure
      leads
      to
      not
      trusting
      me
      and
      a
      relationship
      with
      no
      trust
      means
      nothing.
      You
      get
      on
      with
      your
      life,
      stop
      thinking
      about
      your
      size
      and
      be
      more
      confident
      about
      yourself.
      A
      woman
      would
      take
      a
      confident
      man
      over
      a
      big
      penis
      anytime.

      On

      I've

      relationship
      and
      lived

      a

      on

      I
      must
      say
      that
      it's
      been
      the
      most
      amazing
      three
      years
      in
      my

      You'll

      All
      things
      will

      Let

      how
      your
      date
      went

      XRP
      would
      go

      I

      underwear
      on
      Craigslist
      and
      invest
      all
      the
      profits
      in
      it.

      If
      you
      want
      to
      go
      all
      in,
      invest
      in
      XRP.
      Keep
      your
      XRP
      until
      it
      gets
      5$
      (which

      for

      and
      then
      cash
      out
      everything.
      Once
      you
      have

      back
      and
      a

      buy

      it
      would
      sound
      something
      like
      "We
      redefine
      logic".
      Might
      sound
      bad
      but
      I'm
      waiting
      for
      xrp
      to
      go
      to
      0.60$
      so
      I
      can
      buy
      some
      more.
      No
      matter
      how
      low
      the
      price
      will
      get,
      deep
      down
      in
      my
      heart
      I
      know
      that
      xrp
      is
      my
      ticket
      to
      financial
      freedom.

      I
      was
      18
      and
      had
      saved
      a
      bit
      of
      money
      for
      months
      to
      buy
      myself
      a
      really
      expensive
      shirt
      I
      had
      a
      crush
      on.
      One
      day
      I
      go
      to
      my
      girlfriend
      house
      and
      the
      moment
      I
      get
      through
      the
      door
      she
      rips
      my
      shirt
      buttons
      in
      one
      move
      and
      pushes
      me
      against
      the
      wall.
      I've
      started
      crying
      and
      said
      "what
      my
      shirt
      did
      to
      you?".
      I
      met
      this
      girl
      and
      we
      were
      in
      missionary
      position.
      I
      was
      thrusting
      on
      her
      really
      fast
      when
      my
      penis
      slipt
      out.
      Trying
      to
      put
      it
      back
      in
      fast
      without
      touching
      it,
      I
      entered
      into
      the
      wrong
      hole.
      All
      of
      a
      sudden
      I
      see
      her
      eyes
      full
      of
      tears
      and
      her
      face
      expression
      looked
      really
      weird.
      Without
      realising
      what
      I've
      done,
      I'm
      asking
      her
      "Are
      you
      having
      a
      seizure?".
      This
      girl
      was
      playing
      with
      her
      clit
      while
      I
      was
      in
      front
      of
      her
      penetrating.
      Somehow
      she
      scratched
      my
      penis
      and
      when
      I've
      told
      her
      what
      she's
      done,
      she
      said
      "let's
      put
      it
      in
      salted
      water
      ".
      Like
      it
      wasn't
      enough
      that
      she
      scratched
      it,
      now
      she
      wanted
      to
      put
      my
      penis
      in
      salted
      water.
      I've
      told
      her
      "what
      my
      penis
      did
      to
      you?".

      I
      had
      a
      male
      friend
      who
      had
      this
      fantasy.
      His
      wife
      in
      the
      end
      gave
      up
      and
      agreed
      to
      have
      sex
      with
      a
      stranger.
      After
      a
      week
      or
      so,
      my
      friend
      couldn't
      take
      his
      mind
      that
      some
      other
      guy
      had
      sex
      with
      his
      wife
      and
      he
      was
      beating
      himself
      on
      how
      stupid
      he
      was
      to
      put
      his
      wife
      to
      do
      that.
      He
      got
      into
      drinking,
      they
      got
      a
      divorce
      about
      7
      months
      later.
      Make
      sure
      that
      he
      is
      emotionaly
      OK
      with
      this
      too,
      not
      just
      sexualy.
      Sometimes
      an
      idea
      seems
      great
      in
      our
      heads
      but
      when
      it
      actually
      happens...the
      emotional
      impact
      might
      take
      over
      his
      sexual
      fantasy
      and
      it
      could
      end
      up
      really
      bad.
      Whatever
      you
      do,
      I
      wish
      you
      success.

      Dated
      over
      500
      women.
      Had
      sex
      with
      over
      300.
      For
      the
      last
      6
      months
      I
      have
      a
      girlfriend.
      It's
      alright
      for
      me,
      it's
      working
      good.
      Sexualy
      she
      knows
      how
      to
      make
      me
      feel
      ecstatic
      and
      she
      is
      a
      combination
      of
      the
      all
      300+
      women
      I've
      slept
      with.
      Would
      I
      give
      up
      on
      her
      to
      have
      my
      old
      life
      back?
      I
      don't
      know.
      Sometimes
      I
      miss
      chasing
      the
      women,
      making
      them
      mine.
      I
      miss
      the
      hunting.
      But
      for
      now
      I'm
      much
      more
      happy
      with
      how
      things
      are
      at
      the
      moment.
      I
      would
      chose
      stability
      over
      uncertainty
      anytime.
      It's
      not
      easy,
      but
      with
      the
      right
      person
      it's
      worth
      it.

      A
      man
      who
      is
      unsure
      about
      things
      at
      the
      moment,
      for
      reasons
      which
      you
      are
      already
      aware
      of,
      makes
      it
      clear
      to
      you
      that
      he
      likes
      you.
      And
      you
      think
      you
      should
      get
      offended?
      With
      all
      due
      respect,
      I
      am
      sure
      you're
      enjoying
      the
      attention
      he
      gives
      to
      you,
      otherwise
      you
      wouldn't
      entertain
      him.
      You're
      asking
      some
      strangers
      on
      Internet
      if
      you
      should
      feel
      offended?
      I
      believe
      that
      wrong
      in
      so
      many
      ways.
      No
      one
      can
      tell
      you
      how
      should
      you
      feel.
      That
      like
      asking
      us
      if
      you
      should
      feel
      happy
      or
      sad
      at
      a
      funeral?
      We
      cannot
      tell
      you
      how
      you
      should
      feel,
      but
      you
      should
      know
      already
      based
      on
      your
      values.
      Do
      you
      want
      to
      fu*k
      him?
      If
      yes,
      continue
      to
      entertain
      him
      and
      you'll
      get
      there.
      You
      feel
      that
      whatever
      he's
      saying
      to
      you
      is
      wrong
      and
      it
      doesn't
      aligns
      with
      your
      core
      values?
      If
      yes,
      block
      any
      contact
      with
      him.
      You
      don't
      know
      what
      to
      feel
      about
      the
      whole
      thing?
      Give
      it
      time.
      Communications
      is
      the
      key.

      I
      understand
      and
      I
      agree
      with
      you.
      This
      is
      what
      reddit
      is
      for
      -
      to
      ask
      questions.
      But
      I
      want
      you
      to
      understand
      that
      you
      shouldn't

      tell
      you
      how
      you
      should
      feel
      about
      something.
      You
      need
      to
      ask
      yourself
      how
      you
      feel
      about
      it.
      Are
      you
      offended?
      I
      believe
      that
      you're
      looking
      for
      social
      validation,
      in
      order
      to
      asses
      if
      it's
      right
      or
      wrong
      from
      a
      moral
      point
      of
      view.
      Each
      person
      has
      different
      views
      about
      different
      things
      and
      you
      shouldn't
      take
      decisions
      or
      live
      your
      life
      based
      on
      what
      other
      people
      will
      say
      that
      you
      should
      feel.
      We
      can
      give
      you
      advice,
      but
      we
      cannot
      tell
      you
      if
      you
      should
      feel
      offended
      or
      not.
      I'm
      just
      trying
      to
      be
      helpful,
      please
      don't
      take
      it
      personally.

      I
      would
      just
      get
      rid
      of
      him.
      Chatting
      with

      every

      without
      being
      clear

      out,

      in

      same
      time
      to
      make
      comments
      about
      his

      about

      If
      you
      would
      like
      to
      fu*k
      him,
      then
      you
      better
      take
      the

      try

      bring

      in
      the
      right
      direction
      and
      make
      it
      happen.
      I
      wouldn't
      waste
      any
      time
      with
      someone
      like
      him.
      There
      are
      man
      who
      are
      willing
      to
      go
      the
      extra
      mile
      and
      ask
      you
      out
      and
      be
      clear
      about
      their
      intentions,
      why
      would
      you
      settle
      for
      someone
      who
      seems
      that
      he's
      not
      putting
      any
      effort
      in
      making
      things
      happen
      and
      just
      plays
      around.
      Probably
      he
      keeps
      you
      as
      an
      option
      in
      case
      he
      can't
      do
      better.
      Just
      my
      opinion.

      I've
      had
      a
      7
      years
      relationship
      and
      we
      were
      living
      together.
      I've
      never
      allowed
      her
      to
      touch
      my
      phone,
      ever.
      I've
      never
      cheated
      on
      her
      and
      never
      even
      tried
      to.
      My
      phone
      is
      personal.
      Like,
      deadly
      personal.
      If
      she
      would
      of
      ever
      tried
      to
      get
      into
      my
      phone,
      I
      would
      of
      dumped
      her
      the
      next
      second.
      Privacy
      for
      me
      is
      crucial
      and
      it's
      not
      something
      I
      need
      to
      explain.
      I've
      never
      had
      porn
      or
      anything
      which
      could
      of
      damaged
      our
      relationship,
      but
      things
      which
      she
      would
      of
      probably
      found
      boring
      anyway.
      Don't
      jump
      to
      conclusions,
      people
      are
      different
      and
      if
      something
      is
      not
      normal
      for
      you,
      it
      doesn't
      mean
      that
      it's
      not
      normal
      for
      others.

      it
      was
      a
      matter
      of
      not
      having
      to
      explain
      myself.
      If
      I
      looked
      on
      eBay
      for
      "bandage"
      but
      I've
      wrote
      by
      mistake
      "
      bondage
      "...I
      just
      get
      on
      with
      life.
      But
      if
      she
      sees
      my
      eBay
      search
      history
      and
      sees
      that
      I've
      looked
      for
      bondage,
      she
      might
      think
      that
      I'm
      into
      it,
      she
      might
      think
      that
      I'm
      too
      shy
      to
      speak
      with
      her
      about
      it,
      she
      might
      change
      her
      behaviour
      in
      bed
      to
      please
      me,
      she
      might
      God
      knows
      what
      else.
      Nothing
      like
      this
      would
      be
      possible
      if
      I
      keep
      my
      phone
      private.
      I'm
      also
      a
      geek
      and
      I
      research
      and
      learn
      about
      things
      which
      you
      might
      not
      even
      think
      about.
      Do
      you
      know
      that
      in
      UK,
      if
      there's
      an
      ambulance
      with
      the
      blue
      lights
      on
      driving
      on
      the
      road,
      and
      you
      express
      your
      intention
      to
      cross
      the
      zebra
      cross,
      the
      ambulance
      need
      to
      stop?
      It's
      the
      law.
      I
      also
      look
      into
      different
      tech,
      and
      because
      I
      used
      to
      work
      in
      a
      company
      where
      they
      were
      making
      wires
      and
      cables,
      I
      research
      about
      stuff
      like
      this
      too.
      Short
      story
      long,
      if
      she
      spends
      just
      10
      minutes
      checking
      my
      search
      history,
      bookmarked
      websites,
      saved
      articles,
      etc,
      she
      would
      call
      the
      police
      telling
      them
      that
      I'm
      planning
      to
      build
      a
      bomb
      and
      I
      planned
      everything
      in
      details,
      haha.
      I
      don't
      want
      to
      explain
      myself
      why
      I'm
      interested
      in
      this
      things
      as
      I
      know
      she's
      not
      interested
      and
      we
      would
      waste
      each
      other
      time
      talking
      about
      it.
      Really
      stupid
      reasons
      really,
      nothing
      serious.
      But
      I
      would
      rather
      keep
      things
      for
      myself
      and
      avoid
      any
      problems,
      confusions,
      misunderstandings.

      I
      once
      asked
      a
      taxi
      driver
      how
      much
      does
      it
      cost
      to
      take
      me
      home.
      He
      said
      $20.
      Then
      I've
      asked
      him
      how
      much
      does
      it
      cost
      if
      my
      girlfriend
      comes
      with
      me
      as
      well.
      He
      said
      that
      it's
      still
      20$.
      That
      when
      I've
      realised
      that
      with
      or
      without
      her,
      it's
      no
      difference.
      Same
      as
      your
      beard.

      I've
      actually
      been
      on
      a
      Tinder
      date
      with
      a
      girl
      which
      after
      two
      weeks
      of
      chatting
      forgot
      to
      mention
      that
      she
      has
      no
      legs.
      Once
      there,
      she
      acted
      like
      everything
      was
      fine
      so
      I
      didn't
      had
      the
      heart
      to
      mention
      anything
      about
      it.
      Got
      on
      with
      our
      date,
      made
      her
      feel
      amazing
      for
      the
      night
      and
      then
      I've
      told
      her
      that
      I'm
      moving
      away.
      Not
      my
      worst
      Tinder
      story
      though.

      I
      was
      seeing
      this
      girl
      (fwb)
      for
      nearly
      a
      year
      and
      she
      always
      smelled
      and
      tasted
      amazing.
      However,
      one
      day
      when
      I
      went
      over
      for
      sex
      and
      we
      got
      down
      to
      business,
      she
      was
      smelling
      fishy
      and
      I
      haven't
      even
      went
      down
      on
      her.
      I've
      stopped
      and
      told
      her
      straight
      that
      she
      smells
      funny
      and
      she
      admitted
      that
      she
      was
      masturbating
      before
      seeing
      me
      and
      cleaned
      herself
      but
      didn't
      had
      a
      shower.
      She
      started
      to
      cry,
      felt
      embarrassed,
      and
      brought
      that
      moment
      into
      our
      conversations
      almost
      every
      single
      time.
      She
      said
      that
      smelling
      bad
      is
      one
      of
      the
      worst
      things
      a
      woman
      is
      afraid
      to
      hear.
      The
      thing
      is,
      women
      are
      so
      used
      with
      the
      smell
      of
      their
      body
      that
      they
      can't
      tell
      the
      difference
      if
      something
      is
      bad.
      You
      know
      like
      when
      you
      put
      some
      cologne
      on
      you,
      everyone
      tells
      you
      how
      good
      you
      smell
      but
      you
      can't
      smell
      a
      thing,
      haha.
      I
      would
      say
      to
      just
      be
      mature
      about
      it
      and
      tell
      her
      straight
      without
      hidding
      in
      the
      bushes.
      If
      she
      takes
      it
      well
      or
      not,
      it's
      her
      problem,
      but
      she
      will
      react
      the
      same
      no
      matter
      how
      you
      put
      it.

      I've
      slept
      with
      over
      300
      women.
      Do
      you
      think
      I
      woke
      up
      one
      morning
      and
      everyone
      wanted
      to
      have
      sex
      with
      me?
      Definitely
      not.
      I
      have
      put
      myself
      in
      so
      many
      awkward,
      weird,
      pathetic
      situations
      and
      got
      rejected
      so
      many
      times,
      that
      at
      some
      point
      I
      wasn't
      even
      sure
      I
      still
      have
      a
      reputation.
      Good
      or
      bad.
      I
      got
      so
      used
      with
      being
      rejected,
      that
      when
      a
      woman
      finally
      agreed
      to
      give
      me
      her
      phone
      number,
      I
      said
      "no
      problem,
      thank
      you
      anyway".
      I
      went
      through
      times
      when
      I
      felt
      I
      must
      be
      the
      most
      ugly
      man
      alive,
      I
      felt
      worthless.
      My
      self
      esteem
      committed
      suicide,
      my
      confidence
      went
      into
      depression
      and
      my
      insecurities
      were
      having
      a
      party.
      However,
      I
      haven't
      stopped.
      I
      haven't
      allowed
      my
      emotions
      to
      take
      control
      over
      my
      life.
      All
      the
      rejections
      and
      all
      the
      embarrassing
      moments
      played
      probably
      the
      most
      important
      part
      in
      becoming
      successful
      at
      dating
      women.
      I've
      started
      to
      read
      books
      about
      personal
      development,
      dating,
      business,
      etc.
      I've
      started
      watching
      videos
      related
      to
      dating.
      I've
      learned
      about
      fashion
      and
      changed
      my
      style.
      Reading
      also
      helped
      me
      express
      myself
      in
      a
      more
      classy
      manner.
      I've
      end
      up
      going
      to
      public
      speaking
      meetups
      to
      learn
      how
      to
      express
      myself
      in
      a
      bold
      manner.
      I
      went
      to
      dance
      classes
      because
      I
      felt
      in
      love
      with
      tango.
      I
      signed
      up
      to
      the
      gym
      to
      get
      in
      shape.
      I
      took
      good
      care
      of
      my
      teeth
      and
      fixed
      any
      problems
      so
      I
      can
      have
      a
      nice
      smile.
      I
      got
      a
      new
      haircut
      and
      always
      made
      sure
      that
      I
      have
      eyebrows
      and
      not
      a
      mono
      brow.
      I
      got
      so
      caught
      up
      into
      this
      personal
      development
      journey,
      that
      picking
      up
      girls
      wasn't
      as
      important
      anymore
      and
      it
      was
      more
      like
      a
      bonus.
      Having
      girls
      asking
      me
      for
      my
      number
      became
      somehow
      of
      a
      problem
      because
      I
      got
      so
      busy
      with
      my
      life
      that
      I
      couldn't
      find
      time
      to
      date.
      Picking
      up
      girls
      when
      I
      wanted
      to,
      became
      so
      natural
      that
      I
      didn't
      even
      had
      to
      put
      the
      effort
      in
      anymore.
      I've
      changed
      from
      a
      man
      who
      desperately
      wanted
      to
      have
      women,
      into
      the
      man
      who
      women
      would
      be
      interested
      to
      date.
      After
      hundreds
      of
      rejections,
      thousands
      of
      hours
      invested
      in
      my
      personal
      development,
      tens
      of
      thousands
      hours
      of
      reading
      and
      taking
      actions,
      I
      forgot
      why
      I've
      started
      this
      journey
      in
      the
      first
      place.
      I've
      created
      a
      life
      for
      myself
      and
      in
      the
      same
      time
      I've
      built
      my
      self
      worth,
      I've
      grew
      my
      confidence,
      I've
      learned
      how
      to
      deal
      with
      my
      emotions,
      I
      created
      and
      discovered
      myself.
      Today,
      I
      don't
      need
      to
      chase
      women
      anymore
      because
      I
      have
      the
      power
      to
      choose.
      I
      have
      standards.
      Hope
      this
      helps
      you
      with
      your
      journey
      and
      wish
      you
      success.

      I'm
      using
      the
      app
      "photo
      vault"
      as
      well,
      however
      sometimes,
      some
      of
      the
      videos
      saved
      there
      won't
      work
      anymore
      and
      they
      will
      be
      lost
      forever.
      The
      app
      is
      great
      and
      safe
      for
      pictures
      though.
      As
      a
      second
      option
      I've
      created
      a
      fake
      Facebook
      profile
      and
      I
      send
      dirty
      pictures
      and
      videos
      to
      my
      fake
      profile
      via
      messenger.
      I
      can
      access
      those
      messages
      anytime
      from
      anywhere
      and
      no
      one
      can
      hack
      in
      since
      I'm
      the
      only
      one
      who
      knows
      the
      email
      and
      password.

      This
      is
      my
      first
      post
      on
      reddit.
      Someday,
      I
      will
      tell
      my
      grandchildren
      a
      story
      about
      how
      I
      became
      a
      millionaire
      a
      day
      after
      my
      first
      post
      on
      reddit.
      And
      then,
      I'll
      come
      back
      here
      and
      do
      an
      AMA.
      I
      would
      normally
      say
      to
      you
      people
      to
      start
      praying
      and
      /
      or
      keep
      your
      fingers
      crossed
      for
      the
      partnership
      to
      be
      huge.
      But
      not
      in
      this
      case,
      not
      now.
      Now,
      I
      am
      confident
      enough
      to
      say
      that
      this
      partnership
      will
      be
      huge
      for
      Verge,
      it
      will
      be
      huge
      for
      us,
      the
      bag
      holders,
      and
      it
      will
      make
      history
      -
      just
      my
      gut
      feeling.
      Stay
      positive
      but
      don't
      invest
      more
      than
      you
      can
      afford.
      Things
      could
      go
      both
      ways
      no
      matter
      how
      good
      or
      how
      bad
      the
      partnership
      will
      be.

      Years
      ago
      I
      was
      just
      about
      to
      buy
      few
      thousands
      of
      bitcoin
      when
      it
      was
      worth
      pennies.
      I
      was
      using
      my
      uncle
      computer
      to
      do
      that
      and
      10
      seconds
      before
      I
      bought
      them
      he
      asked
      me
      what
      was
      I
      doing.
      After
      explaining
      my
      plan
      and
      trying
      to
      explain
      to
      him
      what
      bitcoin
      is,
      he
      convinced
      me
      to
      buy
      myself
      a
      scooter
      instead.

      That
      is
      good

      I
      have
      worked
      in
      the
      exact
      same
      amazon
      warehouse
      three
      years
      ago.
      I
      was
      a
      packer,
      it
      was
      my
      first
      job
      when
      I
      arrived
      in
      England.
      The
      pay
      was
      almost
      minimum
      wage
      and
      the
      work
      conditions
      were
      OK!
      I
      had
      a
      target
      for
      packing
      items
      per
      hour,
      and
      sometimes
      I
      was
      reaching
      the
      target
      and
      sometimes
      I
      wasn't.
      No
      one
      gave
      a
      shit
      if
      I
      was
      reaching
      the
      target
      or
      not,
      however,
      the
      team
      leader
      would
      tell
      you
      that
      "you
      can
      do
      better".
      Most
      of
      the
      times
      there
      were
      incentives
      for
      people
      who
      packs
      the
      most
      products
      per
      hour
      -
      free
      lunch
      and
      cash
      money.
      The
      environment
      was
      really
      friendly,
      I
      actually
      made
      few
      friends
      and
      we
      were
      talking
      and
      laughing
      while
      we
      were
      working.
      Even
      the
      team
      leader
      would
      come
      now
      and
      then
      and
      ask
      you
      if
      you're
      OK,
      if
      you
      need
      anything,
      if
      she
      could
      help
      you
      with
      anything.
      The
      warehouse
      was
      perfectly
      clean
      all
      the
      time
      and
      even
      though
      everyone
      had
      targets
      to
      accomplish,
      no
      one
      seemed
      in
      a
      rush.
      I
      absolutely
      loved
      working
      there
      but
      I
      moved
      on
      after
      three
      months.
      The
      only
      thing
      I
      can
      complain
      is
      that
      I
      haven't
      received
      all
      the
      money
      I've
      worked
      for.
      Even
      today
      they
      still
      owe
      me
      about
       #163;350.
      The
      payment
      department
      never
      answer
      the
      phone
      and
      you
      can't
      even
      leave
      a
      voice
      mail
      as
      it's
      always
      full.
      I
      have
      other
      friends
      who
      are
      still
      owed
      as
      much
      as
       #163;3000.
      I've
      sent
      tens
      of
      emails
      with
      proof
      that
      they
      owe
      me
      money
      but
      with
      no
      reply
      ever.
      I
      was
      going
      to
      the
      toilet
      whenever
      I
      wanted
      to
      with
      no
      one
      telling
      me
      off.

      by

      Sincero.
      For
      me
      it
      was
      life
      changing
      and
      I
      started
      seeing

      a

      Couldn't

      more.
      It's
      definitely
      the

      I

      I'm
      buying
      every
      month
      with
      about
      75%
      of
      my
      earnings.
      I'll
      keep
      buying
      every
      month
      until
      it
      gets
      over
      $1.50
      and
      then
      I'll
      just
      sit
      back
      and...pray.
      Worst
      case
      scenario,
      I
      lost
      few
      months
      of
      earnings.
      Best
      case
      scenario
      I
      get
      to
      retire
      in
      5
      years.

      I
      was
      about
      18
      years
      old
      and
      I
      was
      over
      at
      this
      girl
      house.
      I
      bought
      a
      butt
      plug
      to
      use
      it
      on
      her.
      After
      about
      two
      hours
      I
      was
      getting
      ready
      to
      leave
      and
      my
      phone
      rang
      so
      I
      went
      into
      the
      bathroom
      to
      speak
      as
      it
      was
      something
      personal
      and
      I
      didn't
      knew
      this
      girl
      for
      very
      long
      time.
      On
      my
      way
      to
      the
      bathroom,
      I've
      left
      the
      door
      from
      our
      room
      open
      and
      the
      dog
      came
      inside
      the
      room
      and
      got
      the
      but
      plug
      and
      brought
      it
      over
      to
      the
      girl's
      father
      who
      was
      in
      the
      kitchen.
      Now,
      the
      father
      knew
      that
      his
      daughter
      was
      a
      virgin
      and
      he
      got
      really
      angry
      and
      came
      to
      me
      into
      the
      bathroom
      without
      even
      knocking
      and
      asked
      me
      what
      in
      the
      world
      is
      that?
      Her
      father
      was
      a
      really
      big
      guy
      and
      I
      was
      just
      a
      kid,
      so
      I
      said
       #8220;it's
      mine
      -
      I'm
      using
      it #8221;.

      You're
      probably
      looking
      at
      5

      chart.
      It

      even
      higher

      I
      use
      the
      5
      minutes
      chart
      too,
      however,
      you
      need
      to
      understand
      that
      people
      will
      sell
      and
      people
      will
      buy.
      In
      a
      matter
      of
      5
      minutes
      there
      could
      be
      more
      sell
      orders
      rather
      than
      buy
      orders
      and
      the
      price
      /
      sats
      might
      go
      down
      a
      bit
      but
      that
      doesn't
      mean
      it's
      dumping.
      If
      you're
      zooming
      out
      and
      look
      at
      the
      whole
      picture
      you
      can
      see
      its
      still
      climbing
      and
      let's
      be
      serious,
      we
      can't
      possibly
      expect
      to
      go
      only
      up
      non
      stop.
      The
      news
      with
      the
      exchange
      is
      big
      for
      Verge
      and
      more
      and
      more
      people
      will
      want
      to
      get
      into
      it
      while
      it's
      still
      cheap.
      With
      the
      new
      exchange
      we
      will
      /
      might
      get
      new
      people
      who
      will
      research
      on
      verge
      and
      start
      buying
      and
      hopefully
      holding
      as
      well.
      Stop
      looking
      at
      the
      5
      minutes
      chart
      as
      it's
      only
      for
      day
      traders.
      Look
      at
      whats
      happening
      news
      wise,
      look
      to
      see
      if
      the
      volume
      is
      increasing
      (which
      obviously
      is)
      and
      hold.
      If
      you're
      in
      for
      the
      short
      term,
      set
      a
      goal
      and
      wait
      to
      reach
      it
      and
      then
      sell.
      If
      you're
      in
      for
      the
      long
      term...buy
      and
      hold,
      forget
      about
      verge
      and
      come
      back
      next
      year.

      Honestly
      I
      don't
      care
      at
      all
      about
      a
      woman's
      hair
      colour.
      She
      could
      have
      a
      white
      head
      and
      I'd
      still
      not
      care.
      After
      7
      years
      with
      my
      ex,
      completing
      a
      form
      where
      asked
      what
      hair
      colour
      my
      girlfriend
      has,
      I
      had
      to
      look
      at
      pictures
      on
      my
      phone
      as
      I
      wasn't
      sure
      of
      her
      hair
      colour.
      A
      nice
      personality,
      brains
      and
      at
      least
      an
      average
      looking
      body
      will
      always
      win
      my
      heart.

      In
      2011
      I've
      said
      to
      a
      friend
      to
      buy
      loads
      of
      bitcoins
      as
      "it's

      He
      actually
      bought
      loads
      and
      kept
      it
      safe,
      while
      my
      uncle
      convinced
      me
      not
      to
      invest
      my
      money
      in
      online
      scams.
      The
      lie
      is
      that
      I
      had
      no
      clue
      that
      bitcoin
      was
      the
      real
      deal.
      I
      just
      needed
      someone
      to
      invest
      with
      me
      so
      I
      won't
      feel
      stupid
      on
      my
      own
      if
      I'll
      lose
      the
      money.
      Now
      my
      friend
      has
      almost
      a
      million
      dollars.

      I've
      always
      been
      buying
      ready
      made
      frozen
      pizza,
      and
      at
      home
      I
      was
      putting
      it
      into
      the
      microwave
      instead
      of
      the
      oven.
      I've
      always
      thought
      that
      microwave
      is
      the
      modern
      version
      of
      the
      oven.
      Cooking
      is
      not
      for
      me.

      After
      one
      year
      of
      relationship,
      I've
      told
      my

      that
      I'm
      insecure
      about
      my
      very
      large
      penis.
      She

      even
      noticed

      I

      John
      Radcliffe
      hospital
      outside
      entrance
      on
      my

      I've
      started
      to
      yawn
      and
      my
      eyes
      got
      teary
      because
      of
      yawning.
      I
      removed
      my
      glasses
      to
      wipe
      my
      tears
      and
      this
      couple
      came
      to
      me
      asking
      if
      I'm
      alright.

      I've
      tried
      explaining
      that
      I'm
      OK,
      but
      they
      said
      that
      it's
      alright
      to
      open
      up
      and
      express
      my
      feelings.
      While
      explaining
      this,
      another
      couple
      joined
      in
      asking
      the
      first
      couple
      of
      I'm
      OK.
      I
      kept
      saying
      that
      I'm
      alright
      and
      even
      more
      people
      stopped,
      saying
      "Oh,
      bless
      him".
      At
      first
      I
      had
      no
      idea
      why
      they
      were
      checking
      on
      me.
      However,
      moments
      later
      I
      realised
      why
      they
      all
      came
      to
      me
      and
      by
      this
      time
      there
      were
      too
      many
      people
      around,
      feeling
      bad
      for
      me,
      so
      it
      would
      had
      been
      really
      awkward
      to
      tell
      them
      that
      I
      was
      just
      yawning
      so
      I
      thanked
      them
      for
      their
      concern
      and
      left.
      British
      people
      do
      care
      for
      random
      strangers.

      I
      was
      once
      in
      a

      on

      and
      this

      asked
      what

      She
      said
      "I'm

      For
      a
      second,

      my
      then
      girlfriend

      I
      was
      about
      14
      and
      one
      morning
      when
      I
      woke
      up,
      I
      turn
      on
      the
      TV,
      and
      there
      was
      one
      of
      those
      teleshopping
      programs.
      This
      hot
      model
      was
      presenting
      and
      trying
      to
      sell
      a
      swimsuit
      for
      women.
      She
      was
      bending,
      twisting,
      stretching
      and
      her
      ass
      was
      shaking
      like
      there
      was
      no
      tomorrow.
      I
      was
      ready
      to
      buy
      whatever
      she
      was
      selling,
      haha.
      Anyway,
      I
      got
      really
      horny
      seeing
      her
      and
      started
      to
      masturbate
      under
      the
      covers.
      My
      mother
      heard
      that
      TV
      is
      on
      and
      she
      assumed
      I'm
      up
      already
      so
      she
      came
      into
      my
      room
      exactly
      when
      I
      was
      about
      to
      finish.
      Obviously
      the
      moment
      she
      opened
      the
      door,
      I've
      stopped
      doing
      anything,
      but
      I
      couldn't
      stop
      what
      was
      inevitable
      -
      cumming.
      She
      saw
      me
      being
      all
      red,
      sweating
      and
      shaking.
      After
      putting
      her
      hand
      on
      my
      forehead
      to
      check
      if
      I
      have
      fever,
      she
      said
      "OMG,
      you're
      really
      hot"
      and
      without
      any
      warning
      took
      the
      cover
      away
      as
      I
      sweating.
      Never
      watched
      teleshopping
      again.

      No.
      In

      waiters
      don't

      Aren't
      we
      here
      to
      ask
      for
      advice?
      Opinions?
      I
      don't
      know
      why
      people
      are
      being
      rude.
      Anyway,
      I
      would
      say

      with
      all
      the
      things
      which
      are
      about
      to

      go
      over
      1$
      by
      end
      of
      July.
      But
      then
      this
      is
      just
      my
      prediction
      based
      on
      my
      own
      research
      and
      I'm
      risking
      my
      own
      money.
      You
      do
      what
      you
      think
      it's
      best.
      If
      I'd
      be
      you,
      I
      wouldn't
      sell
      xrp
      until
      end
      of
      July
      if
      you
      need
      the
      money
      short
      term
      or
      minimum
      two
      years
      if
      you
      could
      wait
      for
      possibly
      a
      life
      changing
      amount.

      you
      need
      to
      ask
      yourself
      why
      your
      standards
      died
      of
      cancer.
      With
      a
      profile
      like
      that,
      I
      bet
      that
      tens
      or
      even
      hundreds
      already
      been
      there.
      I
      would
      say
      pass.

      I've
      been
      to
      a
      supermarket
      in
      England
      and
      asked
      a
      lady
      who
      was
      working
      there
      if
      she
      has
      a
      "bath
      plug".
      Clearly
      offended,
      she
      told
      me
      that
      I
      need
      to
      go
      to
      the
      sex
      shop
      for
      stuff
      like
      that.
      Because
      of
      my
      accent,
      I
      had
      to
      have
      a
      shower
      instead
      of
      a
      bath.

      Onions.
      My
      mum
      used
      to
      grow
      her
      own
      onions
      and
      she
      was
      very
      proud
      of
      them.
      So
      proud
      that
      she
      used
      to
      feed
      me
      every
      day
      with
      onion
      soup,
      fries
      with
      onions,
      onion
      pizza,
      onion
      sandwich,
      onion
      cake,

      So
      in
      a
      morning
      I
      was
      on
      my
      way
      to
      a
      training
      regarding
      sells.
      I
      arrive
      in
      this
      big
      building
      and
      there
      were
      lots
      of
      meeting
      rooms.
      I
      couldn't
      remember
      what
      room
      number
      was
      my
      training
      in
      so
      I
      just
      opened
      a
      door
      to
      have
      a
      peak,
      hoping
      that
      I'll
      recognise
      someone.
      Immediately
      after
      I
      open
      the
      door,
      the
      trainer
      says
      "Oh,
      hello.
      Because
      you're
      late,
      you'll
      be
      the
      first
      to
      try
      and
      administer
      rectal
      diazepam
      to
      this
      patient
      (not
      a
      real
      human,
      but
      a
      doll)".
      Before
      I
      even
      get
      to
      speak,
      he
      encourages
      me
      by
      handing
      over
      the
      tablet
      and
      guiding
      me
      towards
      the
      patient.
      I
      just
      smile
      in
      front
      of
      about
      30
      people
      and
      shove
      that
      tablet
      up
      to
      the
      doll's
      ass.
      The
      trainer
      says
      I've
      done
      a
      fantastic
      job.
      Meanwhile,
      my
      boss
      was
      ringing
      wondering
      where
      I
      am.
      I've
      answered
      the
      phone
      and
      said
      "you
      won't
      believe
      this".

      After
      7
      years
      relationship
      with
      my
      first
      (
      now
      ex)
      girlfriend,
      I
      had
      to
      reinvent
      myself.
      I've
      been
      trying
      to
      pick
      up
      girls
      unsuccessfully
      for
      so
      long
      that
      I
      just
      quit
      and
      concentrated
      on
      myself.
      I've
      fixed
      my
      teeth.
      I've
      bought
      tailored
      made
      clothes
      (iTailor
      has
      some
      great
      prices).
      I've
      started
      to
      work
      extra
      hours
      and
      saved
      all
      the
      money
      and
      bought
      myself
      a
      nice
      car.
      I've
      been
      to
      public
      speaking
      meetups
      (free
      of
      charge)
      to
      raise
      my
      confidence.
      I've
      taken
      dance
      and
      piano
      classes
      (always
      wanted
      to).
      I've
      started
      to
      read
      books
      about
      self
      development.
      I've
      started
      to
      go
      to
      the
      gym
      three
      times
      a
      week.
      I've
      changed
      my
      haircut.
      I've
      got
      into
      modeling
      (gained
      experience
      and
      money)
      and
      made
      some
      great
      friends
      along
      with
      some
      professional
      photos.
      I
      got
      so
      busy
      with
      my
      life,
      that
      looking
      for
      sex
      wasn't
      important
      anymore.
      I
      developed
      the
      confidence,
      the
      skills,
      the
      looks
      and
      my
      number
      is
      close
      to
      400
      women.

      So
      I've
      been
      to
      this
      lady
      friend
      house
      for
      a
      catch-up
      (haven't
      seen
      each
      other
      for
      5
      years)
      and
      we
      were
      alone.
      She
      told
      me
      that
      she
      got
      married
      and
      other
      stuff.
      One
      thing
      led
      to
      another
      and
      started
      to
      have
      sex.
      About
      5
      minutes
      later
      a
      man
      gets
      into
      the
      room.
      I
      stop
      and
      apologise.
      She
      says
      "why
      you're
      apologising
      for?
      He
      is
      not
      my
      husband.".
      While
      my
      body
      was
      shaking,
      I've
      managed
      to
      squeeze
      in
      a
      big
      sigh
      of
      relief.
      I
      haven't
      finished
      my
      sigh
      when
      another
      man
      gets
      into
      the
      room,
      and
      she
      says
      "now
      that
      my
      husband!
      ".
      They
      are
      still
      together,
      although
      I'm
      no
      friends
      with
      her
      anymore.
      Sometimes
      people
      do
      catch
      people
      doing
      things.
      Just
      think
      that
      it
      could
      have
      been
      worse.

      Back
      when
      I
      had
      no
      clue
      about
      women,
      I've
      been
      on
      a
      date
      with
      this
      girl
      and
      she
      invited
      me
      to
      her
      place.
      Once
      there,
      she
      threw
      herself
      on
      the
      bed
      and
      spread
      her
      legs.
      I
      sat
      on
      a
      chair.
      She
      looked
      at
      me
      and
      asked
      if
      I
      like
      her
      high
      heels.
      I
      said
      it's
      better
      to
      take
      them
      off
      as
      she
      will
      make
      the
      bed
      covers
      dirty.
      On
      request,
      I
      took
      them
      off
      for
      her
      and
      sat
      back
      on
      the
      chair.
      Then,
      I
      helped
      her
      get
      her
      jeans
      off
      and
      sat
      back
      on
      the
      chair.
      After
      some
      more
      chit-chat,
      I
      helped
      her
      get
      her
      top
      off
      and
      sat
      back
      on
      the
      chair.
      She
      went
      even
      further
      and
      took
      her
      underwear
      and
      bra
      off
      saying
      that
      it's
      really
      hot.
      I
      sat
      on
      the
      chair.
      And
      if
      that
      wasn't
      enough,
      she
      bent
      over
      while
      naked
      to
      pick
      her
      clothes
      from
      the
      floor.
      I
      sat
      on
      the
      chair.
      She
      asked
      me
      if
      I'm
      not
      hot,
      and
      I
      said
      "no,
      I'm
      OK",
      while
      I
      was
      sitting
      in
      the
      chair.
      I
      went
      home
      thinking
      it
      was
      such
      a
      good
      date.
      If
      I
      could
      go
      back
      in
      time,
      I'd
      slap
      the
      heck
      out
      of
      the
      young
      me.

      When
      you
      sign
      up
      to
      Binance,
      you
      need
      to
      get
      verified
      with
      documents.
      The
      OP
      says
      that
      he
      can
      prove

      he
      sent
      to
      verify
      his

      that

      of
      that

      I
      don't
      know
      how
      you
      people
      do
      it.
      I
      wouldn't
      have
      the
      patience
      to
      text
      someone
      for
      YEARS
      before
      meeting.
      The
      longest
      I've
      texted
      someone
      before
      meeting
      up
      was
      about
      two
      hours,
      split
      into
      two
      nights.
      The
      way
      I
      look
      at
      it,
      I'm
      not
      a
      therapist
      and
      definitely
      not
      on
      dating
      sites
      to
      be
      someone's
      emotional
      pillow.
      Dating
      is
      about
      chemistry.
      Once
      it's
      obvious
      that
      there
      is
      interest
      from
      both
      sides,
      we
      either
      move
      to
      the
      next
      step
      together,
      either
      I
      move
      to
      the
      next
      one.
      Texting
      for
      a
      little
      while
      is
      to
      be
      expected,
      so
      we
      can
      asses
      the
      other
      person
      mental
      capacity
      and
      get
      a
      whif
      of
      their
      personality.
      Everything
      else
      can
      be
      done
      on
      a
      first
      date.
      Most
      people
      just
      want
      someone
      to
      give
      them
      attention,
      boost
      their
      ego,
      make
      them
      feel
      good
      about
      themselves.
      Those
      are
      time
      waisters
      and
      not
      worth
      entertaining.
      Falling
      in
      love
      over
      text
      messages
      it's
      actually
      not
      healthy.
      You
      love
      the
      image
      of
      someone
      you've
      created
      in
      your
      mind
      and
      most
      of
      the
      times
      it
      turns
      out
      to
      be
      deceiving.
      "Awww,
      he
      likes
      Netflix
      too.
      I
      can't
      believe
      we
      have
      so
      many
      things
      in
      common
      "
      she
      says.
      Well,
      guess
      what?
      Everyone
      who
      knows
      and
      has
      access
      to
      Netflix,
      likes
      Netflix.
      Don't
      get
      fooled
      into
      the
      texting
      game
      and
      try
      and
      meet
      the
      other
      person
      as
      fast
      as
      possible.
      It
      could
      be
      a
      waste
      of
      time,
      even
      years
      by
      the
      looks
      of
      it.
      Remember
      -
      In
      text
      messages,
      people
      tend
      to
      create
      a
      image
      of
      themselves
      based
      on
      how
      they
      want
      you
      to
      perceive
      them.

      When
      Binance
      had
      that
      VIA
      coin
      hack
      a
      month
      or
      two
      ago,
      I
      lost
      all
      the
      money
      from
      my
      account.
      Whoever
      logged
      in,
      managed
      to
      sell
      all
      my
      xrp,
      usdt
      and
      change
      it
      for
      btc,
      and
      then
      bought
      VIA
      coins
      with
      all
      the
      available
      btc.
      Somehow
      my
      account
      was
      showing
      zero
      even
      though
      I
      still
      had
      some
      VIA
      in
      my
      account.
      I
      had
      2FA
      enabled
      and
      no
      one
      has
      access
      to
      my
      phone
      (iphone
      X
      with
      face
      recognition).
      I
      have
      never
      used
      an
      API
      in
      any
      way.
      I
      have
      never
      received
      an
      email
      of
      confirmation
      of
      funds
      withdrawal.
      I
      haven't
      been
      phished
      as
      I
      always
      check
      that
      I'm
      on
      the
      right
      website
      (I
      develop
      websites
      so
      I
      know
      what
      to
      look
      for).
      After
      contacting
      Binance
      support,
      I
      received
      100%
      of
      my
      money
      back
      and
      a
      reply
      saying
      that
      the
      problem
      was
      solved.
      They
      never
      explained
      how
      it
      happened
      in
      the
      first
      place
      or
      how
      can
      I
      prevent
      from
      happening
      again.
      I
      believe
      what
      you're
      saying
      as
      I've
      been
      there.
      However,
      I
      still
      like
      Binance
      and
      I
      still
      trust
      them.
      They
      might
      make
      a
      mistake
      (knowingly
      or
      not)
      here
      and
      there,
      but
      compared
      with
      all
      the
      other
      decentralised
      exchanges,
      I'd
      choose
      Binance
      without
      thinking
      twice
      about
      it.
      Keep
      fighting
      and
      find
      what
      happened
      and
      hopefully
      you'll
      sort
      it
      out.
      Success.

      If
      the
      interviewer
      is
      a
      woman,
      say
      "excuse
      me,
      you
      have
      something
      on
      your
      face.
      Oh,
      never
      mind,
      it
      was
      the
      mustache.
      I
      apologise."
      The
      apology
      didn't
      worked
      for
      me,
      but
      it's
      worth
      trying.

      They
      are
      definitely
      worth
      it.
      I
      live
      in
      England
      and
      I
      don't
      have
      my
      own
      place.
      I
      live
      with
      rent
      in
      one
      bedroom.
      In
      the
      last
      four
      years
      I've
      slept
      with
      over
      400
      Tinder
      women
      and
      I
      haven't
      brought
      one
      at
      home.
      Not
      even
      once.
      They
      either
      pay
      for
      hotel
      for
      us
      (usually
      they're
      business
      women
      and
      can
      afford
      to),
      either
      do
      it
      at
      her
      place,
      her
      friends
      place,
      in
      the
      car,
      secluded
      parking
      spots,
      their
      place
      of
      work
      if
      convenient,
      etc.
      I
      haven't
      once
      paid
      for
      a
      hotel
      as
      it's
      not
      worth
      it
      for
      me
      since
      I
      have
      options.
      If
      you
      reach
      to
      the
      point
      where
      she
      is
      willing
      to
      sleep
      with
      you,
      she
      will
      always
      sort
      something
      out
      if
      you
      can't.
      Women
      are
      creative.
      Get
      on
      there,
      make
      things
      happen
      and
      worry
      about
      logistics
      later.

      I

      What
      is
      the

      bragging

      strangers?
      There's
      no

      Perhaps
      my
      wording
      wasn't
      very
      good
      because
      of
      my
      English,
      I
      do
      apologise.

      Not

      to
      prove
      anything,

      I'm

      haven't
      even
      got

      yet.
      Not

      POF,
      Badoo
      plus
      picking
      women
      in
      real
      life.
      I
      had
      sex
      with
      up
      to
      four
      different
      women
      some

      (not

      and
      I
      have
      messages
      to
      prove
      it.
      Also
      I
      like
      taking
      pictures,
      so
      I
      can
      prove
      with
      that
      as
      well.
      I
      have
      a

      of
      about
      300
      selfies

      women
      in
      compromising
      postures,
      haha.
      I'm
      not
      the
      best
      looking
      man
      out
      there,
      but
      I
      look
      OK.
      I'm
      smart
      and
      I
      have
      the
      knowledge
      on
      how
      to
      work
      my
      way
      around
      women.
      You've
      mentioned
      about
      cost
      of
      taking
      them
      to
      dinner.
      I
      have
      a
      job
      and
      a
      business
      and
      I
      do
      OK
      for
      myself,
      but
      I'm
      not
      rich
      or
      anything.
      However,
      I
      almost
      never
      take
      women
      to
      dinner.
      I
      want
      to
      have
      sex
      with
      them,
      not
      to
      marry
      them.
      I
      usually
      take
      them
      for
      a
      walk
      in
      the
      park.
      It's
      always
      the
      perfect
      place
      to
      put
      her
      in
      circumstances
      where
      you
      can
      grab
      and
      hold
      her
      hand,
      play
      with
      her
      hair
      while
      sattting
      on
      a
      bench
      and
      kiss
      her
      without
      having
      the
      whole
      world
      watching.
      In
      a
      park,
      she
      will
      always
      feel
      safe
      and
      that
      very
      important.
      The
      most
      I've
      ever
      spent
      on
      a
      date
      was
      probably
       #163;20
      and
      that
      includes
      my
      petrol
      for
      driving
      to
      her
      and
      back.
      Happy
      to
      write
      more
      about
      it
      if
      you
      want
      to
      learn
      from
      my
      experiences.
      I'm
      here
      to
      help
      others
      while
      I'm
      learning
      new
      things
      from
      others
      as
      well.
      I'm
      just
      a
      stranger,
      believe
      me
      or
      not,
      that
      your
      choice.

      First
      time
      I've
      rejected
      because
      I
      had
      a
      girlfriend.
      Then,
      I
      rejected
      because
      I
      genuinely
      either
      didn't
      find
      them
      attractive
      or
      I
      could
      sense
      that
      they
      are
      the
      type
      who
      want
      a
      house
      with
      a
      white
      fence,
      when
      all
      I
      wanted
      was
      sex.
      I'm
      just
      being
      polite,
      smile
      and
      say
      that
      I'm
      sorry
      but
      I
      have
      a
      girlfriend
      -
      it
      always
      does
      the
      trick.
      I
      don't
      feel
      bad
      for
      them,
      I
      don't
      feel
      empowered,
      I
      don't
      feel
      anything.
      They
      tried,
      it
      wasn't
      meant
      to
      be
      and
      we
      both
      get
      on
      with
      our
      lives.
      At
      the
      beginning
      I
      used
      to
      brag
      about
      it,
      it
      used
      to
      make
      me
      feel
      good
      about
      myself.
      Now
      I
      don't
      care.
      I
      don't
      care
      about
      how
      they'll
      feel
      as
      it's
      not
      my
      problem
      and
      it
      doesn't
      affect
      me
      in
      any
      way.

      If
      I'm
      in
      a
      supermarket
      shopping
      and
      see
      a
      good
      looking
      woman,
      I
      just
      go
      to
      her,
      smile
      and
      say
      "Hi,
      sorry
      to
      bother
      you
      but
      I
      find
      you
      to
      be
      really
      attractive
      and
      was

      if
      you're
      committed
      in
      any
      way?
      "
      If
      the
      answer
      is
      no,
      I
      get
      her
      number.
      If
      the
      answer
      is
      yes,
      than
      I
      end
      up
      with
      a
      joke
      like
      "Uh,
      that
      just
      broke
      my
      heart
      "
      and
      move
      on
      to
      living
      my
      life.
      I
      do
      the
      same
      wherever
      I
      see
      a
      woman
      to
      which
      I
      feel
      attracted
      to.
      In
      the
      park,
      car
      parks,
      secretary
      /
      staff
      in
      a

      receptionist
      /
      staff
      in
      a

      etc.
      Wherever
      I
      go
      and
      there
      is
      a
      woman
      with
      potential,
      I'm
      on
      it.
      Although,
      OLD
      is
      just
      more
      convenient.

      That
      true,
      some
      women
      might
      not
      like
      being
      approached.
      However,
      I
      am
      only
      looking
      for
      sex
      so
      the
      type
      of
      women
      I
      usually
      approach
      are
      already
      coming
      across
      as
      confident,
      sociable
      and
      approachable.
      I
      would
      never
      approach
      a
      shy
      woman
      or
      someone
      who
      seem
      to
      not
      want
      to
      be
      disturbed.
      These
      type
      of
      women
      tend
      to
      live
      in
      their
      own
      world
      (no
      disrespect,
      I'm
      reffering
      in
      general
      )
      and
      chances
      to
      have
      sex
      with
      someone
      like
      that
      are
      really
      slim.
      Although
      they
      are
      decent
      women,
      they
      are
      a
      bit
      too
      decent
      for
      me.
      They
      want
      a
      man
      to
      invest
      in
      them
      -
      time,
      courtship,
      dinners,
      walking
      on
      the
      beach
      and
      then
      next
      step
      is
      getting
      married.
      Same
      as
      women
      are
      attracted
      to
      confident
      men,
      men
      are
      attracted
      to
      confident
      women.
      A
      confident
      woman
      is
      already
      open-minded,
      knows
      what
      she
      wants
      and
      she's
      not
      afraid
      to
      say
      it.
      They
      don't
      giggle
      when
      we
      talk
      about
      sex
      and
      they
      are
      emotionaly
      mature
      enough
      to
      get
      over
      me
      in
      case
      things
      don't
      last.
      Since
      forever,
      men
      are
      known
      to
      be
      the
      ones
      doing
      the
      approach,
      so
      I'm
      just
      doing
      my
      job.

      Could
      you
      please
      share
      why
      do
      you
      think
      that?
      I
      mean,
      in
      a
      grocery
      store
      a
      woman
      won't
      feel
      threatened
      compared
      to
      other
      places
      where
      there
      is
      none
      or
      much
      people
      around.
      It
      only
      takes
      a
      minute
      to
      ask
      the
      question
      and
      if
      the
      woman
      is
      not
      interested
      she
      can
      cut
      me
      off
      immediately.
      There
      are
      lots
      of
      things
      to
      pick
      on
      in
      order
      to
      break
      the
      ice
      and
      open
      a
      conversation.
      A
      grocery
      store,
      is
      a
      place
      where
      people
      do
      like
      to
      socialise
      (at
      least
      in
      England).
      I
      do
      get
      rejected
      here
      and
      there
      for
      different
      reasons
      but
      most
      of
      the
      times
      I
      find
      these
      places
      to
      be
      a
      success.

      Thank
      you
      for
      explaining,
      really
      appreciate
      it.
      Yes,
      I
      think
      it's
      more
      of
      a
      matter
      of
      mentality
      when
      it
      comes
      to
      different
      countries.
      In
      England
      it's
      very
      rare
      to
      see
      anyone
      with
      headphones
      in
      their
      ears
      while
      in
      grocery
      store.

      "can
      you
      do
      me
      a
      favour?",
      you
      should
      answer
      with
      "not
      at
      the
      moment,
      but
      since
      you're
      here
      can
      you
      please
      (insert
      here
      new
      task
      for
      her
      to
      do)".
      If
      she
      does
      what
      you've
      asked,
      then
      ask
      her
      what
      was
      the
      favour
      she
      needed
      earlier
      and
      offer
      to
      help.
      If
      she
      finds
      excuses
      and
      refuses
      to
      do
      what
      you
      asked,
      then
      you
      can
      politely
      say
      "so
      you
      want
      me
      to
      help
      you
      out
      with
      things
      but
      you
      can't
      help
      me
      out
      when
      I
      ask
      you?".
      This
      will
      set
      a
      ground
      for
      equality
      as
      well
      as
      a
      precedent.
      She
      will
      probably
      avoid
      asking
      you
      for
      favours
      in
      the
      future
      as
      she
      now
      knows
      that
      you
      will
      also
      boss
      her
      around.

      I've
      been
      with
      women
      30
      years
      older
      than
      me
      and
      in
      the
      same
      time
      11
      years
      younger.
      Older
      women
      seem
      to
      be
      so
      much
      more
      interesting,
      experienced
      and
      eager
      to
      please.
      The
      younger
      ones...I
      can't
      connect.
      I
      can't
      find
      anything
      in
      common
      to
      discuss
      about
      and
      usually
      it
      gets
      awkward.
      But
      again
      it
      depends
      of
      the
      woman,
      as
      you
      could
      find
      someone
      who's
      50
      and
      she
      thinks
      like
      someone
      who's
      16.

      We
      were
      in
      the
      park
      for
      a
      walk
      on
      the
      first
      date
      and
      she
      was
      carrying
      a
      small
      bottle
      of
      coke.
      After
      she
      finished
      drinking
      it,
      she
      threw
      the
      empty
      bottle
      over
      her
      shoulder.
      No
      second
      date.
      I've
      explained
      to
      her
      that
      currently
      there
      are
      over
      100
      million
      tons
      of
      plastic
      in
      the
      ocean
      around
      the
      world,
      which
      kills
      over
      100
      million
      marine
      animals
      each
      year.
      About
      80%
      of
      polution
      enters
      the
      ocean
      from
      the
      land.
      All
      the
      countries
      (especially
      UK)
      are
      fighting
      to
      reduce
      use
      of
      plastic
      and
      decrease
      polution.
      She
      said
      "whatever".
      Funny
      enough,
      she
      had
      three
      tattoos
      of
      animals
      which
      she
      was
      very
      proud
      of
      and
      she
      told
      me
      before
      we
      met
      that
      for
      her
      animals
      comes
      before
      people.

      A
      hot
      woman
      would
      probably
      message
      you
      and
      ask
      if
      that
      still
      available.
      After
      you
      desperately
      say
      "yes"
      and
      give
      her
      your
      address,
      she
      will
      send
      her
      grandma
      at
      your
      place.
      I
      bet
      her
      glutes
      are
      looking
      tense
      too.
      Good

      Lots
      of
      great
      advice
      here.
      Probably
      someone
      already
      said
      this
      to
      you
      but
      just
      do
      it.
      Don't
      think
      about
      it.
      Don't
      process
      the
      thoughts.
      Don't
      even
      blink.
      When
      there
      is
      an
      opportunity,
      just
      go
      to
      her
      and
      say
      "hi".
      You'll
      figure
      everything
      else
      after
      you
      say
      "hi".
      The
      more
      you
      do
      it,
      the
      easier
      it
      gets.
      To
      answer
      the
      question,
      I
      do
      have
      my
      own
      regrets.
      I
      used
      to
      overthink
      a
      lot
      and
      I
      was
      backing
      off
      because
      of
      my
      previous
      insecurities.
      But
      I
      kept
      trying
      and
      trying
      and
      today
      I
      don't
      even
      think
      about
      it
      anymore,
      I
      just
      do
      it
      automatically.

      When
      I
      was
      15
      I've
      worked
      for
      a
      research
      company
      called
      "Galup".
      They
      got
      a
      contract
      with
      a
      company
      who
      invented
      some
      new
      type
      of
      crisps,
      and
      the
      crisps
      company
      wanted
      feedback
      from
      people
      to
      see
      if
      it's
      worth
      producing
      them
      on
      a
      bigger
      scale.
      So
      I
      literally
      had
      to
      stop
      people
      from
      walking
      on
      the
      side
      of
      the
      road
      and
      asking
      them
      to
      come
      with
      me
      in
      a
      hotel
      meeting
      room
      which
      was
      near
      by
      and
      I
      had
      to
      give
      them
      3
      plates
      with
      crisps
      which
      were
      all
      different
      but
      the
      client
      wouldn't
      know
      which
      is
      which
      and
      he
      /
      she
      would
      have
      to
      taste
      them
      all
      and
      answer
      some
      questions.
      I
      was
      getting
      paid
       #163;15
      for
      each
      person
      who
      would
      taste
      the
      crisps
      and
      answer
      the
      questions.
      Not
      only
      that
      I
      made
      a
      lot
      of
      money
      with
      that
      project,
      but
      at
      the
      end
      of
      the
      day
      I
      was
      getting
      all
      the
      crisps
      at
      home
      as
      they
      had
      to
      bring
      in
      new
      fresh
      ones.
      One
      day
      I
      took
      two
      full
      bin
      bags
      of
      crisps
      (had
      nothing
      else
      to
      carry
      them,
      lol).
      And
      also
      this
      is
      how
      I
      met
      my
      first
      girlfriend
      (now
      ex)
      who
      I've
      been
      7
      years
      together
      with.

      I'm
      very
      familiar
      with
      this
      drug.
      Scopolamine,
      also
      known
      as
      "devil's
      breath"
      or
      "burundanga".
      It's
      made
      from
      the
      extracts
      of
      plants
      in
      the
      nightshade
      family
      such
      as
      henbane
      and
      jimson
      weed.
      It's
      a
      deliriant,
      meaning
      it
      can
      induce
      symptoms
      of
      delirium
      such
      as
      disorientation,
      loss
      of
      memory,
      hallucinations,
      and
      stupor.
      It
      is
      indeed
      used
      as
      a
      rape
      drug.
      Most
      often,
      the
      rapist
      will
      blow
      it
      into
      the
      victims
      face
      as
      its
      a
      white
      powder.
      They
      also
      can
      put
      them
      on
      Maps
      and
      stop
      someone
      (victim)
      and
      ask
      for
      directions
      and
      when
      the
      victim
      will
      get
      closer
      to
      the
      map
      to
      have
      a
      look,
      they
      will
      sniff
      the
      drug
      without
      knowing.
      It
      is
      used
      in
      different
      ways
      and
      it's
      very
      effective.
      Most
      common
      reactions
      include
      disorientation
      (loss
      of
      common
      sense
      and
      control)
      and
      loss
      of
      memory.
      The
      abuser
      can
      make
      you
      cash
      out
      money
      from
      your
      card
      and
      you
      won't
      remember
      a
      thing
      after
      that.
      Also
      they
      can
      rape
      you
      and
      you
      won't
      know
      what
      happened
      when
      you
      wake
      up
      as
      you
      have
      no
      memory.
      If
      given
      a
      large
      quantity,
      it
      can
      and
      will
      cause
      death.
      It
      will
      also
      cause
      death
      if
      you
      suffer
      from
      different
      medical
      conditions
      which
      might
      make
      the
      effort
      of
      Scopolamine
      fatal.
      It's
      also
      very
      hard
      if
      not
      impossible
      to
      trace
      it
      into
      the
      body
      /
      blood
      after
      24
      hours
      or
      even
      less
      (depending
      on
      the
      quantity
      ingested
      and
      other
      biological
      factors).
      Your
      friend
      (?)
      most
      definitely
      sniffed
      Scopolamine
      while
      someone
      was
      near
      her
      ears.
      Scopolamine
      won't
      have
      any
      effect
      if
      blown
      into
      the
      ears,
      but
      because
      the
      powder
      light
      constitution,
      it's
      very
      easy
      to
      be
      sniffed
      from
      the
      air.
      It
      is
      also
      an
      highly
      illegal
      and
      very
      dangerous
      drug.

      years

      No,
      not
      only
      because
      of
      your
      experience
      but
      I
      get
      to
      see
      more
      and
      more
      examples
      like
      this.
      I've
      been
      reading
      on
      another
      subbredit
      earlier
      about
      a
      husband
      who's
      wife
      wanted
      a
      divorce
      all
      of
      a
      sudden
      after
      11
      years
      or
      so
      and
      they
      had
      a
      9
      months
      old
      baby.
      I
      look
      at
      married
      friends
      and
      they
      all
      feel
      drained
      and
      unhappy
      after
      2-3
      years.
      You
      invest
      your
      time
      in
      someone.
      Your
      feelings.
      You
      try
      to
      be
      the
      best
      version
      of
      yourself
      so
      you
      make
      the
      other
      half
      happy.
      And
      all
      this
      just
      so
      one
      day
      one
      of
      them
      decides
      that
      "she's
      /he's
      not
      feeling
      it
      anymore".
      I
      chose
      to
      be
      my
      own
      source
      of
      happiness
      so
      no
      one
      could
      hurt
      me.
      I
      feel
      happy
      that
      you
      now
      found
      someone
      and
      you're
      happy
      with.
      I
      hope
      it
      will
      work
      out
      great
      until
      you
      get
      to
      be
      100
      years
      old.
      If
      you're
      still
      going
      to
      be
      on
      reddit,
      please
      reply
      and
      tell
      me
      if
      it
      was
      worth
      it.
      I
      might
      take
      a
      chance
      then
      :)

      Hey
      Your
      bio
      matters
      a
      lot.
      You
      should
      make
      it
      funny
      but
      in
      the
      same
      time
      say
      a
      few
      things
      about
      yourself.
      Women
      want
      to
      know
      if
      it's
      worth
      matching
      and
      having
      a
      conversation
      with
      you
      or
      if
      you
      might
      be
      just
      a
      waste
      of
      time.
      In
      my
      bio
      I
      have
      something
      like
      "my
      wife
      is
      really
      busy"
      and
      at
      the
      end
      I
      write
      "P.S.
      I
      meant
      my
      LIFE
      is
      really
      busy".
      I'm
      not
      saying
      that
      I
      have
      a
      sense
      of
      humour,
      but
      I'm
      actually
      proving
      that
      I
      do
      have.
      I
      also
      write
      a
      few
      words
      about
      my
      hobbies
      and
      personality.
      The
      wording
      should
      sound
      relatively
      smart
      and
      have
      good
      grammar.
      Pictures
      matter
      a
      lot
      more
      than
      description,
      unfortunately.
      Especially
      on
      Tinder,
      it's
      the
      first
      thing
      which
      will
      get
      her
      attention
      and
      make
      her
      look
      deeper
      into
      your
      profile.
      Solo
      pictures
      are
      more
      than
      fine,
      but
      they
      shouldn't
      be
      all
      the
      same.
      Try
      and
      put
      some
      pictures
      doing
      different
      things
      /
      activities.
      Get
      a
      friend
      and
      go
      out
      and
      take
      some
      pictures
      doing
      stuff.
      Would
      be
      really
      helpful
      if
      it
      looks
      like
      you're
      having
      fun,
      smiling
      or
      laughing
      and
      make
      sure
      you
      don't
      wear
      the
      same
      clothes
      in
      every
      picture.
      Finally,
      when
      you
      match
      with
      someone,
      you
      should
      start
      chatting.
      Don't
      wait
      for
      her
      to
      make
      the
      first
      move,
      just
      go
      for
      it.
      I
      usually
      say
      something
      like
      "Hey
      [name],
      how's
      your
      day
      going?".
      Have
      a
      bit
      of
      chit
      chat
      and
      then
      ask
      her
      for
      her
      number,
      or
      a
      date.
      You
      don't
      want
      to
      waste
      your
      time
      chatting
      with
      strangers,
      you
      want
      to
      go
      on
      a
      date.
      If
      she's
      up
      for
      it,
      great.
      If
      not,
      then
      there
      are
      others
      waiting
      to
      match
      with
      you
      and
      go
      on
      a
      date.
      I
      try
      and
      meetup
      as
      soon
      as
      I
      know
      I'll
      have
      the
      time
      to
      go
      on
      a
      date.
      It
      could
      be
      tommorow
      or
      this
      weekend.
      I
      let
      her
      find
      excuses
      once
      or
      twice
      as
      I
      understand
      that
      people
      are
      busy
      and
      their
      life
      doesn't
      revolve
      around
      me.
      If
      she
      says
      something
      like
      "I
      can't
      tomorrow
      but
      will
      date
      Saturday
      ",
      I
      know
      that
      she
      wants
      to
      but
      it's
      just
      a
      matter
      of
      time.
      Once
      I
      get
      her
      number,
      we
      chat
      on
      WhatsApp.
      I
      never
      ever
      call
      before
      dating
      but
      I
      guess
      it's
      a
      personal
      preference.
      Hope
      it
      helps.

      You
      should
      try
      laser.
      You
      do
      a
      few
      sessions
      (usually
      about
      6)
      and
      it

      about
      81%
      less
      pain
      compared
      to
      waxing.

      Does
      it
      specify
      in
      the

      that

      How
      much
      you
      pay
      for
      waxing
      every
      single
      time?
      How
      often?
      Now
      multiply
      that
      with
      the
      number
      of
      years
      which
      you
      think
      waxing
      will
      still
      be
      relevant
      (I
      don't
      think
      my
      grandma
      still
      does
      it).
      That
      is
      a
      lot
      of
      money.
      In
      UK,
      to
      laser
      my
      whole
      pubic
      area
      including
      balls
      and
      even
      a
      bit
      down
      the
      leg
      +
      the
      line
      up
      to
      my
      belly
      button
      costed
      me
       #163;160
      per
      session
      and
      I
      needed
      5
      sessions.
      That
      a
      total
      of
       #163;800
      or
      roughly
      $1100.
      I
      need
      to
      go
      every
      3
      or
      4
      years
      for
      one
      single
      session
      to
      kill
      those
      hair
      follicles
      which
      are
      super
      motivated
      and
      don't
      know
      when
      to
      quit.
      However,
      even
      if
      you
      don't
      go
      after
      4
      years
      for
      that
      one
      session,
      you
      don't
      have
      hair
      but
      it's
      more
      like
      fluff
      and
      most
      of
      the
      times
      that
      fluff
      only
      appears
      in
      a
      certain
      area.
      And
      to
      pay
       #163;160
      every
      4
      years
      is
      not
      bad.
      My
      skin
      now
      is
      very
      very
      smooth.
      No
      more
      red
      spots,
      ingrown
      hairs,
      irritation
      from
      shaving
      /
      waxing,
      etc.
      Laser
      can
      be
      also
      done
      on
      any
      part
      of
      the
      body
      including
      between
      butt
      cheeks
      and
      face.
      I
      don't
      recommend
      laser
      on
      face
      for
      a
      man
      as
      it
      will
      make
      you
      look
      like
      a
      baby.

      One
      minute?
      The
      lady
      who
      was
      doing
      me,
      done
      it
      for
      about
      20
      minutes
      every
      time.
      As
      for
      the
      pain,
      everyone
      seems
      to
      perceive
      the
      pain
      different.
      For
      me
      it
      was
      painless,
      more
      like
      someone
      was
      tickling
      me.
      I
      have
      a
      female
      friend
      who
      said
      that
      for
      her
      it
      hurt
      a
      lot
      but
      not
      as
      much
      as
      waxing.

      I
      feel
      like
      that
      1%
      makes
      your

      less

      Especially

      something
      as
      nebulous
      and
      subjective
      as
      a
      person's
      positive
      feelings.
      All

      seems
      a

      sketchy
      to

      You

      Especially

      You
      could
      start
      with
      "You're
      a
      badass"
      by
      Jen
      Sincero.
      It
      will
      help
      you
      get
      to
      know
      and

      yourself
      to
      a
      very
      deep
      level.
      It

      make

      why
      you
      think
      the

      and
      why
      you
      behave
      the
      way
      you
      behave.
      After
      you
      finish
      that
      book,
      your
      outlook
      on
      life
      will
      be

      About
      8
      years
      ago
      I
      used
      to
      live
      in
      a
      flat
      with
      my
      then
      girlfriend.
      After
      a
      14
      hrs
      shift,
      I
      returned
      "home".
      I
      got
      in
      as
      the
      door
      was
      unlocked,
      left
      my
      shoes
      at
      the
      entrance
      and
      went
      in
      the
      living
      room.
      The
      lights
      were
      off
      but
      the
      TV
      was
      already
      on
      so
      I
      just
      took
      a
      sit
      on
      the
      sofa,
      put
      my
      feet
      on
      the
      coffee
      table
      and
      I
      was
      waiting
      for
      my
      then
      girlfriend
      to
      come
      out
      from
      the
      bedroom
      and
      greet
      me
      at
      some
      point.
      About
      10
      minutes
      later,
      an
      80
      years
      old
      lady
      comes
      out
      from
      the
      bedroom
      in
      a
      dressing
      gawn.
      I
      froze.
      It
      was
      midnight,
      I
      was
      at
      home
      where
      it
      was
      supposed
      to
      be
      just
      me
      and
      my
      girlfriend.
      But
      all
      I
      could
      see
      was
      an
      80
      years
      old
      lady
      in
      a
      dressing
      gawn.
      I
      was
      sure
      I
      didn't
      knew
      her.
      I
      was
      sure
      she
      wasn't
      there
      to
      rob
      us
      at
      that
      age,
      but
      I
      couldn't
      understand
      what
      was
      she
      doing
      in
      our
      flat
      in
      a
      dressing
      gawn
      at
      midnight
      wandering
      around.
      She
      seemed
      to
      be
      as
      shocked
      as
      I
      was.
      We
      just
      stood
      there
      for
      a
      while
      looking
      at
      each
      other,
      waiting
      for
      each
      other
      to
      make
      a
      move.
      Those
      few
      seconds
      or
      perhaps
      minutes,
      felt
      like
      an
      eternity.
      Meanwhile,
      my
      girlfriend
      was
      calling
      me
      wondering
      why
      I'm
      not
      home
      yet.
      And
      this
      is
      how
      I
      met
      my
      neighbour
      from
      the
      flat
      below
      mine.

      Hey
      there
      buddy.
      Don't
      lose
      hope,
      things
      will
      turn
      up
      to
      be
      better
      with
      time.
      All
      you
      need
      to
      do
      is
      work
      hard
      while
      figuring
      out
      a
      way
      to
      work
      smarter.
      Nothing
      is
      impossible
      these
      days
      and
      you
      live
      in
      a
      world
      full
      of
      options.
      All
      you
      need
      is
      to
      find
      your
      "thing"
      and
      make
      a
      living
      out
      of
      it.
      I
      wouldn't
      invest
      if
      I
      was
      you,
      especially
      I
      wouldn't
      invest
      in
      cryptocurency
      as
      the
      risk
      of
      losing
      money
      is
      very
      high.
      And
      if
      you're
      stubborn
      and
      still
      want
      to
      take
      a
      chance,
      at
      least
      I
      wouldn't
      invest
      in
      ocn.
      Have
      a
      look
      at
      xrp
      instead
      perhaps?
      OCN
      is
      not
      going
      anywhere
      anymore,
      trust
      me.
      People
      got
      their
      10x
      gains
      from
      ICO
      and
      all
      what's
      left
      are
      people
      who
      wish
      and
      dream.
      Don't
      rely
      on
      crypto
      to
      become
      rich.
      If
      it
      happens
      to
      make
      money
      out
      of
      it,
      great.
      But
      there
      are
      bigger
      chances
      to
      not
      make
      money
      out
      of
      it
      and
      then
      you
      might
      have
      lost
      more
      than
      you
      could
      afford
      to.
      I
      wish
      you
      success
      and
      stay
      strong.
      With
      time,
      work
      and
      effort,
      your
      luck
      will
      change.

      You're
      going
      to
      be
      fine,
      don't
      stress
      about
      it.
      But
      if
      you
      keep
      drink
      it
      in
      large
      quantities,
      your
      bones
      will
      get
      weaker
      with
      time.
      Your
      post
      reminded
      me
      of
      when
      I
      was
      your
      age.
      When
      I
      was
      14
      I
      smoked
      my
      first
      cigarette.
      Few
      days
      later
      I
      smoked
      two
      cigarettes
      in
      a
      day.
      I
      was
      sure
      I
      will
      get
      cancer
      on
      that
      day.
      I
      was
      just
      laying
      on
      the
      bed
      waiting
      for
      the
      cancer
      to
      take
      over
      me,
      while
      I
      was
      regreting
      my
      life
      choices.

      Up
      to
      15
      years
      old,
      I
      thought
      the
      clitoris
      was
      a
      hole.
      I've
      overheard
      some
      highschool
      colleagues
      saying
      that
      he
      put
      his
      penis
      in
      both
      holes.
      When
      I
      had
      sex
      for
      the
      first
      time
      and
      I
      found
      out
      that
      the
      clitoris
      wasn't
      a
      hole,
      I
      was
      really
      depresed.
      Then,
      when
      I
      found
      out
      what
      the
      second
      hole
      was...my
      sexual
      life
      went
      from
      exciting
      to
      disgusting
      in
      less
      than
      a
      second.
      Second
      time,
      the
      same
      girl
      was
      about
      to
      take
      my
      penis
      in
      her
      mouth.
      For
      a
      good
      few
      seconds
      I
      thought
      she
      wanted
      to
      eat
      it
      and
      I
      was
      really
      scared.
      I
      was
      born
      in
      a
      third
      world
      country
      where
      they
      weren't
      teaching
      sexual
      education
      in
      schools
      and
      I
      never
      touched
      a
      computer
      or
      heard
      about
      porn
      until
      I
      was
      17
      years
      old.

      Not
      true.
      Do
      you
      know
      how
      much
      are
      the
      annual
      maintenance
      costs
      for
      a
      $300
      million
      ship?
      A
      $10
      million
      ship
      would
      set
      you
      back
      $1
      million
      a
      year
      in
      operational
      costs.
      Fuel
      (lots
      of
      it),
      vessel
      insurance,
      dockage
      fees,
      maintenance
      and
      repairs,
      and
      crew
      salaries
      are
      typically
      the
      heftiest
      running
      costs.
      Dockage
      fees
      can
      run
      about
      $350,000
      and
      insurance
      about
      $240,000.
      Now
      multiply
      that
      by
      30
      in
      order
      to
      get
      the
      costs
      for
      a
      $300
      million
      ship.

      That
      very
      well
      said
      and
      I'm
      the
      living
      proof
      of
      this
      concept.
      The
      first
      girl
      I
      met,
      turned
      into
      a
      7
      years
      relationship.
      All
      I
      ever
      wanted
      was
      a
      serious
      relationship.
      After
      our
      relationship
      ended
      and
      after
      I
      gave
      myself
      enough
      time
      to
      heal,
      I
      discovered
      dating
      apps
      and
      I
      started
      to
      look
      for
      a
      new
      girlfriend.
      After
      a
      few
      dates
      with
      a
      few
      women,
      I
      kind
      of
      got
      to
      enjoy
      the
      attention
      I
      was
      receiving
      and
      the
      sex
      with
      no
      commitments.
      I
      mean,
      having
      the
      freedom
      to
      have
      sex
      with
      anyone,
      anytime,
      without
      worrying
      about
      cheating,
      nagging,
      jealousy,
      trust
      issues,
      arguments,
      etc,
      that
      was
      (and
      still
      is)
      fantastic.
      If
      I
      want
      to
      have
      sex
      now,
      I'm
      just
      texting
      a
      fwb
      or
      go
      on
      Tinder
      and
      find
      someone
      to
      sort
      things
      out.
      I
      don't
      have
      to
      worry
      that
      my
      girlfriend
      might
      not
      be
      in
      the
      mood.
      I'm
      a
      man
      of
      options
      and
      I
      enjoy
      my
      freedom
      and
      my
      peaceful
      life.
      My
      confidence
      skyrocketed,
      my
      ego
      got
      a
      boost,
      I
      became
      better
      at
      dating
      because
      of
      the
      numerous
      dates
      I
      had,
      I
      became
      better
      in
      bed
      thanks
      to
      all
      the
      sexual
      experiences
      I
      had
      with
      different
      women.
      My
      friends
      are
      married
      and
      have
      children.
      Most
      of
      them
      are
      unhappy
      after
      few
      years
      with
      their
      wife
      but
      they
      stay
      in
      because
      of
      the
      children.
      I
      refuse
      to
      put
      myself
      in
      that
      position.
      Some
      friends
      have
      girlfriends
      and
      they
      argue
      now
      and
      then,
      they
      get
      their
      feelings
      hurt,
      they
      don't
      feel
      appreciated
      enough,
      they
      go
      through
      nights
      without
      sleep
      having
      arguments
      in
      the
      name
      of
      love.
      Why?
      Why
      would
      I
      put
      myself
      in
      that
      position?
      Why
      shall
      I
      disturb
      my
      inner
      peace
      because
      my
      other
      half
      doesn't
      understand
      me,
      or
      wants
      to
      fight,
      or
      has
      trust
      issues
      or
      is
      jealous
      or
      etc.
      Just
      why?
      When
      you
      can
      have
      the
      sex
      and
      all
      the
      good
      and
      fun
      moments
      with
      someone,
      anytime,
      without
      investing
      feelings
      in
      someone.
      I
      believe
      all
      women
      are
      amazing,
      because
      now
      I
      don't
      get
      to
      see
      their
      dark
      side.
      They're
      problems
      are
      not
      my
      problem.
      I'm
      not
      afraid
      of
      a
      divorce.
      The
      rate
      of
      divorce
      in
      America
      is
      about
      50%.
      The
      rate
      of
      divorce
      in
      UK
      is
      about
      45%.
      I
      don't
      want
      to
      be
      part
      of
      that.
      Also,
      I'm
      not
      afraid
      of
      becoming
      a
      single
      father
      (I'm
      clipped).
      I'm
      not
      afraid
      that
      someday
      I'll
      get
      hurt
      as
      I
      don't
      invest
      my
      feelings
      in
      anyone.
      I'm
      happy
      and
      I've
      been
      happy
      since
      the
      day
      I
      became
      single.
      I'm
      not
      bragging
      and
      without
      sounding
      arrogant,
      if
      a
      date
      fails,
      I
      have
      other
      10
      women
      waiting
      to
      date.
      If
      one
      of
      my
      fwb
      disappears,
      I
      can
      get
      10
      others
      fwb
      to
      replace
      her.
      This
      post
      might
      make
      me
      sound
      like
      a
      narcissistic
      person,
      but
      I
      can
      assure
      you
      that
      this
      is
      not
      the
      case.
      I'm
      just
      showing
      that
      I'll
      never
      get
      to
      truly
      appreciate
      someone
      and
      invest
      in
      them,
      because
      I
      know
      for
      a
      fact
      that
      I
      can
      always
      find
      someone
      else
      who
      might
      be
      better
      in
      a
      way
      or
      another
      and
      there
      are
      plenty
      of
      fish
      in
      the
      sea.
      Why
      settle?
      I'm
      an
      average
      looking
      man
      and
      still
      get
      lots
      of
      matches.
      Even
      men
      who
      are
      below
      average
      looking
      still
      get
      lots
      of
      matches,
      because
      there
      are
      enough
      women
      to
      satisfy
      anyone
      and
      there
      are
      enough
      dating
      apps
      to
      find
      someone
      and
      make
      things
      happen.
      Few
      years
      ago,
      I
      would
      of
      been
      disgusted
      with
      the

      I

      Now,
      thanks
      to
      dating

      I
      wouldn't

      It

      I
      have
      friends
      and
      mentors
      to
      confide
      in.
      As
      for
      my
      dark
      side,
      I'm
      a
      really
      mentally
      stable
      person
      but
      if
      necessary
      I
      can
      go
      and
      speak
      with
      psychologist.
      Most
      of
      the
      times
      a
      professional
      would
      make
      you
      realise
      what
      you're
      doing
      wrong
      and
      what
      needs
      changing
      to
      make
      it
      right.
      A
      girlfriend
      /
      wife
      would
      probably
      just
      comfort
      you,
      which
      doesn't
      necessarily
      solves
      anything.
      And
      no,
      I
      don't
      miss
      the
      cuddles
      or
      spending
      those
      little
      moments
      with
      someone.
      Quite
      the
      contrary,
      I'm
      spending
      time
      with
      different
      women
      who
      provide
      that
      emotional
      satisfaction
      /
      girlfriend
      experience.
      I
      cuddle
      with
      them
      while
      staying
      overnight
      and
      watching
      TV
      or
      having
      deep
      conversations
      about
      everything
      and
      nothing.
      I
      go
      in
      holidays
      with
      them
      (we
      cover
      our
      own
      costs).
      I
      go
      out
      eating
      and
      doing
      fun
      things
      together.
      I
      live
      everything
      with
      the
      same
      intensity
      as
      in
      a
      committed
      relationship,
      with
      the
      only
      difference
      that
      we
      both
      know
      that
      it's
      not
      going
      anywhere.
      And
      you're
      right.
      I
      did
      stated
      mostly
      the
      negative
      sides
      of
      a
      relationship.
      A
      relationship
      can
      be
      beautiful
      and
      sometimes
      incomparable
      with
      any
      fwb
      experience,
      I
      just
      don't
      want
      to
      put
      the
      effort
      in
      anymore.
      I
      cherish
      my
      freedom,
      my
      inner
      peace
      and
      mental
      health
      more
      than
      anything.
      Why
      let
      anyone
      in
      to
      disturb
      anything
      since
      I'm
      already
      happy
      and
      content?
      In
      5
      years
      time
      there
      is
      the
      risk
      of
      getting
      a
      divorce.
      That
      5
      years
      I
      will
      never
      get
      back.
      That
      5
      years
      of
      missed
      experiences
      with
      so
      many
      other
      wonderful
      people.
      That
      5
      years
      of
      commitment
      and
      sacrifices
      to
      make
      the
      other
      half
      happy.
      If
      I
      learned
      anything
      so
      far,
      is
      that
      in
      life
      nothing
      is
      for
      sure
      or
      forever,
      other
      than
      death.

      I
      don't
      care
      about
      boobs
      at
      all.
      I'm
      not
      turned
      on
      by
      them.
      I
      don't
      want
      or
      care
      about
      feeling
      them
      or
      even
      touching
      them
      (unless
      I'm
      trying
      to
      turn
      her
      on).
      There
      could
      be
      women
      half
      naked
      around
      me
      showing
      their
      boobs
      and
      I'd
      still
      only
      be
      looking
      at
      their
      ass.
      I
      don't
      care
      if
      they're
      small,
      big
      or
      medium.
      I
      don't
      care
      about
      their
      shape
      or
      about
      the
      nipples.
      Funny
      thing,
      one
      of
      my
      ex
      invested
      few
      thousands
      in
      boobs
      job
      and
      then
      she
      met
      me.

      I
      had
      a

      We

      and
      while
      having

      I
      stopped

      "Your

      What
      do
      you
      think
      his
      boss
      is
      going
      to
      do?
      The
      boss
      will
      start
      collecting
      empty
      bottles
      and
      cans
      to
      make
      some
      money?
      I'd
      I'd
      be
      his
      boss,
      I
      would
      be
      glad
      that
      he
      is
      taking
      the
      empty
      bottles
      /
      cups
      /
      cans
      away
      to
      be
      fair.
      The
      recycling
      bin
      can
      get
      full
      very
      fast
      which
      might
      be
      unconvient,
      which
      might
      cost
      him
      even
      more
      to
      get
      it
      emptied
      several
      times.
      There
      won't
      be
      any
      random
      empty
      bottles
      laying
      around
      the
      shop
      /
      bar
      which
      might
      display
      a
      bad
      image.
      As
      a
      boss,
      you're
      supposed
      to
      encourage
      and
      support
      your
      employees
      all
      the
      times.
      The
      boss
      is
      already
      making
      profit
      from
      selling
      the
      drinks.
      No
      one
      cares
      about
      the
      empty
      bottle.
      If
      the
      boss
      would
      care
      about
      the
      empty
      bottle,
      he
      wouldn't
      be
      able
      to
      afford
      having
      employees.
      I
      think
      you
      might
      save
      some
      money
      and
      perhaps
      you'll
      get
      your
      car
      home
      at
      some
      point.
      The
      main
      problem
      here
      is
      that
      your
      business
      model
      is
      not
      very
      much
      time
      or
      money
      efficient.
      If
      you
      collect
      hundreds
      of
      empty
      bottles,
      that
      is
      a
      big
      volume
      of
      material.
      How
      are
      you
      going
      to
      transport
      all
      that
      to
      the
      recycling
      center?
      You
      need
      to
      calculate
      your
      fuel
      if
      you
      do
      several
      trips
      and
      also
      need
      to
      take
      into
      account
      how
      much
      time
      you're
      spending
      with
      all
      this.
      Collecting.
      Storing.
      Packing.
      Transporting.
      Unloading.
      Even
      if
      it
      sounds
      like
      a
      small
      job,
      you
      do
      need
      a
      small
      business
      plan
      to
      see
      if
      you're
      actually
      making
      any
      profit
      out
      of
      it
      and
      if
      you
      do,
      you
      need
      to
      ask
      yourself
      if
      it's
      worth
      doing
      all
      tag
      work
      for
      that
      profit.
      You
      might
      come
      to
      the
      realisation
      that
      you
      could
      make
      the
      same
      money
      just
      by
      working
      an
      extra
      hour
      or
      two
      a
      week
      at
      your
      job.
      Or
      perhaps,
      maybe
      it's
      worth
      looking
      for
      a
      part
      time
      job
      along
      with
      your
      full
      time
      one?
      Nothing
      is
      impossible,
      just
      always
      make
      sure
      that
      whatever
      you
      do,
      it's
      worth
      it.

      When
      I
      was
      17
      and
      was
      about
      to
      have
      sex
      for
      the
      first
      time,
      I've
      asked
      my
      then
      girlfriend
      if
      she
      wanted
      me
      to
      put
      it
      in
      her
      vagina
      or
      in
      her
      clitoris.

      Man
      with
      over
      600
      matches
      here.
      I've
      had
      a
      Tinder
      Profile
      and
      I've
      put
      normal
      pictures
      (holidays,
      doing
      activities,
      me
      and
      my
      car,
      etc).
      I've
      written
      a
      funny
      but
      detailed
      description
      and
      I
      was
      getting
      about
      6-7
      out
      of
      10
      numbers.
      Some
      ended
      up
      in
      sex.
      Some
      ended
      up
      in
      just
      going
      for
      a
      walk.
      Some
      ended
      up
      in
      my
      pile
      of
      forgotten
      conversations
      on
      WhatsApp.
      Then
      I've
      changed
      my
      Tinder
      description
      to
      something
      like
      "I'm
      here
      looking
      just
      for
      sex,
      no
      commitments,
      no
      drama.
      Happy
      to
      pay
      for
      hotel
      room
      and
      dinner".
      I
      kid
      you
      not
      that
      to
      my
      surprise
      I
      am
      getting
      every
      match's
      numbers.
      That
      10/10.
      And
      not
      only
      that
      I'm
      getting
      all
      their
      numbers
      but
      my
      match
      rate
      per
      day
      increased
      too.
      I
      was
      using
      Tinder
      the
      wrong
      way.
      The
      hard
      way.
      Wish
      I
      have
      done
      this
      from
      the
      beginning
      as
      it
      would
      of
      saved
      me
      a
      lot
      of
      time
      in
      endless
      conversations
      going
      nowhere.
      Then
      I've
      tried
      the
      same
      trick
      on
      Bumble
      and
      I
      am
      not
      getting
      matches
      anymore
      there.

      I
      believe
      I'm
      average
      looking.
      Altough
      I
      am
      6'7"
      and
      have
      a
      4
      pack
      and
      half
      with
      11%
      body
      fat
      which
      I
      think
      helps.
      I
      make
      sure
      that
      I'm
      always
      dressed
      nice
      (no
      brand
      names
      except
      for
      the
      shoes).
      I've
      invested
      some
      money
      into
      tailored
      made
      clothes
      like
      casual
      jeans
      and
      casual
      shirts
      and
      definitely
      worth
      every
      penny
      (iTailor
      website
      was
      always
      my
      choice
      and
      never
      disappointed
      me).
      Then
      I
      also
      go
      once
      a
      month
      to
      the
      saloon
      and
      have
      my
      eyebrows
      done
      as
      I
      don't
      want
      to
      have
      a
      monobrow.
      I
      use
      cleansing
      products
      for
      face
      before
      bed
      and
      in
      the
      morning
      along
      with
      moisturiser,
      for
      a
      good
      radiant
      skin
      (because
      I'm
      worth
      it,
      haha).
      I'm
      basically
      showing
      through
      the
      way
      I
      look
      and
      dress,
      my
      personality.
      Women
      seem
      to
      be
      attracted
      to
      men
      who
      dress
      well
      and
      look
      after
      themselves
      (which
      I
      think
      it's
      available
      the
      other
      way
      around
      too).
      When
      it
      comes
      to
      the
      pictures
      posted,
      I
      post
      pictures
      where
      I
      am
      engaged
      in
      activities
      I
      enjoy.
      Pictures
      where
      I
      am
      naturally
      smiling
      and
      /
      or
      coming
      across
      as
      friendly
      and
      approachable.
      Pictures
      where
      I
      come
      across
      as
      confident
      (straight
      body
      posture,
      not
      smiling,
      engaged
      into
      an
      social
      activity).
      The
      not
      smiling
      part
      I've
      stole
      it
      from
      catwalk
      models,
      they
      never
      smile.
      You
      should
      look
      into
      why
      they
      don't
      smile
      and
      what's
      the
      concept
      behind
      it
      as
      it's
      really
      clever.
      Now,
      after
      I've
      already
      made
      my
      first
      impression
      when
      it
      comes
      to
      looks
      and
      set
      the
      right
      image
      into
      the
      woman's
      mind,
      I
      need
      to
      chat
      with
      her.
      When
      it
      comes
      to
      chatting,
      I
      usually
      pick
      on
      something
      from
      their
      profile
      or
      from
      the
      way
      they
      look
      and
      build
      around
      that
      thing.
      After
      some
      short
      chit-chat,
      I
      find
      an
      excuse
      saying
      that
      I
      need
      to
      leave
      and
      can't
      chat
      anymore
      but
      she
      can
      give
      me
      her
      number
      and
      will
      continue
      on
      WhatsApp
      when
      I
      have
      time.
      I
      make
      it
      look
      like
      I
      want
      things
      to
      go
      my
      way
      and
      I'm
      the
      one
      leading
      where
      this
      is
      going.
      If
      she
      agrees,
      great.
      If
      not,
      it's
      not
      worth
      the
      time
      as
      I
      know
      for
      sure
      that
      there
      are
      other
      women
      willing
      to
      play
      along.
      All
      this
      effort
      it's
      worth
      it
      as
      it
      provides
      results:
      [Tinder
      screenshoot.](https://ibb.co/jDB870)
      There
      is
      no
      such
      thing
      as
      not
      working
      for
      you.
      If
      it
      doesn't
      work
      now,
      it
      means
      that
      you're
      giving
      out
      the
      wrong
      vibe
      and
      probably
      you
      may
      need
      to
      change
      a
      thing
      here
      and
      there.
      I'm
      sure
      there
      is
      a
      way
      to
      make
      it
      work,
      you
      just
      need
      to
      practice
      different
      approaches
      and
      see
      which
      one
      works
      for
      you.
      When
      I
      first
      signed
      up
      on
      Tinder
      I
      wasn't
      getting
      any
      matches:
      I
      had
      a
      fringe
      and
      my
      hair
      was
      all
      over
      the
      place
      (changed
      my
      hair
      style
      and
      now
      it
      looks
      modern
      and
      looked
      after).
      I
      was
      wearing
      clothes
      which
      were
      too
      large
      for
      me
      and
      I
      had
      no
      style
      (changed
      my
      wardrobe
      completely
      and
      instead
      of
      buying
      expensive
      branded
      clothes,
      I've
      bought
      clothes
      which
      put
      in
      evidence
      my
      physical
      qualities).
      I
      had
      no
      idea
      how
      to
      chat
      with
      them
      and
      I
      was
      coming
      across
      as
      needy,
      awkward
      and
      weird.
      I've
      been
      unmatched
      in
      under
      one
      minute.
      I've
      been
      rejected.
      I've
      been
      laughed
      at
      and
      sometimes
      made
      fun
      of.
      But
      despite
      all
      that
      I
      kept
      trying.
      I've
      tried
      different
      approaches.
      I've
      done
      my
      research.
      I've
      experienced
      what
      works
      and
      what
      doesn't.
      I
      never
      gave
      up.

      I'm
      planning
      to
      invest
       #163;10.000
      in
      xrp
      but
      not
      sure
      when
      is
      the
      right
      time.
      So
      many
      people
      believe
      that
      bitcoin
      is
      going
      to
      fall
      bellow
      $4000
      and
      will
      drag
      xrp
      down
      with
      it.

      Few
      years
      ago
      I
      had
      some
      money
      and
      wanted
      to
      buy
      a
      few
      thousands
      bitcoin
      but
      I
      didn't
      even
      had
      a
      computer
      at
      home
      (parents
      against
      technology,
      etc).
      I
      went
      to
      my
      uncle
      to
      use
      his
      computer
      to
      buy
      bitcoin
      and
      he
      somehow
      managed
      to
      convince
      me
      that
      it's
      all
      a
      scam
      and
      if
      it
      would
      be
      real,
      everyone
      would
      know
      about
      it
      already.
      Being
      young,
      I've
      said
      he
      knows
      what
      he
      is
      talking
      about
      it
      as
      he
      is
      older
      and
      he
      has
      life
      experience.
      I
      bought
      myself
      a
      bicycle
      instead.

      Shopping
      home
      delivery.
      About
      8
      years
      ago
      I
      was
      working
      my
      ass
      off
      on
      a
      job
      and
      I
      was
      getting
      home
      really
      tired.
      My
      now
      ex
      used
      to
      leave
      me
      a
      note
      with
      what
      I
      need
      to
      buy
      grocery
      wise
      so
      she
      can
      cook
      when
      she
      comes
      home.
      I
      had
      to
      come
      home
      from
      work,
      have
      a
      shower,
      change
      clothes,
      go
      out
      again,
      etc.
      I
      actually
      looked
      on
      Google
      to
      see
      if
      there
      is
      such
      thing
      as
      shopping
      delivery,
      as
      I
      was
      more
      than
      happy
      to
      pay
      a
      few
       #163;
      just
      to
      have
      a
      minute
      of
      peace
      and
      quiet
      after
      work.
      There
      was
      no
      such
      thing.
      One
      evening
      I
      go
      out
      with
      some
      work
      colleagues
      and
      between
      others
      I
      tell
      them
      that
      I'm
      thinking
      about
      opening
      a
      company.
      I
      want
      to
      make
      a
      website
      so
      people
      can
      place
      orders
      for
      what
      they
      need
      buying
      from
      the
      shop
      and
      I
      can
      go
      and
      buy
      it
      for
      them
      and
      deliver,
      for
      a
      small
      fee.
      Life
      happened
      and
      few
      days
      later
      that
      idea
      faded.
      About
      a
      year
      later
      I'm
      at
      a
      friends
      house
      and
      his
      mum
      says
      that
      she's
      just
      about
      to
      order
      something
      from
      the
      shop
      and
      asked
      my
      friend
      (her
      son)
      if
      he
      wants
      anything.
      Intrigued,
      I've
      asked
      questions.
      Turns
      out
      that
      one
      of
      my
      work
      colleague
      who
      I've
      discussed
      my
      idea
      with
      that
      evening,
      actually
      made
      it
      a
      reality
      without
      even
      telling
      me.
      The
      sad
      part
      is
      that
      for
      few
      days
      I
      was
      throwing
      logistics
      ideas
      at
      him
      while
      being
      happy
      that
      someone
      is
      actually
      listening
      to
      my
      crazy
      ideas.
      This
      happened
      in
      a
      third
      world
      country
      where
      8
      years
      ago
      there
      was
      no
      such
      thing
      as
      shopping
      delivery.
      Now
      there
      are
      lots
      of
      businesses
      offering
      this
      service,
      but
      I
      was
      the
      one
      to
      think
      about
      it
      first.

      Not
      much
      to
      say
      as
      I've
      run
      away
      from
      home
      short
      after
      as
      my
      mum
      tried
      to
      kill
      me
      (long
      story).
      Don't
      keep
      in
      touch
      with
      family.
      Life
      goes
      on.
      I'll
      make
      my
      millions
      in
      some
      other
      way.

      I've
      owned
      a
      videochat
      studio.
      Girls
      were
      earning
      between
      $400
      -
      $1000
      /
      week.
      In
      a
      third
      world
      country,
      this
      was
      and
      still
      is
      a
      lot
      of
      money.
      I
      have
      noticed
      that
      people
      who
      pay
      this
      girls
      are
      actually
      people
      who
      are
      feeling
      lonely
      (emotionally,
      sexually,
      socially).
      They
      visit
      the
      website
      and
      first
      they
      throw
      a
      $5
      to
      see
      what
      happens.
      They
      get
      some
      attention
      and
      the
      client
      loves
      attention.
      All
      of
      a
      sudden,
      this
      man
      realised
      that
      he
      can
      pay
      beautiful
      attractive
      women
      to
      talk
      to
      him,
      and
      even
      do
      stuff
      for
      him.
      He
      is
      getting
      attention
      from
      a
      woman
      who
      probably
      in
      real
      life
      wouldn't
      even
      stop
      to
      say
      "hi"
      to
      him.
      At
      the
      beginning
      is
      just
      fun.
      Then
      slowly
      becomes
      a
      habit.
      He
      feels
      like
      he
      is
      part
      of
      this
      cam
      model
      life.
      He
      is
      part
      of
      a
      group
      of
      people
      who
      also
      supports
      this
      cam
      model.
      HE
      BELONGS!
      In
      general
      people
      want
      to
      be
      accepted
      for
      who
      they
      are
      and
      want
      to
      belong
      to
      something.
      Cam

      Because
      most
      of
      the
      times,
      it
      is
      not
      the
      sex
      they're
      missing.
      It's
      the
      lack
      of
      a
      social
      life,
      friends,
      someone
      to
      talk
      to.
      They
      feel
      isolated.
      If
      they
      pay
      a
      prostitute,
      in
      an
      hour
      he
      goes
      home
      and
      that
      was
      it.
      But
      he
      could
      spend
      just
      half
      the
      money
      and
      get
      to
      chat
      and
      be
      entertained
      for
      a
      whole
      night,
      while
      getting
      sexual
      satisfaction
      too.
      Some
      people
      might
      also
      pay
      for
      prostitutes
      or
      even
      have
      a
      girlfriend.
      There
      are
      lots
      of
      different
      people
      with
      different
      needs
      on
      this
      planet.
      It's
      like
      gambling.
      Some
      people
      like
      to
      spend
      their
      money
      on
      slots,
      while
      others
      like
      to
      play
      roulette.
      They
      still
      get
      the
      kick,
      just
      in
      a
      different
      way.

      Pubic
      hair
      is
      the
      biggest
      turn
      off
      for
      me.
      I
      have
      literally
      refused
      several
      times
      to
      have
      sex
      with
      women
      who
      had
      hair
      down
      there.
      Now
      I'm
      asking
      women
      if
      they
      are
      shaved
      down
      there
      or
      if
      they're
      willing
      to
      shave
      soon
      after
      we
      start
      chatting
      and
      know
      that
      there
      is
      a
      chance
      to
      get
      lucky.
      Not
      taking
      risks.

      I
      just
      don't
      like
      seeing
      hair
      down
      there.
      I
      find
      it
      hard
      to
      get
      or
      maintain
      an
      erection
      if
      I'm
      looking
      down
      and
      it's
      hairy.
      It's
      an
      instant
      mood
      killer
      for
      me.
      I
      don't
      know
      why,
      I
      can't
      explain
      it.
      As
      for
      oral,
      it
      takes
      more
      for
      me
      to
      perform
      oral
      than
      no
      hair.
      The
      vaginal
      pH
      plays
      a
      massive
      role
      in
      this.
      A
      normal
      vaginal
      pH
      level
      is
      between
      3.8
      and
      4.5.
      I
      have
      hyperosmia,
      which
      means
      that
      I
      can
      smell
      and
      deduct
      the
      vaginal
      pH
      level
      whenever
      I'm
      near
      a
      vagina.
      I
      can
      instantly
      tell
      how
      that
      vagina
      is
      going
      to
      taste,
      and
      if
      there
      is
      a
      pH
      level
      higher
      than
      4.3...it's
      not
      going
      to
      happen.
      A
      pH
      higher
      than
      4.3
      will
      be
      moderately
      acidic
      and
      I
      don't
      like
      the
      smell
      or
      the
      taste.
      I
      do
      absolutely
      love
      any
      vagina
      with
      a
      pH
      smaller
      than
      4.3,
      but
      it
      needs
      to
      be
      shaved.
      I
      don't
      care
      if
      the
      woman
      looks
      like
      a
      10
      and
      has
      a
      nice
      everything.
      If
      she's
      not
      shaved
      I'm
      not
      going
      anywhere
      near
      her
      pants,
      and
      if
      she's
      shaved
      but
      her
      pH
      is
      higher
      than
      4.3,
      I
      won't
      do
      oral.
      I'm
      weird,
      I
      know
      that
      already.
      But
      worst
      case
      scenario,
      there
      are
      other
      ways
      to
      satisfy
      women
      (it's
      called
      Visa
      /s).

      In
      4th
      grade,
      a
      teacher
      sent
      me
      to
      the
      school
      principal
      to
      ask
      him
      for
      a
      bucket
      of
      electricity.
      On
      my
      way
      to
      see
      the
      principal,
      I've
      met
      with
      his
      secretary.
      After
      explaining
      to
      her
      why
      I
      want
      to
      see
      the
      principal,
      she
      said
      that
      I
      can't
      just
      go
      in
      without
      a
      bucket.
      I
      went
      to
      the
      cleaning
      room
      and
      got
      a
      bucket,
      then
      I
      went
      to
      the
      principal.
      He
      asked
      me
      if
      I
      know
      how
      to
      milk
      the
      electricity
      from
      the
      plug
      socket
      and
      put
      me
      to
      hold
      the
      bucket
      below
      the
      plug
      socket
      for
      a
      whole
      hour,
      while
      waiting
      for
      the
      electricity
      to
      leak
      into
      my
      bucket.
      That
      was
      the
      day
      when
      I've
      lost
      faith
      in
      humanity.

      It

      Few
      comments
      above,
      a
      guy
      was
      saying
      that
      lube
      is
      your
      best
      friend.
      Now
      you're
      saying
      to
      become
      friends
      with
      the
      clit.
      I'm
      starting
      to
      get
      the
      impression
      that
      sex
      is
      more
      about
      developing
      social
      relationships.

      I've
      been
      to
      the
      shop
      to
      buy
      a
      box
      of
      condoms
      and
      since
      I
      was
      there
      I
      also
      bought
      some
      lube
      and
      this
      vibrating
      penis
      ring
      caught
      my
      attention
      and
      bought
      that
      one
      too.
      Before
      I
      left
      home,
      my
      then
      girlfriend
      asked
      me
      to
      buy
      her
      some
      lemons
      to
      make
      some
      tea
      or
      something.
      I
      go
      to
      checkout
      and
      put
      the
      condoms,
      the
      lube,
      the
      penis
      ring
      and
      the
      lemons
      on
      the
      counter.
      The
      guy
      from
      the
      checkout
      was
      giving
      me
      funny
      looks.
      People
      waiting
      behind
      me
      were
      giving
      me
      funny
      looks.
      I
      couldn't
      understand
      why
      as
      everyone
      buys
      condoms,
      it's
      normal.
      After
      a
      few
      moments,
      the
      guy
      from
      the
      checkout
      said
      "
      OK,
      I
      understand
      what
      the
      condoms,
      the
      lube
      and
      the
      penis
      ring
      is
      for,
      but
      I
      don't
      want
      to
      die
      stupid,
      so
      can
      you
      please
      tell
      me
      what
      are
      you
      going
      to
      do
      with
      the
      lemons?"
      My
      response
      -
      Tea.

      Went
      home
      after
      work
      and
      jumped
      straight
      into
      bed.
      After
      5
      minutes
      of
      watching
      the
      ceiling,
      I
      notice
      with
      the
      corner
      of
      my
      eyes
      that
      curtains
      are
      red
      and
      I
      don't
      like
      red.
      I
      get
      up
      instantly
      and
      say
      to
      myself
      "Fu*k,
      I
      don't
      live
      here
      anymore
      ".
      I
      moved
      out
      from
      there
      a
      week
      before
      the
      incident
      and
      I
      still
      had
      the
      key
      as
      I
      never
      had
      time
      to
      go
      and
      drop
      it
      off.
      Even
      after
      that,
      I
      still
      found
      myself
      parking
      "home"
      even
      if
      I
      was
      now
      living
      on
      the
      other
      side
      of
      town.

      My
      first
      girlfriend
      was
      working
      until
      11
      pm
      every
      evening.
      It
      was
      pitch
      black
      when
      she
      would
      walk
      home.
      I
      was
      going
      out
      halfway
      through
      and
      I
      was
      waiting
      for
      her
      every
      single
      evening
      to
      make
      sure
      that
      she
      gets
      home
      safe.
      She
      kept
      saying
      to
      me
      that
      there
      is
      no
      need
      to
      do
      that
      as
      she
      can
      look
      after
      herself.
      So
      one
      evening,
      I
      thought
      I
      should
      surprise
      her
      from
      behind
      to
      make
      her
      realise
      that
      she
      can
      get
      in
      a
      dangerous
      situation
      and
      be
      helpless.
      So
      I
      see
      her
      from
      a
      distance,
      but
      mind
      you
      it
      was
      really
      dark.
      I
      hide
      and
      let
      her
      pass
      me,
      then
      I
      go
      from
      behind
      her
      back
      and
      grab
      her
      both
      arms
      in
      a
      lock.
      She
      started
      to
      scream
      while
      I
      was
      saying
      to
      her
      "what
      are
      you
      going
      to
      do
      now?".
      When
      she
      started
      to
      speak,
      my
      knees
      went
      weak.
      She
      wasn't
      my
      girlfriend.
      I've
      literally
      just
      scared
      the
      shit
      out
      of
      a
      woman
      walking
      alone
      in
      the
      dark.
      Then
      I
      tried
      to
      explain
      that
      she
      wasn't
      supposed
      to
      be
      my
      victim
      -
      which
      didn't
      helped
      either.

      While
      I
      partially
      agree
      with
      your
      post,
      I
      think
      the
      problem
      is
      a
      bit
      different.
      Hot
      girls
      usually
      have
      money
      or
      are
      supported
      by
      a
      family
      who
      has
      money.
      The
      shinny
      hair,
      the
      perfect
      skin,
      all
      those
      sexy
      clothes
      and
      accessories
      cost
      money.
      Then,
      hot
      girls
      are
      (most
      of
      the
      time)
      smart
      and
      educated.
      Some
      of
      them
      are
      school
      smart
      while
      others
      are
      street
      /
      socially
      smart
      -
      or
      both.
      Now,
      having
      the
      looks,
      the
      money,
      the
      social
      skills
      and
      the
      knowledge
      makes
      them
      confident.
      They
      want
      someone
      who
      is
      at
      least
      equal
      when
      it
      comes
      to
      social
      status.
      It
      is
      very
      rare
      when
      you
      see
      a
      hot
      girl
      with
      a
      guy
      who
      works
      a
      job
      in
      a
      warehouse
      on
      minimum
      wage
      and
      still
      lives
      with
      his
      parents.
      No
      matter
      how
      confident
      that
      guy
      will
      be,
      a
      girl
      like
      that
      won't
      see
      a
      future
      with
      him.
      All
      her
      friends
      have
      boyfriends
      who
      are
      accountants,
      lawyers,
      doctors,
      etc,
      while
      her
      boyfriend
      has
      a
      minimum
      paid
      job.
      It's
      not
      that
      she's
      interested
      in
      his
      money,
      but
      it
      can
      tell
      her
      a
      lot
      of
      things.
      It's
      not
      that
      they
      are
      superficial,
      but
      they
      know
      that
      they
      can
      do
      better
      and
      score
      more
      points
      personally
      and
      socially.
      For
      them,
      there
      is
      no
      challenge
      to
      try
      and
      get
      that
      man's
      number.
      But
      trying
      to
      get
      the
      number
      of
      a
      man
      who
      is
      smart
      and
      is
      proven
      by
      having
      a
      great
      career,
      trying
      to
      get
      the
      number
      of
      a
      man
      who
      doesn't
      need
      to
      prove
      anything
      to
      anyone
      and
      who
      doesn't
      need
      to
      chase
      women
      because
      he
      knows
      he
      has
      options,
      that
      a
      challenge.
      That
      where
      the
      secret
      lays.
      A
      hot
      woman
      wants
      someone
      to
      make
      her
      grow.
      Someone
      who
      already
      has
      more
      confidence,
      experience
      and
      knowledge
      than
      her.

      When
      I
      was
      8
      years
      old,
      one
      night
      I
      had
      a
      dream
      that
      my
      father
      will
      go
      with
      his
      new
      car
      on
      a
      certain
      Road
      and
      the
      brakes
      will
      fail
      and
      he
      will
      have
      an
      accident
      and
      die.
      I've
      also
      dreamed
      that
      at
      3
      pm
      two
      of
      our
      employees
      would
      knock
      on
      our
      door
      and
      that
      my
      mother
      was
      cooking
      and
      that
      she
      will
      open
      the
      door
      and
      see
      those
      two
      employees
      who
      would
      give
      her
      the
      news.
      I
      woke
      up
      in
      the
      morning
      and
      told
      my
      parents
      everything
      in
      detail
      what
      I've
      dreamed
      about.
      They
      said
      it
      was
      just
      a
      nightmare
      and
      that
      everything
      is
      fine,
      even
      if
      I
      kept
      telling
      them
      that
      everything
      seemed
      so
      real.
      I
      came
      back
      from
      school
      and
      it
      was
      almost
      3
      pm.
      My
      mother
      was
      cooking
      exactly
      what
      I've
      dreamed
      that
      she
      will
      cook.
      She
      was
      wearing
      exactly
      what
      I've
      dreamed
      that
      she
      will
      wear
      and
      she
      was
      even
      in
      a
      position
      as
      I've
      dreamed
      that
      she
      would
      be.
      There
      it
      is,
      3
      pm
      and
      someone
      knocks
      on
      our
      door.
      I
      tell
      my
      mother
      without
      even
      looking
      who
      is
      at
      the
      door
      and
      what
      are
      they
      going
      to
      tell
      her.
      She
      shouts
      at
      me
      and
      says
      to
      stop
      worrying
      about
      my
      dream.
      She
      opens
      the
      door
      and
      sees
      exactly
      the
      people
      I
      was
      telling
      her
      about
      and
      they
      had
      a
      sad
      face.
      They've
      started
      to
      tell
      her
      the
      bad
      news.
      I
      was
      like
      "I
      can't
      believe
      this
      is
      happening
      right
      now".

      Oh,
      you're
      definitely
      right.
      Hot
      girls
      are
      human.
      They
      go
      through
      ups
      and
      downs
      too.
      They
      get
      drunk.
      They
      make
      mistakes.
      They
      experience.
      But
      it's
      very
      rare
      and
      it's
      not
      for
      the
      long-term.

      Most
      women
      want
      foreplay.
      They
      need
      kissing
      and
      played
      with.
      They
      need
      attention.
      As
      a
      man,
      I
      need
      to
      concentrate
      not
      to
      finish
      to
      quick
      so
      she
      can
      enjoy
      it
      too.
      While
      it's
      fun,
      sometimes
      it
      can
      feel
      like
      work.
      Sometimes
      I
      don't
      have
      the
      energy
      or
      I'm
      just
      not
      in
      the
      mood
      for
      the
      whole
      thing.
      Sometimes
      I
      just
      want
      to
      be
      selfish.
      I
      just
      want
      a
      BJ
      or
      just
      a
      quickie
      and
      then
      I
      want
      to
      get
      on
      with
      my
      life.

      To
      be
      fair,
      you're
      not
      pushing
      yourself
      out
      of
      your
      comfort
      zone
      at
      all.
      You
      have
      a
      routine
      and
      you're
      stuck
      in
      it.
      What
      I
      would
      do,
      I'd
      go
      crazy
      for
      a
      while.
      Crazy
      as
      in
      go
      to
      different
      meetup
      meetings.
      Start
      studying
      for
      something
      new
      or
      take
      some
      piano
      or
      other
      instrument
      lessons.
      Or
      self
      defence?
      Signup
      to
      the
      gym.
      Book
      a
      holiday
      here
      and
      there.
      You
      don't
      have
      to
      enjoy
      any
      of
      these
      things,
      but
      just
      do
      them
      so
      you
      can
      experience
      them.
      The
      whole
      purpose
      is
      that
      along
      the
      way,
      you'll
      find
      something
      interesting
      to
      do
      and
      you'll
      know
      what
      you're
      not
      into.
      It's
      fine
      to
      spend
      the
      rest
      of
      your
      life
      as
      you
      do
      now,
      but
      you
      won't
      have
      stories
      to
      tell
      to
      your
      friends
      or
      even
      new
      girlfriend
      /
      wife
      /
      children.
      There
      is
      so
      much
      more
      about
      life.
      You're
      not
      boring,
      but
      just
      lack
      life
      experiences
      which
      you
      still
      have
      time
      to
      gain.

      I
      knew

      I
      have

      why
      I
      was
      saying
      that
      in
      the

      I'm
      working
      with
      people
      with
      mental
      health
      disorders,

      I've
      been
      working
      way
      over
      300
      hours.
      After

      I
      have
      noticed
      the
      effects
      work
      has
      on
      me.
      I
      wasn't

      aware

      I
      was
      speaking

      and
      I
      don't
      recal
      saying
      those
      words.
      It's
      kind
      of
      scary

      I
      went
      to
      a
      car
      rental
      company
      to
      rent
      a
      car.
      At
      the
      desk,
      there
      was
      this
      young,
      beautiful,
      chatty
      lady.
      As
      there
      was
      no
      queue,
      we
      had
      some
      chit
      chat
      and
      we
      were
      both
      smiling
      and
      having
      a
      good
      time.
      I
      took
      the
      keys
      and
      left.
      About
      two
      hours
      later,
      she
      sends
      me
      a
      friend
      request
      on
      Facebook.
      I
      ignore
      it.
      Few
      hours
      later,
      she
      sends
      me
      a
      message
      on
      messenger
      asking
      me
      if
      I'm
      happy
      with
      the
      car
      and
      what
      I'm
      up
      to.
      Even
      though
      I
      was
      single
      and
      she
      seen
      that
      on
      my
      Facebook,
      I
      wasn't
      interested
      in
      dating
      her.
      For
      me,
      I
      like
      to
      be
      the
      one
      who
      does
      the
      chase
      or
      I'm
      not
      interested.
      Don't
      break
      the
      professional
      boundary
      as
      it's
      really
      off
      putting.
      What
      you
      can
      do,
      try
      and
      be
      sexy
      but
      professional
      and
      make
      him
      chase
      you.

      Do
      you
      know
      what
      a
      bidet
      is?
      Well,
      I
      grew
      up
      at
      the
      country
      side.
      I
      have
      never
      heard
      of
      it.
      One
      day
      I
      moved
      to
      the
      city,
      got
      a
      job
      and
      all
      and
      went
      on
      a
      date.
      I
      took
      her
      to
      a
      nice
      restaurant
      and
      at
      some
      point
      I
      had
      to
      go
      to
      the
      bathroom.
      After
      peeing,
      I've
      seen
      this
      water
      fountain
      and
      I've
      started
      to
      drink
      some
      water.
      It
      tasted
      kind
      of
      funny,
      but
      I
      didn't
      really
      minded.
      Then,
      I
      went
      back
      to
      my
      date
      and
      said
      "
      what
      genius
      would
      put
      a
      water
      fountain
      in
      a
      bathroom?".
      She
      looked
      at
      my
      wet
      shirt
      and
      suddenly
      her
      interest
      in
      me
      went
      down
      the
      toilet.

      Funny
      thing.
      I
      own
      a
      2005
      car
      and
      when
      I
      go
      to
      McDonald's
      drive-through
      they
      always
      greet
      me
      with
      "You're
      alright
      mate?".
      And
      then
      I
      also
      own
      a
      luxury
      car
      for
      the
      weekends,
      and
      when
      I
      go
      to
      the
      same
      McDonald's,
      employees
      there
      greet
      me
      with
      "How
      are
      you
      today,
      Sir?".
      Bro,
      you
      literally
      saw
      me
      yesterday
      wearing
      the
      same
      clothes
      just
      different
      car.

      That
      fine.
      She's
      not
      an
      asset
      anymore,
      but
      a
      liability.
      He
      already
      knows
      that
      she's
      going
      to
      be
      single.

      I
      had
      a
      girlfriend
      who
      came
      up
      with
      the
      same
      shit.
      I
      told
      her
      that
      I
      don't
      think
      I
      can
      cope
      with
      the
      thought
      of
      someone
      else
      fucking
      her.
      She
      pressured
      me
      into
      it
      and
      I
      agreed
      in
      the
      end.
      The
      moment
      we
      met
      with
      another
      couple
      face
      to
      face,
      I
      knew
      then
      and
      there
      that
      our
      relationship
      is
      over.
      I
      was
      right!
      If
      you
      want
      to
      save
      your
      marriage,
      whatever
      you
      do,
      don't
      agree
      with
      this
      plan.

      Bumble
      date
      took
      me
      to
      her
      place.
      We
      had
      sex
      and
      then
      she
      says
      "you

      -

      never

      not

      I
      had

      ass
      out

      I
      went
      for
      a
      non
      scalpel
      vasectomy
      to
      a
      private
      clinic.
      The
      procedure
      took
      15
      minutes
      and
      then
      I
      had
      to
      stay
      there
      for
      20
      minutes
      to
      see
      if
      I'm
      OK.
      They
      took
      my
      blood
      pressure
      and
      it
      was
      fine.
      We
      went
      through
      what
      I
      need
      to
      do
      for
      the
      next
      few
      days
      (painkillers,
      ice,
      no
      lifting)
      and
      then
      they
      took
      my
      blood
      pressure
      again
      and
      it
      was
      76.
      Everyone
      went
      into
      panic
      mode
      while
      I
      was
      feeling
      kind
      of
      light
      headed.
      They
      gave
      me
      a
      glucose
      tablet
      and
      two
      minutes
      later
      I
      was
      good
      to
      leave.
      The
      procedure
      itself
      was
      somehow
      painful.
      I
      felt
      the
      needle
      for
      1
      second
      but
      that
      was
      nothing.
      No
      pain.
      Then,
      about
      3
      minutes
      later
      the
      Dr
      said
      that
      he
      needs
      to
      pull
      my
      tube
      a
      bit
      and
      I
      might
      feel
      some
      discomfort.
      That
      was
      really
      painful
      as
      I've
      literally
      felt
      my
      sperm
      tube
      being
      pulled
      through
      my
      lower
      abs.
      It
      only
      took
      10
      seconds
      or
      so
      but
      it
      was
      painful.
      Then,
      on
      the
      second
      incision,
      he
      had
      to
      pull
      the
      tube
      again
      from
      the
      other
      side
      and
      felt
      as
      bad
      as
      the
      right
      side.
      Except
      those
      2
      X
      10
      separate
      seconds,
      I
      haven't
      felt
      anything
      else.
      About
      10
      minutes
      after
      everything
      was
      all
      done,
      I've
      started
      to
      get
      big
      pain
      in
      my
      lower
      ab
      /
      hip
      which
      lasted
      for
      one
      hour
      (that
      was
      really
      painful).
      The
      Dr
      said
      it's
      normal
      and
      that
      it's
      my
      tube
      retracting
      (or
      trying
      to).
      After
      an
      hour,
      I
      assume
      the
      painkillers
      kicked
      in
      and
      I
      was
      pain
      free
      for
      the
      rest
      of
      the
      time.
      Now
      it's
      not
      painful,
      but
      it
      is
      "there".
      It's
      like
      a
      dull
      sensation.
      I'm
      on
      paracetamol
      and
      ipubrofen
      and
      wearing
      a
      jockstrap
      at
      all
      times.
      Haven't
      put
      any
      ice
      yet
      but
      I'm
      tempted
      to
      try
      and
      see
      if
      it's
      any
      different.
      My
      penis
      and
      balls
      are
      so
      bruised
      and
      it
      seems
      that
      as
      time
      goes
      on,
      it
      gets
      even
      more
      bruised.
      Am
      I
      happy
      that
      I've
      done
      it?
      Absolutely.
      Would
      I
      do
      it
      again?
      Not
      sure.
      I
      hope
      there
      won't
      be
      scaring
      marks.
      Hopefully
      I'll
      be
      on
      my
      100%
      soon.

      Can

      Haha,

      I'm
      sorry
      to
      hear
      you're
      having
      troubles
      and
      I
      hope
      it
      will
      get
      better
      soon.

      Well
      to
      be
      perfectly
      honest,
      in
      my
      humble
      opinion,
      of
      course
      without
      offending
      anyone
      who
      thinks
      differently
      from
      my
      point
      of
      view,
      but
      also
      by
      looking
      into
      this
      matter
      in
      a
      different
      perspective
      and
      without
      being
      condemning
      of
      one's
      view's
      and
      by
      trying
      to
      make
      it
      objectified,
      and
      by
      considering
      each
      and
      every
      one's
      valid
      opinion,
      I
      honestly
      believe
      that
      I
      completely
      forgot
      what
      I
      was
      going
      to
      say.

      A

       #163;
      on

      I've
      had
      my
      vasectomy
      done
      last
      Friday.
      I've
      booked
      it
      4
      months
      ago.
      I'm
      29
      and
      I've
      always
      knon
      I
      don't
      want
      children.
      I
      had
      no
      second
      thoughts,
      except
      when
      I
      was
      in
      the
      waiting
      room.
      I
      was
      thinking
      that
      maybe
      this
      is
      a
      mistake
      and
      maybe
      I'm
      just
      going
      through
      a
      rough
      mental
      period
      and
      maybe
      I
      shouldn't
      do
      it.
      While
      thinking
      this,
      a
      family
      with
      3
      little
      children
      came
      in
      for
      the
      husband
      to
      have
      a
      vasectomy.
      They
      sat
      next
      to
      me
      in
      the
      waiting
      room.
      The
      children
      started
      to
      run
      around,
      scream,
      laugh,
      jump,
      etc.
      It's
      only
      been
      2
      minutes
      since
      they
      came
      in
      but
      I
      was
      already
      mentally
      exhausted.
      That
      was
      the
      moment
      I
      knew
      I'm
      doing
      the
      right
      choice.
      It's
      only
      been
      a
      few
      days
      but
      I
      would
      do
      it
      again
      if
      I'd
      have
      a
      choice.
      Hope
      it
      helps
      and
      good
      luck.

      I
      have
      exactly
      the
      same
      symptoms,
      altough
      I'm
      only
      6
      days
      post
      op.
      Can
      I
      ask,
      have
      you
      had
      sex
      /
      masturbated
      yet?
      Just
      before
      my
      vasectomy,
      I've
      met
      this
      sexy
      lady
      and
      I'm
      supposed
      to
      see
      her
      Friday
      and
      have
      sex.
      However,
      I'm
      terrified
      that
      I
      might
      be
      in
      too
      much
      pain,
      or
      I
      won't
      get
      an
      erection
      or
      I
      might
      break
      something
      there
      or
      etc.
      Everything
      is
      so
      sensitive
      now
      that
      I'm
      even
      afraid
      to
      masturbate.

      I
      don't
      want
      children
      either
      and
      I'm
      a
      man.
      I
      broke
      up
      with
      many
      amazing
      women
      because
      of
      this
      very
      reason:
      they
      want
      children.
      It
      hurts
      from
      the
      male
      side
      too,
      but
      having
      a
      child
      or
      more
      it's
      something
      you
      really
      need
      to
      /
      should
      want
      and
      it
      never
      should
      be
      a
      compromise
      for
      the
      sake
      of
      your
      partner.
      Time
      heals
      everything
      and
      you'll
      meet
      the
      right
      person
      for
      you
      someday.

      things.
      I
      used
      to
      work
      on
      a
      minimum
      wage
      job.
      She
      kept
      telling
      me
      and
      put
      pressure
      on
      me
      that
      I
      need
      to
      work
      more
      hours
      so
      I
      can
      make
      more
      money.
      If
      I
      worked
      overtime
      now
      and
      then,
      she
      would
      complain
      that
      we
      don't
      spend
      enough
      time
      together.
      One
      day
      we
      got
      into
      an
      argument
      over
      money
      and
      she
      said
      that
      I
      need
      to
      find
      a
      way
      to
      make
      more
      money.
      I
      dumped
      her
      right
      then
      and
      there
      and
      now
      I
      am
      indeed
      making
      more.
      I'll
      always
      be
      grateful
      to
      her
      for
      my
      savings.

      The

      day
      (31st
      March)
      I
      was
      in
      a
      coffee
      shop
      writing
      on
      Facebook

      this

      back
      to
      my
      car,
      I

      It's
      been
      6
      weeks
      since
      I
      had
      mine
      done.
      I'm
      back
      to
      100%,
      no
      bruises
      or
      pain.
      Back
      to
      the
      gym
      as
      normal
      and
      no
      pain
      during
      sexual
      intercourse.
      Except
      for
      seeing
      a
      small
      scab
      when
      I
      shower,
      I
      don't
      even
      think
      about
      it
      anymore.
      It
      gets
      better,
      I
      promise.
      Hang
      in
      there.

      After
      3
      weeks
      I
      was
      99%
      myself.
      I
      would
      of
      probably
      healed
      faster
      but
      the

      day

      vasectomy,
      I
      was

      lifting
      heavy
      things
      -
      it
      wasn't
      a

      I
      still
      had
      pain
      even
      in
      the
      6th
      day
      and
      I
      was
      still
      popping
      some
      paracetamol
      here
      and
      there.
      After
      two
      weeks
      the
      pain
      went
      away,
      but
      the
      jewelleries
      were
      still
      a
      bit
      sensitive
      when
      walking.
      I
      would
      say
      it's
      kind
      of
      normal,
      as
      we
      all
      heal
      differently.
      However,
      do
      check
      up
      with
      your
      Dr
      to
      make
      sure.

      I
      work
      minimum
      300
      hours
      /
      month
      (380
      hours
      was
      the
      most
      I've
      worked
      in
      a
      month
      after
      a
      break
      up).
      -
      I
      go
      to
      the
      gym
      3
      times
      a
      week
      (2-3
      hours
      each
      time).
      -
      I
      take
      piano
      and
      violin
      lessons
      and
      I'm
      about
      to
      start
      taking
      tango
      lessons.
      -
      I
      spend
      a
      lot
      of
      time
      reading
      things
      I
      enjoy
      and
      also
      writing
      stuff
      on
      Quora
      and
      other
      forums.
      -
      I
      fly
      abroad
      for
      a
      weekend
      every
      2-3
      months
      for
      a
      short
      holiday
      (different
      countries
      in
      Europe).
      -
      I'm
      studying
      for
      a
      management
      diploma
      online
      from
      ILM
      and
      other
      few
      things.
      -
      I
      always
      keep
      in
      touch
      with
      people
      I
      care
      about,
      visiting
      or
      calling
      them
      regularly.
      -
      I'm
      a
      serial
      dater.
      I
      try
      and
      go
      on
      a
      different
      date
      every
      weekend.
      Sometimes
      I'm
      bored
      and
      have
      nothing
      to
      do,
      so
      I'm
      either
      learning
      a
      new
      language,
      or
      I
      have
      a
      few
      hours
      of
      sleep
      in
      the
      day
      time.
      So
      far
      I
      speak
      4
      languages
      +
      BSL
      and
      Braille.
      I've
      started
      to
      learn
      English
      5
      years
      ago.
      It's
      all
      about
      planning
      your
      time
      in
      advance
      and
      setting
      priorities.
      I
      wake
      up
      every
      day
      at
      7:30
      AM,
      despite
      if
      I'm
      working
      or
      not,
      if
      I've
      slept
      for
      an
      hour
      or
      ten.
      I
      make
      the
      most
      of
      my
      time.
      I
      have
      no
      children,
      no
      girlfriend.
      I
      don't
      like
      alcohol
      so
      I'm
      always
      at
      my
      100%
      because
      there
      is
      no
      hangover.
      I
      don't
      need
      to
      worry
      about
      cleaning
      as
      I
      keep
      everything
      clean.
      I
      put
      my
      clothes
      to
      wash
      while
      I'm
      having
      dinner
      and
      I
      put
      them
      to
      dry
      after
      I
      finished
      my
      dinner.
      I
      fold
      them
      and
      put
      them
      away
      next
      morning
      as
      part
      of
      my
      "making
      coffee"
      routine.
      Sometimes
      I'm
      tempted
      to
      take
      a
      part
      time
      job
      as
      well,
      this
      is
      why
      I
      have
      qualified
      as
      a:
      -
      masseur
      -
      CNC
      operator
      -
      forklift
      driver
      -
      trainer
      /
      teacher
      -
      recruitment
      consultant.
      I'm
      currently
      studying
      for
      some
      more
      qualifications
      in
      different
      fields.
      I'll
      probably
      never
      going
      to
      take
      a
      part
      time
      job,
      but
      the
      idea
      of
      knowing
      how
      to
      do
      /
      being
      qualified
      in
      different
      things,
      turns
      me
      on.

      Women
      crying.
      When
      I
      was
      18,
      my
      then
      girlfriend
      received
      a
      call
      with
      some
      bad
      news
      and
      she
      started
      to
      cry.
      I
      got
      so
      hard
      that
      it
      hurt.
      With
      time,
      she
      realised
      that
      everytime
      she
      was
      crying,
      I
      was
      getting
      really
      hard.
      One
      day,
      she
      received
      a
      call
      that
      her
      mother
      died
      and
      she
      started
      to
      cry
      and
      said
      "if
      you
      get
      a
      bonner
      now,
      you're
      literally
      sick".
      I'm
      sick.

      I've
      done
      a
      course
      in
      melanoma
      and
      skin
      cancer
      early
      detection.
      I
      went
      to
      a
      funeral
      and
      noticed
      a
      weird
      shaped
      and
      coloured
      mole
      on
      a
      woman
      who
      was
      friends
      with
      a
      friend.
      The
      circumstances
      to
      say
      anything
      then
      and
      there
      weren't
      good.
      Next
      day
      I've
      messaged
      my
      friend
      to
      tell
      to
      that
      friend
      that
      the
      mole
      on
      her
      neck
      might
      be
      cancerous.
      I've
      sent
      him
      my
      diploma
      in
      melanoma
      and
      skin
      cancer
      early
      detection
      to
      prove
      that
      I
      know
      what
      I'm
      talking
      about
      and
      all.
      My
      friend
      said
      that
      he
      will
      tell
      her
      straight
      away.
      He
      never
      did.
      Three
      years
      later
      he
      messages
      me
      saying
      "OMG,
      my
      friend
      was
      diagnosed
      with
      skin
      cancer
      ".
      I
      never
      rely
      on
      other
      people
      anymore
      when
      it
      comes
      to
      life
      threatening
      conditions.

      I
      was
      in
      a
      position
      where
      I
      could
      of
      helped
      Katiusha
      with
      legal
      paperwork.
      We
      met
      to
      discuss
      details
      over
      a
      coffee.
      She
      suggested
      to
      go
      to
      her
      place
      to
      show
      me
      some
      work
      related
      things.
      Once
      home,
      she
      threw
      herself
      on
      the
      bed,
      spread
      her
      legs
      in
      a
      very
      inciting
      way
      and
      gave
      me
       #8220;the
      look #8221;.
      Meanwhile
      I
      took
      a
      sit
      on
      a
      chair.
      She
      said:
      come
      here
      on
      the
      bed
      with
      me.
      I
      said:
      no
      thank
      you,
      I #8217;m
      fine
      on
      the
      chair.
      She
      was
      probably
      the
      most
      beautiful
      young
      blonde,
      blue
      eyed,
      russian
      girl
      I #8217;ve
      seen
      to
      date.
      I
      had
      no
      confidence
      back
      then
      so
      sleeping
      with
      her
      was
      something
      I
      could
      only
      think
      and
      masturbate
      to.

      I
      panicked
      and
      was

      alone.
      I

      trying
      to

      my
      then
      girlfriend
      for
      help.
      I #8217;ve

      created

      times,
      pressing

      I

      it
      never
      rang.

      I #8217;m
      a

      I #8217;ve
      put

      the

      and
      the

      in

      After

      rented
      house
      where

      after

      lived

      the
      opposite

      I

      piano
      lessons
      every
      Saturday
      morning
      for

      The

      I

      all

      A

      in
      her
      80s
      came
      to
      me
      and
      asked:
      Her
      -
      Do
      you
      mind
      if
      an
      old
      lady
      comes
      in
      the
      jacuzzi
      with
      you?
      Me
      -
      I
      don't
      mind,
      but
      where's
      the
      old
      lady?
      She
      couldn't
      stop
      smiling.
      It
      made
      me
      happy!

      mission
      while
      trying

      change

      myself
      "what
      does

      do?".
