      So
      I
      have
      been
      checking
      discussion
      chats
      and
      forums
      but
      hardly
      anyone
      discussed
      this...
      White
      diamond's
      gem
      is
      different
      from
      her
      mural.
      Its
      not
      what
      some
      fans
      expected
      it
      to
      be.
      Isnt
      her
      gem
      suppose
      to
      be
      similar
      to
      Yellow's
      and
      Blue's
      instead
      of
      Pink's?
      Wont
      that
      make
      her
      defective
      instead
      of
      the
      'perfect'
      diamond?
      I
      would
      like
      to
      discuss
      more!
      Maybe
      hear
      some
      theories
      of
      why
      her
      gem
      isnt
      what
      her
      mural
      depicts.
      *yes
      I
      know
      murals
      arent
      accurate
      like
      Pink
      and
      Blue
      but
      I
      still
      have
      a
      feeling
      that
      White
      shouldnt
      be
      having
      Pink's
      gem
      shape
      as
      older
      theories
      go,
      Pink
      is
      like
      a
      defective
      diamond.
      Though
      that
      is
      still
      a
      theory
      and
      a
      diamond
      could
      be
      another
      shape
      and
      be
      perfect

      No
      no
      I
      know
      the
      gem
      is
      in
      her
      forehead
      and
      saw
      the
      gem.
      But
      Im
      talking
      about
      the
      shape
      of
      the
      gem.
      How
      it
      is
      exactly
      like
      Pink's
      and
      not
      like
      Yellow's
      or
      Blue's.

      Good
      idea
      and
      she
      does
      probably
      set
      the
      standards
      of
      'perfect'
      but
      if
      she
      was
      the
      one
      who
      sets
      it,
      doesnt
      She
      have
      to
      be
      perfect
      herself?
      XD
      And
      true.
      Other
      diamonds
      gems
      shapes
      arent
      perfect
      either.
      But
      the
      thing
      that
      bothers
      me
      is
      that
      if
      she
      is
      the
      so
      called
      ultimate
      diamond,
      the
      highest
      diamond
      there
      is
      and
      the
      most
      perfect
      one,
      wont
      she
      have
      to
      be
      absolutely
      perfect
      with
      no
      flaws
      etc?
      Like
      a
      perfect
      diamond
      shape
      no
      ups
      or
      downs.
      No
      flaws.
      Just
      one
      perfect
      cut
      gem.

      True
      true.
      But
      now
      it
      makes
      me
      think
      that
      if
      Pink's
      gem
      is
      the
      same
      as
      White,
      wont
      she
      be
      perfect?
      Hahaha
      then
      again
      all
      diamonds
      are
      perfect

      Well
      it
      depends.
      The
      diamonds
      treat
      other
      gems
      like
      tools
      yet
      the
      gems
      themselves
      are
      worshipping
      the
      Diamonds.
      Just
      like
      what
      Peridot
      said.
      They
      are
      perfect
      gem
      beings.
      So
      perhaps
      theres
      a
      link
      we
      are
      missing.

      I
      see.
      Though
      I
      disagree
      with
      the
      perfection
      doesnt
      matter
      part.
      Perfection
      I
      think
      is
      a
      must.
      If
      they
      arent
      perfect,
      they
      cant
      lead
      and
      is
      just
      like
      the
      other
      gems.
      Yes
      they
      are
      programmed
      to
      obey
      but
      since
      they
      also
      have
      enough
      self
      awareness
      to
      break
      free,
      they
      must
      need
      something
      or
      someone
      whos
      perfect
      and
      strong
      like
      a
      leader
      (in
      this
      case
      a
      Diamond)
      to
      prevent
      them
      from
      breaking
      free
      and
      rebelling.

      Take
      it
      with
      a
      grain
      of
      salt*
      Because
      from
      my
      perspective,
      most
      Era
      1
      gems
      have
      powers
      and/or
      the
      ability
      to
      lead.
      Take
      Garnet.
      She
      could
      lead.
      And
      maybe
      if
      given,
      she
      could
      lead
      an
      entire
      army
      too.
      And
      as
      for
      powers,
      Sapphires
      for
      example
      has
      powers
      too.
      Basically,
      without
      perfection,
      diamonds
      are
      just
      like
      other
      gems
      and
      if
      you
      think
      about
      it,
      what
      if
      there
      is
      no
      diamonds?
      Without
      perfections
      and
      diamonds,
      could
      gem
      kind
      still
      go
      on?
      Most
      likely.
      You
      have
      zircons
      to
      show
      you
      information,
      you
      have
      aquamarine
      to
      remember
      every
      details,
      you
      have
      jaspers
      to
      lead
      and
      so
      on.
      If
      diamonds
      arent
      perfect,
      they
      are
      just
      like
      those
      regular
      gems.
      They
      would
      most
      probably
      at
      the
      same
      level
      as
      a
      Sapphire
      for
      Blue,
      Jasper
      for
      Yellow,
      Rose
      quarts
      for
      Pink
      and
      Pearls
      for
      White.

      diamond's
      gem

      is

      Yup
      which
      I
      dont
      mind
      the
      different
      cut
      but
      Im
      curious
      as
      to
      why
      the
      writers
      decide
      to
      give
      White
      the
      same
      cut.
      Is
      it
      because
      of
      another
      plot
      twist
      in
      the
      future?
      Or
      is
      because
      she
      isnt
      as
      perfect
      as
      we
      think
      she
      should
      be
      etc.
      Or
      is
      it
      just
      a
      typical
      plain
      aesthetic
      reasons
      which
      would
      be
      a
      bit
      of
      a
      bummer
      considering
      she
      is
      the
      ultimate
      villain.

      Yes
      they
      arent
      finalized
      but
      there
      is
      another
      weird
      point.
      I
      remembered
      it
      was
      by
      The
      Roundtable.
      About
      how
      the
      murals
      are
      incorrect
      but
      despite
      that,
      Garnet's
      flashback
      (by
      that
      flashback,
      all
      the
      designs
      is
      finalized
      mostly)
      of
      Pink's
      battle
      with
      them
      was
      Pink
      looking
      like
      her
      Mural.
      Though
      Garnet's
      flashback
      isnt
      that
      accurate
      as
      well.
      So
      its
      weird

      But
      its
      a
      bit
      disappointing
      that
      her
      gem's
      design
      isnt
      a
      the
      way
      it
      was
      suppose
      to

      reason
      other
      than
      unfinished

      Long
      story
      short,
      Dentist
      wants
      to
      bail
      out
      on
      braces
      before
      the
      top
      teeth
      is
      fully
      neat
      and
      in.
      Is
      that
      even
      allowed?
      Like
      arent
      braces
      suppose
      to
      make
      it
      completely
      neat
      and
      in?
      Long
      story
      below,
      I
      have
      rabbit
      teeth.
      Its
      almost
      2
      years/passed
      2
      years
      since
      I
      got
      my
      braces
      but
      this
      time,
      its
      really
      bad.
      For
      the
      past
      few
      months,
      my
      dentist
      did
      not
      touch
      my
      top
      brace
      at
      all.
      No
      changing
      of
      rubber
      or
      wire.
      Nothing.
      And
      instead,
      he
      focused
      on
      the
      bottom
      row
      and
      gave
      me
      the
      rubber
      for
      me
      to
      wear
      which
      I
      did.
      Shouldnt
      he
      change
      the
      rubber
      as
      its
      hygienic
      and
      put/remove
      the
      wires?
      But
      despite
      wearing
      them
      as
      frequent
      as
      I
      could,
      there
      is
      hardly
      any
      movement
      on
      the
      top.
      And
      yet
      the
      dentist
      wishes
      to
      so
      called
      bail
      out
      on
      the
      braces
      which
      he
      claims
      that
      its
      no
      use
      and
      theres
      no
      point
      of
      wearing
      braces.
      And
      frankly
      I
      find
      it
      kinda
      rude
      that
      he
      claims
      I
      wasnt
      'that
      interested
      in
      treating
      myself'
      when
      I
      clearly
      am.
      AND!
      My
      top
      row
      is
      only
      protruding
      a
      bit.
      Cant
      he
      like
      handle
      it
      before
      claiming
      it
      doesnt
      work?
      He
      wants
      to
      remove
      the
      braces
      completely
      before
      the
      top
      row
      is
      done.
      Instead,
      he
      'suggested'
      that
      i
      do
      filing
      instead
      to
      make
      it
      'go
      in'
      which
      is
      bullshit
      in
      my
      eyes
      as
      my
      teeth
      is
      still
      protruding
      out
      instead
      of
      it
      being
      long.
      I
      think
      the
      clinic
      trying
      to
      scam
      money.
      I
      even
      paid
      last
      payment
      last
      time
      but
      was
      told
      theres
      1
      more
      which
      was
      odd.
      But
      nonetheless,
      I
      will
      pay
      this
      last
      time.
      *scam
      money
      by
      not
      completing
      treatment
      and
      do
      more
      expensive
      options
      which
      is
      not
      needed.
      I
      would
      like
      to
      have
      some
      answers
      and
      solution...
      I
      want
      to
      fix
      my
      teeth
      completely
      instead
      of
      a
      half-assed
      job
      like
      that...

      Hello!
      A
      little
      info
      first,
      Im
      20
      years
      old
      with
      braces
      and
      have
      all
      4
      wisdom
      teeth.
      3
      of
      them
      are
      fine
      and
      are
      erupting
      with
      no
      issues
      except
      the
      bottom
      left
      one.
      It
      has
      erupted
      too
      off
      to
      the
      side
      where
      my
      cheek
      is
      and
      the
      feeling
      I
      can
      closely
      describe
      is
      its
      literally
      pulling
      my
      cheek
      and/or
      one
      of
      its
      vein.
      Right
      now
      its
      slightly
      swollen
      and
      I
      couldnt
      chew
      well
      on
      the
      left
      side
      since
      the
      top
      left's
      wisdom
      tooth
      keeps
      poking
      on
      the
      sensitive
      gum.
      *unfortunately
      i
      havent
      gotten
      an
      updated
      x-ray
      so
      I
      couldnt
      show
      anything
      rn.
      The
      tooth
      seems
      to
      be
      tilted.
      Is
      this
      normal?
      And
      should
      i
      remove
      it
      asap
      or
      wait
      till
      i
      remove
      my
      braces?
      Or
      just
      leave
      it
      be
      and
      wait
      for
      noticable
      changes?
      Pretty
      worried
      as
      Ive
      heard
      tales
      of
      nerve
      damage...

      No

      no
      nothing.
      Just
      peace
      in
      my
      mind
      and
      body.
      No
      need
      to
      worry
      about
      survival
      like
      food
      or

      no

      But
      that's
      the
      contradiction.
      One
      cannot
      achieve
      that
      wish
      without
      money
      these
      days.
      Money
      is
      survival.
      But
      in
      order
      to
      survive,
      one
      must
      suffer
      to
      get
      it.
      Enduring
      pain
      and
      torments
      for
      the
      basic
      necessities.
      And
      if
      one
      wants
      to
      be
      at
      peace,
      they
      have
      to
      suffer.
      Its
      a
      never-ending
      cycle.
      Want
      freedom?
      Money.
      Want
      peace?
      Money.
      Want
      to
      survive?
      Money.
      Want
      money?
      Suffer.
      Don't
      want
      to
      suffer?
      Money.
      I
      cannot
      achieve
      this
      wish.
      No
      matter
      how
      much
      I
      try.
      Cause
      I
      am
      just
      not
      lucky
      enough.
      Horrible
      parents,
      terrible
      school
      experience
      and
      most
      importantly,
      poor.
      I'm
      pretty
      tired
      from
      this
      never-ending
      cycle.
      And
      that's
      ok,
      maybe
      one
      day,
      I
      will
      find
      my
      place
      of
      peace.
      I
      will
      just
      keep
      wishing.
