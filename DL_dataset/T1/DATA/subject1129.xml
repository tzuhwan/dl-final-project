      Yeah
      I
      realized
      that,
      but
      surprisingly
      she
      came
      back
      later
      on
      in
      the
      day

      I
      was
      about
      5-6
      years
      old
      in
      a
      supermarket.
      I
      didn't
      realize
      I
      was
      standing
      directly
      under
      a
      weighing
      basket
      for
      produce.
      My
      dad
      jokingly
      said
      "don't
      jump!".
      Without
      looking,
      I
      screamed
      to
      my
      sister
      "HEY
      MEGAN,
      WATCH
      THIS!"
      *
      without
      looking
      up*.
      I
      HIT
      THAT
      THING
      SO
      HARD
      THAT
      IT
      SOUNDED
      LIKE
      A
      GONG
      WAS
      BEING
      HIT.

      Yeah,
      you're
      right,
      and
      no
      it
      was
      barely
      worth
      it
      for
      me.
      I
      guess
      I
      needed
      to
      hear
      it
      from
      someone

      That's
      what
      I
      was
      planning
      but
      my
      mom
      just
      got
      too
      mad
      and
      wouldn't
      let
      me
      take
      her
      back
      to
      the
      house.
      I
      also
      didn't
      have
      any
      friends
      to
      hold
      her
      for
      me.
      Now
      she's
      back
      at
      the
      shelter
      we
      got
      her;
      it's
      depressing.
      But
      I'll
      get
      over
      it
      eventually. #128565;

      Yes
      they

      sell
      live
      fish,
      one
      in

      Hill
      still
      sells
      the
      regular
      fish
      (including
      Betta's
      in
      the
      fish
      food

      They
      sell
      about
      10
      different
      types
      of
      fish.

      Sounds
      ridiculous,
      but
      I'm
      on
      a
      plan
      from
      2008
      only
      so
      my
      sister
      can
      keep
      her
      unlimited
      data.
      Now
      that
      Verizon
      is
      bringing
      it
      back,
      we
      can
      change
      it.

      My
      question
      is
      maybe
      Verizon
      has
      somewhere
      hidden
      in
      the
      newer
      plans
      where
      it's
      under
      their
      discretion
      to
      change
      or
      eliminate
      the
      unlimited
      data.

      I
      understand
      that,
      but
      my
      question
      was
      if
      they
      could
      downgrade
      plans
      and
      do
      away
      with
      unlimited
      some
      time
      in
      the
      future.

      The

      thing
      about
      the

      UDP
      is
      that
      it

      I

      If

      Go

      Walmart
      after

      pm,
      the

      will
      give

      Or
      find

      box
      you
      need
      (look
      on

      open

      what's
      in

      Walmart

      Man

      my

      brought

      a

      a

      absolutely
      hates
      him.
      My

      and
      I
      are
      going
      to
      try
      reintroducing
      through
      the
      eating
      between
      door
      trick
      for

      Hopefully

      be

      about

      At

      this
      was
      Shameless.

      How

      Haha
      wow,
      it's
      so
      scary
      because
      we
      know
      how
      viscous
      it
      could
      turn.
      The
      reason
      we're
      cautious
      is
      because
      he
      orange
      cat
      was
      a
      feral
      (picked
      her
      up
      on
      the
      street
      without
      realizing
      she
      was
      feral
      haha)
      who
      would
      guard
      her
      food
      when
      we
      first
      got
      her.
      Thanks
      for
      letting
      me
      know!

      Today
      I
      was
      a
      little
      out
      of
      my
      head.
      I
      got
      to
      school,
      almost
      locked
      my
      keys
      in
      the
      trunk,
      then
      I
      shut
      the
      trunk..
      Well,
      I
      supposedly
      shut
      the
      trunk.
      I
      was
      in
      class
      for
      an
      hour+.
      I
      was
      walking
      to
      my
      car,
      then
      my
      heart
      suck
      to
      my
      stomach.
      My
      trunk
      was
      halfway
      shut...
      OPEN.
      I
      freaked
      out
      thinking
      all
      of
      my
      money
      was
      stolen..
      To
      my
      surprise
      everything
      was
      left
      untouched.
      I
      parked
      by
      so
      many
      people
      and
      when
      I
      got
      to
      my
      car,
      people
      were
      just
      sitting
      in
      their
      cars
      probably
      thinking
      "What
      an
      idiot").
      I
      am
      so
      happy/
      relieved.

      I
      don't
      have
      cash,
      I
      just
      keep
      all
      of
      the
      money
      in
      my
      bank.
      So
      I
      meant
      my
      debit
      cards
      and
      credit
      card
      which
      were
      in
      my
      purse.
      I
      don't
      bring
      it
      into
      class
      either
      so
      I
      had
      a
      small
      heart

      Yeah
      I'm
      currently
      in
      a
      rural-ish
      city
      where
      it
      could
      be
      a
      possibility.
      My
      one
      friend
      who
      moved
      to
      Virginia
      for
      college
      had
      his
      MacBook
      and
      multiple
      cameras
      stolen
      from
      his
      car
      overnight.
      It's
      crazy!

      I
      noticed
      my
      circle
      was
      placed
      slightly
      to
      the
      left,
      but
      that's
      just
      ridiculous.

      I

      It's

      It's
      hilarious
      that
      you
      accused
      me
      of
      posting
      for
      up
      votes
      and
      that
      my
      post
      didn't
      actually
      happen.
      It's
      so
      obvious
      that
      you
      staged
      this.
      You
      are
      the
      actual
      definition
      of
      a
      desperate
      up
      vote
      whore.

      maybe
      this

      I
      had
      my

      joint,
      then
      aligned
      it
      to
      the
      end
      of
      a
      dollar.
      I
      then
      rolled
      the
      joint
      inside
      of
      the
      dollar
      to
      tighten
      it.

      I
      bought
      a
      medium
      sized
      Phoenician
      from
      Smoke
      Cartel.
      When
      I
      got
      it,
      it
      was
      pretty
      big.
      I'm
      used
      to
      small
      grinders
      where
      when
      I
      grind
      a
      small
      bud,
      it
      fills
      my
      grinder
      up
      pretty
      nice!
      This
      medium
      grinder
      is
      SUPER
      sharp.
      The
      teeth
      are
      slightly
      too
      far
      apart
      imho.
      It
      still
      gets
      the
      job
      done,
      you
      can
      see
      the
      final
      grind
      on
      the
      paper.
      While
      grinding,
      it
      makes
      a
      slight
      noise,
      but
      I
      honestly
      find
      the
      noise
      appealing
      lol.
      Other
      than
      that,
      it's
      a
      fast,
      smooth,
      and
      somewhat
      silent
      grind.
      The
      grinder
      comes
      with
      a
      guitar
      pick
      too
      for
      the
      bottom
      kief
      collector.
      I
      also
      love
      how
      the
      bottom
      is
      rounded
      so
      you
      can
      get
      all
      the
      kief
      inside.
      This
      grinder
      doesn't
      shut
      like
      normal
      grinders
      (by
      twisting
      until
      they're
      tight),
      you
      have
      to
      line
      each
      piece
      up
      and
      lock
      it
      into
      place.
      The
      magnet
      is
      really
      good.
      I
      would've
      gotten
      a
      smaller
      one
      because
      I
      don't
      grind
      enough
      to
      where
      I
      would
      need
      so
      much
      weed
      storage.
      Lmk
      if
      you
      have
      any
      other
      questions!

      I
      will
      be
      signing
      up
      for
      my
      trip
      for
      this
      winter.
      I
      have
      a
      few
      questions
      for
      anyone
      who
      has
      done
      this,
      or
      anyone
      that
      could
      answer
      some
      questions
      about
      Israel
      in
      general.
      What
      are
      the
      dos
      and
      don'ts
      for
      the
      trip?
      I
      will
      probably
      be
      doing
      the
      outdoors
      portion.
      1.
      What
      should
      I
      buy
      while
      in
      Israel,
      is
      there
      anything
      that
      I
      can't
      take
      home
      with
      me
      (what
      the
      airport
      won't
      let
      me
      take
      on
      the
      flight
      home?)?
      2.
      Should
      I
      haggle
      prices,
      or
      just
      accept
      the
      prices
      of
      items?
      3.
      Any
      cool
      stores
      to
      stop
      at?
      4.
      Can
      you
      sneak
      out
      of
      the
      hotel
      at
      night
      to
      go
      explore
      or
      do
      anything
      fun
      alone?
      5.
      What
      happens
      if
      you
      skip
      an
      activity
      to
      sleep
      in
      (I
      probably
      won't
      do
      this)?
      I've
      heard
      of
      people
      doing
      that,
      but
      what
      do
      they
      do
      once
      they
      wake
      up
      late
      while
      the
      rest
      of
      the
      group
      is
      gone?

      Yeah
      I

      Honestly,
      I
      feel
      way
      better
      drinking
      that
      amount
      opposed
      to
      my
      usual...
      Today
      I
      drank
      99
      oz
      (I
      weigh
      113).

      Yeah,
      milk
      is
      amazing.

      some

      I
      am
      a
      sophomore
      in
      college,
      and
      hopefully
      will
      be
      going
      to
      Florida
      Gulf
      Coast
      University
      in
      the
      spring.
      I'm
      going
      crazy
      and
      I
      feel
      helplessly
      lost
      trying
      to
      decide
      on
      what
      I
      want
      to
      be.
      Looking
      over
      FGCU's
      bachelor
      programs,
      I
      am
      not
      sure
      what
      I
      would
      do
      to
      have
      an
      HR
      career.
      What
      degree
      did
      you
      get
      work
      in
      HR?
      Edit:
      I'm
      assuming
      a
      B.S.
      in
      Management
      would
      be

      best

      Yeah,
      I'm
      starting

      just
      get
      a

      (concentrated

      in
      the
      HR
      world.

      Sorry
      I
      just
      realized
      how
      stupid
      I
      was,
      I
      didn't
      realize
      it
      lasted
      that
      short
      of
      time
      haha....
      I'll
      be
      in
      class
      for
      it
      anyway.

      did
      it
      back

      I

      the

      book
      is
      only
      worth
      about
      10
      bucks,
      but
      the
      access
      codes
      raise
      the
      price.
      I
      should've
      just
      bought
      the
      book
      online.

      my

      the

      we

      isn't

      so

      Fun
      fact:
      This
      phone
      isn't
      available
      anymore
      according
      to
      Verizon.
      My
      dad
      tried
      getting
      a
      replacement
      and
      they
      couldn't
      because
      they
      either
      had
      none
      in
      stock,
      or
      simply
      stopped
      the
      production.

      He's
      up
      in
      NY,
      so
      nope.
      Idk
      why
      he
      even
      sent
      that
      haha.
      We
      told
      him
      we
      were
      evacuating
      and
      had
      to
      hang
      up,
      so
      he
      texted
      this.
      He
      probably
      didn't
      send
      the
      whole
      message
      accidentally..

      So,
      I
      went
      to
      class,
      then
      the
      professor
      lectured
      up
      until
      there
      were
      10
      minutes
      left..
      He
      then
      told
      everyone
      to
      just
      take
      the
      exam
      home..

      Yeah,
      that #8217;s
      the
      only
      good
      part
      of
      being
      able
      to
      take
      it
      home.
      This
      class
      is
      probably
      going
      to
      be

      Sorry
      for
      the
      bad
      photo
      quality,
      about
      a
      month
      ago
      I
      got
      my
       #8220;virgin #8221;
      hair
      slightly
      colored
      with
      blonde.
      I
      want
      something
      slightly
      low
      maintenance.
      Hoping
      to
      get
      some
      guidance
      on
      what
      would
      look
      best
      for
      me.
      Also,
      I
      may
      want
      to
      get
      it
      cut
      shorter,
      what
      length
      do
      you
      guys
      think?

      Yes!!

      Do
      you
      have

      suggestions
      on
      what
      length
      I
      should
      go
      to?
      I
      was
      thinking
      just
      below
      my
      shoulders
      but
      I #8217;m
      not
      completely
      sure.

      There #8217;s
      this
      brand
      called
      Matrix
      and
      they
      sell
      a
      product
       #8220;Air
      Dry #8221;
      you
      put
      in
      your
      hair
      right
      after
      showering,
      there #8217;s
      3
      different
      styles,
      Chill,
      Wild,
      or
      Twisted.
      I
      feel
      you
      might
      like
      Twisted,
      it
      doesn #8217;t
      leave
      hair
      hard
      or
      anything
      and
      curls
      look
      great
      after.
      I
      also
      use
      Chill
      cause
      it
      reduced
      my
      frizz.

      Invisalign,

      a

      or
      was
      it
      based
      on
      the
      3D
      computer
      model
      of
      the
      teeth
      that
      made
      the
      dentist
      reconsider?
      I #8217;m
      going
      to
      an
      appointment
      on

      get
      Invisalign
      without

      mine
      are
      slightly
      more
      crowded
      than
      yours.
      Your
      smile
      looks
      amazing!

      Yeah
      I #8217;m
      just
      scared
      to
      do
      extractions
      because
      I #8217;m
      scared
      my

      change

      I #8217;m
      wary

      done.
      I

      I #8217;ll

      I
      got
      it
      from
      red
      bubble,
      sad
      that
      I
      couldn #8217;t
      get
      it
      from
      the
      actual
      rooster
      teeth
      shop.
      Had
      to
      cut
      around
      a
      white
      bevel,
      but
      I
      love
      it.
      You
      can
      see
      slight
      pixelation
      but
      only
      if
      you #8217;re
      super
      close
      to
      it,
      not
      bad
      at
      all.
      Bought
      from
      biggie
      smols,
      there
      was
      another
      seller
      that
      may
      have
      a
      better
      quality
      but
      I
      chose
      this
      one
      cause
      he
      sticker
      looked
      darker
      in
      colors.

      Thanks!
      Just
      recently
      bought
      these
      and
      want
      to
      get
      into
      caring
      for
      succulents!
      Do
      you
      think
      I
      should
      get
      a
      bigger
      pot
      for
      the
      one
      on
      the
      left?
      And
      also
      it
      seems
      kinda
      crowded
      so
      should
      I
      remove
      the
      ones
      growing
      out
      the
      sides
      and
      plant
      them
      in
      a
      different
      pot?

      only
      price
      match
      products
      on

      it

      have
      a

      a
      mini

      Like
      set

      Buy
      miniature

      beach
      chairs,

      Would
      that
      be

      Or
      should
      I
      do
      something
      more
      general?
      I
      have
      about
      9
      mini
      cars
      that
      I
      would
      be
      using.
      Or
      another
      theme
      I #8217;m
      thinking
      of
      is
      leading

      Just

      Should

      them
      in
      dry

      I #8217;m
      not
      sure
      if
      I
      would
      like
      my
      hair
      so
      short.
      I
      know
      it #8217;s
      extremely
      damaged
      but
      could
      I
      get
      away
      with
      cutting
      it
      at
      my
      collar
      bone
      then
      getting
      my
      stylist
      to
      match
      as
      close
      to
      my
      natural
      color
      as
      possible?
      I #8217;ve
      never
      had
      hair
      shorter
      than
      my
      breasts
      so
      it
      makes
      me
      nervous
      thinking
      about
      cutting
      it
      all
      off.

      the
      blonde
      part
      is
      very

      Should

      it
      slightly
      above
      my
      breasts

      would
      that

      just
      cut

      amount
      of
      the
