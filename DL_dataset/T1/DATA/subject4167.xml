      thanks,

      I
      cant
      answer
      OPs
      questions
      for
      them
      however,
      I
      can
      answer
      the
      second
      part
      of
      your
      question.
      I
      purchased
      the
      same
      watch
      from
      a
      different
      seller
      on
      DHgate.
      They
      also
      had
      zero
      reviews,
      it
      was
      mainly
      because
      majority
      of
      these
      reps
      come
      in
      the
      size
      that
      majority
      people
      want(37mm,40mm,41mm),
      so
      it
      was
      difficult
      to
      find
      a
      seller
      with
      the
      exact
      watch
      that
      i
      wanted.
      So
      when
      i
      did,
      i
      had
      to
      take
      the
      chances.
      And
      i #8217;m
      very
      glad
      i
      did.

      For
      me
      it #8217;s
      honestly
      surprisingly
      easier
      than
      even
      i #8217;d
      expect.
      I #8217;ve
      just
      come
      to
      the
      conclusion
      that
      sexuality
      is
      more
      of
      a
      spectrum
      and
      people
      ultimately
      care
      more
      about
      personality
      than
      what #8217;s
      in
      your
      pants.

      both.

      do
      with
      them
      being
      on
      the

      waves
      idk.

      it #8217;s
      the

      for

      Thank
      you,
      my
      gf
      of
      almost
      2
      years
      just
      broke
      up
      with
      me
      because
      she
      felt
      that
      we
      weren #8217;t
      on
      the
      same
      points
      of
      our
      lives
      because
      she #8217;s
      going
      off
      to
      college
      and
      wants
      her
      freedom.
      It
      hurts
      really
      bad.
      Thanks
      for
      making
      me
      realize
      that
      I
      just
      need
      someone
      mature
      enough
      to
      realize
      that
      it
      takes
      a
      lot
      of
      hard
      work
      to
      maintain
      a
      relationship.
      I
      really
      needed

      my
      gf
      of
      two
      years
      just
      broke
      up
      with
      me
      and
      i
      don #8217;t
      know
      what
      to
      do
      with
      myself.
      she #8217;s
      going
      off
      to
      college
      in
      another
      state
      and
      tells
      me
      she
      wants
      her
      freedom.
      but
      i
      know
      the
      main
      thing
      is
      that
      she
      has
      fallen
      for
      one
      of
      her
      guy
      friends
      she #8217;s
      recently
      been
      talking
      to.
      it
      hurts
      a
      lot.
      she
      tells
      me
      she
      doesn #8217;t
      want
      to
      be
      tied
      down
      in
      a
      relationship
      when
      she
      seemingly
      would
      love
      to
      be
      in
      one
      with
      him.
      so
      it #8217;s
      not
      really
      about
      a
      relationship,
      but
      just
      an
      issue
      with
      me.
      i
      try
      not
      to
      dwell
      on
      it
      though.
      i
      realize
      there #8217;s
      nothing
      i
      can
      do
      to
      change
      that.
      it #8217;s
      just
      so
      hard
      when
      you
      put
      everything
      into
      a
      person
      and
      give
      them
      your
      all,
      expecting
      them
      to
      do
      the
      same,
      only
      to
      be
      disappointed.
      watching
      someone
      fall
      out
      of
      love
      for
      you
      is
      really
      something
      else,
      i
      would
      never
      wish
      that
      on
      anyone.
      but
      i
      keep
      telling
      myself
      none
      of
      it
      is
      my
      fault.
      i
      did
      everything
      i
      could.
      i
      did
      everything
      for
      her.
      and
      if
      that
      wasn #8217;t
      enough,
      then
      it #8217;s
      her
      loss.
      here #8217;s
      to
      a
      better
      tomorrow.

      Sometimes
      instead
      of
      thinking
      about
      it
      like
      a
      waste
      of
      time,
      think
      of
      it
      like
      a
      lesson
      or
      a
      long
      memory.
      It #8217;s
      hard
      when
      you
      lose
      someone
      that
      you #8217;ve
      built
      something
      with
      for

      you
      were
      happy
      at
      least
      for
      a
      while.
      The
      breakup
      has
      made
      you
      who
      you
      are
      today,
      and
      that
      person
      is

      Isn #8217;t
      that
      better
      though?
      Knowing
      your
      own
      self
      worth.
      You
      did
      what
      was
      best
      for
      yourself,
      and
      that
      was
      to
      choose
      to
      move
      on
      because
      you
      know
      you
      deserve
      better.
      It
      hurts
      either
      way,
      but
      at
      least
      you
      put
      yourself
      first.

      You
      can
      never
      blame
      yourself
      for
      wanting
      more.
      Wanting
      more
      from
      someone
      else
      doesn #8217;t
      mean
      that
      you
      want
      too
      much,
      but
      most
      of
      the
      time
      because
      they
      didn #8217;t
      give
      enough.
      And
      you
      yourself
      know
      that
      you
      deserve
      to
      feel
      happy.
      There
      is
      no
      reason
      to
      dwell
      on
      things
      like
      that.
      If
      you
      left
      with
      reason,
      then
      that
      reason
      is
      good
      enough.
      There
      will
      be
      someone
      out
      there
      that
      gives
      you
      their

      and
      it #8217;ll

      All
      my
      life
      i #8217;ve
      felt
      like
      i
      was
      running.
      You
      made
      me
      feel
      like
      i
      could
      finally
      catch
      my
      breath.
      You
      made
      me
      feel
      like
      there
      was
      so
      much
      beauty
      in
      the
      world
      if
      it
      had
      you
      in
      it.
      You
      were
      like
      coming
      home
      after
      a
      hard
      day
      at
      work.
      You
      were
      like
      standing
      under
      a
      bridge
      when
      it
      was
      pouring
      rain.
      But
      you
      gave
      me
      up.
      You
      didn #8217;t
      want
      to
      try
      anymore
      because
      it
      was
      hard
      and
      someone
      new
      and
      easier
      came
      along.
      You
      gave
      up
      on
      someone
      who
      would #8217;ve
      never
      given
      up
      on
      you.
      I
      gave
      you
      countless
      chances
      and
      i
      gave
      you
      all
      the
      love
      i
      had.
      But
      you
      didn #8217;t
      want
      it.
      You
      want
      him.
      You
      want
      anything
      but
      me.
      But
      it #8217;s
      not
      my
      fault.
      I
      can
      and
      will
      do
      better.
      I #8217;m
      going
      to
      be
      so
      happy,
      just
      you
      wait.

      THIS.
      That #8217;s
      the
      most
      disappointing
      part
      about
      my
      breakup.
      I
      would #8217;ve
      done
      anything
      for
      her.
      Even
      though
      we
      had
      differences,
      i
      worked
      through
      them
      because
      i
      thought
      the
      happiness
      we
      got
      from
      the
      relationship
      was
      worth
      it
      all.
      I
      gave
      her
      countless
      chances
      even
      though
      she
      was
      the
      one
      who
      fucked
      up.
      She
      didn #8217;t
      feel
      the
      same.
      It
      was
      too
      much
      for
      her
      to
      deal
      with,
      she
      started
      to
      fall
      for
      someone
      new
      and
      easier.
      It
      made
      me
      feel
      like
      absolute
      garbage.
      She
      has
      yet
      to
      understand
      that
      love
      takes
      a
      lot
      more
      work
      than
      just
      things
       #8220;clicking #8221;
      and
      everything
      aligning.
      She
      gave
      up
      on
      someone
      who
      would #8217;ve
      never
      given
      up
      on
      her.
      But
      yes.
      I
      keep
      telling
      myself,
      her
      loss.

      I
      just
      got
      out
      of
      a
      relationship
      where
      i
      prioritized
      her
      before
      everything
      and
      even
      started
      putting
      her
      before
      myself.
      At
      first
      i
      thought
      i
      was
      in
      the
      wrong
      or
      too
      clingy.
      but
      now
      i
      realized
      it #8217;s
      not
      that
      i
      was
      too
      much,
      she
      was
      just
      not
      enough.
      i
      was
      always
      just
      an
      option
      to
      her
      and
      she
      always
      would
      make
      excuses
      to
      why
      she
      had
      to
      hangout
      with
      her
      friends
      over
      me.
      she
      even
      flat
      out
      told
      me
       #8220;i
      don #8217;t
      owe
      you
      anything #8221;
      and
       #8220;i
      can #8217;t
      put
      you
      before
      me #8221;.
      That #8217;s
      when
      i
      knew
      it
      wasn #8217;t
      love.
      It #8217;s
      hard
      when
      the
      person
      you
      love
      with
      everything
      doesn #8217;t
      feel
      the
      same.
      We
      all
      deserve
      someone
      who
      makes
      us
      a
      priority
      and
      never
      an
      option.
      We
      deserve
      to
      be
      given
      the
      same
      amount
      of
      love
      we
      give
      out.

      This
      is
      probably
      the
      hardest
      part.
      Talking
      to
      friends
      is
      great
      and
      all
      but,
      i
      just
      want
      someone
      to
      tell
      the
      random
      things
      to
      without
      it
      being
      abnormal.
      and
      even
      if
      you
      can
      tell
      those
      friends
      it
      just
      doesn #8217;t
      feel
      quite

      sometimes

      with
      someone

      And
      don #8217;t
      compare
      yourself
      to
      your
      friend,
      it #8217;s
      never

      not

      as
      she

      perhaps
      just
      that
      they
      may
      be
      a

      That

      things
      will

      turn
      out
      for
      the
      best.
      Surround
      yourself
      with
      good
      people
      and
      realize
      that
      even
      though
      he
      was
      someone
      special
      to
      you,
      if

      you
      would #8217;ve

      hey
      sorry,
      i
      saw
      this
      posted
      on
      another
      social
      media
      platform

      it
      put
      a
      smile
      on
      my
      face
      so
      i
      wanted
      to
      share
      it
      with
      people
      who
      would
      also
      appreciate
      it.
      i #8217;m
      relatively
      new
      to
      reddit
      so
      i
      wasn #8217;t
      sure
      if
      it
      had
      already
      been
      posted
      before.
      thanks
      for
      making
      the
      original,
      it
      really
      brightened

      i
      feel
      like
      it #8217;s
      almost
      a
      pendulum?
      when
      you
      just

      talking
      to
      someone
      you
      don #8217;t
      want
      to
      over
      share
      or
      text
      too
      much.
      when
      you #8217;ve
      been
      dating
      for
      a
      while
      you
      also
      don #8217;t
      feel
      the
      need
      to
      constantly
      text
      them
      with
      things
      like
       #8220;wyd #8221;.
      you
      just
      have
      to
      read
      the
      situation,
      the
      circumstances
      and
      the
      person.
      some
      like
      an
      instant
      reply,
      some
      don #8217;t
      feel
      the
      need.
      Don #8217;t
      overthink
      it,
      but
      also
      don #8217;t
      limit
      yourself.
      if
      you
      want
      someone
      who
      will
      continuously
      engage
      in
      conversation
      with
      you
      then
      don #8217;t
      settle
      for
      someone
      who
      never
      texts
      back
      or
      makes
      you
      feel
      like
      you #8217;re
      too
      much.

      i
      unlocked
      my
      car
      doors
      with
      my

      fob,
      let

      keys
      letting
      them
      fall

      i

      misplaced
      the
      keys
      and
      spent
      10
      minutes
      trying
      to
      find
      them.
      i
      have
      a

      something
      like
      that

      have

      at

      in
      your
      relationship
      it #8217;s
      not
      a
      big
      deal
      and
      you
      guys
      can
      laugh
      about

      Tiger
      is
      a
      popular
      brand
      and
      even
      though
      it
      is
      a
      great
      rice
      cooker,
      i
      believe
      it #8217;s
      one
      of
      the
      cheaper
      options.
      I
      think
      a
      brand
      like
      zojirushi
      is
      probably
      one
      of
      the
      best/most
      expensive
      ones.
      And
      i #8217;ve
      seen
      certain
      korean
      brands
      that
      are
      hundreds
      if
      not
      1000+
      dollars
