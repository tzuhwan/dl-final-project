      My
      parents
      are
      as
      retarded
      dude.
      One
      time
      I
      was
      quarelling
      with
      my
      dad
      and
      out
      of
      nothing
      he
      called
      the
      cops
      and
      told
      them
      that
      I
      used
      some
      type
      of
      drug.
      Another
      day
      I
      woke
      up
      sick
      and
      my
      fucking
      racist
      doctor
      told
      my
      parents
      to
      have
      me
      tested
      on
      drugs!
      Just
      because
      I
      didn't
      feel
      good!

      There's
      a
      girl
      in
      my
      class
      that
      says
      she
      has
      a
      crush
      on
      me
      but
      I
      don't
      fucking
      believe
      her.
      She
      never
      pays
      attention
      to
      me,
      never
      sends
      me
      any
      messages
      and
      doesn't
      seem
      to
      care
      at
      all.
      I
      think
      she's
      doing
      it
      because
      she
      needs
      emotional
      support,
      and
      that
      when
      she's
      stable
      again
      she
      will
      kick
      me
      out
      of
      her
      life.

      Am
      I
      the
      only
      one
      experiencing
      this?
      You
      wake
      up
      in
      the
      morning
      after
      an
      amazing
      dream,
      you
      think
      for
      a
      second
      where
      you
      are
      and
      then
      you
      realize
      you're
      in
      your
      bedroom
      and
      not
      dead
      yet,
      and
      it's
      gonna
      be
      another
      fucking
      boring
      day.
      You
      go
      to
      school
      and
      see
      those
      people
      again
      that
      pretend
      to
      be
      your
      friends,
      they
      ask
      you
      how
      you
      are
      and
      you
      just
      answer
      'fine'
      like
      always.
      When
      you
      finally
      come
      home
      you
      feel
      tired
      and
      empty
      and
      you
      haven't
      been
      paying
      attention
      to
      a
      single
      lesson.
      You'll
      try
      to
      eat
      something
      nice
      to
      feel
      better,
      but
      it
      doesn't
      help,
      you
      try
      going
      outside,
      but
      you
      have
      no
      one
      to
      join
      you,
      you
      want
      to
      study
      for
      your
      future,
      but
      you're
      constantly
      telling
      yourself
      that
      it's
      pointless,
      you
      want
      to
      be
      busy
      with
      your
      hobbies,
      but
      you
      have
      no
      motivation
      and
      feel
      guilty
      for
      everything
      you
      do.
      I've
      been
      like
      this
      for
      freaking
      months
      and
      even
      though
      I
      visit
      the
      psychiatrist
      frequently
      those
      conversations
      with
      her
      only
      make
      me
      feel
      worse
      and
      anxious.
      I
      also
      feel
      like
      depression
      killed
      half
      of
      my
      braincells
      because
      lately
      I'm
      having
      a
      hard
      time
      remembering
      people's
      name
      and
      shit.
      If
      I
      don't
      get
      help
      soon
      I'm
      sure
      that
      it'll
      be
      the
      fucking
      end
      for
      me.

      Oh,
      well
      I
      always
      seem
      to
      come
      close
      to
      suicide
      whenever
      life
      is
      being
      a

      again
      but
      lately
      I've
      been
      locking
      myself
      up
      for
      my
      own
      safety
      so
      no
      worries.
      Just
      when
      I
      thought
      that
      someone
      was
      finally
      going
      to
      escape
      from
      the
      curse
      called
      life.

      I
      fucking
      hate
      my
      parents
      too
      man,
      they're
      one
      of
      the
      main
      reasons
      that
      I'm
      depressed
      as
      shit
      and
      only
      see
      evil
      inside
      of
      me.
      I
      always
      have
      to
      get
      the
      best
      grades,
      be
      better
      than
      others
      and
      they
      don't
      fucking
      leave
      me
      alone.
      And
      when
      you
      ask
      them
      why
      they're
      doing
      this
      they'll
      respond
      with
      'it's
      for
      your
      own
      good'.

      If
      you
      wanna
      experience
      death,
      try
      psychedelics
      to
      make
      sure
      you
      won't
      regret
      it.
      I
      smoked
      synthetic
      weed
      last
      month
      and
      it
      sent
      me
      to
      hell.
      I
      didn't
      regret
      anything
      and
      even
      if
      it
      hurt
      alot
      I
      was
      glad
      that
      I
      wasn't
      alive
      anymore.
      Just
      a
      few
      hours
      later
      I
      woke
      up
      and
      felt
      like
      I
      had
      lost
      something.

      I

      consider

      are

      Most

      they
      don't
      even
      make

      are
      very

      I
      don't

      people
      can
      think

      they're
      suffering
      from

      If
      you
      ever
      looked
      up
      for
      tips
      and
      tricks
      to
      overcome
      depression,
      you'll
      most
      likely
      find
      people
      saying
      drink
      alot
      of
      of
      water
      and
      do
      yoga.
      I
      tried
      about
      a
      gallon
      of
      water
      everyday
      (4
      liters)
      but
      I
      didn't
      fucking
      change
      anything.
      It
      only
      reduced
      my
      brain
      fog
      but
      other
      than
      that
      there
      was
      no
      difference.
      I'm
      not
      going
      to
      try
      yoga
      because
      doing
      sports
      make
      me
      very
      uncomfortable
      and
      I
      can't
      imagine
      how
      it
      would
      make
      me
      feel
      better.

      Last
      night
      I
      was
      scrolling
      through
      Instagram
      and
      a
      friend
      of
      mine
      was
      chilling
      with
      my
      ex-crush.
      1.5
      years
      ago
      I
      fell
      in
      love
      with
      her
      but
      she
      said
      that
      she
      didn't
      want
      to
      be
      with
      me
      anymore
      because
      I
      was
      loving
      her
      way
      too
      much.
      She
      also
      switched
      schools
      so
      I
      saw
      her
      less
      often.
      Months
      passed
      and
      I
      did
      all
      kinds
      of
      stupid
      shit
      for
      her
      to
      convince
      her
      to
      be
      with
      me,
      but
      she
      didn't
      accept
      anything,
      not
      even
      the
      silver
      ring
      I
      gave
      her
      (she
      told
      me
      that
      she
      threw
      it
      away).
      Around
      may
      2018
      I
      stopped
      contacting
      her
      and
      checking
      on
      her
      and
      minded
      my
      own
      business,
      but
      she
      was
      somehow
      always
      stuck
      in
      my
      head.
      When
      I
      encouraged
      myself
      to
      think
      of
      something
      positive,
      it
      was
      always
      her,
      even
      when
      I
      didn't
      love
      her
      anymore.
      But
      it
      didn't
      make
      me
      feel
      good,
      it
      filled
      me
      with
      guilt
      and
      sadness.
      So
      yesterday
      when
      I
      saw
      a
      picture
      of
      her
      I
      was
      first
      disgusted,
      but
      when
      I
      went
      to
      sleep
      later,
      I
      had
      a
      really
      weird
      dream.
      We
      were
      on
      a
      sort
      of
      playground.
      i
      saw
      her
      at
      the
      slide
      and
      first
      she
      looked
      away,
      but
      for
      some
      reason
      2
      of
      my
      cousins
      were
      there
      as
      well
      (they
      knew
      that
      I
      loved
      this
      girl
      and
      they
      made
      fun
      of
      me).
      I
      was
      talking
      first
      with
      my
      2
      cousins
      and
      I
      dropped
      a
      few
      jokes,
      and
      all
      of
      them
      started
      laughing.
      That's
      when
      I
      started
      to
      talk
      with
      my
      crush
      again,
      and
      she
      wasn't
      ignoring
      me,
      but
      I
      don't
      remember
      what
      we
      were
      talking
      again,
      because
      I
      suddenly
      woke
      up,
      disappointed
      that
      I
      didn't
      die
      in
      my
      sleep.

      Yeah
      but
      I
      always
      get
      thin
      scars
      that
      you
      can't
      really
      see
      I
      wonder
      how
      people
      get
      these
      thick
      red/purple
      scars.
