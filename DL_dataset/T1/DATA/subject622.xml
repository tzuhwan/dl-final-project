      Huh.
      I
      always
      interpreted
      it
      as
      "John,
      John"
      and
      never
      gave
      it
      a
      second
      thought.
      Interesting
      how
      many
      people
      here
      heard
      it
      as
      "John-John"
      it
      never
      even
      crossed
      my
      mind.

      I
      was
      there
      at
      the
      show
      Mia
      seemed
      to
      have
      fucked
      up
      her
      knee
      or
      ankle
      but
      judging
      by
      her
      twitter
      she
      seems
      okay.
      I
      saw
      the
      other
      girl
      Sahara
      7
      get
      rushed
      out
      on
      a
      stretcher
      after
      the
      show
      and
      it
      was
      scary
      her
      breathing
      was
      super
      shallow.
      From
      what
      I
      could
      tell
      she
      was
      injured
      pretty
      badly.

      I
      love
      Beat
      the
      Champ!
      It #8217;s
      not
      my
      number
      one
      but
      probably
      number
      3?
      It #8217;s
      so
      good.
      Loving
      pro
      wrestling
      might
      have
      something
      to
      do
      with
      it
      being
      so
      close
      to
      my
      heart
      but
      it #8217;s
      also
      so
      much
      more
      than
      just
      pro
      wrestling
      y #8217;know?
      Everyone
      has
      that
      Thing
      they #8217;ve
      used
      a
      form
      of
      shelter
      and
      maybe
      it #8217;s
      not
      wrestling
      for
      you
      but
      that
      feeling
      is
      still
      deeply
      recognizable
      when
      you
      listen
      to
      JD
      sing
      about
      it.
      Every
      mountain
      goats
      album
      is
      about
      finding
      what
      is
      universal
      in
      ultra
      specific
      parts
      of
      life
      and
      Beat
      the
      Champ
      (and
      now
      Goths
      too!)
      is
      one
      of
      the
      best
      examples
      of
      that.

      Personally
      I #8217;ve
      never
      heard
      Rhys
      pronounced
      as
      rice
      and
      I
      really
      like
      that
      spelling.
      However,
      I
      think
      if
      you #8217;re
      going
      for
      what
      makes
      your
      kid #8217;s
      life
      easier
      than
      I #8217;d
      go
      with
      Reese.
      Reece
      to
      me
      is
      probably
      the
      worst
      option

      I
      think
      it #8217;s
      a
      cute
      name
      done
      wrong
      by
      the
      spelling.
      Stormy
      or
      even
      Stormie
      would
      be
      a
      good
      name
      but
      I #8217;ve
      always
      found
      names
      with
      i
      endings
      like
      Lexi
      and
      Brandi
      to
      just
      look
      silly.
      Storm
      being
      her
      full
      name
      and
      Stormi
      as
      the
      nn
      would
      be
      best
      case
      scenario
      as
      I
      think
      Storm
      could
      be
      a
      cool
      strong
      name
      but
      for
      me
      Stormi
      isn #8217;t
      that
      bad.
      She #8217;s
      a
      Jenner
      it #8217;s
      not
      like
      her
      name
      is
      ever
      gonna
      be
      judged
      by
      a
      potential
      employer
      or
      anything.

      I

      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      it #8217;s
      too
      old
      lady
      at

      I #8217;m

      about

      that #8217;s
      more

      lol.
      I
      think
      Freddie

      someone
      else
      said
      is

      I
      personally
      think
      Jude
      is
      your
      best
      bet.
      While
      Merrick
      is
      cool
      a
      lot
      of
      people
      are
      gonna
      mishear
      it
      and
      it
      is
      a
      unisex
      name
      so
      that
      may
      be
      something
      you're
      looking
      to
      avoid.
      Theodore
      is
      super
      popular
      for
      kids
      being
      born
      now
      as
      someone
      else
      said
      so
      it
      might
      seem
      weird
      for
      you
      to
      have
      that
      name.
      Obviously
      if
      the
      downfalls
      of
      Merrick
      don't
      concern
      you
      pick
      that
      one
      since
      you
      like
      it
      but
      Jude
      seems
      the
      most
      hassle
      free.

      There
      were
      three
      girls
      at
      my
      high
      school
      all
      named
      Aida
      pronounced
      like
      Ida.
      I
      think
      it #8217;s
      a
      pretty
      name
      but
      three
      letter
      names
      like
      Ava
      and
      such
      always
      look
      half
      finished
      to
      me
      so
      ideally
      for
      me
      it #8217;d
      be
      spelled
      as
      Aida
      but
      maybe
      that #8217;s
      just
      because
      I #8217;m
      more
      exposed
      to
      that
      spelling
      so
      it
      seems
      more
      correct.

      Oh
      man
      I
      remember
      listening
      to
      White
      Cedar
      one
      day
      in
      my
      basement
      and
      at
      this
      point
      I
      had
      listened
      to
      it
      a
      million
      times
      but
      for
      some
      reason
      those
      two
      drum
      hits
      happened
      and
      I
      completely
      lost
      it
      just
      0-100
      shoulder
      shaking
      sobbing
      out
      of
      NOWHERE.
      I
      don #8217;t
      even
      know
      what
      came
      over
      me
      I
      was
      fine
      the
      second
      before
      but
      I
      guess
      that #8217;s
      just
      white
      cedar #8217;s
      grip
      on
      me.

      I
      wish.
      I
      go
      to
      college
      there
      and
      I #8217;ve
      been
      looking
      for
      a
      while
      but
      from
      what
      I #8217;ve
      seen
      there
      doesn #8217;t
      look
      to
      be
      one
      that #8217;s
      still
      running.
      All
      I
      know
      is
      what
      the
      other
      guy
      said
      about
      MCW
      but
      that #8217;s
      a
      good
      3
      hour
      drive
      if
      traffic
      is
      light.

      Kolton
      and
      Kameron
      is
      baffling
      because
      both
      names
      are
      traditionally
      spelled
      with
      a
      C
      so
      it #8217;s
      not
      like
      the
      parents
      changed
      the
      spelling
      so
      the
      two
      could
      have
      the
      same
      initials.
      Just
      seems
      kinda
      pointless
      is
      all.

      I

      a
      lot
      of

      are
      also
      the

      of
      this
      sub
      just
      not
      being
      in

      about
      how
      most
      of
      gay/stan
      twitter
      works.
      Saying
      someone
      you
      don #8217;t
      particularly
      care
      for
      is
      untalented
      trash
      is
      just
      sort
      of...what
      people
      say
      on
      that
      part
      of
      the
      internet.
      It #8217;s
      really
      not
      that
      deep.
      You
      stan
      who
      you
      stan
      and
      everyone
      else
      is
       #8220;garbage #8221;.
      I #8217;m
      not
      saying
      I
      agree
      with
      or
      like
      that
      mode
      of
      thinking
      (I
      personally
      find
      it
      kinda
      over
      the
      top)
      but
      that #8217;s
      what
      he #8217;s
      doing
      here.

      I

      seem
      to
      be

      because
      that #8217;s
      not
      what

      is.
      It #8217;s
      just
      a
      show
      at
      a
      gaming

      You
      guys
      must
      think
      very
      little
      of
      writers
      if
      you
      really
      don #8217;t
      think
      they
      put
      any
      thought
      into
      the
      specific
      words
      they
      choose
      in
      their
      work.
      Also
      the
      author #8217;s
      intent
      doesn #8217;t
      necessarily
      have
      to

      analysis
      at
      all
      for
      it
      to
      still
      be
      good
      and
      worthwhile
      analysis.
      Just
      because
      you
      didn #8217;t
      like
      doing
      it
      doesn #8217;t
      mean
      your
      teacher
      just

      Personally
      I #8217;m
      of
      the
      opinion
      that
      as
      long
      as
      you
      can
      support
      your
      analysis
      with
      the
      text
      it #8217;s
      valid.
      I
      don #8217;t
      disagree
      that
      teachers
      can
      go
      overboard
      when
      teaching
      analysis
      I
      just
      think
      it
      gets
      a
      bad
      rap.
      I
      think
      the
      fault
      in
      what
      your
      teacher
      did
      was
      giving
      you
      the
      analysis
      and
      making
      you
      write
      about
      it
      rather
      than
      letting
      you
      guys
      actually
      interpret
      the
      text
      and
      do
      your
      own
      thing
      so
      I
      get
      how
      that
      can
      be
      really
      off-putting.

      Honestly
      I
      think
      what #8217;s
      important
      to
      take
      from
      this
      whole
      situation
      is
      that
      John
      is
      a
      person.
      Fallible
      and
      imperfect
      and
      human
      above
      all
      else.
      I
      think
      that
      realization
      is
      really
      where
      all
      the
      panic
      is
      coming
      from.
      This
      fan
      base
      in
      particular
      really
      does
      engage
      in
      the
      outright
      hero
      worship
      of
      JD
      and
      honestly
      myself
      included
      for
      a
      while
      (they #8217;ve
      been
      my
      favorite
      band
      since
      I
      was
      11
      though
      so
      it #8217;s
      hard
      to
      avoid
      that
      kind
      of
      thinking
      when
      you #8217;re
      young).
      This
      whole
      fiasco
      forces
      you
      to
      realize
      that
      no
      he
      really
      isn #8217;t
      your
      spiritual
      father
      figure
      come
      to
      deliver
      you
      from
      your
      trauma
      he #8217;s
      just...a
      guy.
      Who
      fucks
      up.
      Do
      I
      think
      what
      John
      did
      was
      inappropriate?
      Yeah,
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      the
      artist-fan
      power
      dynamic
      can
      responsibly
      allow
      for
      that
      kind
      of
      console-me-I-need-you
      intimacy.
      I
      think
      it
      was
      emotionally
      immature
      at
      best.
      But
      do
      I
      think
      he #8217;s
      an
      abuser?
      Absolutely
      not.
      He #8217;s
      just
      an
      obviously
      mentally
      ill
      guy
      who
      I
      think
      genuinely
      tries
      his
      best
      to
      do
      good.
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      there
      was
      any
      malicious
      calculated
      intent
      like
      op
      implied.
      I
      just
      believe
      that
      there
      was
      an
      irresponsible
      lack
      of
      boundaries
      from
      JD
      but
      really,
      nothing
      he
      did
      is
      that
      horrific
      it #8217;s
      just
      the
      realization
      that
      he #8217;s
      not
      perfect
      that #8217;s
      earth
      shattering
      for
      some.
      I
      hope
      both
      John
      and
      the
      op
      find
      peace
      with
      this
      situation.

      Really
      well
      said.
      It #8217;s
      refreshing
      to
      have
      a
      nuanced
      take
      instead
      of
      the

      and
      john-is-a-monster
      takes
      I #8217;ve

      I

      only
      hope
      this
      all
      works
      out
      well
      for
      everyone
      involved.

      A
      little
      embarrassed
      to
      say
      I
      cried
      through
      that
      entire
      episode
      and
      maybe
      sobbed
      reading
      that
      article
      but
      such
      is
      life.
      I
      never
      even
      really
      watched
      bojack
      before
      this
      but
      this
      subject
      hits
      real
      close
      to
      home.
      My
      mom #8217;s
      still
      alive
      but
      there
      was
      a
      period
      of
      time
      where
      she
      had
      completely
      disappeared
      from
      my
      life
      and
      I
      had
      to
      confront
      the
      idea
      that
      she
      might
      be
      dead
      and
      I
      went
      through
      very
      similar
      emotions.
      Trying
      to
      handle
      the
      death
      of
      someone
      that #8217;s
      done
      you
      wrong
      but
      you
      still
      desperately
      want
      to
      be
      able
      to
      love
      anyway
      is
      such
      a
      difficult
      thing
      and
      I #8217;m
      glad
      people
      are
      talking
      about
      it.

      I
      mean
      ultimately
      you
      can
      name
      your
      kid
      whatever
      you
      want
      and
      people
      will
      learn
      to
      pronounce
      it
      correctly,
      it's
      just
      going
      to
      be
      a
      little
      more
      work
      for
      your
      child.
      In
      terms
      of
      prehispanic
      mexican
      names
      that
      would
      be
      easy
      for
      the
      general
      public
      to
      pronounce,
      your
      best
      bet
      would
      be
      one
      of
      the
      more
      "intuitive"
      ones
      like
      Citlalli
      and
      Malinalli.
      I've
      met
      two
      girls
      named
      Xochitl
      before
      which
      isn't
      on
      your
      list
      but
      it's
      a
      little
      more
      common
      than
      some
      of
      the
      others
      if
      you're
      interested
      in
      it?
      At
      the
      end
      of
      the
      day
      if
      you
      love
      the
      name
      and
      you're
      understanding
      that
      it
      probably
      won't
      be
      the
      easiest
      name
      to
      have,
      use
      it.
      People
      will
      figure
      it
      out
      eventually.
      For
      a
      middle
      name
      though?
      Honestly
      you
      could
      probably
      go
      hog
      wild
      and
      it
      would
      not
      matter
      because
      most
      people
      don't
      share
      their
      middle
      names
      all
      the
      time
      so
      if
      you
      really
      love
      these
      names,
      but
      don't
      feel
      comfortable
      putting
      them
      as
      a
      first
      name,
      then
      a
      middle
      name
      is
      definitely
      not
      a
      problem.

      I

      it
      tops
      No

      for

      That

      I
      still
      think
      this
      is
      a

      I

      can #8217;t
      wrap
      my
      head
      around
      how
      he #8217;s
      able
      to
      get
      so
      weird
      and
      noise-y
      and
      still
      maintain
      his
      pop
      sensibility.
      His
      mind.
      I
      need
      him
      to
      make
      music
      forever.

      My
      first
      tmg
      song
      was
      Damn
      These
      Vampires.
      I
      think
      it
      was
      the
      first
      thing
      that
      came
      up
      when
      I
      googled
      the
      mountain
      goats
      since
      All
      Eternals
      Deck
      had
      just
      came
      out.
      I
      don #8217;t
      even
      remember
      why
      I
      looked
      them
      up
      but
      I
      think
      someone
      online
      mentioned
      them?
      I
      was
      immediately
      hooked
      and
      downloaded
      their
      entire
      discography
      but
      really
      only
      seriously
      listened
      to
      All
      Hail
      West
      Texas
      and
      the
      Sunset
      Tree
      over
      and
      over
      for
      a
      few
      years
      before
      diving
      into
      the
      rest
      of
      their
      stuff
      later.

      what
      a
      throwback.
      I
      own
      this
      book
      too
      I
      bought
      it
      when
      I
      was
      like
      14.
      I
      was
      a
      huge
      sweet
      bro
      and
      hella

      I #8217;m
      gay
      and
      honestly
      not
      a
      big
      crier
      but
      I
      borderline
      sobbed
      at
      the
      ending.
      I #8217;ve
      been
      really
      lucky
      in
      terms
      of
      growing
      up
      in
      a
      very
      accepting
      environment
      so
      I
      end
      up
      not
      relating
      to
      a
      lot
      of
      narratives
      where
      people
      struggle
      with
      coming
      out
      but
      for
      some
      reason
      this
      episode
      just...took
      me
      there.
      I
      think
      a
      lot
      of
      it
      is
      just
      the
      showrunners
      seeing
      their
      lgbt
      fans
      and
      deciding
      to
      make
      something
      beautiful
      for
      us
      and
      not
      caring
      if
      it #8217;s
      tonally
      inconsistent
      with
      the
      rest
      of
      the
      show.
      They
      wanted
      us
      to
      have
      this
      and
      they
      did
      it.
      It #8217;s
      just
      really
      affirming
      and
      I
      have
      the
      utmost
      respect
      and
      gratitude
      for
      rob
      for
      this.

      Not
      sure
      what
      you #8217;re
      getting
      at.
      Criticism
      is
      perfectly
      valid,
      so
      is
      straight
      just
      not
      liking
      it.
      I
      only
      find
      fault
      in
      saying
      what
      something
      was
       #8220;meant #8221;
      to
      be

      you #8217;re
      not
      the
      creator
      of
      it
      yourself.
      I #8217;m
      pretty
      sure
      only
      they
      know
      where
      the

      alliterative
      and
      I #8217;ve
      always
      liked
      it.
      I
      never
      even
      considered
      it
      as
      a
      problem

      on

      sub
      hate
      it
      for
      some
      reason.
      I
      think
      it #8217;s
      fine?
      Literally
      no
      one
      comments
      on
      it
      except
      on
      occasion
      someone

      out
      and
      say
      they
      think
      it #8217;s
      cool.

      I
      think
      it
      depends
      how
      much
      you
      define
      the
      genre
      by
      the
       #8220;rock #8221;
      part
      of
      the
      name.
      I
      wouldn #8217;t
      really
      call
      their
      music
      rock
      but
      I #8217;d
      probably
      call
      it
      math.
      I
      think
      it #8217;s
      more
      of
      a
      personal
      definition
      thing.
      I #8217;d
      consider
      them
      math
      pop
      and
      probably
      include
      them
      under
      the
      greater
      umbrella
      of
      math
      rock.

      I
      first
      heard
      about
      them
      when
      I
      was
      14-15
      (I #8217;m
      19
      now
      for
      reference)
      because
      I
      used
      to
      be
      really
      into
      the
      band
      AJJ
      at
      the
      time
      and
      Jamie
      Stewart
      did
      vocals
      on
      Coffin
      Dance
      from
      Christmas
      Island
      so
      I
      checked
      out
      some
      of
      Xiu
      Xiu #8217;s
      music
      from
      there.
      Angel
      Guts:
      Red
      Classroom
      had
      just
      came
      out
      so
      the
      first
      search
      results
      were
      songs
      from
      that
      album
      and
      I
      didn #8217;t
      really
      like
      them
      at
      the
      time.
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      I
      gave
      them
      another
      shot
      until
      I
      was
      like
      16
      or
      17
      and
      someone
      I
      respected
      the
      music
      taste
      of
      was
      talking
      a
      lot
      about
      Knife
      Play
      so
      I
      gave
      it
      a
      listen
      and
      fell
      in
      love.
      Though
      to
      be
      fair
      to
      my
      past
      self,
      Angel
      Guts
      is
      still
      one
      of
      my
      least
      favorite
      Xiu
      Xiu
      releases
      (though
      I
      do
      like
      it)
      so
      I
      probably
      would
      have
      had
      a
      better
      first
      opinion
      of
      them
      had
      it
      been
      a
      different
      album.

      I
      mean,
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      it #8217;s
      because
      they #8217;re
      women?It #8217;s
      not
      like
      there #8217;s
      a
      Collective
      Music
      Taste
      shared
      by
      all
      women
      that
      makes
      them
      hate
      math
      rock.
      I
      think
      it #8217;s
      largely
      in
      part
      with
      just
      how
      niche
      it
      is
      as
      a
      genre
      the
      average
      person,
      in
      my
      experience,
      isn #8217;t
      really
      crazy
      about
      it.
      I
      know
      several
      women
      who
      like
      it,
      people
      are
      different,
      man.
      Maybe
      your
      female
      friends
      just
      aren #8217;t
      into
      it
      because
      they
      aren #8217;t
      into
      it
      and
      not
      because
      they #8217;re
      female.
      If
      you
      mean
      in
      terms
      of
      low
      attendance
      rates
      of
      women
      at
      shows
      and
      stuff
      that #8217;s
      probably
      a
      self
      feeding
      loop
      where
      having
      the
      crowds
      be
      male-dominated
      might
      make
      some
      women
      not
      feel
      as
      welcome
      and
      in
      turn
      not
      go
      to
      shows,
      keeping
      the
      scene
      male
      dominated.
      But
      that #8217;s
      really
      part
      of
      a
      larger
      discussion
      about
      music
      scenes
      as
      a
      whole.

      Honestly,
      it #8217;s
      been
      kind
      of
      annoying
      to
      see
      so
      many
      people
      making
      fun
      of
      it
      as
      if
      it
      wasn #8217;t
      obviously
      just
      part
      of
      her
      accent?
      I #8217;m
      Brazilian
      (from
      Minas
      Gerais
      like
      Larissa
      funnily
      enough)
      but
      I
      moved
      to
      America
      when
      I
      was
      young
      but
      the
      rest
      of
      my
      family
      has
      a
      considerable
      accent
      when
      they
      speak
      English
      and
      oftentimes
      add
      the
      -ee
      sound
      to
      the
      end
      of
      words.
      Seeing
      everyone
      make
      fun
      of
      someone
      who
      sounds
      like
      my
      family
      members,
      even
      if
      she
      is
      insufferable
      otherwise,
      is
      a
      little
      disheartening.

      Soo
      fucking
      good.
      Their
      least
      accessible
      shit
      in
      like...ever
      maybe?
      But
      still
      so
      fucking
      good.
      I
      preordered
      it
      so
      I #8217;ve
      had
      it
      for
      a
      few
      days
      now
      and
      every
      listen
      gets
      better
      for
      me.
      Some
      will

      a

      I
      don #8217;t
      really
      believe
      in
      ghosts
      or
      monsters
      or
      demons
      or
      anything
      like
      that
      anymore
      (used
      to
      as
      a
      kid
      though)
      but
      I
      think
      supernatural
      horror
      is
      significantly
      scarier
      than
      slashers.
      For
      me,
      its
      in
      the
      unknowability
      of
      it.
      Ultimately,
      I
      know
      what
      a
      human
      can
      do.
      They
      can
      still
      be
      scary
      and
      awful
      but
      I
      know
      the
      limitations
      of
      a
      human.
      A
      demon?
      Satan?
      A
      ghost?
      I
      don #8217;t
      know
      what
      the
      fuck
      they
      can
      do
      at
      all
      and
      that #8217;s
      way
      scarier
      for
      me.

      Sounds
      a
      lot
      like
      my
      little
      brother
      but
      with
      Michael
      Myers.
      He #8217;s
      about
      to
      turn
      4
      (parents
      got
      remarried
      so
      there #8217;s
      a
      huge
      age
      gap)
      and
      he #8217;s
      obsessed
      with
      him.
      Obviously
      he #8217;s
      wayyy
      too
      young
      to
      watch
      Halloween
      but
      his
      mom
      took
      him
      to
      a
      halloween
      store
      and
      he
      saw
      a
      big
      animatronic
      Michael
      Myers
      display
      and
      fell
      in
      love.
      His
      mom
      had
      to
      talk
      him
      out
      of
      having
      a
      Michael
      Myers
      birthday
      party.
      Maybe
      some
      people
      are
      just
      born
      horror
      fans
      haha.

      Oh
      man
      I'm
      so
      jealous
      you
      guys
      got
      Last
      Limit
      of
      Bhakti
      that's
      like
      one
      of
      my
      dream
      songs
      to
      see
      live.
      This
      sounds
      like
      it
      was
      a
      great
      show.

      Maybe
      I #8217;m
      biased
      since
      TMG
      have
      been
      my
      favorite
      band
      since
      I
      was
      like
      12
      but
      I
      didn #8217;t
      find
      this
      album
      underwhelming
      at
      all.
      I
      love
      it
      to
      be
      honest.
      It
      feels
      like
      a
      culmination
      of
      Beat
      the
      Champ #8217;s
      dip
      into
      country
      and
      the
      groovier/jazzier
      parts
      of
      Goths.
      The
      Owen
      Pallett
      production
      was
      also
      definitely
      a
      welcome
      addition,
      there
      were
      tons
      of
      musical
      choices
      I
      never
      really
      expected
      from
      a
      mountain
      goats
      record
      but
      I
      feel
      like
      they
      worked
      well.
      Cadaver
      Sniffing
      Dog,
      Younger,
      Clemency
      for
      the
      Wizard
      King,
      and
      Waylon
      Jennings
      Live!
      are
      probably
      my
      favorite
      tracks
      from
      this
      album
      but
      I
      can #8217;t
      really
      say
      there #8217;s
      any
      that
      I
      dislike
      altogether.
      I
      definitely
      got
      into
      this
      one
      quicker
      than
      Goths
      which
      took
      me
      a
      few
      listens
      to
      fully
      appreciate.
      It #8217;s
      definitely
      some
      of
      their
      best
      work
      in
      recent
      years.

      Okay,
      I #8217;ve
      been
      looking
      for
      this
      for
      AGES
      but
      googling
      has
      done
      nothing.
      I
      found
      this
      story
      in
      a
      book
      of
      horror
      stories
      for
      kids
      (not
      scary
      stories
      to
      tell
      in
      the
      dark,
      I
      remember
      the
      cover
      being
      more
      colorful
      and
      less
      scary).
      It
      was
      about
      a
      little
      girl
      who
      goes
      to
      a
      toy
      store
      with
      her
      mom
      and
      she
      sees
      a
      baby
      doll
      being
      sold
      with
      a
      matching
      mommy
      doll.
      She
      only
      wants
      the
      baby
      doll
      and
      the
      store
      clerk
      tries
      to
      tell
      her
      to
      buy
      both
      but
      she
      throws
      a
      fit
      and
      manages
      to
      buy
      only
      the
      baby
      doll.
      The
      rest
      is
      kind
      of
      blurry
      for
      me
      but
      I
      think
      basically
      the
      baby
      doll
      comes
      to
      life
      and
      keeps
      calling
      for
      its
      mama?
      That #8217;s
      all
      I
      remember
      for
      certain.
      I #8217;m
      looking
      for
      the
      name
      of
      the
      book
      or
      even
      just
      proof
      that
      it
      exists
      because
      at
      this
      point
      I
      feel
      crazy.
      If
      it
      helps
      any
      I
      just
      turned
      20
      and
      I
      read
      this
      book
      when
      I
      was
      probably
      like
      7-9
      years
      old.

      I
      think
      in
      7th?
      Grade
      or
      somewhere
      around
      there.
      Around
      when
      All
      Eternals
      Deck
      came
      out
      because
      I
      remember
      Damn
      These
      Vampires
      being
      the
      first
      song
      I
      heard
      when
      I
      looked
      them
      up
      after
      hearing
      about
      them
      online
      so
      I
      must
      have
      been
      somewhere
      around
      12.
      I
      got
      super
      super
      into
      The
      Sunset
      Tree
      and
      All
      Hail
      West
      Texas
      from
      there.
      I
      turned
      20
      last
      month
      and
      the
      Sunset
      Tree
      remains
      my
      favorite
      album
      of
      all
      time.

      Writing

      has
      some

      don #8217;t
      get

      but
      as

      It
      doesn #8217;t
      even
      compare
      to
      most
      of
      the

      I #8217;m
      with
      most
      people
      and
      think
      Miles
      flows
      the
      best
      with
      Trayvon
      but
      I
      love
      the
      name
      Malcolm
      and
      think
      it #8217;s
      a
      close
      second.
      I
      am
      on
      the
      other
      hand
      super
      surprised
      that
      so
      many
      people
      here
      only
      associate
      Trayvon
      with
      Trayvon
      Martin.
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      I #8217;ve
      ever
      known
      a
      Trayvon
      but
      I #8217;ve
      known
      enough
      guys
      named
      similar
      things
      like
      Tayvon
      or
      Trayvius
      that
      Trayvon
      comes
      across
      as
      a
      fairly
      straightforward
      generic
      name.
      I
      guess
      it
      depends
      on
      where
      you #8217;re
      from
      to
      see
      how
      strong
      the
      association
      would
      be.

      Absolutely
      devastating.
      American
      Water
      and
      The
      Natural
      Bridge
      got
      me
      through
      high
      school.
      This
      happening
      so
      soon
      after
      the
      release
      of
      Purple
      Mountains
      makes
      it
      all
      the
      more
      tragic.
      Rest
      In
      Peace
      to
      an
      absolutely
      unparalleled
      songwriter.

      it #8217;s
      more
      straightforward/tame

      what
      I
      usually

      I #8217;m

      more
      and
      hopefully
      the

      little
      weirder.
