      There
      are
      Ranks
      within
      the
      demons.
      There
      Is
      a
      Group
      called
      the
      Six
      Black
      Knight.
      They
      are
      Strong
      Demons,
      And
      there
      is
      The
      Ten
      commandment
      are
      the
      Elite
      Group.
      They
      are
      superior
      to
      the
      Black
      knight
      but
      Not
      the
      Strongest
      in
      the
      demon
      in
      the
      clan.
      There
      were
      weakling
      like
      fraudring
      and
      Galan
      Within
      them
      and
      There
      were
      Comparatively
      strongest
      Members
      like
      Meliodas
      Zeldrin.
      But
      Cusack
      and
      Chandler
      are
      the
      Highest
      Rank
      in
      the
      demon
      clack.
      They
      are
      the
      teaches
      of
      the
      strongest
      members
      in
      the
      Ten
      commandment.
      They
      cant
      simply
      be
      part
      of
      this
      weakling.
      they
      are
      probably
      close
      to
      the
      Demon
      kings
      level
      without
      his
      demon

      he

      We
      all
      believed
      Full
      counter
      was
      Meliodas
      Magical
      power.
      That
      is
      the
      ability
      to
      completely
      counters
      Magical
      attacks
      reflecting
      them
      back
      at
      the
      enemy
      with
      even
      greater
      force
      .
      Then
      later
      in
      the
      season
      2
      we
      found
      out
      that
      Estarossa
      magical
      power
      was
      always
      Full
      Counter
      just
      in
      different
      form.
      that
      is
      ability
      to
      counter
      and
      reflect
      physical
      Attacks.
      Later
      In
      the
      Manga,
      we
      came
      to
      know
      Chandler
      is
      actually
      the
      Owner
      of
      full
      counter
      and
      taught
      it
      to
      Meliodas
      his
      student,
      but
      we
      have
      seen
      him
      use
      Meliodas
      version
      of
      full
      counter
      not
      Estarossa
      version.
      Now
      That
      we
      All
      know
      Estarossa
      was
      Mael
      all
      this
      while,
      we
      can
      say
      full
      counter
      was
      some
      how
      implanted
      in
      Mael
      by
      OG
      Gowther
      was
      turning
      him
      into
      a
      Estarossa.
      If
      that
      is
      the
      case
      then
      that
      version
      already
      existed
      and
      was
      taught
      to
      Estarossa.
      I
      personally
      think
      Chandler
      is
      the
      owner
      of
      both
      Full
      counter
      and
      reverse
      counter.
      When
      Chandler
      was
      fighting
      the
      sins
      he
      was
      shown
      using
      magical
      Full
      counter
      but
      when
      he
      Turn
      to
      his
      beast
      or
      original
      form
      Zeldris
      mentions
      That
      if
      Chandler
      Take
      That
      form
      No
      one
      can
      tough
      him.
      And
      I
      think
      no
      one
      can
      touch
      him
      means
      both
      Magical
      and
      physical
      full
      counter
      was
      activated,
      and
      can
      also
      use
      Reverse
      Counter
      from
      Both.
      What
      do
      you
      think
      Guys.

      Definitely.
      We
      haven't
      seen
      the
      Supreme
      deity
      yet
      and
      just
      a
      little
      of
      the
      demon
      King.
      I
      personally
      think
      Meliodas
      will
      be
      the
      boss
      of
      this
      season
      or
      Arc
      And
      the
      next
      will
      be
      more
      of
      goddess
      clan
      probably
      Mael
      will
      try
      getting
      his
      grace
      back
      with
      the
      help
      of
      Ludociel.
      The
      manga
      is
      far
      from
      over.
      This
      season
      or
      arc
      will
      end
      at
      probably
      chapter
      297
      with
      Elizabeth
      getting
      his
      curse
      lift.
      That
      just
      about
      10
      chapters
      away
      and
      we
      are
      still
      yet
      to
      find
      out
      something
      like
      Bans
      Sacred
      weapon
      and
      Who
      Rhitta
      really
      is.
      I
      think
      Its
      will
      end
      at
      400
      chapters
      .
      And
      I
      also
      Read
      Nakaba
      is
      panning
      a
      prequel
      more
      like
      3000years
      ago
      before
      the
      war.

      How
      can
      you
      be
      so
      cruel
      with
      zeldris
      to
      give
      him
      that

      So
      201,000
      ludeciel
      and
      above
      100,000
      escanor
      are
      almost
      hopeless
      against
      him.
      do
      you
      still
      give
      him
      70
      to
      90k
      .
      man
      thats
      unfair
      to
      him.
      first
      I
      said
      I
      dont
      see
      Zeldris
      being
      the
      son
      of
      the
      demon
      king
      have
      61k
      Pl,
      he
      should
      be
      over
      120,000
      and
      everyone
      wanted
      my
      head.
      Do
      you
      think
      Nakaba
      would
      save
      Zeldris
      fight
      till
      this
      time
      if
      he
      had
      just
      that
      low

      a
      weapon.
      Reasons:
      Rhitta's
      special
      ability
      is
      Charge
      and
      Fire.
      which
      completely
      absorb
      and
      store
      the
      amount
      of
      heat
      Escanor
      that
      radiates
      from
      Escanor's
      body
      during
      the
      day.
      which
      allows
      him
      to
      release
      the
      heat
      on
      command
      and
      with
      precision
      instead
      of
      simply
      burning
      away
      everything
      around.
      So
      it
      mean
      Escanor
      cant
      actually
      use
      Sunshine
      without
      The
      aid
      of
      Rhitta.
      We
      can
      also
      put
      it
      that
      Escanor
      cant
      really
      control
      His
      Magic
      without
      his
      Weapon.
      we
      are
      yet
      to
      see
      Escanor
      Use
      Sunshine
      without
      Rhitta.
      So
      my
      question
      is
      what
      is
      the
      Connection
      of
      Rhitta
      to
      Sunshine.
      We
      came
      Know
      Sunshine
      is
      actually
      a
      grace
      from
      the
      Goddess
      Clan
      formally
      the
      Grace
      of
      Mael.
      And
      For
      some
      unknown
      reason
      Pass
      on
      to
      Escanor
      who
      is
      a
      human.
      But
      I
      dont
      think
      Mael
      will
      need
      a
      Weapon
      in
      other
      to
      Use
      Sunshine
      like
      Escanor.
      And
      before
      The
      Archangels
      revived,
      it
      was
      mentioned
      that
      they
      resided
      in
      relics
      and
      Ornaments
      or
      treasures.
      So
      what
      if
      there
      is
      a
      goddess
      in
      Escanor's
      Sacred
      Treasure
      and
      the
      name
      of
      that
      Goddess
      is
      Rhitta.
      Though
      it
      was
      mention
      That
      The
      king
      Gave
      them
      their
      Sacred
      treasure
      but
      i
      think
      That
      was
      just
      a
      bluff
      because
      Chestifol
      wasn't
      given
      to
      king
      by
      Batra
      or
      Melins
      Aidan,
      so
      we
      can
      say
      Escanor
      has
      his
      all
      the
      while.
      So
      my
      question
      is
      who
      is
      Rhitta?
      Why
      cant
      Escanor
      use
      Sunshine
      without
      her/his
      Aid.
      I
      personally
      think
      She
      was
      the
      wielder
      of
      Sunshine
      before
      Mael
      and
      when
      Mael
      Died
      or
      turned
      into
      A
      demon
      it
      came
      Back
      to
      her
      but
      because
      she
      didnt
      have
      a
      physical
      body
      She
      chose
      Escanor
      and
      granted
      him
      the
      grace.
      but
      because
      he
      is
      a
      mere
      Human
      and
      cant
      use
      that
      grace
      like
      a
      true
      Goddess
      She
      stick
      with
      him
      to
      Aid
      him.
      Another
      theory
      is
      Rhitta
      possess
      Escanor
      During
      the
      day.
      Escanor's
      Pride
      is
      beyond
      Human.
      He
      is
      a
      completely
      different
      man
      when
      the
      sun
      is
      out
      but
      he
      Goes
      back
      to
      a
      typical
      Escanor
      when
      the
      Sun
      is
      down.
      This
      pride
      Has
      not
      been
      seen
      with
      Mael
      so
      we
      can
      conclude
      its
      not
      due
      to
      his
      Sunshine
      magic
      but
      rather
      from
      a
      different
      source.
      I
      think
      That
      pride
      is
      the
      pride
      of
      Rhitta
      the
      Goddess.
      probably
      the
      Strongest
      of
      all
      after
      the
      Supreme
      Deity.

      I
      doubt
      That
      it
      was
      Craft
      or
      Forged
      By
      anyone
      in
      the
      Kindom
      or
      by
      the
      King.
      Chestifol
      is
      given
      to
      the
      fairy
      King
      by
      the
      Sacred
      Tree.
      Gloxinia
      Has
      Basquias
      because
      he
      was
      a
      Fairy
      King.
      Anyway.
      Meliodas
      Sacred
      Treasure
      is
      a
      Demon
      Sword
      from
      the
      demon
      World.
      they
      Call
      it
      Demon
      Sword
      Lostvayne.
      Escanor
      Sacred
      Treaure
      is
      Called
      Divine
      Axe
      Rhitta.
      I
      guess
      it
      tells
      Us
      its
      from
      the
      Goddess
      race.
      we
      Are
      still
      yet
      to
      see
      Escanor
      use
      Sunshine
      without
      Rhitta
      if
      he
      can.
      I

      he
      can.

      Do

      The

      is
      by
      far
      far
      better

      re-read

      First
      I
      love
      this
      manga
      to
      the
      core.
      Its
      actually
      my
      best
      so
      far.
      It
      took
      me
      15days
      to
      catch
      up.
      I
      love
      the
      Zhao
      invasion,
      I
      feel
      like
      i
      cant
      wait
      for
      the
      new
      chapter.
      I
      wish
      I
      could
      take
      a
      break
      and
      come
      back
      to
      read
      when
      it
      at
      700
      chapters
      but
      Im
      so
      addicted
      i
      check
      for
      spoilers
      here
      and
      there.
      But
      I
      came
      to
      realize
      the
      Zhao
      invasion
      has
      gone
      for
      more
      than
      a
      year,
      Its
      frustration
      to
      waiting
      every
      week
      for
      a
      Chapter
      but
      it
      could
      be
      more
      frustration
      to
      guys
      who
      has
      been
      reading
      for
      years.
      I
      wish
      i
      could
      skip
      time
      or
      enter
      Hera's
      mind
      to
      read
      from
      there.
      The
      guy
      who
      recommended
      this
      Manga
      to
      me
      should
      have
      told
      me
      about
      it
      in
      2020
      knowing
      that
      this
      mango
      can
      go
      pass
      1000
      chapters.
      i
      cant
      waiting
      and
      i
      wont
      be
      able
      to
      deal
      with
      the
      breaks.

      I
      think
      Hera
      should
      make
      you
      a
      general.
      nice
      post.
      I
      didn't
      notice
      these
      2
      important
      people
      but
      i
      always
      ask
      why
      Moubu
      was
      considered
      the
      best
      attacker
      in
      all
      of
      china?
      was
      it
      because
      of
      his
      strength
      or
      he
      was
      having
      top
      generals
      like
      Tou
      for
      Ouki,
      or
      Ouson
      and
      Kanki
      for
      Mougou.
      but
      From
      your
      helpful
      post
      I
      will
      say
      these
      2
      Generals
      might/are
      the
      reason
      why
      Moubu
      is
      an
      attacker
      extraordinaire.
      Kanki
      and
      olsen
      was
      the
      reason
      why
      mougou
      was
      said
      to
      have
      the
      best
      army.
      Maybe
      same
      goes
      for
      moubu
      even
      though
      he's
      strong
      himself

      I
      think
      Zeldris
      will
      win
      this
      fight.
      simply
      because
      Mael
      should
      be
      weak
      right
      now
      per
      the
      time.
      Sunshine
      users
      are
      stronger
      when
      the
      time
      is
      approaching
      noon
      and
      weak
      when
      the
      time
      is
      going
      down.
      zeldris
      is
      yet
      to
      use
      his
      Asault
      mode,
      Hopefully
      when
      i
      find
      out
      that
      he
      has
      no
      means
      of
      stopping
      merlin.
      he
      counting
      on
      meliodas
      to
      save
      his
      girlfriend
      who
      is
      actually
      the
      most
      important
      thing
      in
      his
      life,
      so
      now
      making
      meliodas
      the
      demon
      king
      is
      his
      top
      priority.

      By
      recommendation.
      But
      I
      hate
      that
      guy
      for
      one
      reason.
      and
      the
      reason
      is,
      he
      should
      have
      told
      me
      about
      Kingdom
      in
      2020
      or
      2021.
      The
      manga
      would
      have
      gotten
      to
      700
      chapters
      by

      In

      Zeldris

      Kick

      Meliodas

      Meliodas
      and

      Merlin,
      Ludociel,
      Escanor

      almost

      Meliodas
      Dominated
      Escanor
      until
      The
      one,
      And
      Zeldris
      was
      also
      dominating
      5
      of
      them
      until
      Escanor
      One
      Full.
      AM
      Meliodas
      Vs
      Zeldris
      in
      Perfect
      Cude
      will
      be

      Death...
      Meliodas

      I
      think
      it
      would
      have
      been
      best
      if
      Nakaba
      had
      shown
      more
      of
      Cuzack
      and
      chandler
      Than
      Making
      a
      pointless
      combination
      of
      them.
      We
      only
      saw
      best
      of
      Chandler
      when
      he
      fought
      against
      the
      Sins
      and
      was
      told
      to
      have
      left
      than
      half
      is
      Power.
      We
      deserved
      to
      see
      more
      of
      Him
      fight
      on
      Full
      strength,
      and
      We've
      seen
      almost
      nothing
      of
      Zeldris
      Master
      Cusack's
      real
      fight.
      HE
      deserved
      to
      see
      more
      of
      the
      highest
      ranked
      Demons
      instead
      of
      Making
      something
      as
      pointless
      as
      the
      sinner.
      Is
      Nakaba
      in
      a
      rush
      or
      he
      just
      superficially
      making
      a
      great
      manga
      look
      ordinary?..
      I
      almost
      stopped
      reading
      this
      Manga
      when
      Monspiet
      Died
      because
      we
      couldn't
      see
      more
      of
      his
      fight.
      I
      think
      this
      Manga
      would
      have
      been
      better
      if
      it
      were
      to
      go
      for
      500
      600
      chapters
      with
      all
      the
      Character
      getting
      their
      moment
      to
      show
      what
      they
      can
      truly
      do.

      Literally
      The
      Sinner
      is
      Chandler
      and
      Cuzsack.
      and
      should
      be
      stronger
      than
      both.
      But
      i
      don't
      believe
      Mael's
      Greatest
      Sun
      would/could
      have
      Hurt
      Chandler
      because
      he
      can
      easily
      use
      Full
      Counter
      to
      Send
      Mael
      Back
      to
      sleep
      mode.
      Sinner
      saw
      the
      Greatest
      Sun
      Magic
      and
      couldn't
      do
      a
      thing
      instead
      went
      to
      sleep
      mode.
      Don't
      y'all
      think
      They
      were
      have
      been
      better
      individuals
      than
      making
      them
      a
      one
      being.

      I
      would
      go
      for
      Ka

      She
      was
      the
      MVP
      of
      the

      Arc.
      She
      Almost

      best
      him
      Psychologically
      and
      coming
      to
      rescues.
      Every
      move
      she
      made
      was
      terrifying.
      Even
      Riboku
      had
      to
      succumb
      to
      Ka
      Rin
      strategy
      many
      time
      because
      She
      a
      Genius.
      Kyou
      was
      a
      terrifying
      general
      but
      i
      don't
      think
      she
      will
      be
      a
      match
      for
      Ka
      Rin.
      Strategically
      and
      Physically.
      Being
      the

      1
      General
      in
      the

      Kyou

      Olsen
      center
      Army
      seem
      weak
      with
      no
      Capable
      General
      like
      Akou
      and
      Makou.
      Just
      weaklings.
      but
      We
      all
      know
      Olsen
      has
      been
      giving
      enemy
      Commanders
      second
      chances
      to
      live
      by
      joining
      his
      Army.
      We've
      only
      seen
      few
      switch
      side
      to
      his
      army
      but
      I
      guess
      there
      are
      more
      off
      screen
      recruits
      or
      switches.
      He
      wanted
      to
      Catch
      Ordo
      Alive
      in
      the
      coalition

      to
      give
      him
      join
      me
      or
      Die
      option.
      I
      think
      Olsen
      have
      some
      Monster
      Commanders
      or
      General
      level
      Commanders
      in
      his
      Army
      that
      we
      don't
      know
      much
      about,
      even
      more
      stronger
      or
      dangerous
      than
      Akou
      or
      Makou.
      What
      do
      you
      guys
      think?

      Riboku
      is
      shins
      Uncle.
      Riboku
      realized
      Shin
      bears
      great
      resemblance
      to
      her

      and

      Shin
      growing

      a
      man
      and
      making
      wave
      across

      We

      more
      about
      Shin

      relationship.
      Perhaps
      in
      this
      current

      Maybe
      Ka
      Rin
      is

      just
      maybe.

      He
      even
      got
      a
      chapter

      I

      he
      will
      have
      a
      big

      Maybe
      future
      Left

      Man
      of

      or
      maybe
      he
      will
      join
      Ouhon
      Army
      or
      get

      Kyoukai
      knows

      telling
      Shin
      his

      is
      bad

      line.
      But
      she
      Seem
      to
      know
      what
      that
      sword
      is.
      Maybe

      her
      later
      after
      this

      I
      think
      you
      are
      a
      bit
      confuse.
      Comparing
      Out
      hon
      to
      Tou
      its
      unfair.
      Tou
      is
      pretty
      much
      an
      all
      round
      person.
      He
      hasn't
      show
      his
      true
      ability
      yet.
      The
      Wei
      commanding
      general
      said
      Tou
      has
      should
      his
      capability
      yet.
      In
      his
      questwith
      shin
      Mou
      ten
      and
      Ou
      hon
      he
      just
      gave
      the
      kids
      the
      plaform
      to
      be
      themselves
      and
      perform
      to
      their
      potential.
      I
      think
      he's
      a
      start
      general
      show
      see
      potential
      and
      also
      tty
      to
      develop
      it.
      I
      think
      he
      the
      only
      General
      who
      truely
      knows
      the
      potential
      of
      the
      kid.
      Qin
      official
      and
      Shiheikun
      are
      not
      mad
      to
      grand
      someone
      who
      does
      qualify
      to
      be
      A
      GG
      that
      position.
      You
      know
      how
      moubu
      suffered
      before
      he
      was
      made
      a
      GG.
      Always
      asking
      them
      to
      make
      him
      BT
      Tou
      was
      given
      even
      ahead
      of
      Ou
      Sen
      and
      Kanki...
      Because
      we've
      see
      less
      of
      him
      doesn't
      mean
      we
      should
      downplay
      him...
      Man
      recognized
      by
      Ouki
      isn't
      a

      Physically
      he

      Army.
      Strategically
      He
      not
      far
      below
      Ousen.
      You've
      forgotten
      Ousen
      chooses
      his
      battle
      but
      Tou
      does
      the
      opposite.
      And
      he
      also
      has
      a
      shape
      intuition.
      He
      sensed
      the
      coalition
      army
      before
      then
      when
      showed
      up
      and
      attacked
      them
      with
      just
      a
      small
      number...
      Tou
      is
      greater
      than
      you
      think
      bro...
      Being
      the
      next
      in
      command
      of
      One
      of
      the
      6
      Great
      General
      is
      not
      someone
      you
      can
      accomplished
      with
      cute
      face
      or
      good
      look
      or
      being
      good.
      You
      got
      to
      fight
      your
      way.
      And
      for
      a
      GG
      to
      be
      great
      most
      of
      it
      come
      from
      his
      Generals
      of
      commander..
      Men
      ouki
      said
      he
      is
      not
      much
      higher
      in
      strength
      than
      Tou.
      I
      think
      in
      strategy
      too...
      You
      need
      to
      give
      some
      respect
      to
      the
      Great
      General
      Tou.

      I
      will
      have
      to
      blame
      one
      man
      for
      Ouki's
      Death
      and
      that
      is
      Moubu.
      Its
      acting
      on
      his
      own
      accord
      and
      Ouki
      came
      down
      to
      prevent
      him
      from
      getting
      killed.
      Anyway
      Ouki
      Did
      predicted
      there
      was
      an
      army
      coming
      but
      though
      he
      could
      be
      reach
      quick
      with
      houken.
      Ouki
      did
      acknowledged
      Riboku
      saying
      coming
      war
      in
      China
      will
      circle
      around
      Him
      but
      to
      be
      very
      honest
      Ouki
      wouldnt
      have
      lost
      to
      Riboku
      if
      he
      knew
      him
      already.
      and
      I
      strongly
      believe
      on
      a
      same
      plane
      like
      Ousen
      vs
      Riboku
      Ouki
      will
      never
      loss.
      Riboku
      used
      Cheat
      to
      win
      and
      I
      congratulate
      him
      for
      knowning
      the
      code
      to
      stop
      Ouki
      but
      who
      knows
      how
      many
      years
      of
      prep
      riboku
      used
      and
      information
      he
      gather
      on
      him.
      IMO
      houken
      joining
      the
      Zhao
      Great
      heaven,
      Riboku
      infiltrating
      the
      Northern
      mountain
      people
      were
      all
      because
      of
      Ouki,
      and
      Ouki
      had
      no
      knowledge
      of
      Riboku's
      Existence.

      My
      friend
      and
      I
      snicked
      into
      main
      office
      to
      steal
      Exams
      papers.
      We
      weren't
      caught
      that
      moment.
      but
      after
      writing
      the
      6th
      paper
      that
      was
      Mathematics.
      We
      just
      made
      a
      big
      mistake
      being
      so
      kind
      to
      let
      few
      friend
      know
      we
      are
      in
      possessing
      of
      Maths
      paper
      2
      days
      before,
      They
      also
      gave
      it
      out
      and
      it
      some
      how
      leaked.
      when
      people
      realized
      after
      the
      Maths
      exams
      that
      the
      paper
      was
      leaks
      days
      before
      that,
      they
      got
      pissed
      and
      went
      spreading
      the
      news
      that
      the
      papers
      go
      leaked
      so
      they
      staff
      some
      investigation
      and
      we
      were
      sold
      out
      by
      those
      we
      were
      kind

      I
      tried
      a
      lot
      of
      times
      winning
      a
      Lady
      over
      with
      Poems
      and
      song
      lyrics
      for
      2
      years
      and
      she
      never
      turn
      to
      look
      at
      me
      until
      i
      found
      out
      she
      goes
      to
      the
      Field
      to
      watch
      soccer
      games
      every
      weekend.
      Then
      i
      realized
      Poems
      and
      music
      was
      just
      a
      waste
      and
      she
      never
      gave
      a
      hoot
      about
      that.
      So
      I
      turned
      into
      a
      Soccer
      lover
      and
      then
      went
      to
      the
      field
      every
      weekend.
      We
      became
      very
      close
      talking
      about
      Matches
      and
      criticizing
      players
      and
      coaches.
      I
      got
      her
      Eventually
      in
      about
      5
      months
      from
      them
      and
      I
      was
      Like
      "**What
      a
      wasted
      2years"**
      if
      i
      knew
      this
      earlier.

      What

      people

      to
      fix
      them
      if
      we
      want
      to.
      We

      a

      and

      Per
      what
      we've
      seen
      so
      far
      in
      the
      current
      arc.
      We
      now
      know
      a
      hybrid
      General
      could
      exist
      somewhere.
      We
      all
      know
      Ousen
      and
      Ri
      Boku
      are
      great
      Strategic
      Generals
      but
      we
      have
      seen
      they
      can
      also
      use
      instinct
      from
      learning
      from
      the
      cream
      of
      Instinctual
      General
      Duke.
      We
      can
      say
      they
      are
      just
      a
      mere
      copy
      of
      what
      could
      possibly
      be
      a
      hybrid
      type.
      So
      the
      question
      is
      what
      if
      Great
      General
      Tou
      was
      Qin's
      successful
      Hybrid
      type
      of
      General.
      Why
      was
      he
      even
      made
      a
      Great
      General
      before
      Ou
      sen
      and
      Kanki?
      they
      were
      all
      Generals
      serving
      under
      great
      Generals.
      what's
      your
      thought
      on
      this.

      What
      experience?
      That
      i
      think
      is
      him
      using
      pure
      instinct,
      not
      experience.
      Remember
      he
      was
      the
      first
      General
      to
      notice
      something
      was
      going
      to
      happen
      before
      the
      rest
      of
      the
      Generals
      or
      even
      Kanyo.
      He
      said
      to
      his
      men
      a
      great
      wind
      was
      coming
      to
      Qin
      and
      was
      first
      to
      engage
      them.
      all
      this
      along
      with
      the
      Wei
      invasion
      Go
      Houmei
      trap
      was
      Instinct
      not
      Strategy
      or
      experience.

      Yes,
      there
      is
      a
      lot
      of
      explanation
      to
      that
      if
      i
      am
      right.
      You
      will
      be
      an
      excellent
      model
      since
      you
      love
      the
      spotlight.
      Also,
      acting
      will
      be
      great
      for
      yours.
      You
      are
      a
      very
      passionate
      person,
      very
      emotional,
      possessive
      and
      intense.
      you
      hate
      dishonesty
      and
      can
      detect
      liars
      easily.
      You
      have
      a
      very
      strong
      sexual
      aura
      and
      very
      attractive.
      people
      think
      you
      are
      a
      rude,
      authoritative,
      prideful
      and
      self-confident
      person
      and
      think
      its
      offensive.
      people
      think
      you
      are
      an
      attention
      seeker
      because
      of
      your
      bright
      playful
      nature.
      You
      can
      be
      frustrated
      because
      you
      do
      not
      come
      across
      to
      others
      as
      you
      really
      are.
      To
      then
      you
      are
      Harsh
      and
      to
      you
      they
      just
      misunderstood
      you.
      It
      is
      hard
      for
      you
      to
      accept
      that
      you
      may
      be
      wrong
      or
      that
      you
      need
      to
      improve
      yourself,
      which
      makes
      it
      hard
      for
      you
      to
      change
      what
      they
      say
      about
      you.
      Actually,
      you
      want
      everyone
      you
      meet,
      friend
      or
      love
      to
      feel
      happy
      and
      okay
      even
      if
      you
      do
      not
      like
      them.
      You
      treat
      all
      people
      equal.
      You
      wish
      to
      have
      a
      lover
      who
      loves
      you
      the
      same
      as
      you
      love
      them.
      You
      don't
      want
      a
      one-sided
      love
      and
      when
      you
      feel
      your
      relationship
      is
      being
      one
      side
      you
      find
      a
      way
      to
      balance
      it.
      You
      feel
      alive
      and
      can
      be
      yourself
      when
      you
      have
      a
      partner
      It's
      likely
      you
      have
      your
      original
      way
      of
      doing
      things
      which
      is
      different
      from
      anyway.
      and
      don't
      like
      doing
      thing
      the
      normal
      way.
      you
      need
      some
      level
      of
      freedom
      from
      your
      partner
      in
      a
      relationship.
      Advice:
      Communicate
      with
      people
      in
      a
      positive
      manner.
      Air
      signs
      will
      be
      best
      for
      you.

      I
      personally
      think
      it
      will
      be
      SHK.
      since
      many
      believe
      he
      will
      betray
      Qin
      and
      join
      the
      chu.
      If
      I
      am
      not
      mistaken
      it's
      said
      he
      was
      a
      prince
      of
      chu,
      so
      maybe
      he
      will
      take
      his
      place
      as
      the
      rightful
      king
      of

      or
      become
      the

      yes,
      he

      I

      Karin's

      Hoh.
      Kanki
      hasn't
      made
      a
      move
      yet.
      And
      Gyou
      is
      said
      to
      be
      really
      hard
      to
      break
      city
      so
      I
      am
      expecting
      Kanki
      army
      to
      take
      about
      20
      chapters
      to
      full
      take
      over
      Gyou.
      and
      it
      looks
      like
      it's
      going
      to
      take
      about
      15chapters
      more
      on
      the
      Ousen
      vs
      Riboku
      Battle.
      so
      I
      think
      in
      all
      it
      will
      take

      Forget
      the
      Manic
      shht.
      Mhen
      I
      can
      see
      a
      very
      intelligent
      freedom-loving
      guy
      but
      can
      be
      superficial
      in
      anything
      including
      relationship.
      Focus
      should
      come
      hard
      for
      you
      but
      if
      you
      can
      focus
      you
      can
      do
      almost
      anything.
      Jack
      of
      all
      trade,
      learn
      to
      focus
      and
      you
      can
      master
      some
      or
      most.
      haha,
      I
      can
      see
      a
      shapeshifter
      or
      Cameleon
      nature
      in
      you.
      You
      can
      easily
      change
      and
      easily
      adapt.
      You
      cant
      actually
      be
      yourself
      when
      you
      work
      alone
      or
      enjoy
      working
      with
      someone
      or
      in
      a
      group
      but
      you
      also
      want
      the
      person/group
      to
      give
      you
      enough
      freedom.
      Talkative,
      argumentative.
      a
      very
      great
      debater,
      an
      energetic
      one.
      You
      are
      attracted
      to
      someone
      smarter
      than
      you
      or
      at
      the
      same
      wavelength
      or
      a
      brainer.
      a
      quiet
      and
      dumb
      partner
      is
      worse
      for
      you.
      she
      should
      be
      knowledgable
      and
      talkative
      else
      you
      become
      bore
      with
      them.

      Why
      I

      Ouhon
      is
      not
      Ousen's
      son.

      I
      mean
      come
      on,
      in
      as
      much
      as
      we
      love
      Ouhon
      and
      want
      to
      see
      Ousen
      acknowledge
      him
      as
      his
      son.
      Lets
      also
      put
      ourself
      in
      Ousen
      shoe
      or
      try
      to
      get
      Ousen
      point.
      even
      though
      Hara
      hasn't
      dived
      deep
      into
      that.
      Let's
      look
      at
      it
      this
      way.
      Why
      I
      think
      Ouhon
      is
      not
      Ousen
      son.
      For
      most
      of
      us
      guys
      whenever
      a
      lady
      come
      to
      tell
      us
      they
      are
      pregnant
      with
      us,
      we
      only
      accept
      the
      pregnancy
      when
      we
      are
      very
      sure
      that
      we
      were
      the
      only
      one
      using
      that
      road
      but
      whenever
      there
      are
      some
      doubts,
      accepting
      it
      becomes
      an
      issue.
      if
      this
      happens
      we
      {whoever
      have
      been
      in
      this
      mess)
      try
      to
      do
      some
      investigation,
      casting
      minds
      back
      and
      asking
      around
      if
      there
      was
      someone
      else
      using
      the
      road
      aside
      us
      before
      making
      the
      decision
      to
      accept
      or
      not.
      so
      my
      point
      is
      if
      Ousen
      thinks
      Ouhon
      isn't
      his
      son
      then
      Ousen
      has
      without
      a
      doubt
      made
      some
      investigation
      to
      confirm
      he
      isn't
      responsible
      for
      Ouhon's
      creation.
      I
      first
      thought
      Ousen
      was
      being
      a
      jerk
      father
      on
      Ouhon
      until
      I
      read
      the
      Zhao
      invasion
      to
      the
      current
      chapter.
      I
      said
      to
      myself.
      can
      Ousen
      who
      is
      on
      par
      with
      Riboku
      be
      wrong
      in
      investigating
      on
      his
      son?
      NO.
      And
      if
      he
      says
      he's
      not
      the
      father
      of
      Ouhon
      he
      is
      Goddamn
      right
      and
      I
      am
      with
      him
      because
      of
      Ousen
      is
      not
      the
      type
      of
      man
      to
      be
      wrong
      with
      something
      so
      important
      as
      finding
      out
      if
      His
      first
      son,
      the
      rightful
      heir
      to
      him
      is
      truly
      his
      or
      not.
      If
      it
      was
      Moubu
      then
      it
      would
      have
      been
      a
      different
      case
      but
      this
      is
      Ousen.
      Let's
      Think
      again.

      I

      that
      was
      okay

      I
      am
      not
      into
      the
      occult.
      I
      am

      and
      I
      have
      vast
      knowledge
      in

      I
      do

      capable

      within

      or
      less

      I
      am
      an
      African
      Ghanaian
      to
      be
      precise.
      I

      evil
      spirits
      or
      witch
      try
      or
      hunt
      me.
      My

      beat
      really
      hard
      when
      something
      is

      on
      or
      someone
      is
      trying
      something
      against
      me.
      An
      unknown
      person
      told
      me
      to
      seek
      for

      because
      evil
      witches
      are
      plotting
      and
      trying
      me
      because
      of
      what
      I
      am
      capable
      of.
      I
      am
      also
      a
      good
      rapper
      and
      capable
      of
      doing
      a
      lot
      more
      which
      can
      take
      me
      high.
      I
      have
      taken
      the
      Unknown
      person's
      advice
      but
      how
      can
      I

      I

      Thanks
      for
      your
      help
      r/Vanderlust13
      I
      would
      love
      to
      make
      friends
      with
      any
      good
      spirit
      or
      entities
      around
      if
      I
      knew
      how
      to
      do
      that.
      And
      should
      I
      ask
      my
      ancestors
      protection
      through
      Prayers
      or
      offering?
      Well,
      I
      have
      been
      trying
      to
      get
      what
      you
      meant
      with
      the
      egg.
      I
      didn't
      understand
      it
      well.
      Will
      I
      use
      only
      the
      egg
      white
      on
      my
      body
      or
      with
      the
      yoke
      mixed
      and
      how
      will
      I
      break
      the
      yoke
      to
      see
      if
      something
      was
      wrong?
       #8203;
      **I
      will
      be
      happy
      to
      do
      a
      collaboration
      with
      you
      any
      day
      anytime.
      It
      would
      be
      amazing.
      The
      only
      problem
      is
      English
      is
      not
      my
      main
      language
      so
      I
      do
      not
      use
      it
      much
      in
      my
      rap.
      if
      that
      won't
      is
      a
      problem.
      But
      I
      can
      mix
      both
      Languages
      well.**

      No
      there
      is
      no
      "bad"
      with
      your
      chart.
      You
      have
      a
      few
      squares
      and
      opposing
      aspects.
      Maybe
      the
      guy
      didn't
      know
      what
      he
      was
      reading
      or
      not
      very
      good
      to
      figure
      out
      you
      are
      a
      very
      good
      Gemini.
      Although
      I
      personally
      do
      not
      like
      people
      with
      Aquarius
      moon
      because
      they
      like
      to
      study
      a
      person
      like
      a
      course
      which
      they
      are
      going
      to
      write
      an
      exam
      on.
      They
      like
      to
      know
      how,
      why
      and
      what
      cycling
      around
      a
      person.
      But
      one
      thing
      Aquarius
      moon
      don't
      realise
      is
      that
      every
      person
      has
      a
      bad
      side
      which
      you
      do
      not
      have
      to
      explore
      or
      find.
      Another
      thing
      I
      don't
      like
      is
      that
      you
      don't
      know
      how
      to
      feel
      emotion
      but
      rather
      think
      about
      what
      emotion
      you
      should
      feel
      for
      a
      particular
      event
      or
      a
      circumstance.
      We
      don't
      think
      emotion
      we
      feel
      it
      which
      make
      you
      emotionally
      aloof.
      But
      in
      your
      case
      Cancer
      mercury,
      Venus
      and
      Mars
      will
      make
      you
      a
      very
      sensitive
      Gemini
      and
      emotional
      especially
      when
      it
      comes
      to
      love
      and
      though.
      You
      are
      very
      protective
      of
      yourself
      because
      of
      your
      sensitivity.
      You
      are
      a
      mom.
      I
      mean
      a
      Gemini
      is
      the
      fun-loving,
      freedom-loving
      and
      a
      free-spirit
      type
      Who
      doesn't
      want
      to
      see
      her
      partner
      every
      day
      to
      keep
      up
      with
      the
      love
      but
      you
      are
      the
      Clingy,
      Nurturing
      and
      caring
      type
      who
      wouldn't
      mind
      being
      with
      your
      partner
      all
      the
      time.
      Completely
      opposite
      to
      a
      typical
      Gemini.
      You
      don't
      want
      to
      hurt
      anyone
      and
      don't
      want
      anyone
      to
      hurt
      you.
      If
      You
      Guy
      knew
      about
      this
      I
      don't
      know
      why
      he
      would
      Ghost
      you,
      perhaps
      he
      didn't
      want
      to
      hurt
      you,
      perhaps
      he
      knew
      hurting
      you
      will
      leave
      a
      scar
      on
      your
      for
      a
      very
      loooong
      time.
      But
      actually,
      In
      my
      case,
      I
      don't
      care
      about
      chart
      or
      placement
      when
      it
      comes
      to
      choosing
      a
      partner
      but
      what
      I
      care
      for
      or
      look
      for
      is
      our
      compatibility
      with
      Synastry
      Chart.
      If
      he
      is
      a
      really
      good
      Astrologer
      he
      would
      check
      the
      compatibility
      instead.
      I
      am
      a
      Virgo
      with
      Gemini
      rising.
      I
      do
      well
      with
      Gemini's
      but
      I
      will
      find
      it
      hard
      with
      your
      version
      of
      Gemini
      because
      I
      have
      more
      Air
      and
      Fire
      Placements.
      I
      would
      advise
      you
      to
      find
      a
      Cancer
      or
      any
      of
      the
      Water
      sign
      or
      Earth.
      Air
      and
      fire
      sign
      wouldn't
      be
      good
      for
      you
      even
      though
      you
      are
      an
      Air
      but
      water
      is
      your
      dominant
      Element,
      more
      specifically
      Cancer
      Dominant.

      This
      is
      not
      common
      because
      it
      my
      first
      time
      reading
      a
      chart
      like
      this
      but
      it's
      not
      rare
      either
      because
      you
      were
      not
      the
      only
      person
      born
      on
      that
      day
      or
      time..
      Anyway,
      You
      can
      easily
      detect
      if
      some
      is
      lying
      or
      telling
      the
      truth
      when
      talking
      to
      the.
      You
      will
      be
      a
      very
      good
      detective.
      You
      like
      reading
      or
      studying
      people
      to
      know
      why
      or
      who
      they
      are
      like
      it's
      your
      job
      and
      you
      can
      thoroughly
      know
      the
      why
      who
      and
      what
      circle
      around
      the
      any
      person
      you
      set
      your
      eye
      on.
      I
      DONT
      WANT
      TO
      BE
      AROUND
      YOU
      simply
      because
      any
      person
      has
      a
      bad
      side
      but
      we
      choose
      not
      to
      bring
      it
      out
      so
      it
      will
      be
      good
      not
      to
      try
      to
      find
      it
      and
      you
      alway
      find
      it
      when
      you
      read
      them.
      because
      of
      that,
      you
      can
      easily
      detect
      some
      bullshit
      from
      other
      people
      before
      they
      even
      come
      close
      to
      you
      which
      make
      people
      think
      you
      are
      an
      anti-social
      person.
      You
      are
      an
      emotional
      person
      but
      can
      be
      aloof
      when
      it
      comes
      to
      emotion
      at
      least
      to
      people.
      You
      think
      about
      what
      emotion
      you
      need
      to
      present
      for
      a
      certain
      circumstance
      and
      not
      often
      feel
      them
      even
      though
      you
      are
      an
      emotional
      person.
      You
      are
      a
      very
      deep
      thinker
      and
      a
      very
      dark
      person
      with
      a
      lot
      of
      Mysteries
      circle
      around
      you.
      You
      have
      an
      innocent
      outlook
      but
      any
      person
      who
      knows
      you
      well
      will
      know
      beneath
      your
      innocent
      appearance
      lies
      a
      very
      dark
      person.
      You
      easily
      think
      bad
      and
      don't
      normally
      give
      people
      the
      chance
      to
      prove
      themselves
      because
      you
      think
      you
      already
      know
      them
      and
      know
      what
      they
      were
      trying
      to
      do
      before
      they
      even
      do
      it.
      You
      are
      a
      very
      high
      sexual
      aura
      around
      you.
      probably
      what
      attract
      people
      to
      you,
      and
      YES
      you
      like
      sex.
      oops..
      You
      are
      not
      the
      type
      to
      let
      people
      fuck
      you
      up
      or
      someone
      you
      love
      and
      go
      scotfree,
      You
      will
      without
      a
      doubt
      seek
      to
      revenge,
      at
      least
      in
      the
      past.
      You
      are
      a
      Hard
      worker
      and
      a
      passionate
      person.
      You
      do

      I
      think
      Zenou
      is
      very
      strong
      when
      it
      comes
      to
      brute
      strength
      but
      lack
      the
      brain.
      Like
      An
      animal...
      He's
      the
      Sword
      of
      Kanki
      Army.
      Do
      not
      underestimate
      him
      yet.
      All
      Strategic
      Generals
      has
      a
      brute
      Strength
      person
      or
      General
      in
      their
      Army
      serving
      as
      a
      Sword.

      I
      forgot
      Moubu
      was
      the
      reason
      why
      Ouki
      died.
      If
      he
      had
      follow
      orders
      Ouki
      wouldnt
      have
      set
      out
      to
      rescure
      him.
      I
      am
      not
      beginning

      hate
      him.

      I
      believe
      Kyoukai
      won't
      leave
      the
      Hi
      Shin
      Army
      and
      remain
      their
      Luitenante.
      All
      the
      big
      Name
      Great
      Generals
      had
      or
      has
      a
      monster/s
      in
      the
      army,
      like
      Ouki
      had
      Tou,
      Rishoujo
      had
      Gyou
      un
      and
      CGR,
      Renpa
      Has
      the
      4
      heavens.
      etc.
      So
      I
      think
      Kyoukai
      will
      be
      shin's
      Monster
      Lieutenant.
      so
      my
      list
      will
      be
      1.
      Moubu
      2.
      Ousen
      3.
      Tou
      4.
      Shin
      5.
      Kanki
      6.
      Ouhon.
      If
      Kanki
      revert
      to
      betray
      Quin
      which
      is
      likely
      then
      he
      will
      make
      room
      for
      Mouten.
      Although
      I
      think
      Mouten
      is
      more
      capable
      of
      leading
      a
      large
      army
      among
      the
      Trio.

      I
      am
      from
      the
      western
      part
      of
      African
      and
      I
      am
      interested
      in
      Witchcraft
      but
      not
      once
      in
      my
      country.
      I
      have
      been
      going
      to
      this
      sub
      and
      I
      found
      out
      our
      own
      version
      of
      Witchcraft
      is
      different
      from
      the
      once
      I
      see
      here.
      Mainly
      the
      kind
      of
      witchcraft
      in
      my
      country
      is
      purely
      evil,
      maybe
      only
      very
      few
      use
      theirs
      for
      good/protect
      themselves.
      Witchcraft
      is
      my
      country
      are
      pure
      evil,
      arrogant,
      envious,
      and
      want
      to
      bring
      anyone
      who
      they
      see
      up
      down
      or
      destroy
      their
      destiny.
      they
      feed
      on
      your
      relative
      or
      offspring
      or
      destroy
      them
      if
      they
      have
      a
      brighter
      future.
      it's
      said
      that
      every
      family
      has
      a
      witch
      who
      is
      causing
      the
      havoc.
      some
      of
      them
      are
      caught
      and
      disgrace
      and
      force
      them
      to
      speak
      out
      what
      they've
      used
      their
      witchcraft
      for
      and
      its
      always
      destroy,
      kill
      or
      rip
      off
      relative
      destiny,
      no
      good.
      a
      witch
      can
      gift
      another
      person
      they
      like
      a
      witchcraft
      by
      putting
      it
      in
      food
      or
      given
      a
      bracelet
      or
      attire
      and
      when
      they
      eat
      or
      use
      it,
      it
      means
      they
      have
      taken
      the
      initiative
      and
      they
      camp
      at
      night
      in
      their
      spiritual
      form
      I
      guess.
      I
      want
      to
      also
      protect
      myself
      and
      my
      family
      from
      this
      kind
      of
      witchcraft
      but
      i
      need
      a
      better
      more
      good
      version
      not
      the
      one
      in
      my
      country.
      do
      i
      have
      to
      be
      initiated?
      or
      your
      version
      has
      its
      way.
      Help,

      I

      simply

      Yes,

      think.
      Maybe
      Riboku
      would
      be
      slightly
      up
      when
      it

      the
      Battlefield
      and
      use
      Glaive
      put
      him
      hight
      I
      think
      than
      anyone
      in
      the
      Manga.
      Even
      though
      we
      haven't
      seen
      much
      from
      him
      but
      He
      has
      been
      compared
      to
      Moubu
      Physically
      and
      Riboku
      Strategically.
      So
      I
      think
      he
      is
      strongest
      in
      the
      manga.
      Well
      According
      to
      the
      History, gt;!
      He
      betrayed
      Qin
      and
      joined
      up
      to
      the
      Chu
      which
      he
      is
      a
      prince
      of.
      If
      Hara
      will
      bring
      that
      history
      crap
      in
      the
      manga
      then
      He
      will
      definitely
      be
      a
      Monster
      to
      beat
      than
      Riboku! lt;

      when
      you
      love
      you
      love
      deep

      intense.
      you
      actually
      need
      someone
      who
      is
      ready
      to

      and

      are
      not

      of
      commitment
      and
      Intimacy.
      You
      know
      your

      through
      Intimacy.
      You

      a

      You

      dark
      or
      bad
      for
      something
      or

      make
      a
      move.
      You
      are
      a
      lie
      detector.
      You
      can
      see

      You

      a
      protector
      to
      those
      you
      love
      or
      like.
      You
      can
      take
      time
      to
      process
      your
      feeling,
      when
      you
      get
      hurt
      it
      takes
      a

      time
      before
      you
      let
      go
      or
      forget,
      or
      it
      never
      goes.
      You
      can
      weep
      for
      hurtful
      feeling
      that
      is
      long
      gone
      just
      because
      you
      remembered
      it
      and
      its
      hurts
      like

      You
      are

      You

      who
      only
      talk

      really

      people
      will
      see
      you
      are
      an
      antisocial
      person.
      You
      don't

      to

      people
      bullsh\*t

      I
      dislike
      you
      first.
      Its
      just
      simple.
      Shin
      knows
      Kyoukai
      is
      stronger
      that
      was
      why
      he
      made
      her
      his
      Lieutenant
      from
      in
      the
      after
      the
      first
      campaigne.
      Kyou
      should
      be
      very
      strong
      with
      some
      weakest
      like
      she
      has
      limit
      with
      her
      dance
      and
      she
      can
      be
      her
      best
      where
      she
      is
      riding
      on
      a
      horse
      while
      shin
      has
      no
      weakness.
      We
      dislike
      Houken
      simple
      because
      of
      ouki.
      and
      Riboku
      too
      but
      riboku
      is
      likeable
      than
      Houken
      is.
      but
      Man
      if
      you
      hate
      Kyoukai
      then
      Hate
      Bajio
      too.
      and
      Moubu.

      I
      haven't
      read
      Vintage
      saga.
      I
      honestly
      can't
      keep
      up
      with
      the
      monthly
      release.
      but
      so
      far
      i
      am
      stuck
      with
      Kingdom
      ever
      since
      i
      started.
      its
      simply
      the
      best
      i
      have
      ever
      read.
      I
      have
      actually
      dowloaded
      all
      the
      chapters
      so
      reread
      when
      i
      have
      more
      time.
      i
      love
      everything
      about
      it
      except
      the
      fact
      that
      its
      addictive.

      I
      will
      recommend
      you
      read
      the
      manga
      instead.
      I
      don't
      like
      how
      the
      anime
      was
      made.
      the
      pictures
      are
      bad
      but
      it
      the
      manga
      the
      art
      is
      amazing.

      I'm
      still
      imagining
      how
      strong
      Moubu
      vessels
      are.
      The
      Pop
      guy
      is
      surely
      stronger
      than
      A
      Kon
      to
      be
      Moubu
      Right
      handman.
      And
      other
      Lieu
      is
      also
      surely
      stronger
      than
      A
      Kon.
      That
      will
      explain
      why
      they
      said
      he
      is
      the
      strongest
      Offensive
      General
      in
      all
      of

      Yes.
      it
      keeps
      improving.
      the
      coalition
      arc
      is
      great
      but
      there
      are
      more
      great
      arcs
      and
      more
      to
      come.
      they've
      just
      started
      the
      Unification
      with
      Zhao
      being
      the
      first
      to
      be
      invaded
      so
      far
      so
      good.
      I
      am
      never
      disappointed.

      Yes,
      same
      here.
      I
      hate
      though
      2
      especially
      Zhao
      because
      of
      Riboku.
      He
      killed
      my
      favorite
      Character
      Great
      General
      Ouki.
      Currently
      he
      the
      Commanding
      General
      in
      the
      defense
      again
      the
      Qin.
      Even
      though
      that
      Zhao
      invasion
      Arc
      is
      at
      it
      climax
      we
      still
      don't
      know
      who
      is
      winning
      because
      Riboku
      is
      always
      a
      Monster
      plus
      he
      has
      Houken
      Madafaka
      piece
      sh\*t.
      I
      hate
      those
      2.
      Anyway,
      Shin
      is
      using
      Ouki's
      Glaive
      Now
      but
      not
      the
      Duke's
      Shield.
      Maybe
      Later
      because
      When
      he
      uses
      the
      2
      it
      will
      be
      CHAAAAAAAARGE
      all
      the
      way.

      I
      agree
      strongly
      with
      you.
      Akakin
      is
      good
      but
      not
      better
      than
      Kyoukai
      in
      any
      way.
      They
      are
      both
      Battle
      smart
      but
      Kyoukai
      is
      a
      better
      Fighter.
      And
      I
      don't
      Think
      Kanjou
      is
      better
      than
      Naki.
      And
      HSU
      has
      people
      like
      Suugen,
      Garo,
      the

      No
      one
      is
      taking
      that
      from
      Akakin.
      He
      is
      great
      but
      come
      on.
      You
      are
      Comparing
      Akakin
      to
      Kyoukai
      who
      is
      a
      Better
      Fighter,
      A
      good
      Strategist
      and
      tactician.
      Akakin
      is
      more
      like
      Sousa,
      I
      mean
      Sousa
      was
      known
      to
      be
      the
      best
      to
      have
      a
      wild/
      great
      view
      on
      the
      battlefield
      being
      able
      to
      see
      where
      or
      what
      is
      going
      wrong
      on
      the
      battle
      and
      how
      to
      fix
      it.
      Kyoukai
      is
      an
      all
      round
      person.
      If
      Kyoukai
      was
      in
      the
      same
      army
      as
      Akakin
      she
      would
      have
      been
      considered
      as
      the
      best
      prodigy
      hands
      down.
      Gyou'un
      acknowledged
      Kyoukai
      Monstrosity
      when
      he
      encountered
      her.

      Am
      not
      actually
      Comparing

      Battle

      than

      Definite
      Akikin
       gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt; gt;Sousa.
      Anyway
      Gyou'un
      never
      felt
      the
      monstrosity
      that
      he
      felt

      Are
      you
      seriously
      comparing
      a
      Progidy
      to
      a

      6GG

      go
      back
      to
      read
      chapter
      549
      and
      550.
      about
      how
      Gyou'un
      felt
      when
      he
      met
      Kyoukai.
      **For
      that
      instant,
      he
      thought
      of
      a
      member

      that

      with
      that
      many
      bodies.
      His
      words
      were.
      He
      made
      3
      miscalculations.
      first
      was
      that
      Shin
      being
      able
      to
      predict
      his
      surprise
      attack,
      the
      second
      was
      Shin
      fighting
      Prowse
      being
      able
      to
      contain
      him
      and
      the
      third
      was
      that
      **an
      officer
      in
      the
      Hi
      Shin
      unit
      that
      is
      "Kyoukai"
      being
      able
      to
      influence
      the
      battle
      other
      than
      Shin.**
      in
      chap.
      550
      Gyou'un
      told
      CGR,
      Bananji,
      and
      Gaku'el
      that
      Shin
      and
      Kyoukai
      remind
      him
      of
      the
      6GG
      when
      he
      encountered
      them.

      My
      question
      is
      If
      Meliodas
      as
      gotten
      stronger
      After
      the
      DK
      took
      over
      his
      body,
      does
      that
      mean
      Zeldris
      will
      also
      be
      stronger
      when
      he
      return
      to
      his
      body.
      and
      the
      next
      question
      is
      which
      vs
      of
      DK
      is
      stronger.
      MK
      Meliodas
      or
      DK
      Zeldris

      Yes.
      The
      only
      difference
      is
      that
      one
      is
      a
      monster
      and
      the
      other
      is
      a
      madafaking
      Monster

      You
      are
      belittling
      Kyoukai
      to
      praise
      Akakin
      which
      is
      not
      working.
      Taking
      about
      this
      Arc
      alone
      I
      would
      Agree
      Akakin
      has
      done
      more
      than
      Kyoukai
      but
      kyoukai
      has
      also
      done
      hers.
      But
      Comparing
      the
      2
      on
      their
      regular
      base.
      I
      think
      it
      will
      be
      a
      mismatch
      to
      compare
      Akakin
      to
      Kyoukai.
      She
      is
      being
      compared
      to
      The
      Trio
      and
      has
      a
      better
      Chance
      to
      Make
      it
      into
      the
      6GG
      than
      Akakin
      would
      ever
      be.
      But
      if
      its
      only
      The
      Arc
      I
      would
      give
      it
      to
      Kyoukai
      and
      I
      think
      we
      are
      still
      yet
      to
      see
      more
      from
      her
      providing
      she
      has
      been
      missing
      for
      about
      4
      chapters
      now.
      I
      think
      she
      is
      preparing
      for
      a
      big
      kill.
      that
      will
      Silent
      you.
      Anyway
      Kyoukai
      can
      do
      anything
      the
      Trio
      can
      do.
      IMO
      She
      is
      more
      Balance
      than
      Shin.

      Yes,
      this
      is
      a
      history
      based
      Manga.
      There

      advice
      you
      start
      reading
      from
      where
      season
      one
      ended.

      The
      only
      way
      we
      can
      understand
      that
      misunderstanding
      is
      to
      say
      Escanor
      underestimated
      Meliodas
      far
      too
      much
      to
      have
      gone
      easy
      on
      him
      for
      Meliodas
      to
      overpower
      him
      unexpectedly.But
      this
      chapter
      explains
      nothing
      but
      only
      one
      thing,
      Nakaba
      was
      just
      using
      this
      chapter
      to
      shit
      on
      Escanor
      THE
      One
      no
      lost
      streak.
      and
      to
      Make
      Meliodas
      OP
      but
      it's
      so
      pointless
      because
      from
      what
      we've
      read
      so
      far
      to
      this
      point,
      We
      would
      Understand
      Prime
      Meliodas
      will
      win
      against
      Escanor
      but
      Arguable
      not
      against
      THE
      ONE.
      Perhaps
      hold
      him
      off
      till
      THE
      ONE
      is
      over
      and
      win.
      But
      to
      Saitama
      Escanor
      is
      bad
      writing
      and
      pointless.
      How
      can
      Prime
      Meliodas
      put
      THE
      ONE
      into
      Coma
      with
      just
      One
      punch.
      Tell
      me
      Nakaba
      was
      drunk
      when
      he
      made
      this
      and
      I
      would
      understand
      else
      I
      will
      think
      he
      just
      wanted
      to
      take
      his
      invincibility
      from
      him.

      I

      any
      defeat

      As
      escanor
      Fan
      boy
      I
      strongly
      believe
      nakaba
      is
      a
      Meliodas
      Fun
      boy.
      and
      i
      hate
      when
      the
      Author
      chooses
      a
      side.
      we
      are
      so
      not
      cool
      with
      what
      he
      did
      to
      us.

      We
