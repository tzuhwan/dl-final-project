      I
      feel
      you
      bro.
      the
      closest
      open
      supermarket
      to
      me
      is
      a
      few
      miles
      away
      and
      the
      uncle's
      borrowed
      the
      car.
      Then
      again,
      I
      figure
      I
      should
      take
      this
      opportunity
      to
      learn
      how
      to
      drink
      my
      tea
      milk-less?

      I
      live
      in
      England
      but
      I
      talk
      to
      my
      cousins
      and
      friends
      in
      Japan
      using
      Line,
      and
      whenever
      I'm
      over
      there
      we
      only
      really
      call
      when
      it's
      urgent
      or
      when
      looking
      for
      each
      other.
      I
      think
      it's
      the
      same
      as
      just
      texting
      though...
      people
      nowadays
      mostly
      text
      instead
      of
      calling,
      don't
      they?
      it's
      just
      that
      Line's
      cheaper
      (or
      free,
      I
      guess)

      This
      is
      great
      in
      terms
      of
      rhyming,
      and
      I
      like
      the
      story
      of
      the
      poem.
      To
      improve
      it
      visually,
      maybe
      you
      could
      structure
      it
      less
      like
      a
      block
      of
      text
      by
      putting
      each
      line
      underneath
      the
      previous
      (though
      you
      might
      have
      already
      tried
      to
      do
      this,
      I
      can
      see
      you've
      capitalised
      each
      phrase?).
      Another
      way
      to
      bring
      it
      together
      a
      bit
      more
      would
      be
      to
      even
      up
      the
      number
      of
      syllables
      in
      each
      phrase
      -
      when
      you
      read
      out
      loud
      the
      last
      two
      lines
      they
      seem
      to
      have
      more
      syllables
      crammed
      in
      when
      compared
      to
      the
      others,
      which
      upsets
      the
      rhythm
      of
      the
      piece.
      I
      think
      the
      idea
      is
      interesting
      and
      original
      -
      thanks
      for
      posting.

      I
      think
      notebooks
      (the
      paper
      ones)
      are
      much
      more
      convenient
      to
      carry
      around
      but
      my
      school
      tends
      to
      give
      out
      a
      lot
      of
      handouts
      which
      work
      alongside
      the
      notes
      you
      take
      in
      class,
      so
      I've
      been
      using
      ring
      binders
      this
      year.
      For
      uni
      though,
      I
      doubt
      they'll
      give
      printouts
      or
      anything
      so
      personally
      i
      think
      spiral-bound
      notebooks
      would
      be
      the
      best
      option.
      If
      you
      get
      ones
      which
      have
      those
      easy-rip
      dotted
      lines
      along
      the
      spines
      and
      holes
      already
      punched
      in
      them,
      then
      you
      can
      file
      your
      notes
      at
      the
      end
      of
      each
      section/term
      as
      well.
      Nicely
      bound
      notebooks
      tend
      to
      be
      on
      the
      pricey
      side,
      and
      unless
      you're
      able
      to
      take
      meticulous
      notes
      really
      quickly,
      it
      might
      feel
      like
      a
      bit
      of
      a
      waste
      to
      have
      messy
      notes
      in
      a
      nice
      notebook
      which
      you'll
      copy
      up
      neatly
      somewhere
      else
      later
      on.
      (although
      it's
      totally
      up
      to
      you!)
      Whiteboards
      are
      *fantastic*...
      I
      love
      using
      them,
      since
      they're
      great
      for
      all
      subjects
      (e.g.
      like
      you
      mentioned,
      brainstorming
      for
      humanities
      and
      doing
      calculations
      for
      sciences).
      i
      would
      make
      sure
      you
      have
      a
      good
      rubber,
      though,
      because
      the
      little
      bits
      of
      dry
      ink
      can
      be
      pretty
      annoying
      when
      they
      go
      everywhere.

      had
      been
      pricking
      the
      people
      he
      passed
      with
      them,
      hence
      their
      spouts
      of
      momentary
      itching.
      What
      was
      in
      the
      syringe
      is
      unknown,
      but
      it
      was
      likely
      HIV,
      or
      some
      similar
      virus
      (I
      think).

      The
      spacing
      does
      make
      it
      a
      bit
      hard
      to
      read,
      but
      honestly
      I
      think
      it
      adds
      more,
      to
      the
      effect
      of
      making
      the
      whole
      encounter
      really
      sudden
      and
      weird.
      what's
      the
      reason
      behind
      the
      title,
      though?
      Is
      that
      the
      name
      of
      the
      road?

      Try
      focusing
      on
      where
      the
      exams
      can
      take
      you.
      You're
      aware
      that
      you
      can
      get
      better
      than
      your
      preliminary
      grades,
      since
      you've
      gotten
      better
      results
      before
      -
      all
      you
      have
      to
      do
      is
      study
      a
      bit.
      Try
      thinking
      for
      a
      moment
      about
      what
      you
      want
      to
      do
      with
      the
      good
      grades
      you'll
      get
      (what
      universities,
      careers
      etc)
      and
      then
      work
      back
      from
      there
      -
      if
      you
      have
      a
      clear
      goal,
      all
      you
      have
      to
      do
      is
      pick
      up
      your
      pen
      to
      start
      getting
      there.

      getting

      When
      the
      itchiness
      is
      100%
      distracting
      (like,
      you

      sit
      still
      and
      write-itchiness)
      it

      switch
      to
      podcasts

      go

      the
      itchiness
      a
      bit,
      while
      giving
      you
      that
      stream
      of
      info.
      You
      can
      also
      move
      round
      with
      your
      headphones
      in,
      if
      you're
      feeling
      restless.

      I

      loving
      (unconditionally?)
      someone
      who's

      That

      well

      By
      necessary
      accommodations,
      do
      you
      mean
      extra
      tutoring
      sessions?
      If
      not,
      then
      getting
      extra
      one
      on
      one
      help
      from
      the
      teachers
      might
      be
      something
      to
      look
      into,
      especially
      if
      you're
      not
      on
      top
      of
      the
      class
      content.
      They
      don't
      necessarily
      have
      to
      teach
      you
      everything
      again,
      but
      you
      could
      maybe
      ask
      them
      to
      set
      aside
      20
      minutes
      during
      lunch,
      for
      example,
      to
      answer
      your
      questions
      (which
      you'll
      probably
      have
      more
      of,
      compared
      to
      other
      students).
      As
      for
      focus
      and
      commitment,
      I
      think
      this
      whole
      sub
      recommends
      the
      pomodoro
      method
      of
      study.
      You
      probably
      know
      it,
      but
      if
      not,
      have
      a
      look.
      I
      think
      it
      might
      work
      for
      you
      because
      you
      can
      set
      your
      work-burst
      time
      according
      to
      your
      preferences
      -
      what
      I
      do
      when
      I'm
      feeling
      restless
      is
      work
      in
      20-minute
      bursts,
      which
      is
      short
      enough
      for
      me
      to
      keep
      my
      concentration,
      but
      just
      long
      enough
      to
      get
      a(n
      albeit
      small)
      chunk
      done.

      UK
      A-level
      student
      here.
      In
      terms
      of
      content
      revision,
      since
      you're
      only
      a
      week
      away
      I
      would
      do
      practice
      question
      after
      practice
      question
      for
      the
      bulk
      of
      your
      studying.
      Read
      the
      revision
      cards/guides/books
      during
      spare
      moments,
      like
      during
      breakfast
      or
      on
      your
      commute
      etc.
      For
      essay
      based
      subjects
      exams,
      exam
      technique
      is
      almost
      as
      important
      as
      the
      content.
      I
      do
      English
      literature
      but
      I'm
      gonna
      assume
      the
      structure
      of
      the
      language
      exam
      is
      the
      same
      =
      2
      essay
      questions
      (correct
      me
      if
      I'm
      wrong).
      For
      each,
      make
      sure
      you
      know
      your
      assessment
      objectives
      -
      for
      Lit
      we
      have
      AO1
      to
      AO4,
      and
      you
      need
      to
      have
      all
      of
      them
      in
      an
      essay
      to
      get
      good
      marks
      (If
      you
      don't
      know
      them,
      google
      them
      for
      your
      exam
      board).
      Also,
      make
      a
      list
      of
      key
      terms
      to
      include
      in
      your
      exam
      essays
      (in
      Literature
      it's
      best
      to
      always
      include
      words
      like
      semantic
      field
      and
      lexis
      and
      stuff
      when
      analysing
      a
      passage;
      I'm
      sure
      you
      have
      words
      like
      that
      in
      Language).
      PM
      me
      if
      you
      need
      any
      help
      setting
      up
      a
      short
      term
      revision
      timetable
      or
      something.

      It

      be
      a
      bit
      easier
      to

      am
      in
      the
      exact
      same
      boat
      as
      you
      for
      some
      of
      my
      final
      exams,
      despite
      my
      parents
      forking
      up
      a
      ton
      to
      send
      me
      to
      private
      school
      to
      repeat
      the
      year,
      so
      obvs
      I'm
      regretting
      not
      working
      as
      hard
      as
      I
      could
      have
      for
      my
      exams
      yesterday
      and
      the
      day
      before.
      I've
      already
      made
      the
      mistakes,
      Op.
      Don't
      be
      me,
      seriously.
      In
      order
      to
      avoid
      being
      me
      -
      to
      put
      it
      bluntly
      -
      you
      should
      be
      working
      your
      arse
      off
      on
      those
      undone
      units
      right
      now...
      whoo
      if
      you
      are,
      if
      not
      then
      do
      so.
      You
      still
      have
      a
      few
      weeks,
      which
      may
      not
      seem
      like
      much,
      but
      if
      you
      put
      your
      absolute
      all
      in
      then
      you'll
      probably
      be
      able
      to
      scrape
      by
      and
      get
      the
      grades.
      Pm
      me
      if
      you
      want
      an
      accountability
      buddy
      or
      something.
      As
      for
      getting
      a
      job,
      there's
      not
      much
      longer
      until
      summer.
      What
      I
      would
      do
      would
      be
      to
      promise
      your
      parents
      that
      you'll
      get
      a
      job
      at
      the
      beginning
      of
      summer
      (make
      sure
      to
      actually
      do
      so)
      after
      you've
      submitted
      your
      work/
      tests
      and
      stuff
      and
      earned
      those
      credits.

      amazing!!!
      I
      watched

      b)
      basically,
      to
      go
      from
      a
      value
      for
      displacement
      (x)
      to
      a
      value
      for
      velocity
      (v)
      you
      need
      to
      differentiate
      the
      equation
      for
      displacement
      because
      the
      acceleration
      isn't
      a
      constant
      value.
      So
      in
      this
      question
      x
      is
      given
      by
      x=t^2
      -7t+12.
      To
      find
      v,
      differentiate
      the
      above.
      I'm
      guessing
      you
      don't
      know
      how
      to
      differentiate?
      If
      so,
      here's
      a
      simplified
      explanation
      you
      can
      use
      in
      answering
      your
      question.
      You
      take
      the
      power
      of
      t
      and
      multiply
      it
      with
      the
      number
      in
      front
      of
      the
      t,
      then
      subtract
      1
      from
      the
      original
      power.
      so
      T^2
      will
      become
      2t^1,
      or
      just
      2t.
      You
      do
      the
      same
      with
      the
      next
      value:
      -7t.
      The
      t
      here
      is
      to
      the
      power
      of
      1,
      so
      bring
      that
      in
      front
      and
      subtract
      1
      from
      the
      original
      power,
      and
      you
      should
      end
      up
      with
      -7t^0
      ,
      or
      just
      -7
      as
      t^0
      is
      1.
      Then
      the
      last
      value,
      12.
      since
      this
      value
      does
      not
      have
      a
      t
      behind
      it,
      we
      scrap
      it.
      So
      put
      them
      all
      together
      and
      you'll
      have
      dx/dt
      =
      2t-7
      then
      plug
      in
      t=0
      into
      this
      differential:
      2(0)-7
      =
      -7ms^-1
      I
      hope
      that
      helps.

      what
      does
      the
      singer
      look
      like?
      and
      is
      the
      song
      sort-of
      electropop?

      I
      like
      the

      it's

      This
      is
      really
      beautifully
      written.
      The
      lack
      of
      a
      major
      twist
      and
      the
      subtle
      creepiness
      wil
      definitely
      keep
      me
      thinking
      about
      possible
      explanations
      for
      a
      while!

      I
      was
      also
      in
      your
      position
      last
      year,
      having
      completely
      flunked
      my
      AS
      levels,
      but
      I
      managed
      to
      get
      4
      As
      at
      AS
      after
      repeating
      the
      year,
      and
      I
      now
      have
      an
      offer
      from
      UCL.
      Since
      you'll
      be
      applying
      with
      your
      retaken
      AS
      grades,
      as
      long
      as
      you
      have
      those
      As
      and
      solid
      gcses,
      you
      should
      have
      a
      relatively
      good
      chance.
      Make
      sure
      you
      polish
      your
      personal
      statement
      though

      A
      to

      maybe
      look
      into
      the
      UTokyo
      courses
      in
      English?
      PEAK
      courses,
      I
      think
      they
      were
      called.
      There
      are
      only
      two
      there,
      and
      they're
      pretty
      specific,
      but
      the
      Uni
      of
      Tokyo
      is
      more
      well-known
      overseas
      than
      others,
      so
      if
      you
      were
      to
      not
      like
      it
      there/
      move
      back
      overseas
      for
      a
      job,
      chances
      are
      you'll
      have
      an
      easier
      time
      transferring/with
      job
      applications
      than
      if
      you
      were
      to
      have
      gotten
      a
      degree
      from
      a
      Japanese
      uni
      that
      has
      a
      good
      name
      in
      japan
      but
      is
      unknown
      overseas.

      Gosh,
      I
      really
      enjoyed
      that.
      They're

      professional
