      Yep,
      you
      generally
      get
      Newman #8217;s
      Own
      versions
      and
      sometimes
      supermarkets
      will
      have
      their
      own
      but
      that #8217;s
      rare,
      like
      other
      commenters
      have
      stated
      you
      can
      get
      it
      on
      your
      Subway
      sandwich
      too.
      I
      love
      ranch
      dressing
      but
      I
      think
      that #8217;s
      largely
      in
      part
      due
      to
      the
      time
      I #8217;ve
      spent
      in
      the
      US
      and
      is
      more
      of
      an
      anomaly
      compared
      to
      my
      fellow
      countrymen.

      Well
      fuel
      is
      expensive
      especially
      compared
      to
      the
      US
      at
      roughly
      $5
      per
      gallon,
      some
      people
      convert
      them
      from
      gasoline
      to
      LPG
      (liquid
      petroleum
      gas)
      to
      save
      which
      brings
      the
      price
      to
      more
      in
      line
      with
      the
      US.
      Parts
      etc
      are
      probably
      more
      expensive
      but
      there
      are
      quite
      a
      few
      of
      these
      trucks
      around
      so
      possibly
      not
      too
      bad.

      Any
      idea
      what
      this
      might
      be?
      It
      was
      small
      about
      the
      size
      of
      a
      large
      grain
      of
      rice.
      It
      looked
      like
      a
      little
      bit
      of
      dried
      rolled
      up
      leaf
      but
      had
      a
      head
      that
      popped
      up
      into
      the
      little
       #8220;shell
      part #8221;
      almost
      like
      a
      little
      hermit
      crab
      or
      something!
      Sussex,
      UK.

      Yeah
      tax
      would
      likely
      be
      very
      high
      compared
      with
      your
      average
      4
      cylinder
      turbo-charged
      crossover
      but
      the
      people
      who
      have
      these
      that
      I
      know
      are
      willing
      to
      pay
      to
      have
      a
      truck
      like
      this
      where

      I #8217;m
      English,
      but
      I
      love
      the
      US
      and
      damn
      near
      all
      the
      people
      I #8217;ve
      met
      there.
      Unfortunately
      online
      I
      think
      people
      feel
      more
      at
      liberty
      to
      talk
      shit
      about
      people
      and
      their
      culture
      without
      fear
      of
      any
      come-backs.
      However
      if
      you
      come
      to
      the
      UK
      (especially
      out
      of
      the
      cities)
      you #8217;ll
      find
      99%
      of
      people
      will
      want
      to
      talk
      and
      find
      out
      more
      about
      where
      you
      come
      from.
      The
      amount
      of
      amazing
      people
      that
      helped
      me
      out
      and
      gave
      me
      advice
      while
      I
      was
      driving
      through
      the
      Mojave
      in
      an
       #8216;07
      grand
      caravan
      made
      me
      love
      the
      states
      even
      more
      than
      I
      already
      did
      and
      after
      that
      it
      felt
      like
      home.

      shows
      why
      relatively
      no-one
      wants
      to
      watch
      women #8217;s
      football.
      It #8217;s
      like
      watching
      an
      under
      13
      match,
      no
      competition
      between
      the
       #8220;best #8221;
      and
       #8220;worst #8221;
      teams.
      You
      feminists
      can
      whinge
      and
      moan
      about
      equal
      pay
      and
      equal
      opportunities
      all
      you
      want
      but
      all
      the
      while
      the
      quality
      is
      equal
      to
      something
      you
      could
      see
      down
      your
      local
      park,
      no
      ones
      going
      to
      pay
      to
      watch
      it.
      Down-vote
      me,
      I
      dare
      you.

      Thank

      for
      your

      run
      over
      so
      camera
      isn #8217;t
      the
      clearest!
      Unfortunately
      she
      has
      hidden
      between
      the
      rafters
      at
      the
      moment
      so
      can #8217;t
      try
      for
      a
      better
      pic
      but
      she
      is
      roughly
      1 #8221;

      Interesting
      perspective.
      Also
      I #8217;m
      sure
      you #8217;re
      aware
      of
      the
      connotations
      behind
      the
      use
      of
      the
      word
      Paki
      and
      I #8217;ve
      never
      heard
      anyone
      refer
      to
      a
      Pakistani
      person
      in
      that
      shortened
      manner
      without
      being
      derogatory.
      Is
      it
      common
      for
      Pakistani
      people
      to
      refer
      to
      themselves
      as
      such?

      I
      spent
      in
      your

      I

      more

      friendship
      than
      I
      can
      even
      begin
      to
      explain.
      Nowhere
      on
      earth
      can
      compare
      to
      how
      varied,
      beautiful,
      free
      and
      prosperous
      the
      USA
      is

      would
      give
      my

      Live
      in
      East
      Sussex,
      UK
      but
      drove
      over
      12,000
      miles
      across
      the
      Western
      half
      of
      the
      US
      last
      year.
      Out
      in
      States
      like
      Utah
      and
      Nevada
      the
      roads
      are
      very
      different
      at
      home,
      wider,
      straighter
      and
      amazingly
      for
      such
      a
      low-population
      density
      area,
      better
      maintained
      than
      where
      I #8217;m
      from.
      I
      found
      after
      the
      first
      few
      hours
      driving
      was
      less
      stressful
      and
      somewhat
       #8220;easier #8221;
      than
      at
      home.
      However
      there
      are
      areas
      in
      the
      UK
      with
      wider
      straighter
      roads
      that
      where
      I
      live,
      such
      as
      East
      Anglia.

      when
      you
      hear
      the
       #8220;frothing
      sound #8221;
      you
      know
      you #8217;re
      making
      foam
      and
      after
      trial
      and
      error
      you #8217;ll
      get
      to
      know
      the
      consistency
      of
      the
      milk
      you #8217;ve
      made.
      Best
      thing
      is
      to
      keep
      the
      amount
      of
      milk
      you
      start
      with
      the
      same
      each
      time.

      That #8217;s
      super
      interesting,
      I
      definitely
      agree
      about
      the
      roads
      and
      buildings
      etc,
      having
      spent
      a
      fair
      bit
      of
      time
      in
      Europe,
      I
      would
      definitely
      say
      the
      UK
      is
      more
      similar
      to
      North
      America
      than
      Europe.
      I
      travelled
      the
      US
      for
      a
      while
      and
      found
      a
      lot
      of
      landscapes
      and
      customs
      to
      be
      reminiscent
      of
      home,
      whereas
      when
      in
      Europe
      I
      tend
      to
      feel
      homesick
      quite
      quickly.

      I
      used
      to
      live
      in
      Springfield
      (a
      suburb

      Keynes)!
      What
      do
      you
      think
      of
      MK?
      I
      always

      a

      Haha
      absolutely,
      love
      the
      map
      by
      the
      way!
      It #8217;s
      just
      there
      are
      a
      lot
      more
      places
      like
      [this](https://goo.gl/maps/6V4mBcRp4F1Dm1Qj8)
      than
      in
      the
      South
      East.
      Sure
      you #8217;ll
      see
      more
      traffic
      and
      houses
      and
      pass

      but
      you
      can
      also
      drive
      for
      250-300
      miles
      of
      scenery
      like
      this,
      that
      I #8217;ve

      That #8217;s
      super
      interesting,
      I
      love
      California
      and
      was
      lucky
      enough
      to
      spend
      a
      month
      of
      my
      time
      in
      the
      US
      driving
      from
      LA
      all
      the
      way
      up
      til
      I
      blew
      through
      the
      border
      with
      Oregon!
      As
      to
      your
      question,
      nope
      it #8217;s
      a
      two-way
      county
       #8220;A #8221;
      road,
      in
      the
      UK
      lanes
      are
      separated
      by
      white
      lines
      like
      in
      the
      photo,
      whereas
      yellow
      lines
      are
      used
      to
      denote
      no-parking
      zones
      at
      the
      sides
      of
      roads
      and
      intersections.
      I
      much
      prefer
      the
      US
      method
      of
      road
      markings
      however
      as
      it
      makes
      it
      much
      more
      obvious
      where
      you
      shouldn #8217;t
      cross
      lanes!

      For
      mine
      (E
      Sussex)
      I
      would
      say
      it #8217;s
      having
      the
      sunniest
      recorded
      place
      in
      the
      UK
      (Eastbourne),
      and
      also
      the
      gay
      capital
      of
      Europe
      (Brighton).
      We
      are
      also
      one
      of
      only
      3
      places
      where
      the
      largest
      spider
      in
      the
      UK
      is
      found
      (Great
      Raft
      Spider)
      in
      the
      Pevensey
      Marshes.
      Oh
      and
      we
      are
      the
      bonfire/fireworks
      capital
      of
      the
      UK.

      For
      sure
      you
      can
      still
      get
      some
      decent
      ideas
      out
      of
      a
      controlled
      economy,
      but
      I #8217;m
      afraid
      it #8217;s
      literally
      fact
      that
      free
      market
      competition
      is
      what
      drives
      people
      to

      better,
      more
      interesting
      and
      ultimately
      more
      successful
      things.
      If
      no
      one
      were
      to
      profit
      from
      the

      they
      would
      have
      come
      out
      with
      RCT
      and
      left
      it
      there.
      I
      mean
      what #8217;s
      the
      point
      of
      making
      a
      sequel
      or
      even
      a
      wholly
      new
      better
      game
      if
      no
      ones
      going

      Soccer
      and
      golf
      are
      literally
      some
      of
      the
      most
      commercialized
      activities
      on
      the
      planet.
      That
      fits
      my
      example
      perfectly.
      Sure
      they
      may
      have
      been
      invented
      by
      people
      who
      had
      no
      plan
      to
      make
      money
      from
      them.
      Capitalism
      is
      the
      entire
      reason
      you
      can
      play
      golf
      in
      the
      desert
      or
      have
      people
      like
      Messi
      or
      Ronaldo
      inspiring
      kids
      around
      the
      world
      to
      play.
      Like
      I
      said,
      sure
      a
      closed
      market
      system
      can
      invent
      something
      but
      you #8217;re
      not
      going
      to
      find
      a
      socialist
      country
      building
      beautifully
      designed
      golf
      courses
      and
      clubhouses,
      or
      making
      better
      more
      precise
      clubs
      etc,
      you #8217;re
      just
      not.
      And
      if
      they
      did,
      it
      would
      only
      be
      the
      oligarchs
      and
      political
      elite
      using
      them.

      nothing,
      in

      of
      itself.
      However
      having
      people
      starving
      and
      pedalling
      themselves
      to

      rice-fields,
      on

      a
      rats
      ass
      about

      is
      a

      See
      the
      difference
      between
      capitalism
      and
      communism
      is
      that

      people
      like
      that

      you

      however
      in

      people
      have
      the
      opportunity
      to
      do
      better,
      work
      hard
      and
      make
      a
      life
      for
      themselves
      without
      the
      government
      siphoning
      off
      all
      their
      money
      to
      spend
      on
      cars,
      food,
      drugs,
      resorts
      etc
      that
      the
      people
      who
      paid
      for
      it
      will
      never

      You
      cannot
      escape
      corruption,
      and
      that #8217;s
      the

      communism
      only
      truly
      works

      let

      see
      the

      and
      suffering

      millions
      of
      people
      over
      the
      last
      hundred
      years
      as
      an
      indictment
      of

      I
      know
      it
      might
      not
      seem
      like
      it
      while
      perusing
      this
      communist
      echo-chamber
      you
      and
      all

      soap-shy
       #8220;comrades #8221;
      wallow

      most

      don #8217;t
      think
      like
      you,
      hence
      the
      fact
      that
      Trump
      is
      president.
      If
      you
      hate
      capitalism
      so
      much
      then
      move

      Venezuela,
      I
      hear
      the
      screams
      of
      dying
      children
      is
      really
      relaxing
      this
      time
      of

      Their

      is
      horrendous
      and
      makes
      finding
      anything
      you

      difficult,
      the

      it

      sounds

      Hi
      all,
      I
      am
      a
      type-1
      diabetic
      with
      good
      control
      and
      luckily
      no
      issues
      other
      than
      the
      diabetes
      to
      speak
      of.
      However
      one
      aspect
      of
      my
      experience
      with
      diabetes
      is
      one
      that
      I
      never
      hear
      people
      talking
      about
      or
      discussing
      ever:
      When
      I
      have
      a
      severe
      hypoglycaemic
      attack
      ie
      during
      the
      night,
      I
      often
      get
      extreme
      and
      terrifying
      hallucinations
      including
      time
      dilation,
      malevolent
      entities,
      feelings
      of
      being
      thrown
      around
      the
      room,
      existential
      dread
      etc.
      Some
      of
      these
      episodes
      have
      been
      so
      exquisitely
      mortifying
      that
      Ive
      has
      flashbacks
      and
      moments
      of
      panic
      when
      I
      remember
      that
      I
      may
      return
      to
      those
      depths
      of
      anguish
      through
      no
      fault
      of
      my
      own
      again.
      In
      one
      particularly
      dreadful
      incident
      I
      woke
      up
      in
      the
      middle
      of
      the
      night
      dripping
      in
      sweat
      and
      on
      my
      own,
      proceeded
      to
      descend
      into
      what
      I
      can
      only
      describe
      as
      a
      pit
      of
      existential
      terror,
      where
      time
      no
      longer
      had
      meaning,
      I
      was
      convinced
      that
      I
      was
      stuck
      in
      an
      infinitely
      regressing
      time
      loop,
      watched
      over
      by
      terrifying
      demons,
      my
      bedroom
      was
      no
      longer
      a
      familiar
      place
      and
      I
      remember
      screaming
      in
      primal
      fear
      that
      I
      would
      never
      be
      able
      to
      return
      to
      a
      normal
      state.
      I
      then
      proceeded
      to
      enter
      my
      bathroom
      and
      fall
      headfirst
      into
      the
      shower
      cubicle
      in
      an
      attempt
      to
      get
      out
      of
      the
      horrendous
      state
      I
      was
      in.
      I
      woke
      up
      in
      hospital,
      back
      in
      the
      real
      world
      and
      the
      feeling
      of
      relief
      was
      indescribable.
      The
      experience
      is
      almost
      identical
      to
      how
      I #8217;ve
      seen
      people
      describe
      bad
      LSD/DMT
      trips.
      So
      diabetic
      friends,
      have
      any
      of
      you
      experienced
      hypoglycaemic
      trips
      like
      this
      and
      if
      so
      I #8217;d
      love
      to
      hear
      about
      them.
      Look
      after
      yourselves
      guys!
      TLDR:
      Occasionally
      when
      my
      sugar-levels
      drop
      very
      low
      I
      experience
      haunting,
      mind
      mending
      hallucinations
      and
      time
      dilation.
      Anyone
      else?

      Well
      unfortunately

      you

      to
      chose
      what #8217;s
      more
      important
      to
      you:
      Furthering
      the
      progress
      and
      universal
      understanding
      of
      humanity,
      in
      a
      ridiculously
      privileged
      position
      that
      only
      a
      minuscule
      fraction
      of
      humans
      will
      ever
      get
      to
      experience.
      OR
      Worship
      a
      hundreds
      of
      year
      old
      desert
      warlord
      who
      murdered
      and
      raped
      children.

      I #8217;m
      not
      sure
      that #8217;s
      true,
      at
      my
      prom
      in
      2013
      (UK)
      everyone
      turned
      up
      at
      school
      in
      limousines
      and
      muscle
      cars
      with
      their
      prom
      date
      or
      girlfriend
      etc
      wearing
      stereotypical
       #8220;prom #8221;
      attire
      (long
      elaborate
      dresses
      for
      the
      girls
      and
      suits
      for
      the
      guys)
      proceeded
      to
      have
      a
      punch/drinks
      and
      dance
      in
      the
      main
      hall
      at
      school
      then
      on
      to
      peoples
      houses
      who
      were
      having
      parties.
      Seemed
      pretty
      similar
      to
      what
      some
      of
      my
      American
      friends
      have
      described.

      the
