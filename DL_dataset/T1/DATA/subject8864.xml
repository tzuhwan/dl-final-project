      1.
      The
      entire
      planet
      is
      city
      pretty
      much,
      and
      you
      can
      fly
      right
      down
      to
      above
      the
      top
      of
      the
      buildings,
      but
      if
      you
      get
      too
      close
      it's
      considered
      a
      restricted
      area,
      the
      textures
      aren't
      as
      detailed
      on
      the
      parts
      of
      the
      planet
      that
      are
      just
      city
      filler
      essentially.
      Then
      there
      are
      designated
      areas
      you
      can
      fly
      around
      buildings
      and
      it's
      not
      restricted,
      can
      land
      on
      some
      roofs
      and
      things.
      Then
      there
      is
      area
      18
      which
      is
      a
      pretty
      large
      area
      you
      can
      land,
      get
      out,
      explore,
      there's
      shops,
      npcs,
      and
      missions.
      1.2.
      I
      would
      assume
      they
      have
      a
      lot
      of
      plans
      with
      them
      2.
      ArcCorp
      is
      the
      only
      city
      planet
      right
      now.
      There's
      plans
      for
      others
      though.
      3.
      See
      above
      4.
      Area
      18
      has
      npcs,
      if
      you
      fly
      down
      on
      other
      parts
      you'll
      see
      some
      space
      cars
      traffic
      .
      5.
      Yep,
      you
      see
      the
      lights
      from
      space
      as
      well,
      looks
      awesome

      They
      reappear
      for
      me
      if
      I
      unequip
      my

      and
      re-equip.
      Unfortunately
      the

      cancels
      though
      so
      it's
      not

      either

      This
      is
      almost
      point
      blank
      what
      me
      and
      my
      wife
      went
      through.
      As
      others
      said,
      she
      probably
      is
      cheating
      or
      has
      cheated
      at
      least
      in
      an
      emotional
      way.
      It
      probably
      hasn't
      really
      been
      a
      14-month
      thing,
      but
      she's
      got
      some
      level
      of
      dissatisfaction
      and
      has
      found
      a
      way
      out.
      My
      wife
      is
      bipolar
      as
      well,
      and
      you
      say
      she
      has
      times
      of
      depression.
      It
      may
      be
      more
      serious
      than
      that.
      You
      also
      mentioned
      trying
      for
      kids,
      and
      not
      having
      success.
      This
      affects
      my
      wife
      and
      I
      tremendously
      as
      well,
      we've
      tried
      for
      years
      with
      no
      luck.
      It
      really
      hurts
      my
      wife,
      consider
      that
      pain
      of
      hers
      as
      you
      process
      all
      this
      as
      well.
      Consider
      that
      you
      may
      be
      much
      more
      at
      fault
      than
      you
      realize,
      was
      the
      case
      for
      me.
      I
      was
      too
      overbearing,
      didn't
      communicate
      enough
      my
      feelings,
      developed
      an
      apathy
      for
      my
      relationship
      and
      the
      things
      she
      was
      doing.
      Realize
      you
      can't
      control
      her
      but
      you
      are
      in
      control
      somewhat
      of
      her
      surroundings,
      and
      yourself.
      Be
      an
      example,
      pray
      like
      never
      before,
      and
      get
      Godly
      friends
      or
      parents
      involved.
      My
      wife
      ended
      up
      separating
      and
      moved
      to
      California
      for
      a
      couple
      months
      to
      live
      with
      her
      sister.
      I'm
      very
      fortunate
      to
      have
      very
      Godly
      in-laws
      that
      were
      able
      to
      have
      some
      influence
      with
      her.
      We're
      since
      back
      together
      and
      coming
      on
      our
      next
      marriage
      anniversary
      and
      that
      rough
      patch
      has
      totally
      transformed
      our
      marriage
      for
      the
      better.
      My
      wife
      also
      had
      an
      alcohol
      addiction
      to
      face.
      If
      your
      wife
      is
      going
      out
      all
      the
      time
      like
      you
      say,
      chances
      are
      she
      does
      too,
      and
      it's
      affected
      her
      mental
      health
      much
      worse.
      Brother,
      I'll
      be
      praying
      for
      you.
      Now
      more
      than
      ever,
      be
      on
      your
      knees
      pleading
      with
      God.
      Get
      every
      Godly
      man
      and
      friend
      you
      know
      surrounding
      you
      with
      love
      and
      prayer.
      Don't
      be
      afraid
      to
      reach
      out
      for
      help.
      God
      doesn't
      want
      to
      see
      marriages
      fail,
      he
      can
      save
      yours,
      and
      transform
      your
      wife's
      heart.
      Hang
      in
      there.

      Our
      hair
      looks
      similar,
      I
      also
      live
      in
      a
      very
      humid
      climate.
      Trying
      different
      pomades
      got
      me
      to
      some
      good
      ones
      that
      keep
      my
      hair
      up,
      some
      work
      great,
      some
      don't.
      Some
      work
      for
      a
      month
      then
      don't
      work
      as
      well
      anymore.
      I
      recently
      started
      using
      Bonafide
      pomade
      on
      a
      recommendation
      on
      my
      barber.
      Their
      Matte
      Paste
      works
      best
      for
      me.
      They
      also
      have
      a
      clay
      if
      you
      need
      more
      hold,
      but
      recommend
      that
      matte
      paste
      as
      it's
      more
      natural
      looking.

      Did
      you
      go
      to
      Nipton?
      I
      did
      the
      same
      trip
      a
      couple
      months
      ago.
      Started
      in
      goodsprings
      and
      took
      the
      same
      route
      as
      the
      game.
      Nipton
      is
      nothing
      like
      the
      game
      lol,
      but
      was
      definitely
      my
      favorite
      location,
      super
      cool,
      quiet
      little
      town.
      And
      was
      sad
      to
      learn
      there's
      no
      such

      I
      build
      software
      for
      the
      merchant
      services
      industry,
      and
      also
      sell
      the
      software
      I
      create
      paired
      up
      with
      merchant
      accounts.
      It's
      really
      a
      simple
      industry
      to
      get
      into,
      not
      majorly
      affected
      by
      recessions,
      and
      excellent
      residual
      income.
      All
      can
      be
      done
      on
      the
      road,
      and
      actually,
      I
      have
      a
      significant
      advantage
      on
      the
      road
      as
      I
      always
      have
      a
      new
      client
      base
      to
      work
      with
      when
      we
      move
      every
      month
      or
      so.
      I
      also
      have
      subreps
      that
      sell
      under
      me
      that
      I
      visit,
      train,
      and
      work
      with
      throughout
      the
      year.
      The
      biggest
      key
      is
      having
      an
      excellent
      MSP
      back
      home
      that
      handles
      most
      of
      the
      support
      and
      deployment
      for
      my
      merchants.

      My
      understanding
      of
      it
      is
      that
      when
      we
      die,
      immediately
      we
      are
      in
      judgement
      before
      God
      making
      a
      case
      for
      our
      life
      on
      Earth.
      If
      we
      are
      saved,
      then
      Jesus,
      mediating
      on
      our
      behalf,
      since
      he
      has
      taken
      our
      punishment
      at
      the
      cross,
      atoned
      for
      our
      sin
      and
      we
      are
      heirs
      of
      his
      righteousness
      and
      are
      granted
      access
      to
      Heaven
      to
      wait
      out
      the
      second
      Coming
      of
      the
      Lord,
      which
      afterwards
      we
      are
      raised
      to
      life
      again
      and
      the
      Earth
      and
      universe
      is
      replaced
      with
      the
      New
      Heavens
      and
      New
      Earth,
      where
      we
      will
      then
      live
      out
      the
      rest
      of
      our
      eternity,
      with
      God
      being
      our
      focal
      point
      and
      source
      of
      worship
      and
      light.
      If
      we
      are
      not
      saved,
      then
      we
      face
      eternal
      damnation
      and
      torment.
      I
      could
      be
      completely
      off
      tho.
      Could
      also
      be
      that
      we
      "sleep"
      until
      the
      second
      Coming
      where
      we
      are
      then
      raised
      to
      life
      again,
      taken
      to
      Heaven
      and
      face
      judgement,
      wait
      out
      the
      Second
      Coming
      events,
      and
      then
      descend
      back
      to
      the
      "new
      heavens,
      new
      earth".
      The
      immediate
      judgement
      makes
      more
      sense
      to
      me
      though.

      Hello!
      I've
      got
      a
      serious
      backlog
      of
      games.
      I've
      been
      trying
      to
      finish
      Witcher
      3
      +
      DLC
      fully
      and
      I've
      got
      to
      Blood
      and
      Wine
      and
      I
      am
      spent,
      don't
      know
      if
      I
      keep
      going
      on
      just
      that
      game,
      great
      as
      it
      is.
      But
      I
      might
      finish
      that
      first
      if
      you
      guys
      think
      it's
      the
      most
      worthy
      endeavor.
      &#8203;

      Thanks
      for
      the
      Dark
      Souls
      recommendation

      and

      Awesome!
      Sounds
      a
      lot
      like
      my
      wife
      and
      I.
      We
      were
      best
      friends
      for
      a
      year
      and
      half
      about
      before
      we
      started
      dating.
      Dated
      4
      months,
      engaged
      only
      20
      days!
      No
      elopement
      either,
      we
      planned
      the
      wedding
      that
      fast.
      I
      also
      say
      go
      sooner
      than
      later.
      The
      best
      thing
      you
      can
      do
      if
      you're
      serious
      is
      get
      some
      hardcore
      premarital
      counseling
      where
      the
      tough
      questions
      will
      be
      asked,
      and
      it'll
      help
      you
      get
      a
      much
      deeper
      understanding
      of
      each
      other,
      and
      set
      some
      boundaries
      before
      marriage
      that'll
      help
      you
      a
      lifetime!
      Ask
      your
      pastor
      for
      recommendations
      or
      if
      he
      does
      premarital
      counseling
      himself!

      Was
      there
      a
      point
      in
      the

      doing
      OMAD
      you
      couldn't

      My

      thought
      was
      KETO
      OMAD
      but
      I
      haven't

      had
      the

      can't

      no

      ups

      OMAD
      has
      been
      the
      easiest
      plan
      to
      follow

      for
      me,
      mainly
      because
      I've
      been
      eating
      whatever
      I
      wanted
      to
      stuff
      myself
      full
      once
      hr
      23
      rolls
      around.
      I
      tracked
      the
      calories
      on
      what
      I
      would
      say
      has
      been
      my
      worst
      day
      so
      far
      (Taco
      Bell
      and
      Oreos
      -1700
      kcal)
      and
      even
      then
      I
      was
      under
      my
      calorie
      goal
      and
      I've
      lost
      some
      weight
      already.
      I
      did
      cut
      soda
      and
      creamers
      out
      completely,
      just
      been
      water
      and
      black
      coffee.
      But
      I
      dunno
      I
      feel
      like
      I'm
      cheating
      and
      it
      won't
      work
      long
      term.

      Sounds
      good,
      thanks
      bro!
      Def
      not
      fast
      food
      every
      time,
      but
      I
      love
      that
      if
      I
      do
      need
      something
      quick
      like
      that
      or
      I
      get
      invited
      out
      to
      eat
      I
      can
      have
      whatever
      I'd
      usually
      eat
      and
      still
      be
      on
      track.
      That's
      why
      OMAD
      so
      far
      for
      me
      has
      worked
      way
      better
      than
      the
      16:8,
      I
      find
      it
      way
      easier.
      What
      would
      an
      average
      KETO
      meal
      look
      like
      for
      you
      to
      hit
      your
      daily
      calories?

      Yeah
      this,
      and
      they
      also
      do
      what's
      called
      chuffing.
      Small
      house
      cats
      don't
      do
      it,
      but
      pretty
      much
      all
      big
      cats
      do.
      It's
      this
      breathy
      low
      rumble
      sound
      and
      it's
      a
      confirmation
      that
      the
      cat
      is
      comfortable
      with
      you
      or
      the
      situation.
      Humans
      can
      mimic
      a
      chuff
      too
      and
      have
      the
      cat
      chuff
      back.
      It's
      basically
      the
      big
      cat
      equivalent
      to
      a
      pur.
