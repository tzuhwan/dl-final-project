      I
      played
      through
      Super
      Metroid
      and
      listened
      to
      Live's
      Throwing
      Copper
      when
      they
      were
      still
      fresh.
      To
      this
      day
      I
      still
      hear
      "I
      Alone"
      in
      my
      head
      whenever
      I
      think
      of
      Metroid.
      Recently
      I
      was
      playing
      Guacamelee,
      and
      when
      I
      realized
      it
      was
      a
      Metroidvania
      style
      game,
      I
      went
      right
      back
      to
      the
      90s
      in
      my
      head.

      I've
      seen
      this
      gif
      too
      many
      times,
      and
      it's
      never
      been
      funny.
      But
      I
      never
      noticed
      that
      guy's
      reactions
      until
      now.
      Ideal
      alchemy
      in
      action.

      Last
      year
      I
      was
      pushing
      people
      to
      read
      this.
      And
      Octavia
      Butler's
      Parable
      of
      the
      Talents.
      Too
      late
      to
      prevent
      Trump
      from
      being
      Prez,
      but
      if
      you
      want
      to
      know
      how
      it
      turns
      out,
      these
      are
      the
      books
      that
      will
      enlighten
      you.

      Me
      too.
      I
      was
      diagnosed
      with
      ADD
      as
      a
      teen.
      Ritalin
      helped
      at
      first
      (with
      everything
      in
      my
      life),
      but
      eventually
      I
      couldn't
      read
      anymore.
      I
      just
      didn't
      give
      a
      crap
      about
      what
      I
      was
      reading.
      For
      many
      reasons,
      I
      took
      myself
      off
      the
      Ritalin--I
      just
      applied
      the
      organizational
      skills
      I'd
      learned
      while
      medicated
      to
      make
      life
      doable.
      A
      wonderful
      side
      effect
      of
      getting
      off
      the
      mess
      was
      a
      renewed
      passion
      in
      many
      things,
      including
      reading.
      It's
      still
      hard
      sometimes
      and
      I
      find
      I've
      read
      several
      pages
      without
      absorbing
      anything,
      but
      I
      enjoy
      it
      enough
      that
      I
      soldier
      through
      those
      attention
      deficit
      spells.

      I
      could
      never
      be
      a
      teacher
      because
      I'd
      be
      cracking
      up
      at
      that
      point.
      I'd
      know
      I
      should
      serious
      and
      mad,
      but
      I'd
      just
      be
      doubled
      over
      with
      laughter.

      cold
      turkey
      (plus

      and
      still
      chew
      it
      to
      this
      day,
      years

      Still

      smoking!
      Twice
      in
      my
      life
      since
      quitting,
      I
      took
      up
      occasional
      social
      smoking,
      and
      both
      times,
      it
      started
      getting
      out
      of
      hand,
      so
      I #8217;m
      done
      with
      that
      idiocy
      now.
      Good
      luck,
      and
      keep
      trying.
      A
      relapse
      isn #8217;t
      an
      excuse
      to
      keep
      smoking
      for
      another
      month
      or
      year,
      it #8217;s
      an
      opportunity
      to
      try
      again
      right
      now.

      The
      Polycade
      is
      gorgeous
      but
      expensive.
      If

      really
      up
      for
      custom
      orders,
      I

      you
      could

      whether

      commercialize
      or
      not.

      Parallel
      path
      for
      me.
      My
      breakfast
      date
      (where
      I
      was
      sadly
      and
      terribly
      hungover)
      turned
      into
      lunch,
      hike,
      dinner
      and
      ice
      cream
      before
      finally
      ending.
      I
      proposed
      a
      year
      later
      where
      we
      hiked
      and
      this
      Christmas
      my
      wife
      is
      buying
      me
      and
      my
      kindergartener
      the
      hulk
      buster
      LEGO
      set
      for
      Christmas.
      The
      green
      light
      was
      that
      neither
      of
      us
      wanted
      the
      date
      that
      lasted
      8
      hours
      too
      long
      to
      end.
      PS
      -
      I
      later
      learned
      she #8217;s
      not
      a
      big
      hiker,
      but
      she
      did
      it
      (and
      does
      it)
      for
      me.
      Easy
      selflessness
      from
      both
      parties
      is
      a
      green
      light.

      Yes,
      narrators
      are
      an
      important
      part
      of
      the
      experience.
      Another
      comment
      on
      narrators
      is
      listening
      to
      the
      same
      narrator
      across
      different
      books.
      Scott
      Brick
      is
      a
      narrator
      I
      like
      quite
      a
      bit,
      but
      I
      listened
      to
      the
      Bourne
      trilogy
      which
      were
      long
      books
      and
      narrated
      by
      him.
      Later
      I
      tried
      to
      listen
      to
      something
      completely
      different
      narrated
      by
      him
      and
      all
      I
      could
      imagine
      was
      the
      next
      action
      sequence
      with
      Bourne
      in
      it.
      For
      me,
      the
      denser
      the
      book,
      the
      better
      suited
      to
      actual
      reading.
      Fluffier
      books
      tend
      to
      be
      good
      choices
      for
      Audio.

      I
      pre

      the
      standard
      edition,

      every

      I
      try

      Sniper

      to
      the
      gold
      edition
      in

      Very

      to
      do
      away
      with
      different
      versions

      Just
      up
      the
      price
      to
      $65
      if
      you
      need
      the
      extra
      money.
      Video

      increased
      in
      price
      substantially
      since

      (when
      they
      were
      sometimes
      more

      I
      just
      got
      my
      first
      printer,
      and
      it #8217;s
      the
      entry
      level
      Dremel.
      I
      think
      it #8217;s
      great
      and
      I
      wanted
      to
      spread
      some
      love.
      Every

      and
      I #8217;m
      sure
      it #8217;s
      great.
      BUT,
      the
      lil #8217;
      Dremel
      hardly
      gets
      mentioned.
      Kudos
      to
      Dremel
      for
      embracing
      this
      movement,
      and
      trying

      bring
      it
      to

      That #8217;s
      a
      fair
      point.
      Going
      price
      on
      Amazon
      is
      $600,
      but
      Home
      Depot
      is
      inexplicably
      $800.
      At
      $600
      it
      feels
      like
      a
      good
      deal
      for
      something
      that #8217;s

      good
      instead
      of
      something
      only
      for
      hobbyists.
      $199
      for
      Ender
      3
      is
      a
      hell
      of
      a
      deal.

      OP,
      does
      the
      pan
      stink
      like
      scallops
      still?
      I
      made
      some
      amazing
      scallops
      on
      a
      friend #8217;s
      cast
      iron
      skillet
      once.
      Everybody
      loved
      me
      until
      they
      realized
      the
      smell
      wouldn #8217;t
      go
      away.
      To
      this
      day,
      I #8217;m
      reminded
      about
      how
      I
      ruined
      my
      friend #8217;s
      pan.

      I
      read
      this
      because
      I
      thought
      Metallica
      was
      cool
      and
      I'd
      be
      cool
      if
      I
      read
      a
      book
      they
      wrote
      a
      song
      about.
      But
      wow
      did
      it
      mess
      me
      up.
      Short
      as
      hell
      which
      worked
      really
      well,
      it
      was
      like
      a
      quick
      kidney
      punch
      where
      the
      after
      the
      shock
      wears
      off,
      there's
      a
      dull
      lingering
      pain
      for
      the
      long
      haul.

       gt;You
      want
      an
      angled
      sash
      brush.
      Spend
      $15
      on
      a
      brush,
      and
      wash
      it
      when
      you're
      done
      until
      there's
      no
      paint.
      It'll
      last
      you
      5+
      years
      as
      a
      DIY
      painter,
      it'll
      hold
      paint
      better,
      it
      will
      physically
      paint
      better,
      and
      you'll
      be
      much
      happier
      100%
      this.
      I
      don't
      usually
      spring
      for
      brand
      name
      when
      it
      comes
      to
      things
      with
      a
      limited
      life,
      but
      a
      nice
      brush
      (I
      like
      Purdy,
      but
      I'm
      sure
      Wooster
      and
      similar
      are
      good,
      too).
      Getting
      away
      from
      taping
      saves
      time,
      and
      makes
      cleaner
      (if
      not
      always
      straighter)
      lines.
