    <TEXT>There will always come a point when you let it slide, with two young boys if I hopped up to check on them every single time I heard a crash, loud noise, crying or yelling I would basically have to stay in whatever room they are in. That being said of course you should notice, and know when it's necessary to intervene and when to let it go. Kids ARE loud and DO yell or cry for any reason. Or no reason.</TEXT>
