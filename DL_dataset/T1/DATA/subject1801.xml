      she
      is
      the
      asshole
      because
      that
      is
      your
      opinion

      even
      if
      you

      if

      think
      some
      of
      the
      food
      is
      weird
      it
      isn't
      racist
      because
      it
      isn't
      like
      you
      saying
      that
      people
      from
      china
      are
      weird
      it
      is
      you
      saying

      can
      be

      NAH
      I
      think
      that
      you
      both
      aren't
      assholes
      because
      the
      test
      was
      false
      and
      you
      just
      wanted
      to
      tell
      her
      that,
      but
      that
      had
      a
      effect
      on
      her
      that
      you
      didn't
      think
      would
      ever
      happen.
      I
      also
      don't
      think
      that
      she
      is
      the
      asshole
      because
      she
      thought
      she
      was
      a
      genius
      but
      isn't
      apparently
      so
      her
      reaction
      can
      be
      understandable.
      I
      do
      think
      that
      she
      is
      overreacting
      a
      bit.
      It
      isn't
      nice
      of
      you
      to
      tell
      her
      because
      of
      how
      confident
      she
      got
      but
      I
      don't
      think
      you
      are
      the
      asshole
      here
      because
      you
      justed
      didn't
      want
      her
      to
      think
      something
      that
      wasn't
      true.

      you
      aren't
      the
      asshole
      because
      they
      changed
      it
      after
      you
      agreed
      to
      it
      and
      I
      do
      understand
      that
      kids
      make
      it
      harder
      but
      if
      the
      supervisor
      has
      a
      ex-wife
      and
      a
      grilfriend
      that
      can
      look
      after
      the
      kids
      they
      aren't
      even
      worth
      mentioning.
      Also
      I
      get
      the
      feeling
      that
      a
      lot
      of
      people
      get
      the
      idea
      that
      because
      people
      have
      kids
      they
      get
      priority
      in
      everything
      and
      that
      other
      people
      should
      just
      do
      all
      of
      the
      shit
      stuff
      because
      they
      have
      kids.

      I
      mean
      its
      a
      shit
      idea
      and
      Micheal
      probs
      doesn't
      do
      things
      he
      finds
      on
      here
      and
      even
      if
      he
      does
      its
      gonna
      take
      a
      lot
      of
      coding
      time
      but
      I
      mean
      I'm
      gonna
      tell
      you
      anyway,
      the
      idea
      is
      bassicly
      a
      remote
      control
      car
      with
      random
      controls
      that
      changes
      them
      every
      time
      you
      start
      to
      work
      out
      how
      they
      work.
      its
      a
      bad
      idea
      but
      is
      it
      'bad'
      bad
      or
      Micheal
      Reeves
      bad?

      NTA
      you
      just
      wanted
      to
      make
      sure
      she
      is
      safe
      and
      she
      is
      being
      a
      royal
      dickhead
      by
      acting
      the
      way
      she
      is
      but
      we
      don
      't
      know
      anything
      else
      so
      it
      might
      be
      completely
      different.
      For
      example
      if
      you
      would
      constantly
      do
      this
      every
      time
      she
      went
      out
      of
      the
      house
      or
      something
      like
      that
      but
      in
      this
      context
      you
      are
      definetly
      not
      the
      asshole
      and
      she
      is.

      Hello,
      this
      is
      my
      first
      post
      here!
      I
      am
      happy
      I
      finally
      found
      a
      place
      where
      I
      can
      talk
      about
      steven
      universe
      with
      other
      people.
      now
      I
      really
      like
      Pearl
      and
      especially
      her
      weapons
      and
      fighting
      style,
      especially
      her
      fighting
      style
      with
      swords.
      Because
      of
      this
      I
      wonderd
      if
      she
      has
      a
      specific
      fighting
      style
      with
      swords
      or
      if
      its
      just
      a
      normal
      very
      common
      style,
      I
      am
      wondering
      this
      because
      I
      really
      like
      her
      style
      of
      fighting
      and
      I
      am
      interested
      if
      I
      could
      learn
      how
      to
      fight
      like
      her.
      Does
      anyone
      know
      if
      she
      has
      a
      specific
      style
      of
      sword
      fighting
      and
      if
      so
      where
      I
      might
      be
      able
      to
      find
      how
      to
      teach
      myself
      how
      to
      fight
      like
      that?
      Thank
      you
      for
      reading
      this!
      I
      know
      its
      been
      quite
      long
      and
      I
      am
      sorry
      but
      I
      just
      really
      want
      to
      know
      how
      I
      if
      I
      could
      do
      this.
      Thanks!

      ESH
      On
      one
      hand
      you
      are
      right
      and
      it
      is
      of
      course
      your
      body
      but
      it
      is
      also
      his
      kid,
      I
      know
      stuff
      like
      abortion
      can
      be
      very
      sensitive
      so
      that
      might
      not
      have
      helped
      but
      I
      think
      that
      in
      this
      and
      maybe
      a
      lot
      of
      other
      scenarios
      like
      this
      you
      should
      both
      agree
      you
      want
      to
      have
      a
      kid
      and
      otherwise
      you
      shouldn't,
      because
      he
      legally
      still
      has
      to
      pay
      money
      even
      if
      he
      won't
      take
      care
      of
      his
      child.
      And
      for
      you
      you
      would
      have
      a
      maybe
      in
      you
      for
      9
      months
      that
      you
      don't
      want
      and
      then
      after
      just
      give
      it
      to
      him.
      The
      best
      thing
      to
      do
      if
      this
      happens
      again
      is
      to
      probably
      abort
      the
      baby
      unless
      both
      of
      you
      are
      sure
      you
      are
      ready
      to
      have
      a
      kid,
      it
      is
      a
      very
      big
      thing
      to
      have
      a
      child
      even
      if
      you
      don't
      take
      care
      of
      it.

      one

      works
      (apparently)

      ask

      something
      bigger
      first
      and
      then
      something

      want)
      so
      in

      it
      seems
      less.
      so
      in

      you
      could
      ask

      then
      when
      they
      say
      no
      you
      ask
      20
      so
      then
      they
      will

      actually
      kinda
      contradicting

      completely
      different

      and
      he

      change
      with

      Bassicly
      you
      aren't

      bullying
      isn't
      a
      light
      thing
      and
      I
      assume
      she
      hasn't
      ever
      been
      bullied,
      otherwise
      she
      would
      probably
      act
      differently.
      I
      think
      its
      a
      bit
      extreme
      what
      you
      did
      tough,
      maybe
      just
      say
      that
      you
      won't
      becoming
      to

      wedding

      you
      won't
      do
      anything
      with

      that
      he
      is
      under
      no
      cicrumstances
      allowed
      in
      your
      house.
      Tough
      I
      can
      really
      see
      why
      you
      did
      this
      because
      what
      he
      did
      was
      horrbile.
      In
      my
      opinion
      you
      are
      definetly
      not
      the
      asshole.

      You
      should
      both
      be
      willing

      have
      a
      child
      and
      be
      able
      to
      keep
      it
      because
      otherwise
      you
      will
      be
      unable
      to
      raise
      it.

      So
      I
      am
      13
      and
      I
      want
      to
      'upgrade'my
      clothing
      style
      because
      at
      the
      time
      I
      mainly
      wear
      whatever
      I
      feel
      like
      wearing,
      so
      basicly
      what
      is
      comfortable
      and
      looks
      a
      bit
      nice
      (usually
      just
      a
      picture
      or
      something
      on
      the
      shirt)
      but
      I
      don't
      think
      its
      actually
      much
      of
      a
      clothing
      style
      because
      usually
      its
      just
      t-shirts.
      So
      I
      have
      looked
      at
      some
      styles
      but
      to
      me
      they
      look
      more
      for
      adults
      than
      for
      kids,
      if
      anyone
      has
      a
      style
      that
      might
      be
      good
      for
      me
      could
      you
      please
      tell
      me?
      thanks!

      I

      Sorry
      if
      the
      formatting
      is
      bad
      I
      am
      on
      mobile.
      So
      recently
      I
      told
      my
      best
      friend
      that
      there
      is
      a
      good
      chance
      I
      might
      be
      bisexual
      and
      now
      do
      I
      not
      only
      regret
      it
      but
      I
      also
      feel
      I
      might
      be
      an
      asshole
      here
      because
      I
      am
      not
      sure
      and
      there
      is
      still
      a
      chance
      I
      am
      not,
      so
      how
      I
      found
      out
      there
      was
      a
      chance
      I
      was
      is
      that
      I
      watched
      a
      video
      on
      if
      you
      are
      gay
      and
      one
      of
      the
      things
      was
       #8216;think
      of
      what
      you
      find
      hot #8217;
      so
      I
      did
      and
      one
      of
      my
      friends
      who
      is
      the
      same
      gender
      as
      me
      is
      the
      first
      thing
      that
      came
      to
      mind.
      So
      I
      immediately
      thought
      there
      was
      a
      good
      chance
      I
      was
      bisexual
      but
      now
      a
      few
      days
      later
      I
      am
      realising
      I
      have
      never
      been
      attracted
      to
      the
      same
      gender
      before
      and
      there
      is
      a
      good
      chance
      I
      am
      straight
      and
      now
      I
      am
      wondering,
      AITA?
      Also
      something
      that
      might
      be
      worth
      knowing
      is
      that
      I
      watched
      that
       #8216;how
      to
      know
      if
      you
      are
      gay #8217;
      video
      multiple
      times
      plus
      I
      watched
      a
      coming
      out
      video
      by
      the
      person
      that
      made
      the
       #8216;how
      to
      know
      if
      you
      are
      gay #8217;
      video
      multiple
      times
      too.
      I
      don #8217;t
      know
      if
      this
      matters
      but
      it
      might.

      This
      might
      be
      very
      controversial
      but
      in
      my
      opinion
      what
      you
      said
      is
      complete
      bullshit
      because
      even
      if
      she
      is
      the
      mother
      that
      doesn #8217;t
      mean
      she
      has
      more
      of
      a
      parental
      right
      over
      the
      kid,
      they
      are
      both
      parents
      so
      why
      should
      one
      have
      more
      right
      over
      the
      other
      just
      because
      one
      has
      to
      have
      the
      baby
      in
      them
      for
      9
      months.
      That
      is
      just
      how
      the
      biology
      has
      to
      work
      but
      that
      shouldn #8217;t
      be
      any
      reason
      for
      the
      mother
      to
      have
      more
      power
      over
      the
      kid.
      In
      my
      opinion
      it #8217;s
      complete
      bullshit
      that
      a
      mom
      is
      allowed
      to
      make
      decisions
      like
      this
      because
       #8216;it #8217;s
      her
      body #8217;,
      no.
      No
      it #8217;s
      not
      your
      body
      it #8217;s
      a
      baby
      in
      your
      body
      and
      hat
      baby
      is
      half
      you
      half
      someone
      else.
      You
      don #8217;t
      get
      to
      decide
      to
      go
      back
      on
      promises
      just
      because
      you
      think
      you
      have
      any
      more
      of
      a
      right
      over
      the
      kid.

      So
      I
      am
      looking
      into
      learning
      dwarvish
      because
      I
      really
      like
      to
      dwarves
      and
      it
      seems
      really
      cool
      to
      me
      so
      I
      was
      thinking
      of
      making
      a
      quizlet
      or
      something
      like
      that
      to
      teach
      myself
      wich
      (normal)
      letter
      is
      wich
      letter
      in
      khuzdul
      but
      I
      can'
      t
      find
      any
      actual
      characters
      of
      it
      anywhere
      so
      I
      was
      wondering
      if
      there
      are
      any
      characters
      I
      can
      use
      or
      if
      there
      is
      something
      else
      I
      can
      use
      to
      teach
      myself
      khuzdul?
      Thanks
      for
      reading
      this!
      This
      is
      my
      first
      post
      and
      I
      hope
      this
      isn'
      t
      a
      really
      common
      question
      or
      anything
      like
      that.

      what
      might
      be
      really
      cool
      is
      a
      miniature
      of
      a
      prop
      or
      a
      figure
      of
      a
      character
      in
      the
      show,
      a
      really
      cool
      place
      you
      could
      get
      something
      like
      this
      is
      weta
      workshop.
      They
      have
      some
      really
      cool
      miniatures
      and
      figures
      so
      maybe
      you
      could
      get
      her
      a
      figure
      of
      her
      favourite
      character
      or
      one
      of
      the
      props
      that
      her
      favourite
      character
      uses.
      I
      will
      warn
      you

      thank
      you!
      you
      really
      made
      me
      realise
      that
      what
      I
      am
      getting
      into
      is
      a
      going
      to
      require
      a
      lot
      more
      effort
      than
      just
      learning
      wich
      symbol
      a
      is
      and
      stuff
      like
      that.
      I
      will
      definetly
      need
      to
      read
      the
      links
      you
      gave
      me
      and
      I
      am
      very
      glad
      you
      said
      this
      before
      I
      started
      this
      and
      it
      turned
      out
      I
      had
      done
      it
      all
      wrong.

      it
      seems
      some
      entity,
      online
      or
      in
      real
      life,
      has
      managed
      to
      get
      onto
      twitter
      and
      kills
      most
      people
      that
      talk
      about
      'it'.
      You
      are
      probably
      best
      of
      to
      run,
      get
      as
      far
      away
      from
      any
      digital
      thing
      but
      do
      keep
      something
      so
      that
      at
      any
      time
      you
      can
      get
      back
      to
      the
      mordern
      world
      as
      fast
      as
      possible
      in
      case
      it
      comes
      after
      you,
      you
      never
      know
      now
      that
      you
      have
      talked
      about
      it,
      be
      weary
      of
      everything
      and
      do
      not
      trust
      anyone.

      it
      won't
      help,
      they
      can
      give
      him
      his
      knuckles
      but
      they
      will
      just
      disapear
      again.
      It
      also
      seems
      its
      either
      speeding
      up
      by
      removing
      more
      parts
      at
      once
      or
      its
      just
      choosing
      bigger
      body
      parts.
      Going
      to
      the
      hospital
      would
      be
      a
      waste
      of
      money
      and
      would
      only
      slow
      it
      down.

      The
      best
      advice
      I
      have
      for
      you
      is
      to
      just
      end
      it
      here,
      tell
      your
      family
      and
      friends
      you
      love
      them
      while
      you
      still
      can
      (you
      never
      know
      when
      your
      tongue
      goes
      missing)
      and
      then
      end
      it.
      Otherwise
      you'll
      be
      scared
      and
      in
      pain
      for
      longer.
      Suicide
      would
      speed
      it
      up.
      You
      can't
      be
      saved
      unless
      you
      find
      a
      cure
      now.
      Good
      luck

      You
      should
      not
      go
      to
      the
      lake,
      whatever
      is
      causing
      it
      wants
      you
      to
      go
      to
      the
      lake
      for
      a
      reason.
      and
      it
      probably
      isn't
      good.
      While
      it
      could
      be
      the
      brain
      thinking
      of
      water
      and
      the
      lake
      is
      water
      it
      would
      seem
      unlogical
      since
      then
      it
      would
      probably
      swap
      between
      bodies
      of
      water
      and
      not
      stick
      to
      the
      lake.
      So
      do
      not
      ever
      go
      to
      the
      lake.

      for
      me
      its
      mostly
      just
      that,
      yes,
      I
      have
      considered
      it
      and
      I
      gate
      myself
      and
      I
      do
      think
      I
      am
      a
      waste
      of
      space
      and
      resources,
      but
      I
      do
      know
      that
      at
      least
      some
      of
      my
      family
      will
      miss
      me,
      even
      tough
      my
      'friends'
      might
      not
      care
      if
      I
      died,
      my
      family
      would
      care.
      And
      I
      don't
      want
      to
      make
      them
      feel
      bad
      just
      beacause
      I
      hate
      myself,
      I
      am
      not
      worth
      anything
      and
      thats
      why
      I
      know
      that
      killing
      myself
      would
      mean
      that
      the
      only
      thing
      I
      have
      really
      ever
      done
      that
      mattersis
      to
      make
      people
      sad.

      Sorry
      for
      the
      formatting
      I #8217;m
      on
      mobile
      So
      my
      friend
      needs
      help
      and
      I
      have
      suggested
      therapy
      but
      they
      don #8217;t
      want
      that.
      So
      I
      said
      that
      I
      do
      want
      to
      help
      them
      and
      asked
      if
      I
      could
      and
      they
      said
      that
      that
      was
      fine.
      So
      my
      question
      is,
      should
      I
      help
      him?
      I
      am
      in
      no
      way
      even
      close
      to
      a
      therapist
      but
      I
      do
      want
      to
      help
      because
      I
      really
      do
      believe
      he
      needs
      it.
      And
      second,
      if
      I
      help
      him
      what
      should
      I
      do?

      Oh
      okay,
      I #8217;ll
      try
      my
      best.
      Also
      I #8217;ll
      tell
      you
      what
      happened
      that
      made
      me
      post
      it
      because
      I
      think
      it
      might
      change
      it
      a
      bit.
      Bassicly
      we
      where
      talking
      and
      then
      e
      started
      saying
      bad
      stuff
      about
      himself
      like
      that
      he
      was
      retarded
      and
      that
      he
      would
      just
      fail
      and
      stuff
      like
      that.
      What
      he
      later
      told
      me
      is
      that
      his
      teacher
      when
      he
      was
      7
      or
      8
      thought
      he
      was
      retarded
      but
      when
      I
      said
      he
      might
      want
      to
      he
      therapy
      because
      of
      the
      way
      he
      talked
      about
      it
      he
      said
      it
      was
      fine.
      But
      what
      worries
      me
      most
      is
      that
      whenever
      I
      say
      something
      good
      about
      him
      he
      either
      ignores
      it
      or
      said
      that
      it #8217;s
      not
      true.
      So
      idk
      if
      this
      does
      change
      something,
      if
      not
      I #8217;m
      sorry
      for
      bothering
      you.

      they
      don'

      multiple

      but
      that

      work.
      I
      have
      gone
      to

      the

      is
      that
      we
      might
      have
      accidentaly
      blocked
      ane
      another.
      I
      have
      gone
      into
      the
      social
      menu
      but
      there
      isn'
      t
      a
      way
      to
      unblock
      each
      other.
      I
      have
      gone
      to
      a
      few
      site
      tough
      and
      they
      have
      said
      that
      we
      would
      need
      someone
      else
      to
      help
      us
      so
      then
      that

      can

      of
      us

       #8203;
      Does

      My

      So
      I
      have
      a
      friend
      who
      is
      suicidal
      and
      last
      night
      she
      said
      she
      was
      going
      to
      kill
      herself,
      I
      barely
      know
      what
      to
      do
      and
      I
      don't
      want
      to
      have
      this
      happen
      again
      and
      then
      she
      actually
      does
      it.
      I
      think
      I
      helped
      her
      for
      then
      but
      I
      don't
      know
      if
      I
      can
      do
      it
      again.
      A
      part
      of
      the
      problem
      is
      that
      I
      don't
      know
      her
      in
      real
      life,
      so
      if
      she
      is
      going
      to
      commit
      suicide
      I
      can't
      do
      a
      lot
      about
      it
      other
      than
      try
      to
      talk
      her
      out
      of
      it.
      I
      there
      anything
      I
      can
      do?
      Anything
      I
      can
      talk
      about
      to
      her
      that
      might
      make
      her
      decide
      she
      won't
      kill
      herself?
      If
      anyone
      needs
      any
      info
      about
      her
      I
      will
      happily
      telly
      ou
      its
      just
      that
      I
      thought
      it
      might
      not
      be
      necesary.

      Yeah
      I
      think
      it #8217;s
      the
      format
      of
      the

      wasn #8217;t
      as
      blurry
      when
      I
      made
      it.
      Also
      is
      there
      anything
      I
      could
      do
      to

      First
      of
      all
      I
      would
      like
      to
      present
      the
      fact
      that
      you
      are
      not
      a
      tiger
      and
      that
      you
      don #8217;t
      have
      to
      fight
      for
      food
      every
      day
      and
      can
      in
      fact
      sit
      comfortably
      in
      your
      home
      behind
      you
      computer.
      Of
      course
      you
      can
      say
      that
      we
      are
      weak
      but
      we
      can
      afford
      to
      not
      have
      women
      pump
      out
      50
      babies
      in
      their
      lives
      because
      all
      of
      those
      babies
      will
      survive
      nowadays,
      in
      the
      wild
      half
      of
      them
      would
      die.
      Also
      you
      don #8217;t
      know
      if
      it
      has
      lasting
      effects
      on
      tigers
      to
      have
      50
      babies
      because
      you
      can #8217;t
      talk
      to
      them.
      You
      don #8217;t
      know
      what
      they
      think,
      plus
      often
      the
      males
      are
      dominant
      and
      protect
      the
      female
      tiger
      so
      the
      female
      tiger
      can
      ease
      her
      cubs.
      In
      our
      day
      and
      age
      that
      it
      is
      often
      not
      possible
      that
      the
      mother
      stays
      home
      so
      she
      can #8217;t
      take
      care
      of
      her
      babies
      because
      she
      has
      so
      work
      wich
      is
      another
      argument
      to
      why
      an
      eleven
      year
      old
      should
      not
      give
      birth.
      She
      can #8217;t
      afford
      to
      have
      here
      entire
      life
      ruined
      because
      some
      dickhead
      raped
      her.

      Yeah
      but
      it #8217;s
      like
      saying
      that
      not
      talking
      to
      someone
      in
      another
      continent
      and
      spending

      on

      is
      wrong

      it

      at

      you
      are
      not

      education
      she
      needs

      abort

      baby.
      And
      of
      course
      the
      baby
      doesn't
      deserve
      death
      but
      you

      raise
      a
      kid

      yeah
      I
      can
      imagine
      how
      she

      days
      if

      she

      entire

      the
      no-visiting
      could
      be
      because
      she
      can't
      stand
      them
      for
      not
      telling
      her
      sooner

      Hi!
       #8203;
      So
      basiclly,
      I
      am
      level
      28
      but
      have
      all
      the
      requirements
      needed
      to
      launch
      a
      nuclear
      missile
      from
      site
      aplha,
      I
      have
      tried
      to
      get
      in
      there
      myself
      but
      as
      you
      might
      guess
      that
      doesn'
      t
      work...So
      I
      wondered,
      can
      anyone
      help
      me
      launch
      my
      first
      nuke?
      If
      you
      can
      could
      you
      please
      send
      me
      a
      friendrequest
      in
      game
      so
      we
      can
      join
      the
      same
      world?
      My
      username

      I
      finally
      worked
      up
      the
      courage.
      I
      knew
      it
      wouldn #8217;t
      become
      anything
      since
      she
      did
      just
      break
      up
      with
      someone
      and

      want

      get
      back
      into
      the

      she
      actually
      took
      it
      quite
      well
      and
      was
      cool
      about
      it.
      Hope
      it
      will
      go
      well

      anyone

      hi

      didn't

      was
      two

      I
      hope
      you
      are
      okay
      and
      still
      here,
      if

      hi
      friend,
      I
      jsut
      want
      to
      say,
      please
      don't
      do
      it.
      You
      seem
      a
      really
      nice
      person
      and
      it
      would
      make
      the
      world
      a
      worse
      place
      if
      you
      left.
      If
      you
      want
      to
      talk
      we
      can
      do
      it
      here
      or
      you
      can
      DM
      me
      if
      you
      want,
      please
      just
      talk
      to
      someone,
      doesn't
      have
      to
      be
      me,
      just
      someone.
      I
      see
      you
      hate
      people
      and
      don't
      want
      to
      talk
      to
      them
      and
      thats
      fine,
      just
      know
      that
      not
      all
      of
      us
      are
      bad,
      and
      that
      there
      are
      some
      people
      out
      there
      who
      are
      good.
      You
      just
      have
      to
      find
      them,
      I
      know
      that
      can
      be
      hard
      nowadays
      but
      it
      is
      still
      posible
      and
      the
      internet
      makes
      it
      a
      lot
      easier,
      maybe
      you'll
      even
      find
      someone
      you'll
      spend
      the
      rest
      of
      your
      life
      with.

      yeah

      you
      said
      in

      sentences
      is
      especially
      people
      forget
      about
      having
      kids,
      have
      you
      thought

      fact
      that
      there
      is
      a

      gen

      ever
      even
      reach
      adult

      honestly
      just
      making

      die
      before
      reaching
      adult
      hood
      'because
      they
      want
      kids'
      it
      seem
      incredibily
      selfish
      to
      have
      kids,
      do
      you

      much
      trouble
      and
      potential
      pain
      they
      will
      be
      once

      gets
      warm
      enough?

      I
      ask
      if
      I

      Yeah
      I
      saw
      about
      that
      article
      too,
      something
      worse
      I
      found
      tough
      is
      that
      the
      first
      time
      I
      saw
      it
      there
      were
      people
      in
      the
      comments
      (it
      was
      on
      Facebook,
      so
      there
      are
      automatically
      insane
      people)
      saying
      stuff
      like
       #8216;good!
      Reverse
      the
      roles #8217;
      and
       #8216;is
      it
      bad
      that
      I
      think
      this
      is
      good? #8217;
      And
      sadly
      it
      didn #8217;t
      seem

      I
      mean
      not
      only
      is
      she
      quite
      entitled
      for
      asking

      to
      move
      around
      everything
      just

      also
      how
      selfish
      is
      she
      for
      thinking
      its
      okay
      to
      have
      baby
      in
      the
      house
      when
      its
      not
      even
      asked
      if
      its
      okay,
      and
      even
      if
      everyone
      is
      okay
      with
      it
      and
      you
      didn't
      say
      it
      it
      would
      still
      be
      entitled
      since
      babies
      can
      cry,
      a
      lot,
      and
      I
      don't
      think
      the
      others
      will
      be
      okay
      with
      waking
      up
      at
      3am
      every
      other
      day
      because
      of
      the
      baby.
      Plus
      when
      the
      baby
      is
      there
      the
      whole
      house
      would
      have
      to
      be
      baby
      proofed
      and
      you
      couldn't
      ever
      really
      have
      a
      party
      anymore
      because
       #168;the
      baby
      needs
      to
      sleep #168;
      Plus
      sometimes
      people
      decide
      to
      have
      babies
      born
      in
      the
      house
      and
      not
      the
      hospital
      and
      if
      she
      also
      would
      have
      decided
      that
      then
      what
      would
      she
      epect
      everyone
      to
      do?
      Just
      ignore
      her
      giving
      birth
      or
      to
      just
      not
      be
      in
      the
      house
      for
      an
      unkown
      amount
      of

      hi
      OP,
      I
      know
      humanity
      is
      terrible,
      I
      don't
      like
      humanity
      either,
      don't
      hate
      people,
      but
      don't
      like
      people
      either...
      I
      do
      believe
      there
      are
      good
      people,
      and
      I
      believe
      you
      are
      one
      of
      those
      few
      good
      people.
      I
      know
      that
      there
      is
      a
      good
      chance
      that
      you
      are
      already
      gone,
      but
      if
      not,
      care
      to
      talk?
      I
      know
      I
      probably
      can't
      change
      your
      mind
      on
      that
      people
      are
      bad,
      but
      I
      would
      like
      to
      be
      your
      one
      friend
      that
      doesn't
      leave,
      if
      you
      want
      me
      to
      be
      your
      friend.

      good
      point,
      you
      know
      what?
      you
      are
      such
      an
      amazing
      person
      and
      SO
      good
      at
      helping
      people
      who
      are
      going
      to
      commit
      suicide
      that
      I
      am
      going
      to
      delete
      my
      comment,
      honestly
      I
      can't
      believe
      they
      need
      this
      sub
      when
      there
      are
      amazing
      people
      like
      YOU
      who
      can
      deal
      with
      it
      soooo
      much
      better,
      you
      should
      go
      work
      for
      a
      suicide
      hotline
      ya
      know?
      you
      would
      be
      a
      great
      asset
      to
      the
      team
      working
      there.

      I
      get
      that,
      but
      you
      do
      need
      to
      remember,
      life
      does
      go
      on,
      you
      can
      find
      new
      people
      to
      hang
      around,
      new
      people
      to

      your
      family

      you,

      keep
      talking

      you
      share

      most
      importantly,
      please,
      if
      you
      really
      want
      to
      commit
      suicide,
      wait
      24hours,
      thing
      it

      isn't

      I
      think
      it
      would
      be
      a
      good
      idea
      tough
      there
      should
      be
      exceptions
      in
      my
      opinion,
      for
      example
      if
      you
      got
      divorced
      and
      re-married
      then
      you
      should
      be
      allowed
      to
      have
      kids
      (if
      the
      person
      they
      re-married
      too
      doesn #8217;t
      have
      kids)
      because
      otherwise
      the
      person
      who
      they
      re-marry
      too
      won #8217;t
      be
      able
      to
      have
      kids
      and
      we
      shouldn #8217;t
      be
      stopping
      people
      from
      having
      kids,
      just
      not
      to
      many.

      I
      know,
      lots
      of
      people
      have
      complained,
      but
      I
      have

      slightly
      different
      one
      so
      I
      thought
      I
      should
      post.
      Bethesda,
      please
      fix
      the
      loot
      system
      at
      events
      or
      just
      in
      general,
      if
      someone
      is
      doing
      the
      event,
      they
      should
      get
      to
      loot
      the
      enemies,
      if
      someone
      is
      shooting
      at
      the
      enemies,
      they
      to
      should
      get
      the
      loot.
      The
      last
      one
      might
      seem
      obvious
      but
      I #8217;m
      putting
      it
      there
      because
      of
      the
      fact
      that
      I
      participated
      in
      the
      scorched
      earth
      event
      today
      and
      I
      did
      shoot
      the
      scorchbeast
      Queen,
      I
      ran
      out
      of
      ammo
      on
      all
      of
      my
      guns,
      but
      I
      didn #8217;t
      get
      any
      loot,
      I
      wasted
      time
      and
      all
      of
      my
      ammo
      on
      the
      schorchbeast
      queen
      and
      I
      didn #8217;t
      get
      anything.
      Please
      fix
      this,
      I
      don #8217;t
      know
      if
      it
      is
      a
      bug
      or
      if
      you

      a
      good

      I #8217;m

      32,

      because
      I
      ran
      out
      of
      ammo
      I
      probably
      didn #8217;t
      do
      enough
      damage,
      so
      while
      it
      is
      a

      it
      makes

      players
      can #8217;t
      do
      things

      this
      because
      they
      won #8217;t
      get

      which
      honestly
      just
      sucks

      They

      That #8217;s
      some

      behaviour.
      Like

      you
      to
      bring
      your

      ESH
      It #8217;s
      hard
      because
      you
      payed
      for
      the
      ticket
      but
      you
      also
      promised
      them
      the
      money.
      I #8217;d
      say
      that
      the
      best
      solution
      would
      be
      to
      give
      the
      sons
      40k
      each
      and
      give
      the
      parents
      20k
      because
      the
      parents
      invested
      the
      sons
      money
      so
      they
      should
      IMO
      also
      get
      a
      part
      of
      the
      revenue
      because
      the
      entire
      alone
      of
      money
      could
      have
      been
      lost
      during
      the
      investing

      so

      lived

      Yeah,
      it #8217;s
      honestly
      dumb
      that

      I

      the

      you

      is
      to

      likes
      these
      things
      and
      gets
      hated
      for
      it.

      the

      hard
      but
      I
      am
      going
      to
      go
      with
      YTA
      While
      you
      did
      warn
      her
      I
      think
      you
      still
      should
      have
      gone
      back,
      I
      have
      -3
      glasses
      and
      if
      I
      don't
      wear
      those
      for
      a
      few
      hours
      I
      get
      a
      bad
      headache,
      I
      can't
      imagine
      what
      your
      daughter
      felt.
      On
      top
      of
      that
      I
      do
      feel
      like
      its
      bad
      to
      be
      at
      a
      wedding
      and
      not
      see
      anything,
      especially
      with
      something
      like
      -26
      you
      won't
      be
      able
      to
      see
      ANYTHING.
      While
      it
      was
      her
      fault
      it
      isn't
      like
      she
      could
      go
      back
      on
      her
      own
      either,
      she
      doesn't
      have
      glasses
      and
      you
      took
      her
      there.

      I
      agree
      with
      most
      of

      you

      OP
      is
      the
      A

      he
      tried
      to

      and
      he
      gets
      shut
      down
      by
      the
      kid
      and
      her

      they

      tough
      he

      Doesn't

      I

      that
      this

      either
      100%

      the
      entire
      government
      is
      in
      on
      a
      secret
      conspiracy
      and
      saying
      that
      discrimination

      I

      it #8217;s
      illegal

      (if

      So
      for
      a
      backstory
      I
      don #8217;t
      need
      to
      say
      much
      other
      than
      that
      my
      dad
      bought
      me
      these
      headphones
      for
      my
      birthday
      last
      year
      and
      they
      are
       #8364;100-ish.
      So
      I
      have
      these
      headphones
      that
      my
      dad
      bought
      for
      my
      birthday
      and
      he
      was
      recently
      telling
      me
      that
      they
      belong
      to
      all
      of
      us
      because
      we
      are
      family
      and
      it #8217;s
      our
      house,
      I
      disagree
      because
      in
      my
      opinion
      the
      fact
      that
      we
      are
      family
      or
      live
      in
      the
      same
      house
      doesn #8217;t
      mean
      that
      I
      have
      to
      share
      them.
      So
      AITA?

      he
      wanted
      to
      use
      them.
      BEfore
      this
      he
      would
      just
      use
      them
      without

      well

      not

      the
      thing
      is
      tough
      that
      if
      she
      COULD
      afford
      it
      she
      wouldn't
      be
      asking
      OP
      for
      3/4th,
      she
      obviosuly
      can't,
      so
      while
      OP
      might
      not
      be
      directly
      forcing
      her
      out
      of
      an
      abortion
      he
      is
      still
      doing
      it

      while
      I
      get
      what
      you
      mean
      its
      still
      (imo)
      dumb,
      if

      afford
      it
      she
      wouldn't

      3/4th
      of
      the

      cost.
      She
      can't
      afford
      it,
      OP
      got
      himself
      in

      she

      I
      am
      not
      saying
      OP
      is
      forcing
      her
      to
      go
      through
      with
      it,
      all
      I
      am
      saying
      is
      that
      OP
      is
      the
      A
      if
      he
      refuses
      to
      pay,
      she
      clearly
      doesn't
      have
      the
      $600
      and
      while
      that
      is
      her
      mistake
      OP
      did
      get
      her
      in
      the
      situation.
      I
      think
      your
      homeless
      person
      comparison
      is
      flawed
      because
      in
      this
      instance
      the
      woman
      wouldn't
      be
      in
      the
      situation
      without
      OP,
      if
      you
      want
      to
      continue
      with
      a
      homeless
      person
      its
      more
      that
      you
      made
      the
      person
      go
      bankrupt
      and
      then
      won't
      give
      them
      the
      money
      they
      need
      to
      feed
      themselves.

      I
      didn't
      mean
      to
      say
      that
      it
      is
      OP's
      fault,
      all
      I
      am
      trying
      to
      say
      is
      that
      you
      can't
      shift
      all
      the
      blame
      on
      her
      and
      say
      that
      SHE
      should
      have
      had
      a
      plan,
      according
      to
      you
      that
      way
      OP
      should
      have
      had
      a
      plan
      too.
      Seeing
      as
      this
      could
      happen.

      Yes
      it
      does
      take
      too,
      and
      OP
      is
      definetly
      not
      100%
      too
      blame,
      but
      it
      also
      isn't
      100%
      your
      fault
      and
      because
      she
      is
      asking
      OP
      to
      pay
      3/4d
      instead
      of
      1/2nd
      or
      nothing
      I
      (and
      I
      am
      assuming
      stuff
      here)
      get
      the
      idea
      that
      she
      can't
      pay.
      Not
      funding
      it
      may
      not
      directly
      make
      it
      she
      can't
      abort
      in
      indirectly
      it
      probably
      will.

      I
      do
      agree,

      I
      think
      that
      nobody
      should
      have
      to
      birth
      a
      baby
      they
      don #8217;t

      it
