      She
      was
      probably
      just
      doing
      it
      for
      fun,
      people
      in
      relationships
      tend
      to
      get
      a
      bit
      bored
      because
      there
      is
      no
      more
      challange
      in
      getting
      a
      man/woman
      as
      they've
      already
      got
      them.
      They
      dont
      necessarily
      want
      to
      cheat
      on
      their
      partner
      just
      probably
      miss
      the
      excitement
      of
      it
      thats
      all.

      You
      can't,
      if
      she's
      not
      even
      considering
      long
      distance
      relationship
      then
      it
      is
      time
      you
      move
      on
      buddy.

      ._.
      I
      mean
      he's
      always
      told
      me
      he'll
      be
      the
      death
      of
      me
      but

      Maybe
      you're
      not
      fully
      clean
      down
      there
      when
      you
      guys
      get
      busy
      because
      that
      can
      be
      a
      huge
      turning
      off
      point,
      or
      maybe
      its
      the
      hair
      that
      is
      bothering
      her?
      After
      some
      time
      she'll
      probably
      want
      to
      try
      it
      out
      herself
      because
      doing
      the
      same
      stuff
      over
      and
      over
      again
      gets
      boring
      eventually
      and
      you'll
      start
      looking
      for
      new
      things
      to
      try.
      Just
      remember
      that
      if
      she
      is
      not
      performing
      oral
      sex
      on
      you,
      then
      you
      sure
      as
      hell
      don't
      have
      to
      either.

      Why
      dont
      you
      make
      it
      into

      next

      to
      see
      who
      cums

      Don't
      be
      so
      serious!!!!
      You
      should
      both
      be
      talking
      and
      giggling
      and
      just
      enjoying
      your
      time
      together.
      Also
      make
      sure
      you
      check
      on
      your
      partner
      during
      sex
      to
      make
      sure
      they
      are
      okay
      and
      check
      after
      sex,
      I
      come
      from
      a
      religious
      family
      so
      the
      day
      after
      I
      lost
      my
      virginity
      I
      felt
      super
      guilty
      and
      sad
      like
      I
      just
      sinned.
      Overall
      its
      not
      like
      the
      movies,
      its
      not
      going
      to
      be
      all
      flowers,
      hearts
      and
      butterflies,
      so
      DONT
      PRESSURE
      YOUR
      SELVES
      TO
      MAKE
      IT
      PERFECT
      :)
      Just
      have
      fun!

      sex

      Well
      me
      and
      my
      boyfriend
      usually
      call
      each
      other
      babe
      or
      baby,
      but
      we
      do
      sometimes
      call
      each
      other
      babe
      or
      baby
      in
      different
      languages
      just
      for
      the
      fun
      of
      it
      :)

      Ask
      him
      about
      the
      future,
      what
      does
      he
      want
      and
      does
      he
      see
      himself
      with
      his
      current
      girlfriend
      in
      like
      5-10
      years
      time?
      If
      the
      answer
      is
      yes,
      then
      I
      know
      its
      hard
      but
      you'll
      have
      to
      move
      on.
      But
      if
      he's
      unsure
      or
      the
      answer
      is
      no,
      ask
      him
      how
      he
      feels
      about
      you
      now
      that
      he
      knows
      the
      truth,
      could
      he
      possibly
      see
      a
      future
      with
      you?

      You're
      still
      young
      and
      curious,
      probably
      just
      want
      to
      see
      what
      it
      would
      be
      like
      having
      sex
      with
      someone
      other
      than
      your
      gf.
      I
      dont
      really
      know
      what
      advice
      to
      give
      you
      but
      since
      you
      are
      still
      young
      I'm
      pretty
      sure
      the
      relationship
      wont
      last
      forever.
