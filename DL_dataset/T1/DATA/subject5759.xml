      Me
      too.
      I
      suffered
      from
      depression,
      anxiety
      and
      self
      harm
      before
      i
      got
      accepted.
      It
      has
      gotten
      100x
      worse
      since
      i've
      gotten
      here
      but
      now
      I've
      lost
      anyone
      I
      cared
      about.
      I
      have
      zero
      people
      to
      talk
      to
      here
      let
      alone
      friends.
      My
      midterms
      have
      been
      ranging
      in
      the
      65-80
      range
      which
      for
      me
      is
      pretty
      fucking
      awful.
      I
      dont
      know
      how
      im
      even
      going
      to
      get
      through
      christmas
      because
      I
      have
      no
      where
      to
      go
      and
      I
      need
      to
      vacate
      residence.
      I
      fucking
      hate
      it
      here.
      If
      you
      come
      up
      with
      a
      suicide
      plan,
      let
      me
      in
      on
      it.

      From
      my
      very
      limited
      experience,
      I've
      only
      been
      attracted
      to
      one
      person
      in
      my
      life
      and
      it
      certainly
      was
      not
      because
      of
      his
      appearance.
      I
      truly
      loved
      this
      persons
      personality
      and
      more
      importantly
      how
      they
      treated
      me.
      I
      feel
      true
      love
      only
      comes
      from
      an
      emotional,
      built
      up
      bond.
      No
      love
      at
      first
      sight
      bullshit.

      Hi
      everyone.
      I

      The

      I
      just
      need
      my
      undergrad
      to
      get
      into
      Law
      school.
      My
      program
      at
      UofT
      currently
      is
      social
      science
      but
      It
      doesnt
      entirely
      matter
      I
      just
      need
      a
      useless
      undergrad
      to
      get
      into
      what
      I
      actually
      want
      to
      be
      doing.
       #8203;
      I
      don't
      have
      any
      friends
      or
      anything
      support
      here
      at
      UofT
      at
      least
      if
      I
      moved
      to
      London
      i'de
      be
      closer
      to
      family.
      I
      tend
      to
      run
      from
      any
      slight
      problem
      I
      have
      which
      is
      why
      I
      like
      getting
      advise
      on
      what
      might
      be
      right
      for
      me.
      i
      think
      things
      would
      improve
      at
      Western
      because
      I
      could
      afford
      to
      bypass
      the
      residence
      situation.
      I
      have
      anxiety
      and
      realized
      quickly
      after
      I
      came
      to
      UofT
      that
      being
      in
      a
      common
      apartment
      with
      3
      strangers
      wasn't
      ideal
      for
      me.

      I
      have
      pretty
      unmanageable
      anxiety
      and
      depression.
      I
      thought
      a
      fresh
      start
      at
      UofT
      and
      being
      completely
      independent
      may
      kick
      my
      ass
      into
      growing
      out
      of
      this.
      But
      i
      realized
      quickly
      being
      moved

      wasn't

      Hi
      everyone.
      Im
      thinking
      about
      starting
      to
      vape
      to
      deal
      with
      my
      depression
      and
      self
      harm.
      I'm
      wondering
      about
      recommendations
      for
      a
      beginner
      who
      doesnt
      want
      to
      get
      super
      "stoned"
      or
      have
      raised
      anxiety.
      I
      need
      something
      as
      an
      anti-depressant
      relaxer
      but
      still
      be
      able
      to
      function
      i
      guess
      is
      what
      im
      getting
      at.
      I
      was
      looking
      at
      the
      website
      and
      with
      a
      pretty
      uninformed
      guess
      was
      wondering
      if
      Shark
      Shock
      or
      B.E.C
      would
      provide
      these
      effects?

      Hey
      everyone.
      I'm
      a
      first
      year
      student
      here
      and
      would
      like
      to
      get
      the
      hell
      out
      of
      this
      place
      after
      I
      finish
      up
      this
      first
      year.
      Has
      anyone
      transferred
      schools
      before?
      Whats
      the
      process?
      I've
      contacted
      admissions
      of
      the
      school
      i
      want
      to
      attend
      but
      they
      are
      very
      slow
      at
      replying
      and
      reply
      too
      vaguely
      to
      be
      anywhere
      near
      helpful.
       #8203;
      Do
      I
      have
      to
      go
      through
      OUAC
      like
      I
      did
      in
      high
      school?

      Oh
      really?
      I
      couldnt
      apply
      for
      a
      transfer
      if
      my
      grades
      were
      shit.
      It
      has
      nothing
      to
      do
      with
      the
      school.
      I
      actually
      enjoyed
      the
      classes
      I
      took
      here.
      It
      has
      to
      do
      with
      residence
      and
      Toronto
      in
      general.
      There
      are
      many
      benefits
      for
      me
      personally
      moving
      closer
      to
      home
      where
      I
      can
      afford
      to
      live
      off
      campus.

      You
      have
      no
      idea
      why
      people
      intend
      to
      leave.
      We've
      all
      fucked
      up

      made

       #8203;
      I
      suggest
      you
      stop
      judging
      people.
      It's
      not
      helping
      anyone.
      I
      also
      never
      referred
      to
      it
      as
      a
      hellhole..
      "Get
      the
      hell

      is
      a
      strongly
      worded
      phrase
      for
      leaving.

      I
      took
      it
      last
      semester
      and
      i'de
      suggest
      reading
      it.
      I
      know
      its
      painful
      and
      when
      you
      start
      reading
      it
      sounds
      like
      a
      repetition
      of
      the
      lecture.
      But
      there
      are
      definitely
      questions
      on
      term
      tests
      and
      the
      final
      exam
      about
      specific
      content
      from
      the
      textbook,
      primarily
      the
      little
      blurbs
      on
      experiments,
      specific
      real
      world
      examples,
      and
      what
      not.

      I'm
      a
      first
      year
      student
      so
      all
      this
      grant
      and
      osap
      stuff
      is
      a
      bit
      over
      my
      head.
      For
      the
      fall
      term
      I
      recieved
      my
      OSAP
      money,
      a
      grant
      from
      Woodsworth
      and
      UTAPS.
       #8203;
      I
      didnt
      get
      much
      from
      UTAPS
      but
      it
      was
      still
      crucial
      to
      paying
      for
      my
      fall
      term.
      This
      term
      I
      only
      got
      OSAP
      which
      paid
      the
      school
      directly...
      I
      still
      have
      quite
      a
      bit
      of
      an
      outstanding
      balance
      since
      I
      didnt
      recieve
      the
      two
      other
      grants.
      Was
      I
      supposed
      to
      apply
      for
      them?
       #8203;
      I
      thought
      UTAPS
      was
      automatically
      applied
      to
      through
      OSAP.
      And
      do
      colleges
      not
      give
      grants
      for
      both
      terms?
       #8203;
      I
      can't
      even
      afford
      to
      buy
      my
      textbooks
      for
      this
      semester
      and
      I
      have
      an
      outstanding
      balance.
      I
      got
      quite
      a
      bit
      of
      money
      first
      semester
      which
      really
      helped
      so
      I'm
      not
      sure
      what's
      changed.

      I'm
      in
      Woodsworth.
      Besides
      the
      brief
      ant
      infestations
      in
      the
      fall
      that
      I
      like
      to
      blame
      my
      pig
      roommates
      for
      or
      the
      fact
      that
      they
      kept
      me
      all
      night
      one
      day
      before
      a
      test
      fucking
      around
      with
      the
      smoke
      alarms,
      it's
      ok.
      But
      i'm
      actually
      transferring
      next
      year
      because
      I
      hate
      residence
      and
      cannot
      afford
      to
      live
      off-campus
      in
      Toronto.
      I
      chose
      it
      at
      the
      top
      of
      my
      rankings
      when
      I
      applied
      because
      there
      were
      private
      bedrooms
      and
      from
      pictures
      I
      found
      online
      they
      seemed
      nicer
      than
      the
      other.
      Woodsworth
      is
      apartment
      style.
      My
      suite
      has
      2
      bathrooms,
      5
      people,
      single
      private
      bedrooms
      and
      a
      common
      kitchen
      and
      living
      space.
      Do
      a
      little
      research
      on
      them.
      I
      know
      its
      hard
      to
      make
      a
      decision
      on
      where
      you
      are
      going
      to
      live
      without
      seeing
      the
      place.
      I
      regret
      my
      decision.
      I
      pay
      way
      too
      much
      money
      for
      this
      residence
      and
      I
      cannot
      stand
      the
      people
      I
      was
      forced
      to
      live
      with
       #8203;
      If
      you
      can,
      I'de
      recommend
      off
      campus
      housing.
      If
      you
      have
      friends
      (unlike
      me)
      You'll
      probably
      end
      up
      paying
      less
      than
      I
      do
      for
      my
      prison
      cell
      type
      dorm
      room
      to
      which
      I
      am
      writing
      from
      while
      also
      choking
      on
      the
      price
      I
      saw
      on
      my
      invoice
      today.
       #8203;
      If
      you
      have
      any
      questions
      about
      Woodsworth
      let
      me
      know.

      I
      found
      the

      email,
      I
      received
      acceptance
      March
      23rd
      last
      year.
      But
      they
      are
      very
      slow,
      I
      sent
      out
      my
      applications
      early
      Dec
      and
      they
      didnt
      even
      send
      an
      acknowledgment
      letter
      that
      they
      received
      it
      until
      late
      January
      so
      I
      think
      you
      are
      right
      to
      doubt
      your
      classmate.

      The
      UofT
      reddit
      page
      right
      now
      is
      going
      crazy
      with
      high
      school
      students
      asking
      for
      advice
      about
      the
      school
      and
      current
      students,
      including
      myself
      bitching
      about
      the
      school.
      I'm
      in
      UofT
      right
      now
      but
      want
      to
      transfer
      to
      Western
      next
      year.
      Before
      I
      submit
      the
      transfer
      application
      i'de
      like
      some
      advice
      because
      I
      know
      I
      would
      have
      appreciated
      it
      before
      I
      optimistically
      packed
      my
      bags
      for
      Toronto.
       #8203;
      Anything
      I
      should
      know
      about
      Western?
      Any
      advice
      you
      can
      give?
      I
      dont
      plan
      to
      live
      on
      campus
      at
      Western
      (Thank
      god,
      which
      is
      why
      im
      leaving
      UofT)

      Thank
      you
      for
      putting
      in
      the
      time
      to
      write
      this,
      I
      really
      appreciate
      it.
      My
      program
      at
      UofT
      is
      in
      social
      sciences
       #8203;
      When
      I
      was
      picking
      schools
      I
      mostly
      focused
      on
      which
      has
      a
      better
      law
      school.
      Which
      is
      why
      I
      was
      debating
      UofT
      and
      Western.
      Is
      there
      anything
      you
      can
      tell
      me
      about
      that?
      My
      program
      right
      now
      doesnt
      matter
      as
      much
      to
      me
      and
      I'm
      thinking
      about
      applying
      to
      criminology,
      sociology
      and
      political
      science.
      I
      was
      also
      thinking
      about
      applying
      to
      Kings
      (I
      want
      to
      get
      in
      wherever
      they
      can
      fit
      me
      in)
       #8203;
      School
      politics
      and
      that
      do
      not
      concern
      me,
      I
      dont
      get
      involved
      in
      anything
      here
      at
      UofT
      and
      resent
      residence
      for
      the
      close
      proximity
      I
      have
      to
      be
      in
      with
      people
      who
      are
      loud,
      messy
      and
      crass.
       #8203;
      P.s
      thanks
      for
      info
      about
      the
      gym,
      the
      one
      here
      at
      my
      residence
      is
      super
      small,
      messy
      and
      some
      weird
      people
      go
      in
      there
      at
      the
      time
      that
      I
      can
      finally
      get
      in.

      Thank
      you
      for
      replying,
      it's
      very
      helpful
      to
      hear
      from
      someone
      who
      has
      experience
      at
      both
      schools.
      My
      idea
      is
      to
      live
      off-campus.
      My
      sister
      lives
      near
      London
      and
      its
      much
      more
      practical
      to
      share
      costs
      with
      her
      to
      get
      a
      place
      off-campus
      than
      shelling
      out
      so
      much
      money
      to
      live
      in
      a
      crappy
      residence
      room
      in
      Toronto.
       #8203;
      Since
      you
      spent
      a
      few
      years
      there,
      did
      you
      hear
      anything
      about
      Western
      Law?
      When
      i
      finish
      my
      undergrad
      at
      Western
      I'll
      be
      considering
      whether
      to
      go
      back
      to
      Toronto
      for
      law
      school
      or
      stay
      at
      Western.
      I
      hear
      good
      things
      about
      both
      though.

      be
      sold
      out
      everwhere.
      Any
      idea
      where
      I
      can
      buy
      it
      without
      paying
      the
      $16
      on
      salt
      nix's
      website

      I've
      been
      advocating
      this
      for
      years.
      Euthanasia
      laws
      in
      Canada
      should
      be
      expanded
      to
      cover
      depression.
      Depression
      isn't
      insanity
      and
      not
      curable
      in
      everyone.
      Why
      should
      people
      who
      are
      depressed
      and
      chronically
      suicidal
      like
      myself
      have
      to
      resort
      to
      some
      kind
      of
      terrible,
      inhumane
      method
      to
      die?

      Thank
      you
      for
      the
      info
      on
      Kings!
      I
      was
      called
      by
      Western
      last
      year
      saying
      they
      did
      not
      have
      space
      for
      me
      in
      the
      program
      i
      wanted
      at
      main
      campus
      but
      offered
      me
      admission
      to
      Kings.
      Since
      i
      didnt
      know
      much
      about
      it
      I
      went
      with
      UofT.
      So
      this
      is
      very
      helpful!
      I
      have
      3
      applications
      so
      i
      was
      going
      to
      apply
      to
      poli
      sci
      and
      criminology
      in
      the
      main
      campus
      and
      I
      wanted
      one
      application
      to
      go
      to
      Kings.
      At
      UofT
      criminology
      is
      extremely
      popular
      so
      I'm
      worried
      about
      selecting
      criminology
      at
      Kings.
      Which
      program
      would
      be
      best
      to
      try
      to
      get
      into
      Kings?
      (Sociology,
      Poli
      Sci
      or
      Criminology?)

      Just
      wanted
      to
      thank
      everyone
      for
      the

      here!
      You
      guys
      are
      seriously
      so
      much
      nicer
      and
      optimistic

      users
      on
      the

      subreddit
      so
      I'm
      sensing
      my
      decision
      to
      leave
      UofT
      is
      a
      good
      one!

      It's
      definitely
      self
      punishment
      for
      me
      at
      least.
      It's
      addicting
      because
      all
      the
      emotional
      pain
      turns
      into
      physical
      which
      to
      me
      is
      so
      much
      more
      bearable
      for
      me.
      I
      get
      into
      terrible
      fits
      out
      cryings,
      panic
      and
      my
      mind
      becomes
      overcome
      with
      terrible
      thoughts.
      If
      you've
      ever
      seen
      a
      cartoon
      with
      the
      character
      with
      those
      rings
      around
      their
      head
      indicating
      dizziness
      thats
      how
      it
      feels.
      Too
      many
      thoughts
      that
      overwhelm
      me.
      The
      only
      way
      to
      calm
      me
      down
      is
      cutting.
      Turning
      my
      sadness
      to
      anger
      and
      cutting
      myself
      completely
      calms
      me
      and
      the
      pain
      and
      headache
      I
      get
      from
      crying
      prior
      is
      like
      a
      sedative
      that
      puts
      me
      to
      sleep
      until
      i
      do
      it
      over
      again
      the
      next.
