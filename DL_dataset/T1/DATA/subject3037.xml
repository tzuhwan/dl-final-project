      Anything.
      As
      long
      as
      they
      don't
      imply
      that
      I
      would
      be
      prettier
      if
      I
      changed
      things
      about
      myself.
      Really,
      I'm
      so
      sick
      of
      'you
      have
      so
      beautiful
      hair,
      you
      would
      be
      so
      pretty
      if
      you
      wore
      it
      down!'
      'you
      would
      look
      really
      great
      with
      some
      makeup
      on!'
      'if
      you
      wore
      more
      fitting
      clothes,
      guys
      would
      be
      all
      over
      you!'
      (like
      that
      is
      what
      my
      gay
      ass
      wants
      to
      happen).
      Or
      wanting
      to
      do
      me
      a
      makeover.
      No
      Natalie,
      I
      don't
      need
      a
      makeover,
      I'm
      fine
      with
      my
      style
      as
      it
      is!
      Yeah
      I
      wish
      I'd
      be
      better
      looking
      but
      makeup
      and
      wearing
      my
      hair
      down
      is
      not
      something
      that
      would
      help,
      because
      I
      have
      a
      different
      sense
      of
      what
      would
      make
      me
      look
      good
      and
      feel
      confident,
      bitch.
      I
      might
      be
      pretty
      and
      feel
      pretty
      in
      makeup
      and
      hair
      down,
      but
      I
      won't
      feel
      confident
      or
      myself.
      I
      know
      you
      don't
      want
      anything
      bad
      for
      me
      but
      go
      fuck
      yourself,
      Nat.

      to
      not
      be
      so
      talkative
      about
      my
      problems,
      because
      compared
      to
      everybody
      else
      they
      are
      stupid.

      Thanks,
      I
      got
      them
      in
      winter
      this
      year
      and
      before
      that
      I
      thought
      really
      long
      about
      what
      shape
      of
      the
      frames
      I'd
      like
      to
      get.

      It
      might
      be
      that
      she
      just
      really
      had
      a
      bad
      day,
      or
      somebody
      really
      pissed
      her
      off.
      Anyway
      I
      think
      you
      should
      give
      her
      some
      time
      and
      ask
      her
      about
      it
      tommorow
      or
      when
      she
      will
      want
      to
      talk

      I,
      too,
      am
      partially
      blind.
      We
      gotta
      stick
      together,
      in
      case
      one
      of
      us
      loses
      their
      glasses.
      Also
      you're
      so
      pretty
      and
      these
      glasses
      really
      suit
      you!

      I
      usually

      me
      even

      I

      I
      want
      her
      to
      actually
      love
      me
      and
      genuinely
      love
      to
      spend
      time
      with
      me
      (practically
      impossible)
      and
      I
      hope
      she
      won't
      have
      a
      high
      libido
      or
      an
      additude
      that
      a
      couple
      must
      have
      sex
      (I'm
      probably
      asexual
      and
      while
      I
      think
      it's
      great
      that
      people
      have
      sex,
      I'm
      not
      really
      drawn
      to
      the
      thing
      myself).
      I
      want
      her
      to
      find
      my
      jokes
      funny,
      so
      I
      can
      see
      her
      laugh
      as
      much
      as
      possible.
      It
      would
      be
      great
      if
      she
      loved
      to
      cuddle
      and
      to
      hold
      my
      hand.
      And
      to
      enjoy
      just
      time
      together,
      with
      no
      talking
      and
      just
      admiring
      each
      other's
      presence.
      To
      accept
      that
      I
      don't
      always
      want
      to
      go
      out,
      or
      that
      some
      days
      I
      can't
      get
      out
      of
      bed
      for
      hours,
      even
      if
      I
      want
      to
      get
      up.
      I
      want
      her
      to
      be
      expressing
      her
      feelings,
      worries
      and
      dreams
      comfortably.
      I
      HOPE
      SHE
      WILL
      LET
      ME
      COOK
      AND
      THAT
      SHE
      WILL
      ENJOY
      THE
      FOOD
      I
      MAKE
      FOR
      HER!
      I
      hope
      we
      will
      have
      a
      height
      difference,
      preferably
      if
      she'd
      be
      shorter,
      so
      I
      can
      carry
      her
      bride
      style
      and
      so
      she
      looks
      adorable
      in
      my
      clothing.
      And
      I
      wanna
      make
      her
      feel
      safe
      and
      loved.
      *We
      gotta
      take
      turns
      on
      being
      the
      little
      spoon,
      because
      I
      want
      her
      to
      make
      me
      feel
      safe
      and
      I
      want
      her
      to
      feel
      safe.*
      That
      we
      have
      some
      hobbies
      that
      are
      different
      and
      some
      hobbies
      that
      are
      the
      same.
      So
      we
      can
      do
      the
      things
      that
      we
      both
      love
      together,
      but
      maybe
      have
      some
      separate
      time,
      or
      to
      introduce
      each
      other
      to
      new
      things.
      I'm
      a
      night
      owl,
      I'd
      like
      her
      to
      be
      a
      night
      owl,
      too.
      I'd
      love
      for
      her
      to
      have
      similar
      music
      taste
      to
      me
      I
      have
      a
      weakness
      for
      curly
      hair
      I
      have
      a
      weakness
      for
      dark
      hair
      I
      have
      a
      weakness
      for
      freckles
      ***I
      have
      a
      weakness
      for
      girls***
      I
      just
      hope
      I'm
      good
      enough
      to
      form
      a
      healthy
      relianshionship
      with
      someone

      for

      10
      year
      old
      child
      fat.
      And
      tell
      your
      dad
      to
      not
      call
      him
      fat,
      either.
      Even
      if
      he
      is
      it
      is
      really
      going
      to
      affect
      him
      emotionally,
      ruin
      his
      self-confidence,
      might
      lead
      him
      to
      self-harm
      and
      eating
      disorder
      in
      the
      future,
      because
      even
      his
      own
      brother
      was
      calling
      him
      fat.
      Play
      with
      him
      outside,
      go
      on
      bike
      rides,
      and
      walk
      instead
      of
      driving
      somewhere.
      He
      might
      not
      be
      good
      at
      first,
      he
      might
      be
      too
      slow
      to
      lose
      weight,
      but
      if
      you
      take
      him
      frequently
      he
      might
      get
      faster,
      enjoy
      sports
      more,
      and
      you
      guys
      will
      have
      some
      bonding
      time.
      When
      you
      go
      on
      bike
      rides
      or
      something
      take
      water
      instead
      of
      juice,
      take
      fruits
      instead
      of
      candy
      bars.
      Maybe
      introduce
      him
      to
      some
      healthy
      foods
      that
      are
      really
      tasty,
      to
      show
      him
      that
      not
      only
      junk
      food
      tastes
      good.
      Keep
      your
      snacks
      away
      from
      him
      not
      to
      temp
      him
      with
      it,
      try
      talking
      to
      your
      parents
      and
      express
      your
      concerns,
      convince
      them
      to
      buy
      healthier
      food,
      which
      is
      a
      good
      thing
      for
      all
      of
      you.
      I
      think
      your
      brother
      will
      lose
      some
      weight
      when
      he'll
      reach
      puperty
      and
      will
      start
      growing
      more
      rapidly
      anyway,
      but
      encouraging
      better
      lifestyle
      is
      always
      good.

      Also
      maybe
      try
      shading
      with
      something
      else
      than
      just
      a

      Try
      doing
      a
      hard
      cell
      shading,
      play
      with
      the

      a

      the

      it's
      not

      the

      tool
      too
      big,
      or
      go
      over
      it
      too
      many
      times.
      If
      it
      still
      looks
      too
      harsh,
      don't
      go
      back
      to
      the

      tool
      just

      At
      current
      pace,
      probably
      a
      few
      months
      from
      now.
      The
      devs
      don't
      have
      much
      experience
      with
      Android
      so
      it
      takes
      a
      lot
      more
      time
      to
      implement
      stuff.
      Even
      though
      I
      understand,
      my
      patience
      starts
      to
      wear
      out,
      but
      there's
      really
      nothing
      we
      can
      do
      about
      it.
      I
      really
      wish
      they
      hired
      some
      people
      experienced
      with
      Android
      so
      we
      can
      catch
      up
      just
      a
      little
      bit,
      but
      it's
      all
      up
      to
      the
      devs.

      I
      think
      you
      should
      go
      to
      therapy.
      What
      you
      describe
      now
      reminds
      me
      of
      symptoms
      of
      depression,
      and
      even
      if
      you
      don't
      have
      it,
      it's
      great
      to
      consult
      a
      professional
      anyway.
      Even
      if
      there's
      nothing
      wrong,
      therapy
      can
      help
      you
      deal
      with
      things
      in
      a
      healthy
      way
      and
      improve
      your
      life.

      Oh
      then
      NTA
      it's
      illegal
      for
      both
      of
      you
      to
      smoke
      since
      you're
      both
      under
      21,
      if
      it
      is
      clearly
      a
      blunt,
      then
      you
      guys
      can
      get
      in
      trouble
      and
      he
      should
      delete
      it.
      Not
      letting
      you
      smoke
      is
      ridiculous
      in
      that
      case
      (I
      thought
      you
      live
      somewhere
      in
      Europe
      where
      it's
      legal
      from
      18,
      so
      that
      would
      make
      sense,
      since
      he's
      the
      one
      that
      could
      legally
      get
      it
      and
      if
      your
      parents
      disapprove
      he
      shouldn't
      give
      it
      to
      you),
      because
      technically
      it's
      not
      legal
      for
      him
      to
      smoke
      either.
      But
      you
      lying
      to
      him
      is
      not
      a
      good
      thing
      either.

      The
      funny
      thing
      is
      that
      I
      discovered
      that
      I'm
      gay
      thanks
      to
      yuri.
      The
      girls
      that
      were
      into
      anime
      that
      I
      knew
      preferred
      yaoi
      because
      cute
      boys,
      I
      was
      into
      yuri,
      because
      the
      girls
      were
      cute
      and
      I
      liked
      to
      see
      a
      lesbian
      reliantionship...
      And
      yeah,
      like
      6-12
      months
      later
      I
      knew
      I
      was
      gay...
      **So
      this
      hurts
      even
      more
      why
      can't
      I
      get
      a
      girlfriend**

      to
      certain
      languages,
      too.
      It's

      learn
      a

      But
      honestly
      I
      really
      can't
      think
      of
      a
      sytuation
      when
      I
      friendzoned
      someone.
      There
      is
      one
      possibility,
      when
      a
      friend
      asked
      me
      if
      I
      *liked*
      her,
      and
      I
      said
      that
      I
      really
      think
      she's
      pretty
      and
      wanna
      make
      her
      happy,
      but
      never
      thought
      of
      her
      in
      a
      romantic
      sense,
      though
      I
      think
      she
      asked
      that
      because
      of
      the
      stereotype
      that
      lesbians
      have
      crushes
      on
      their
      female
      friends.
      So
      yeah,
      nobody
      thinks
      of
      me
      being
      romantically
      attractive
      so
      there's
      no
      way
      I
      could
      do
      that.

      Woah,
      that's
      nice!
      I'm
      missing
      stray
      stories
      and
      volume
      20,
      since
      they
      haven't
      been
      translated
      into
      my
      native
      language,
      and
      buying
      in
      English
      is
      really
      pricey
      (~20PLN
      in
      my
      native
      language
      and
       gt;50PLN
      in
      English),
      so
      that's
      a
      bit
      sad,
      anyway
      have
      a
      nice
      read
      mate!

      Volume
      19
      came
      out
      on
      25th
      (read
      it
      today)
      and
      it's
      probably
      gonna
      be
      two
      months
      or
      more
      before
      they
      translate
      volume
      20.
      I
      think
      they
      are
      focused
      on
      translating
      stray
      stories
      for
      now...

      Make

      hide

      it
      out

      trow

      over
      the

      and
      I

      stab

      also
      it'll
      be
      harder
      to
      move.
      And
      then
      just
      have
      his
      hands
      behind
      his
      back
      and
      wait
      for
      the
      police.
      Or
      maybe
      we
      can
      drink
      some
      water
      and
      have
      a
      Bible
      study
      and
      read
      passages
      on
      why
      stealing
      bad
      and
      killing
      is
      a
      no-no
      Also
      i
      can
      just
      give
      him
      20
      dollars
      to
      fuck
      off

      I

      No,
      I'm
      not
      really
      good
      with
      pencils,
      I
      don't
      have
      the
      right
      promarker
      colours,
      and
      this
      paper
      won't
      handle
      any
      kind
      of
      paint.
      Also,
      I
      really
      like
      playing
      around
      with
      the
      tones
      of
      the
      grays(also
      how
      to
      make
      a
      pattern
      that
      will
      appear
      a
      specific
      shade
      of
      gray
      from
      far
      away)

      how
      to
      make
      your
      attention
      go
      to
      the

      I
      want

      to
      without
      any
      colours
      (since
      it's
      easier
      to
      do
      with
      colour).
      Also,
      I
      still
      need
      to
      work
      on
      my
      colour

      If
      my
      computer
      want
      broken,
      I'd
      try
      scanning
      the
      image,
      saving
      it
      as
      png
      and
      then
      coloring
      on
      my
      graphic
      tablet...
      I
      mean,
      it
      would
      be
      nice
      if
      I
      had
      a
      nice
      digital
      program,
      but
      the
      free
      one
      I
      have
      would
      do,
      too...
      Though
      I
      think
      this
      lineart
      is
      a
      bit
      too
      detailed
      for
      coloring
      it
      since
      I
      like
      to
      have
      cleaner
      lineart
      if
      I
      color
      so
      I
      can
      play
      around
      with
      all
      the
      subtle
      textures
      and
      colored
      shading

      I
      do,
      since
      it's
      still
      summer
      vacation!
      Actually
      my

      is
      filled
      with
      black
      and
      white

      I

      a
      new
      computer
      in
      September,
      so
      maybe
      I'll
      have
      quite
      a
      bit
      coloring
      pages

      I

      I
      was
      once
      a
      dog
      person.
      I
      love
      dogs,
      but
      my
      mum
      is
      allergic.
      I
      can't
      have
      a
      dog
      other
      than
      a
      Maltese
      or
      a
      york
      or
      a
      chihuahua,
      and
      I
      like
      dogs
      like
      that,
      but
      not
      I
      kinda
      got
      discouraged.
      Then
      one
      day
      my
      cat
      came.
      You
      know,
      just
      came
      in
      our
      house
      one
      day
      without
      asking.
      And
      he's
      so
      lovely,
      and
      cuddly.
      So
      now
      I'm
      a
      cat
      person,
      because
      cats
      don't
      need
      to
      be
      taken
      out,
      cats
      purr
      and
      just
      simply
      because
      I
      own
      one
      and
      see
      how
      amazing
      cats
      are.
      Maybe
      my
      cat
      is
      not
      throwing
      himself
      on
      me
      whenever
      I
      come
      home,
      but
      he
      always
      comes
      up
      to
      rub
      himself
      on
      my
      leg,
      at
      night
      he
      comes
      to
      my
      room
      and
      sleeps
      by
      my
      side,
      as
      his
      purring
      soothes
      me.
      And
      it's
      nice.

      I
      mean
      he
      is
      as
      far
      from
      a
      communist
      as
      I
      can
      imagine,
      honestly.
      I'm
      not
      American
      and
      cannot
      really
      talk
      about
      politics
      in
      the
      US,
      but
      I
      personally
      am
      more
      on
      the
      liberal
      side.
      I
      also
      think
      that
      politics
      and
      business
      are
      not
      the
      same
      thing,
      and
      I'm
      quite
      worried
      about
      him
      neglecting
      climate
      change.
      Though
      I
      respect
      your
      opinion,
      even
      if
      I
      completely
      disagree.
      It's
      not
      like
      I
      can
      change
      anything
      in
      the
      USA
      from
      a
      different
      continent
      and
      my
      country
      has
      its
      own
      problems
      so
      I
      can't
      really
      judge.

      I
      mean
      I
      live
      in
      Europe,
      in
      a
      country
      where
      pretty
      much
      everyone
      is
      white,
      and
      I
      don't
      see
      green
      or
      grey
      eyes
      too
      often.
      It's
      more
      common
      to
      have
      brown
      or
      blue
      eyes
      here.
      Especially
      brown.
      So
      I
      guess
      green-Grey
      is
      pretty
      rare.
      My
      eyes
      are
      brown,
      with
      a
      bit
      of
      green
      that
      you
      can't
      really
      see
      until
      you
      get
      close.
      So
      I'm
      pretty
      boring
      and
      average.

      The
      shadows
      are
      a
      bit
      too
      blurry,
      maybe
      you
      should
      try
      cell
      shading
      (doing
      that
      red
      or
      pink
      or
      orange
      /any
      other
      colour
      other
      than
      brown
      or
      black
      looks
      really
      nice
      usually).
      Start
      just
      with
      the
      colour
      and
      just
      put
      it
      wherever
      you
      feel
      like
      needs
      a
      shadow
      (if
      you
      don't
      know
      where
      to
      put
      it,
      start
      with
      determining
      where
      the
      light
      source
      is
      and
      thinking
      where
      would
      the
      light
      not
      get
      to)
      now,
      at
      this
      stage
      you
      might
      freak
      out
      that
      it
      looks
      weird,
      but
      don't
      worry,
      just
      play
      with
      the
      opacity
      until
      it
      looks
      okay,
      maybe
      change
      the
      colour
      of
      the
      shadows
      if
      the
      current
      ones
      don't
      really
      speak
      to
      you.
      The
      last
      stem
      is
      to
      blurr
      out
      only
      the
      edges
      of
      the
      cell
      shading,
      or
      not
      at
      all/only
      in
      some
      places.
      Anyway,
      don't
      discourage
      yourself,
      just
      keep
      improving,
      trying
      new
      things,
      practicing
      and
      experimenting.
      And
      have
      fun
      with
      it!

      Around
      7-9,
      when
      my
      dreams
      stopped
      being
      so
      vivid
      or
      I
      stopped
      remembering
      them
      at
      all
      for
      long
      enough
      to
      be
      creeped
      out
      for
      a
      few
      minutes
      to
      a
      level
      that
      I
      needed
      to
      go
      to
      my
      parents
      bed.
      And
      at
      that
      age
      they
      were
      going
      to
      sleep
      before
      me,
      so
      I
      felt
      safe
      because
      they
      would
      protect
      me
      when
      I
      slept
      and
      they
      did
      not.

      NAH.
      It
      was
      a
      simple
      question.
      Sleeping
      with
      your
      child
      every
      night
      when
      the
      kid
      is
      9-14
      is
      really
      fucking
      weird,
      but
      it's
      their
      business,
      their
      children.
      The
      kids
      might
      grow
      up
      to
      be
      really
      dependent
      on
      their
      mothers,
      but
      the
      parents
      are
      the
      ones
      to
      put
      up
      with
      their
      immature
      kids,
      not
      you.
      Though
      maybe
      the
      kids
      will
      be
      fine.
      Maybe
      it's
      good
      for
      them.
      I
      have
      no
      idea.
      I
      don't
      care.
      And
      maybe
      you
      shouldn't
      really
      ask
      too
      much
      about
      it,
      it's
      their
      business
      after
      all.

      I
      would
      honestly
      just
      lay
      around
      for
      3
      weeks,
      and
      just
      do
      nothing
      for
      the
      last
      weeks
      maybe
      say
      goodbye
      to
      a
      couple
      of
      people.
      But
      I'd
      like
      to
      visit
      another
      continent.
      My
      whole
      life
      I
      have
      been
      only
      in
      Europe,
      and
      I'd
      really
      like
      to
      feel
      the
      cultural
      change
      and
      how
      the
      wildlife
      differs.
      I
      don't
      wanna
      go
      knowing
      only
      what
      one
      continent
      looks
      like.
      I'd
      like
      to
      kiss
      a
      girl
      since
      I
      had
      never
      had
      the
      chance
      to
      come
      out
      of
      the
      closet
      and
      have
      a
      girlfriend.
      I'd
      like
      to
      draw
      something
      good
      enough
      for
      a
      frame.
      I'd
      like
      to
      apologize
      to
      everyone
      And
      after
      all,
      I'd
      like
      to
      have
      my
      last
      moments
      to
      myself.
      I
      wouldn't
      want
      anybody
      to
      see
      how
      weak
      I
      would
      be
      at
      my
      last
      moments.

      Thanks
      mate,
      I'm
      trying
      to
      get
      my
      sleep
      cycle
      back
      to
      resemble
      one
      of
      a
      human
      being
      again,
      and
      not
      one
      of
      a
      bat's.
      I'm
      going
      to
      try
      that
      tonight!
      Anyway,
      how
      did
      you
      find
      this
      post
      after
      so
      much
      time?

      I
      don't
      personally
      like
      the
      idea
      of
      having
      to
      live
      though
      every
      week,but
      every
      month
      /6
      months
      or
      3
      months
      sounds
      quite
      fun.
      Especially
      when
      it
      comes
      to
      pregnancy,
      because
      you
      can
      have
      pop-ups
      about
      cravings
      or
      something,
      relianshionships,
      because
      sometimes
      not
      all
      reliantionships
      last
      a
      full
      year.
      Also,
      when
      you're
      in
      school
      and
      have
      to
      keep
      up
      with
      the
      semesters,
      also
      if
      we
      have
      the
      monthly
      mechanic
      you
      can
      have
      summer,
      and
      you
      can
      have
      a
      full
      time
      job
      for
      a
      while.
      Thoigh
      I
      don't
      know
      if
      it
      would
      be
      possible
      to
      pull
      it
      off.
      Nice
      idea,
      though.

      Mooch
      is
      just
      asking
      everybody
      you
      know
      for
      money
      multiple
      times
      in
      a
      lifetime
      and
      not
      killing
      yourself.
      Cat
      lady
      is
      having
      at
      least
      5
      cats,
      if
      a
      cat
      dies,
      replace
      it,
      have
      good
      reliantionships
      with
      your
      cats,
      be
      born
      female,
      don't
      go
      to
      parties,
      meetings
      and
      anything
      social,
      don't
      talk
      to
      your
      family,
      don't
      do
      things
      with
      your
      family
      (to
      uwant
      no
      one
      at
      your
      funeral).
      Don't
      get
      any
      other
      ribbons
      in
      the
      process.
      I
      can't
      get
      family
      guy,
      either...
      For
      houdini
      is
      just
      being
      in
      and
      out
      of
      prison
      all
      the
      time,
      escaping
      and
      then
      getting
      yourself
      caught,
      then
      escaping
      again,
      but
      not
      spending
      too
      much
      time
      in
      there
      overall
      because
      you
      might
      get
      jailbird.
      With
      the
      new
      prison
      update
      its
      gonna
      be
      hard
      if
      you
      get
      into
      a
      max
      security
      prison,
      but
      if
      you're
      on
      Android,
      then
      you
      have
      the
      advantage
      here.

      salt.)
      I
      think
      you
      should
      start
      with
      apologizing,
      explaining
      what
      lead
      you
      to
      bullying
      (since
      most
      bullies
      have
      their
      own
      insecurities
      or
      problems
      that
      lead
      to
      taking
      it
      out
      on
      another
      person,
      I'm
      sure
      you
      have
      something
      like
      that,
      too),
      say
      that
      you
      understand
      that
      these
      reasons
      do
      not
      justify
      anything,
      and
      acknowledge
      what
      person
      you
      were
      back
      then,
      and
      that
      you
      are
      (hopefully)
      different
      now,
      and
      that
      you
      regret
      what
      you
      have
      done.
      Ask
      them
      how
      are
      they
      doing
      now.
      Have
      a
      normal
      talk.
      Again,
      I
      wasn't
      even
      bulied
      in
      school
      nor
      was
      I
      a
      bully
      so
      I
      have
      no
      idea
      what
      neither
      of
      you
      feel
      now
      and
      what
      you
      have
      felt
      back
      then.

      Last

      started

      and
      it's
      really
      awkward
      because
      everybody
      knows
      things
      about

      Okay,
      it's
      called
      the
      same
      in
      Germany
      on
      the
      same
      level,
      so
      I
      was
      confused.
      Is
      it
      like
      in
      Germany,
      that
      you
      get
      a
      choice
      between
      types
      of
      high
      school
      level
      things?
      Like,
      here
      in
      Poland
      we
      have
      liceum
      (wchich
      is
      a
      thing
      you
      go
      to
      if
      you
      wanna
      go
      to
      college,
      and
      I
      think
      it's
      the
      closest
      to
      German
      gymnasium),
      zawod #243;wka
      (wchich
      teaches
      you
      to
      be
      an
      electrician,
      a
      cook,
      or
      a
      hairdresser
      and
      such,
      and
      then
      technikum
      which
      is
      basically
      a
      mix
      of
      both.

      Not
      as
      annoying,
      because
      you
      don't
      hear

      when
      you
      are
      a

      in,
      you
      can't
      hear
      it.
      But
      if
      they
      blast
      it
      from
      the
      speaker
      you

      Okay,
      that
      makes
      sense.
      Here
      it's
      a
      mess
      for
      now
      because
      there
      was
      a
      reform.
      It's
      really
      messy
      and
      I
      can't
      describe
      it
      really
      well,
      but
      it's
      nice
      to
      exchange
      information
      about
      schooling
      in
      different
      countries,
      soo...
      My
      brother
      was
      put
      though
      6
      years
      of
      elementary
      school,
      after
      which
      he
      had
      to
      write
      an
      exam,
      but
      it
      wasn't
      really
      important,
      you
      literally
      can't
      fail
      it
      and
      always
      are
      going
      further.
      3
      years
      of
      gymnasium,
      which
      is
      middle
      school
      for
      some
      reason,
      I
      have
      no
      idea
      why
      they
      named
      it
      that.
      After
      there
      was
      an
      exam,
      mandatory
      Polish
      English/german
      and
      math,
      and
      some
      other
      subjects
      I
      don't
      remember
      what
      exactly.
      And
      I
      think
      that
      is
      where
      mandatory
      education
      ended,
      but
      sometimes
      I'm
      told
      that
      you
      have
      mandatory
      school
      until
      18,
      it's
      confusing.
      3
      years
      of
      liceum/high
      school,
      though
      if
      you
      choose
      technikum
      it's
      4
      years,
      I
      have
      no
      idea
      about
      zawod #243;wka
      since
      I
      don't
      plan
      to
      go
      there
      and
      I
      don't
      really
      care.
      I
      was
      supposed
      to
      have
      the
      same
      system,
      but
      then
      the
      reform
      came,
      it
      affects
      everyone
      born
      in
      2004
      and
      later.
      I
      was
      born
      in
      2005.
      2004
      and
      2005
      are
      really
      fricking
      lab
      rats
      when
      it
      comes
      to
      this
      education
      program
      and
      you
      can't
      convince
      otherwise.
      Also,
      the
      reform
      happened
      right
      when
      2004
      was
      about
      to
      go
      to
      gymnasium.
      So
      now
      there
      are
      8
      years
      of
      elementary
      school
      (and
      in
      September
      I'm
      going
      to
      be
      in
      8th
      grade).
      After
      that,
      you
      write
      an
      exam.
      For
      2004
      and
      2004
      we
      only
      write
      Polish,
      English
      and
      math,
      but
      2006
      and
      later
      years
      are
      going
      to
      be
      writing
      two
      additional
      subjects.
      Your
      scores
      and
      grades
      are
      transferred
      into
      points,
      which
      are
      necessary
      to
      get
      into
      high
      school.
      Then
      4
      years
      of
      liceum/5
      years
      of
      technikum/whatever+1
      years
      of
      zawod #243;wka
      This
      is
      actually
      the
      system
      my
      parents
      were
      put
      though.
      It
      was
      changed
      because
      putting
      13-16
      year
      olds
      in
      a
      building
      together
      was
      not
      a
      good
      idea,
      so
      the
      government
      decided
      to
      turn
      back
      to
      the
      way
      it
      used
      to
      be.
      It
      created
      a
      sytuation
      when
      both
      2003
      and
      2004
      are
      going
      to
      high
      school
      in
      the
      same
      year,
      and
      are
      going
      to
      be
      taught
      two
      different
      curriculums
      at
      the
      same
      time.
      But
      schools
      don't
      have
      enough
      space,
      so
      each
      individual
      student
      from
      both
      years
      gets
      less
      chance
      to
      get
      into
      a
      high
      school
      they
      want
      to
      than
      the
      year
      2002,
      for
      example.
      Anyway,
      sorry
      for
      this
      reply
      being
      so
      long.
      It's
      probably
      not
      too
      interesting
      and
      quite
      messy.
      Anyway,
      I
      have
      a
      question
      :
      Do
      you
      have
      the
      same
      class
      of
      20/30
      people
      for
      all
      subjects?
      Or
      almost
      all.
      Because
      here
      on
      every
      step
      of
      education
      you
      are
      with
      the
      same
      20-30
      group
      of
      people,
      maybe
      some
      classes
      like
      foreign
      languages,
      ICT
      or
      PE
      are
      split
      into
      groups
      so
      it's
      easier
      to
      learn,
      and
      in
      case
      of
      PE,
      it's
      split
      by
      gender
      sometimes.

      Hey,
      it
      doesn't
      matter
      why
      someone
      needs
      to
      go
      to
      therapy,
      people
      have
      it
      worse,
      but
      they
      have
      it
      better,
      too.
      And
      they
      still
      have
      the
      right
      to
      not
      feel
      okay.
      They
      still
      have
      the
      right
      to
      seek
      help.
      There's
      always
      someone
      who
      has
      it
      worse,
      if
      everyone
      who
      needed
      help
      felt
      bad
      about
      it,
      no
      one
      would
      get
      help.
      You're
      not
      selfish,
      stupid
      or
      needy
      just
      because
      you
      wanna
      be
      okay.
      You
      don't
      need
      a
      reason
      to
      validate
      yourself.
      Sometimes
      it
      just
      happens.
      Sometimes
      the
      chemicals
      in
      your
      brain
      get
      fucked
      up,
      sometimes
      being
      too
      empathetic
      breaks
      you,
      sometimes
      you're
      scared
      abouy
      your
      future,
      and
      future
      of
      everybody
      else.
      Sometimes
      nothing
      goes
      well
      and
      you
      feel
      like
      you
      don't
      deserve
      air.
      Like
      you
      don't
      deserve
      food,
      water
      or
      clothes.
      Like
      your
      existence
      is
      unnecessary
      and
      it
      would
      all
      be
      better
      if
      you
      just
      disappeared
      one
      day
      and
      everything
      would
      be
      alright.
      Sometimes
      you
      feel
      guilty
      because
      of
      simple
      things
      that
      would
      make
      someone
      so
      damn
      happy,
      and
      you
      just
      have
      it.
      And
      even
      though
      you
      appreciate
      it
      all,
      you
      think
      that
      someone
      could
      put
      better
      use
      to
      it,
      that
      someone
      deserves
      it
      more.
      There
      does
      not
      need
      to
      be
      a
      reason
      for
      you
      to
      want
      to
      feel
      better.
      And
      it
      doesn't
      matter
      that
      the
      world
      is
      on
      fire,
      because
      if
      you
      live
      on
      and
      are
      better,
      if
      you
      live
      another
      day,
      go
      to
      therapy
      and
      set
      aside
      the
      guilt,
      with
      the
      things
      you
      have,
      you
      could
      change
      things
      for
      the
      people
      who
      don't
      have
      them.
      The
      world
      is
      a
      scary
      place,
      especially
      now,
      but
      maybe
      you
      could
      be
      the
      one
      who
      makes
      it
      a
      bit
      less
      scary.
      At
      least
      for
      one
      person.
      You
      don't
      have
      to
      be
      the
      best,
      you
      don't
      have
      to
      have
      a
      lot
      of
      influence,
      but
      if
      you
      make
      just
      one
      person
      feel
      like
      they
      are
      a
      bit
      less
      scared,
      it's
      priceless.
      But
      first
      of
      all,
      you
      should
      regularly
      go
      to
      therapy.
      And
      don't
      beat
      yourself
      up,
      thinking
      that
      you
      don't
      have
      a
      reason
      to
      be
      there.
      The
      reason
      doesn't
      matter,
      what
      matters
      is
      your
      well
      being.
      I
      know
      it's
      always
      easier
      said
      than
      done,
      but
      try
      to
      set
      aside
      the
      guilt,
      because
      there's
      no
      reason
      to
      feel
      like
      you
      should
      be
      happy,
      and
      like
      you
      are
      a
      waste.
      Just
      please,
      live
      on
      and
      try
      to
      get
      better.
      And
      one
      day
      you
      maybe
      will
      be
      able
      to
      make
      things
      better
      for
      someone,
      and
      see
      a
      smile
      on
      their
      face.
      And
      you'll
      know
      that
      it
      all
      wasn't
      for
      nothing.
      Please
      just
      try
      therapy
      once
      again,
      calm
      down
      and
      don't
      rush
      yourself.
      Wait
      for
      what
      another
      day
      brings
      and
      act
      accordingly.
      But
      don't
      give
      up
      on
      therapy,
      don't
      give
      up
      on
      yourself,
      don't
      beat
      yourself
      up
      because
      you
      should
      be
      happy
      but
      aren't
      and
      feel
      like
      you
      don't
      deserve
      the
      life
      you
      have.
      I
      don't
      promise
      it
      will
      get
      better,
      but
      with
      just
      a
      little
      bit
      of
      effort,
      it
      might.

      Apparently
      guys
      are
      not
      able
      to
      keep
      their
      cool
      at
      the
      sight
      of
      a
      shoulder.
      They
      just
      immediately
      can't
      think
      and
      are
      only
      left
      with
      their
      instincts
      alone,
      and
      can't
      control
      a
      single
      part
      of
      their
      body.
      Thank
      god
      the
      people
      writing
      dress
      codes
      thought
      about
      it,
      otherwise,
      the
      whole
      school
      would
      be
      flooding
      with
      these
      mindless,
      lustful
      animals!
      Seriously
      though,
      if
      I
      were
      a
      boy
      I'd
      be
      so
      offended,
      like,
      I
      know
      that
      male
      puperty
      is
      quite
      tough
      and
      teenagers
      are
      horny
      creatures,
      but
      shoulders
      and
      knees
      aren't
      even
      that
      much
      anyway,
      and
      also
      guys
      have
      minds
      and
      free
      will,
      they
      aren't
      animals
      at
      sight
      of
      a
      knee.
      They
      don't
      get
      horny
      to
      the
      point
      of
      not
      thinking
      at
      all
      when
      they
      see
      a
      shoulder.
      They
      can
      control
      themselves.
      I'm
      a
      girl
      with
      much
      insecurities,
      so
      I
      don't
      show
      much
      skin
      anyway,
      but
      the
      dress
      codes
      are
      ridiculous
      and
      really
      only
      girls
      are
      told
      what
      to
      wear.
      They
      can't
      show
      their
      styles,
      they
      can't
      show
      off
      the
      things
      about
      their
      bodies
      they
      are
      proud
      of.
      They
      can't
      wear
      clothes
      that
      would
      make
      the
      heat
      less
      unbearable
      in
      the
      summer.
      And
      when
      it
      is
      noticed
      that
      your
      shorts
      might
      be
      too
      short,
      and
      you
      are
      brought
      over
      to
      the
      front
      and
      it
      is
      measured
      if
      the
      length
      is
      right,
      it's
      so
      embarrassing
      and
      it
      feels
      like
      you're
      a
      slut
      when
      your
      shorts
      violate
      the
      dress
      code,
      when
      you
      just
      wanted
      to
      not
      die
      because
      of
      the
      heat
      in
      a
      school
      that
      has
      no
      AC.
      Also
      the
      people
      that
      write
      them
      are
      creeps.
      Like,
      it's
      kind
      of
      sexualizing
      a
      12
      year
      old,
      because
      she
      wears
      a
      tank
      top.
      Telling
      her
      she's
      a
      sexual
      object
      now
      that
      she
      has
      shown
      her
      knees,
      while
      the
      boys
      don't
      even
      care
      at
      that
      point.
      Teachers
      measuring
      the
      length
      of
      your
      skirt
      or
      noticing
      that
      your
      bra
      strap
      is
      showing
      is
      quite
      creepy,
      too.

      that
      you

      want
      to
      talk
      about
      your
      reasons.
      Anyway
      congratulations
      and
      I
      hope
      you
      guys
      will
      have
      a
      happy
      marriage!

      I'm
      a

      all

      Maybe
      you
      don't.
      You
      probably
      don't.
      Don't
      blame
      yourself
      and
      beat
      yourself
      up
      thinking
      that
      you
      deserved
      it.
      I

      someone
      came
      and
      shot
      you,
      you
      wouldn't
      be
      thinking
      'maybe
      I

      *gets

      Yeah,
      I
      deserve
      it.
      No,
      but
      really
      mate,
      sitting
      around
      won't
      make
      anything
      better.
      Just
      crying
      over
      how
      you're
      a
      bad
      person
      that
      deserves
      things
      (wchich
      you

      try

      be
      a
      better
      person
      who
      wouldn't

      better
      for
      those

      you

      Help
      people
      with
      homework
      if
      you
      know
      how

      do
      it,
      make
      people
      laugh.
      Comfort
      someone
      who's
      crying,
      be
      grateful
      to
      people.
      I'm
      sure
      you
      can
      do
      good
      things,
      but
      if
      you're
      just
      crying
      over
      yourself
      saying
      that
      you
      deserve
      everything
      bad,
      you
      might
      do
      only
      that
      at
      some
      point,
      and
      it's
      not
      worth
      it.
      If
      you
      think
      you're
      bad,
      try
      to
      be
      better.
      And
      maybe
      visit
      a
      therapist,
      and
      maybe
      one
      day
      you
      won't
      think
      so
      bad
      of
      yourself.

      I
      have
      actually,
      it
      wasn't
      me,
      because
      I
      cover
      every
      inch
      of
      my
      skin
      and
      wear
      baggy
      clothes,
      but
      a
      girl
      in
      my
      school
      was
      made
      fun
      of
      because
      of
      her
      big
      boobs.
      Though
      she
      was
      really
      confident,
      and
      also
      it
      never
      got
      too
      far.
      But
      I
      myself
      am
      very
      insecure
      about
      having
      chest
      larger
      than
      most
      girls
      my
      age,
      and
      some
      girls
      are
      insecure
      about
      having
      their
      chests
      small.

      I

      think

      girls

      I
      stick
      out
      a

      And
      I
      have
      more
      fat
      overall,
      not
      just
      on
      my
      chest,
      wchich
      I'm
      Hella
      insecure
      about.
      In
      the
      media,
      when
      you
      really
      look
      at
      it,
      most
      women
      considered
      attractive
      have
      smaller
      chests,
      and
      are
      overall
      skinny.
      (and
      can
      wear
      backless
      and
      strapless
      tops
      or

      What
      how
      often?
      The
      being
      scolded
      about
      dress
      code
      when
      you
      don't
      violate
      the
      dress
      code?
      Or
      being
      teased
      about
      having
      big/small
      boobs?

      Fortunately
      less
      often
      nowadays,
      but
      I
      have
      a
      girl
      in
      my
      school
      that's
      teased
      about

      Yeah,
      me
      too.
      Though
      I
      am
      a
      bit
      of
      a
      gal
      that
      would
      really
      like
      a
      small
      titty
      gf,
      but
      maybe
      it's
      because
      I
      search
      for
      things
      I
      always
      wanted
      to
      have
      but
      never
      got
      in
      a
      partner...
      Well
      shit
      that's
      unhealthy
      and
      I
      should
      fix
      that
      before
      I
      get
      in
      a
      reliantionship.

      Yeah,
      but
      a
      lot
      of
      things
      I
      want
      in
      a
      girlfriend
      are
      things
      I
      always
      wanted
      in
      myself,
      like
      dark
      and
      curly
      hair,
      freckles
      (so
      damn
      cute
      hehdhfjrjrhrh),
      more
      on
      the
      skinny
      side
      and
      stuff
      like
      that
      and
      I'm
      quite
      afraid
      that
      if
      I
      get
      in
      a
      reliantionship
      I
      will
      expect
      her
      to
      fill
      my
      expectations
      about
      myself
      that
      I
      wasn't
      able
      to
      fulfill
      and
      that's
      quite
      scary.
      Though
      I
      guess
      I
      shouldn't
      really
      talk
      about
      that
      on
      a
      reddit
      thread
      about
      boob
      sizes.

      Honestly
      always

      in
      my

      and
      if
      there
      was,
      it's
      too
      expensive
      for
      me...

      imagine
      that
      if
      so
      many
      people
      like

      they

      I'm
      asexual
      homoromantic
      and
      I'm
      quite
      hurt
      by
      ho
      some
      exclude
      us
      and
      tell
      us
      we're
      not
      valid.
      We
      are
      s
      valid
      as
      everyone
      else
      in
      the
      community,
      and
      so
      are
      bi
      and
      non
      binary
      people.
      asexuals
      still
      get
      discriminated
      ,just
      not
      by
      religion.
      All
      the
      years
      of
      thinking
      you're
      sick
      and
      broken
      just
      so
      when
      you
      find
      out
      that
      other
      people
      feel
      the
      same
      way
      ,people
      tell
      you
      ther
      is
      probably
      something
      wrong
      with
      your
      hormones,
      that
      it's
      going
      to
      change
      ,that
      your
      romantic
      and
      sexual
      orientation
      has
      to
      align.
      And
      people
      belitelling
      you
      ,teling
      you
      that
      you
      do
      not
      know
      anything
      because
      'you
      have
      not
      tried
      good
      dick/pussy
      yet'.
      People
      wanting
      to
      rape
      you
      just
      so
      you
      stop
      rabling
      about
      your
      sexuality
      when
      you
      did
      not
      even
      finish
      saying
      asexual.
      Fearing
      that
      you
      will
      never
      find
      a
      partner
      ,because
      who
      the
      hell
      could
      accept
      who
      you
      are?
      Why
      can't
      we
      just
      be
      accepted
      like
      everyone
      else?
      Bisexual
      is
      literally
      written
      into
      the
      acronim.
      Like
      what
      the
      fuck
      do
      they
      think
      'B'
      in
      'LGBT+'
      stands
      for?
      Beer?
      Bees?
      Barry?
      Bear?
      Bikini
      Bottom?
      Non
      -binary
      people
      deserve
      to
      be
      validated
      and
      loved
      ,they
      expierence
      disphoria
      if
      you
      tell
      them
      they
      are
      female.
      And
      they
      expierience
      disphoria
      when
      they
      are
      told
      they
      are
      male.
      Again
      ,I
      am
      cis
      female
      ,but
      I
      still
      have
      heard
      a
      lot
      of
      non
      binary
      people
      talking
      about
      it
      ,but
      f
      I
      got
      something
      wrong

      am
      sorry
      ,feel
      free
      to
      correct
      me.
      It
      hurts
      when
      a
      community
      that
      you
      were
      supposed
      to
      feel
      safe
      and
      valid

      you
      ,insults
      you,
      tels
      you
      you
      are
      a
      cishet
      that
      just
      wants
      to
      feel
      special.
      That
      you
      do
      not
      expierience
      discrimination.
      That
      you
      do
      not
      know
      what
      you
      are
      talking
      about.
      That
      you
      want
      to
      have
      a
      cake
      and
      eat
      it
      too.

      Sorry
      if
      there

      my

      Honestly,
      I
      always
      did.
      I
      mean
      ,my
      whole
      life
      English
      was
      everywhere,
      I
      was
      learning
      it
      since
      kindergarten.
      There
      are
      so
      many
      opportunities
      for
      you
      if
      you
      know
      English,
      and
      I
      did
      not
      want
      to
      miss
      out
      on
      them.
      And
      it
      turned
      out
      that
      I
      really
      like
      learning
      new
      languages.
      Also
      it's
      easier
      to
      travel
      if
      you
      know
      english,
      it
      is
      nice
      to
      understand
      what
      is
      written
      on
      the
      clothes
      you
      are
      wearing
      ,to
      understand
      the
      lyrics
      of
      a
      song
      without
      needing
      to
      check
      sketchy
      sites
      for
      a
      tranlation.
      It
      is
      just
      useful.

      I
      don't
      thik
      that
      you
      complimenting
      her
      is
      bad
      ,as
      long
      as
      your
      only
      intention
      is
      to
      make
      herhappy
      and
      feel
      better
      about
      herself.
      But
      if
      in
      the
      back
      of
      your
      head
      ,you
      want
      to
      get
      back
      together
      ,and
      compliment
      with
      intent
      of
      that
      ,that
      is
      quite
      scummy.
      Also
      ,having
      the
      goal
      as
      geting
      back
      together
      when
      she
      sees
      you
      as
      a
      friend
      is
      a
      bit
      scummy
      as
      well,
      but
      sometimes
      you
      can't
      help
      it,
      so
      I
      totally
      get
      it.
      I
      think
      you
      should
      let
      go
      a
      bit.
      Maybe
      if
      you
      work
      on
      erasing
      the
      possibility
      of
      getting
      back
      together
      from
      your
      mind
      and
      focus
      on
      friendship
      will
      make
      you
      less
      anxious.
      Your
      well-being
      is
      very
      important
      ,too.
      If
      you
      ever
      feel
      like
      the
      longing
      for
      a
      romantic
      relianshionship
      becomes
      too
      strong
      ,there
      is
      nothing
      wrong
      with
      stepping
      back
      and
      having
      a
      bit
      of
      a
      break
      from
      her
      and
      hanging
      out
      with
      other
      friends
      more.
      Just
      to
      think
      over
      some
      things.
      Anyway
      ,I
      am
      really
      not
      expierienced
      nor
      qualified
      ,so
      take
      all
      of
      that
      ith
      a
      grain
      of
      salt
      and
      think
      over
      what
      is
      the
      best
      for
      you

      went
      out.
      while
      walking
      to
      the
      town
      centre
      ,a
      thunderstorm
      started.
      every
      street
      looked
      like
      a
      river.
      I
      as
      completely
      soaked
      in
      a
      metter
      of
      seconds.
      My
      phone
      was
      a
      bit
      wet
      ,since
      the
      water
      went
      though
      my
      bag.
      It
      was
      not
      too
      concerning.
      Until
      about
      30
      minutes
      later
      it
      just
      broke
      and
      turned
      off.
      It
      was
      starting
      to
      get
      dark,
      my
      mum
      could
      not
      pick
      me
      up
      nor
      have
      any
      contact
      with
      me.
      I
      was
      cold
      as
      shit.
      And
      still
      raining
      cats
      and
      dogs.
      I
      had
      no
      way
      to
      check
      time
      ,so
      could
      not
      know
      when
      the
      next
      bus
      was
      coming.
      Barely
      got
      home.
      Got
      yelled
      at.
      My
      phone
      is
      still
      broken.
      I
      am
      writing
      this
      from
      an
      old
      laptop
      that
      is
      monolangual.

      a
      56
      year
      old
      conservative

      prick,
      yet
      he
      claimed
      it
      was
      because
      of
      money.
      His

      moved
      out
      and

      him
      after
      he
      was
      beating

      kids
      ,but
      claims
      he
      just
      does
      gods
      work.
      He
      is
      now
      only
      showing
      up
      at
      his
      brothers
      thanksgivibg
      diner
      and
      ruins

      he
      wasnt
      invited
      he
      came
      to
      his
      brothers
      house
      at
      3
      am
      blackout
      drunk,
      screaming
      and
      destroying
      everything.
      Spends
      all
      day
      sitting
      on
      his
      ass
      and
      bitching
      about
      everything
      since
      deborah
      was
      ordered
      to
      pay
      alimony.

      The

      Now
      ,the
      testimony
      of
      the
      defendant
      does
      not
      make
      it
      *impossible*
      for

      to
      be
      the
      one
      who
      made
      the
      meme
      either.
      When
      I
      asked
      the
      defence
      if
      [u/fxckjxff](https://www.reddit.com/user/fxckjxff/)
      could
      recall
      what
      page
      did
      he
      take
      the
      meme
      from
      ,the
      answer
      was:
       gt;He
      was
      unable
      these
      were
      his
      exact
      words:
      "I
      had
      found
      it
      on
      a
      Facebook
      page
      around
      2
      months
      prior"
      Now,
      the
      original
      meme
      *was
      posted
      on

      7th,
      the

      August
      29th*
      ,which
      is
      **about
      two
      months.**
      The
      defendant's
      tentimony
      proves
      that
      my
      client
      is
      the
      one
      who
      made
      the
      meme.
      However,
      I
      *do*
      *believe*
      that
      [u/fxckjxff](https://www.reddit.com/user/fxckjxff/)
      stole
      the
      meme
      from
      a
      facebook
      page,
      and
      that
      the
      facebook
      page
      was
      the
      original
      thief.
      There
      is
      no
      evidence
      ^(beyond
      the
      reasonable
      doubt),
      that
      my
      client
      stole
      the
      meme
      from

      Your
      honour,
      ladies,
      gentlemen,
      dogs
      in
      shoes,
      the
      burger
      salesman,
      and
      everybody
      gathered.
      This
      case
      ^(even
      though
      it
      was
      my
      first
      one)
      was
      the
      most
      messy
      case
      I
      have
      ever
      covered.
      There
      were
      turns
      ,and
      it
      was
      very
      difficult
      to
      determine
      what
      was
      the
      truth.
      But,
      as
      you
      can
      see
      in
      the
      screenshots
      provided
      in
      my
      last
      agument
      ,there
      is
      evidence
      that
      my
      client
      made
      the
      meme
      and
      has
      not
      stolen
      it.Furthermore,
      the
      defendant's
      statements
      further
      ensure
      me
      in
      the
      fact
      that
      my
      client
      was
      the
      one
      that
      made
      the
      meme.
      Every
      piece
      of
      evidence
      does
      align
      ,and
      there
      is
      no
      proof
      that
      on
      any
      facebook
      meme
      site
      u/HappyAccident
      's
      meme
      was
      present
      before
      the
      day
      and
      time
      of
      July
      7th,
      2019
      at
      7:14
      AM
      (central
      european
      summer
      time),
      discrediting
      the
      accusation
      that
      my
      client
      has
      comitted
      a
      thevery.
      Taking
      all
      of
      that
      in
      account,
      I
      think
      the
      defendant
      is
      guilty
      of:
      *
      ~~shamelessly
      stealing
      my
      client's
      meme~~
      (indirect)
      thievery
      from
      my
      client,
      creating
      damage
      of
      18k
      karma
      *
      not
      responfding
      to
      my
      client's
      messages
      *
      reposting
      form
      facebook
      which
      are
      all
      terrible
      felonies.
      And
      I
      believe
      that
      the
      only
      possible
      way
      to
      pay
      for
      that
      would
      be:
      *
      1,5
      hours
      of
      responding
      to
      every
      r/AskReddit
      post
      (sorting
      by
      new),
      excluding
      the
      ones
      tagged
      'serious'
      *
      saying
      'sorry'
      nicely
      both
      to
      my
      client
      directly
      and
      in
      the
      comments
      of
      one
      of
      his
      posts
      *
      making
      five
      memes
      (providing
      proof
      that
      he
      was
      the
      person
      that
      made
      them)
      that
      will
      get
      more
      than
      7
      upvotes
      *
      ^(making
      the
      judge
      give
      me
      some
      of
      that
      pieee)
      These
      are
      suggestions
      of
      course
      ,I
      am
      not
      a
      judge..^(.yet)
      Anyway,
      I
      think
      my
      client
      has
      suferred
      enough
      ,being
      accused
      of
      felony
      hen
      he
      is
      undoubtebly
      the
      victim
      ,and
      deserves
      justice.
      Becase
      that
      is
      what
      he
      subreditt
      is
      for.
       #8203;
      That
      is
      all
      from
      me,
      your
      honour

      can
      I

      Limit
      it
      to
      1/2
      walls
      ,add
      some
      cork
      boards,
      put
      some
      art
      in
      frames.
      You
      might
      wanna
      cluster
      the
      posters
      with
      a
      bit
      of
      overlap
      ,making
      it
      all
      lay
      as
      flat
      as
      possible,giving
      a
      wallpaper
      effect.
      And
      all
      of
      the
      other
      walls
      would
      really
      look
      nice
      painted
      a
      light
      grey
      or
      something.
      I
      suggest
      you
      to
      look
      out
      for
      a
      comon
      colours
      and
      get
      some
      decorations
      in
      that
      colours.
      Like
      ,if
      almost
      all
      posters
      have
      a
      navy
      blue
      and
      red
      thing
      ,get
      some
      red
      and
      navy
      decorations
      Also
      maybe
      add
      a
      big
      mirror
      that
      will
      reflect
      a
      wall
      witgout
      anything
      ,which
      will
      make
      the
      room
      look
      even
      less
      clustered
      ,more
      clean

      grey

      If
      the
      wedding
      is
      all
      planned
      and
      you
      have
      confirmed
      that
      you
      would
      go
      then
      YTA,
      because
      she
      found
      you
      significant
      enough
      to
      pay
      the
      seat
      you
      would
      seat
      on
      and
      the
      food
      you
      would
      eat.
      She
      paid
      for
      it,
      and
      you
      not
      showing
      up
      would
      be
      rude.
      She
      thought
      about
      you
      when
      inviting
      people
      to
      the
      wedding.
      If
      you
      have
      not
      a
      100%
      confirmed
      and
      she
      has
      not
      paid
      for
      that
      shit
      yet
      then
      just
      skip
      it
      and
      there
      would
      be
      NAH.

      Hmmm...
      Yeah
      I
      think
      that
      if
      you

      do

      apology
      asap
      and
      send
      some
      cash
      later
      I
      think
      it
      will
      be

      I
      don
      not
      eat
      in
      school
      anyway
      ,since
      I
      am
      not
      hungry
      in
      the
      morning,
      my
      school
      does
      not
      have
      lunches
      for
      everyone,
      ypu
      bring
      ypur
      own
      food
      and
      usually
      I
      would
      just
      buy
      a
      breadroll
      or
      two.
      So
      I
      am
      really
      saving
      some
      money
      before
      and
      after
      school
      on
      food.
      I
      go
      two
      days
      fasting,
      then
      one
      day
      one
      meal
      ,one
      day
      fasting
      again
      ,one
      day
      one
      meal
      again
      ,then
      for
      the
      weekend
      I
      will
      eat
      three
      small
      meals
      and
      a
      little
      snack
      ,but
      all
      still
      below
      the
      calory
      intake
      suggested
      ,so
      I
      do
      not
      yo-yo
      .
      I
      just
      started,
      and
      I
      am
      going
      to
      do
      it
      for
      a
      week
      or
      two
      ,then
      slowly
      implement
      some
      food
      into
      my
      life
      ,but
      still
      make
      sure
      not
      to
      put
      on
      weight
      too
      fast.
      And
      then
      I
      will
      do
      the
      same
      thing
      when
      I
      feel
      like
      a
      fat
      mess
      and
      will
      need
      some
      weightloss
      and
      control
      in
      my
      life.
      Doing
      the
      one
      day
      one
      meal
      thing
      just

      Yeah.
      Neither

      pride.
      If

      support

      LGBT
      community
      you
      can

      yput
      straightness

      Yes,
      people
      like
      that
      exist
      and
      are
      really
      ridiculous
      for
      calling
      staright
      people
      homophoplbic
      because
      they
      don't
      want
      to
      date
      them.
      It
      is
      kind
      of
      like
      nice
      guys
      saying
      they're
      nice
      and
      the
      moment
      you
      reject
      them
      they
      call
      you
      a
      whore
      ,but
      with
      extra
      shame
      and
      extra
      panic
      ,
      because
      then
      you
      wonder
      if
      you
      are
      homophobic,
      even
      though
      the
      obvious
      answer
      is
      no.
      Still
      ,
      I
      think
      that
      you
      just
      have
      to
      understand
      that
      not
      of
      all
      them
      are
      like
      that.
      I
      mean,
      if
      you
      went
      and
      organised
      a
      straight
      pride
      now,
      I
      wouldn't
      come
      since
      I
      would
      obviously
      not
      be
      wanted
      there,
      but
      I
      would
      throw
      bottles
      and
      fireworks
      at
      you
      and
      scream
      that
      you
      are
      sick
      and
      not
      wanted
      here(which
      happend
      at
      the
      last
      pride
      parade
      in
      my
      country,
      in
      America
      the
      parades
      are
      a
      lot
      nicer,I
      think).
      I
      would
      just
      think
      it's
      pointless
      and
      stupid.
      And
      kind
      of
      one
      upping
      the
      LGBT
      just
      for
      the
      sake
      of
      it.
      But
      hey,
      if
      you
      want
      to
      orginize
      it,
      go
      on.
      I
      can't
      stop
      you
      I
      still
      think
      it's
      pointless
      and
      like
      white
      history
      month
      ,when
      every
      other
      month
      you
      have
      white
      history.

      I
      am
      so
      tired
      I
      just
      want
      to
      disapear
      just
      so
      I
      can
      have
      a
      day
      off
      it
      all...
      Also
      I
      have
      PE
      in
      the
      mornings
      and
      I
      smell
      really
      bad

      Honestly
      I
      feel
      like
      I
      just
      want
      to
      disapear
      and
      never
      bother
      another
      being
      again
      ,
      and
      if
      I
      killed
      myself
      the
      funeral
      would
      have
      to
      be
      handled
      and
      everyone
      would
      be
      annoyed
      because
      if
      someone
      kills
      themselves
      the
      school
      will
      go
      through
      a
      shitty
      suicide
      prevention
      program
      that
      just
      feels
      intrusive
      and
      akward
      and
      it
      would
      be
      my
      fault.
      Also
      people
      would
      have
      to
      pretend
      they
      care
      to
      not
      seem
      like
      they
      have
      no
      empathy.
      So
      yeah.
      Just
      disapearing
      wpuld
      be
      nice

      try
      to
      have
      a

      Well
      shit
      can
      I
      go
      back
      to
      sleep
      or...
      I
      never
      felt
      this
      confused
      ever
      before!
      Where
      am
      I?
      What
      am
      I
      here
      for?
      Did
      I
      sleep
      quietly
      or
      did
      i
      snore?
      What
      was
      the
      place
      of
      origin
      of
      that
      nickel?
      I
      did
      not
      have
      that
      before;
      won't
      comment
      this
      pickle...
      Why
      do
      I
      feel
      so
      strange
      and
      what
      is
      that
      tickle?
      Also,
      where
      did
      I
      put
      my
      sickle?
      I'll
      get
      out
      of
      here,
      I'll
      climb
      the
      trees...
      Well...
      are
      there
      still
      trees?
      Are
      there
      still
      bees?
      I
      want
      to
      get
      out,
      but
      I
      can't
      find
      the
      keys!
      I'm
      kind
      of
      hungry,
      maybe
      there
      is
      a
      can
      of
      peas...

      No,
      but
      you
      really
      have
      to
      prepare
      what
      ypu
      will
      say
      and
      do
      when
      she
      says
      no.
      I
      really,
      really
      hope
      she
      says
      yes.
      But
      if
      she
      says
      no
      ypu
      have
      tp
      be
      prepared,
      because
      you
      are
      going
      to
      be
      really
      hurt.
      If
      she
      says
      yes
      you
      also
      have
      to
      know
      what
      to
      do
      just
      to
      not
      make
      things
      akward
      in
      your
      new
      relianshionship.
      Also
      she
      may
      say
      she
      needs
      time.
      So
      don't
      pressure
      ger
      if
      she
      says
      she
      has
      to
      thi
      k
      it
      over.
      Remember

      for

      but
      I
      still
      remember
      how
      it
      felt
      like.
      I
      am
      really
      tempted
      to
      do
      that
      again,

      upper

      as

      because
      even
      that
      is
      really
      hard
