      I
      am
      getting
      a
      bearded
      dragon
      in
      a
      two
      weeks
      and
      I
      was
      wondering
      if
      there
      are
      alternatives
      to
      crickets.
      Also
      is
      it
      okay
      for
      me
      to
      feed
      them
      meal
      worms
      instead
      of
      crickets.
      I
      know
      there
      are
      some
      controversies
      on
      this
      but
      I
      feel
      that
      I
      should
      ask
      anyways.
      This
      is
      my
      very
      first
      time
      keeping
      a
      reptile
      but
      I
      do
      still
      know
      a
      lot
      about
      them.

      I
      can
      communicate
      with
      animals.
      I
      promise
      I #8217;m
      not
      crazy.
      I
      was
      on
      a
      field
      trip
      and
      this
      Seagull
      was
      flying
      above
      us
      and
      following
      us
      around.
      I
      decided
      to
      say
      hi
      and
      it
      sealed
      back.
      Then
      it
      landed
      in
      front
      of
      me
      and
      I
      offered
      it
      some
      food.
      Again
      I
      promise
      I #8217;m
      not
      crazy.
      I
      began
      to
      realize
      that
      this
      sort
      of
      thing
      doesn #8217;t
      happen
      to
      anyone
      else
      when
      the
      entire
      6th,
      7th,
      and
      the
      rest
      of
      my
      8th
      grade
      class
      was
      staring
      at
      me
      and
      my
      best
      friend
      said
       #8220;Madison,
      did
      you
      just
      talk
      to
      a
      fucking
      seagull #8221;.

      Punching

      Asking

      in
      my

      class.
      My

      always
      says
       #8220;Any
      questions #8221;
      with
      the
      most
      sweet
      voice
      during
      a

      If
      you
      actually
      ask
      a
      question
      she
      looks
      at
      you
      with
      the
      most
      terrifying
      look
      until
      you
      look
      away.
      She
      then
      precedes
      with
      the
      lesson
      with
      her
      sweet
      voice.

      No
      he/she
      eats
      insects
      and
      veggies.
      I
      feed
      him/
      her
      insects
      in
      the
      morning
      and
      sometimes

      I
      feed
      him/her
      veggies
      in
      the
      evening.
      He/she
      is
      about
      two
      months
      old
      so
      I
      can #8217;t
      sex
      yet.
      Also
      yesterday
      he
      ate
      a
      hornworm.

      he/she

      I

      trying
      the
      things
      you

      Yeah
      I
      did
      actually
      get
      him
      from
      a
      chain
      pet
      store.
      I
      didn #8217;t
      want
      to
      but
      my
      Mom
      wouldn #8217;t
      buy
      from
      anywhere
      else
      as
      all
      of
      the
      other
      places
      were
       #8220;sketchy #8221;.
      That
      was
      actually
      his
      first
      time
      eating
      a
      hornworm
      and
      there
      was
      a
      second
      when
      he
      backed
      away
      and
      looked
      at
      me
      like
       #8220;well
      are
      you
      going

      Yeah
      he
      was
      in
      another
      tank
      with
      six
      others
      and
      so
      I
      put
      my
      hand
      in
      and
      which
      ever
      one
      jumped
      on
      first
      would
      be
      the
      one
      I
      would
      take
      home.
      He
      jumped
      on
      and
      then
      refused
      to
      be
      put
      into
      a
      temporary
      carrier
      so
      I
      ended
      up
      carrying
      him
      home.
      It
      was
      great
      for
      bonding
      and
      personally
      I
      think
      it
      was
      a
      cry
      for
      help.
      I
      just
      wish
      I
      could
      have
      taken
      them
      all
      home
      because
      they
      all
      looked
      like
      he
      did
      but
      one
      who
      was
      really
      fat.
      Like
      REALLY
      fat.

      Me
      too.
      I
      only
      hope
      that
      someone
      will
      get
      the
      rest
      before
      it #8217;s
      too
      late.
      And
      I
      hope
      that
      someone
      will
      get
      the
      one
      eating
      all
      of
      the
      food
      before
      he
      gets
      too
      overweight.

      That

      us
      actual
      crop
      tops.
      Idk
      if
      this
      is
      still
      a
      thing
      but
      the
      thought
      of
      it
      is
      really
      cringey.

      My
      Great
      Grandma
      told
      me
      that
      when
      she
      was
      little
      she
      was
      raped
      everyday
      by
      the
      guards
      in
      her
      camp
      and
      that
      was
      the
      only
      reason
      that
      she
      was
      kept
      alive
      until
      one
      day
      she
      was
      smuggled
      out
      by
      a
      nurse.

      I
      hate
      being
      silenced.
      I
      don #8217;t
      know
      why
      I
      just
      can #8217;t
      handle
      it.
      One
      time
      I
      was
      talking
      about
      the
      school
      system
      and
      then
      she
      cut
      me
      off
      in
      the
      middle
      of
      my
      speech
      yelled
      at
      me
      saying
      that
       #8220;We
      invoke
      critical
      thinking
      here! #8221;
      She
      then
      proceeded
      to
      say
       #8220;You
      know
      what,
      I
      don #8217;t
      want
      to
      argue
      with
      you
      go
      to
      your
      class #8221;.
      Do
      you
      see
      the
      gap
      in
      logic?

      I
      was
      not
      born
      but
      I
      find
      it
      odd
      that
      people
      can
      remember
      where
      they
      were
      and
      what
      they
      were
      doing
      but
      then
      bring
      it #8217;s
      up
      like
      it
      is
      surprising.
      It
      was
      a
      shocking
      moment
      in
      history
      and
      one
      of
      America #8217;s
      darkest
      hours.
      So
      I
      makes
      sense
      that
      you
      would
      remember
      what
      happened.

      My
      bestfriend #8217;s
      boyfriend
      called
      me
      and
      told
      me
      that
      she
      committed
      suicide
      but
      the
      thing
      that
      struck
      me
      the
      most
      was
      that
      I
      would
      have
      to
      tell
      her
      sister.
      She
      was
      in
      college
      and
      the
      boyfriend
      didn #8217;t
      have
      her
      number
      so
      he
      called
      me.
      This
      sucked
      because
      our
      families
      are
      friends
      so
      I #8217;ve
      known
      them
      for
      years.
      They
      are
      like
      family
      to
      me
      and
      I
      didn #8217;t
      let
      myself
      grieve
      until
      after
      I
      told
      her.
      I
      also
      had
      to
      tell
      her
      Mom
      and
      Dad
      because
      they
      never
      accept
      any
      of
      the
      boyfriend #8217;s
      calls.
      That
      was
      the
      worst
      day
      of
      my
      life
      but
      it
      was
      weird
      seeing
      her
      lying
      there
      in
      her
      temporary
      casket.
      She
      wanted
      to
      become
      a
      part
      of
      the
      earth
      so
      they
      put
      her
      in
      a
      bio
      urn
      and
      now
      she
      is
      a
      beautiful
      weeping
      willow
      tree.
      I
      was
      only
      13
      years
      old
      when
      all
      of
      this
      happened.
