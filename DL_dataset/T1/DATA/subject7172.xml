      Are
      you
      sure
      it
      isn't
      just
      a
      defect
      in
      the
      glass
      making,
      instead
      of
      being
      actually
      designed
      that
      way?
      But
      I
      understand
      that
      it'd
      be
      so
      cute
      if
      someone
      designed
      this
      on
      pupose.

      I've
      heard
      stories
      from
      people,
      but
      I
      don't
      know
      if
      it
      works
      the
      same
      way
      as
      LSD
      or
      if
      there
      is
      any
      science
      to
      back
      it
      up
      at
      all.
      I've
      done
      it
      less
      than
      10
      times,
      and
      my
      mood
      isn't
      nearly
      as
      cheerful
      as
      it
      was
      the
      other
      times.
      Is
      it
      still
      okay
      to
      take
      it?

      I've
      thought
      about
      this
      for
      many
      years,
      before
      the
      introduction
      of
      the
      new
      set
      of
      Assassin's
      Creed
      came
      along,
      but
      I
      disagree
      to
      what
      a
      lot
      of
      people
      imagine
      as
      to
      how
      the
      Hidden
      Blade
      works.
      I
      thought
      that
      since
      all
      the
      assassin's
      are
      related
      to
      the
      very
      first
      assassins,
      and
      so
      in
      the
      same
      way
      they
      inherited
      Eagle
      Vision,
      they
      also
      inherited
      a
      tendon
      on
      their
      fore
      arms
      that
      so
      that
      only
      assassin's
      can
      use
      hidden
      blades.
      The
      tendon
      would
      push
      up
      against
      a
      plate,
      and
      once
      the
      user
      stop
      tensing
      the
      tendon,
      the
      blade
      would
      retract.
      I
      understand
      this
      probably
      clashes
      with
      when
      Leonardo
      looked
      at
      the
      blades
      in
      AC
      2,
      and
      both
      Altair's
      and
      Edwards
      explanations
      of
      the
      mechanics
      (which
      contradict
      themselves
      anyway),
      and
      also
      the
      shift
      from
      single
      to
      double
      hidden
      blades,
      and
      there
      are
      probably
      similar
      contradictions
      like
      that.
      But
      it
      would
      make
      more
      sense
      with
      in
      game
      blue
      prints
      of
      the
      design,
      without
      that
      'ring
      and
      string'
      mechanic,
      as
      well
      as
      making
      it
      more
      of
      an
      obvious
      divide
      between
      the
      assassin's
      and
      the
      rest
      of
      humanity.

      I
      recently
      played
      Metal
      Gear
      Solid
      V:
      The
      Phantom
      Pain
      and
      initially
      I
      thought
      I
      would
      be
      able
      to
      easily
      go
      through
      this
      40
      hour
      game.
      But
      even
      in
      the
      first
      chapter
      I
      had
      a
      very
      hard
      time
      going
      unnoticed.
      I
      will
      say,
      I
      am
      not
      good
      at
      video
      games.
      I
      often
      play
      on
      easy
      and
      I
      stay
      away
      from
      shooters.
      Even
      so,
      in
      any
      Assassin's
      Creed
      game,
      newer
      or
      older,
      I
      am
      easily
      able
      to
      comb
      through
      the
      whole
      stage
      and
      take
      out
      every
      enemy
      and
      never
      break
      my
      stealth.
      Also,
      I
      can
      comfortably
      play
      Origins
      and
      Odyssey
      on
      hard,
      but
      that's
      more
      about
      their
      combat.
      However,
      when
      I
      played
      Metal
      Gear,
      I
      was
      completely
      blind
      sided
      from
      the
      lack
      of
      enemy
      positioning,
      and
      colour
      contrast
      for
      the
      enemies.
      Something
      similar
      happened
      with
      Batman:
      Arkham
      Knight,
      but
      not
      to
      as
      much
      of
      an
      extent
      because
      of
      all
      of
      its
      other
      stuff
      like
      the
      vehicle
      gameplay.
      I
      just
      want
      to
      point
      out
      that
      Assassins
      Creed
      may
      be
      called
      a
      stealth
      series,
      but
      it
      very
      toned
      down
      and
      basic
      compared
      to
      a
      lot
      of
      other
      stealth
      games.

      As
      I've
      said,
      I'm
      not
      very
      good
      at
      video
      games.
      I'm
      just
      surprised
      that
      I
      could
      play
      this
      game
      on
      Hard
      while
      I
      struggle
      on
      other
      games
      like
      Witcher
      3
      or
      God
      of
      War
      on
      Normal.
      I'll
      say
      it
      again,
      in
      not
      good
      at
      video
      games,
      and
      I'm
      able
      to
      admit
      that.
      But
      I
      still
      enjoy,
      like
      everyone
      else,
      all
      of
      these
      amazing
      masterpieces
      of
      incredible
      design
      and
      art.

      Okay,
      I'm
      not
      defending
      what
      he
      did
      in
      anyway
      because
      it's
      absolutely
      disgusting
      and
      vile.
      But
      clearly
      he
      has
      had
      mental

      I've
      been
      trying
      to
      date
      around
      for
      the
      last
      couple
      of
      years,
      and
      I've
      asked
      out
      4
      girls,
      the
      latest
      one
      has
      been
      my
      girlfriend
      for
      half
      a
      year
      now.
      And
      my
      advice
      is
      this;
      all
      three
      other
      girls
      that
      basically
      said
      no
      to
      my
      proposal,
      I'm
      still
      good
      friends
      with
      even
      after
      they
      said
      no.
      You're
      relationships
      with
      them
      won't
      change
      for
      the
      worst
      if
      you
      don't
      let
      them.
      Too
      many
      people
      are
      afraid
      of
      rejection
      and
      what
      it
      would
      be
      like
      afterwards
      if
      they
      say
      no.
      But
      just
      take
      a
      leap
      of
      faith.
      Sure,
      if
      you
      act
      hurt
      and
      don't
      talk
      to
      them
      of
      course
      your
      relationship
      with
      them
      will
      detiorate,
      you'll
      just
      become
      strangers
      if
      you
      don't
      try
      to
      get
      back
      into
      your
      previous
      relationship
      with
      them
      afterwards.
      I
      will
      say,
      it'll
      be
      awkward
      for
      a
      while,
      but
      be
      mature
      enough
      and
      put
      it
      past
      yourselves.
      From
      my
      past
      experiences,
      take
      this
      mindset
      with
      you.
      Don't
      hesitate
      to
      ask
      them
      out
      because
      of
      fear
      of
      what
      will
      happen
      if
      they
      say
      no,
      nobody
      wants
      to
      lose
      friends,
      and
      it's
      always
      worth
      a
      shot.

      Oh
      that
      is
      genuinely
      incredible!
      If
      you're
      doing
      a
      whole
      series
      on
      canabis
      strains,
      then
      maybe
      try
      illustrating
      one
      with
      a
      high
      amount
      of
      crystallised
      resin
      (keef).
      It
      maybe
      a
      hard
      texture
      to
      recreate
      in
      illustrator,
      but
      I
      think
      it
      would
      look
      fantastic
      (even
      though
      I
      don't
      have
      any
      experience
      in
      creating
      such
      detailed
      texture).
      Otherwise
      keep
      doing
      the
      great
      work
      you're
      doing,
      amazing
      work.

      Looks
      great,
      but
      I
      think
      you

      think
      more

      the

      of
      the
      actual
      gun.
      Looks
      very
      thin
      for
      a
      gun,
      as
      if
      it
      was
      half
      sunken
      into
      the

      I
      appreciate
      them
      trying
      something
      new
      in
      the
      newer
      games,
      but
      compared
      to
      God
      of
      War
      and
      Darks
      Souls,
      it
      felt
      way
      too
      floaty
      and
      unrefined.
      But
      I'm
      glad
      that
      they're
      moving
      away
      from
      the
      old
      counter+strike
      system
      and
      going
      with
      a
      more
      responsive
      and
      grounded
      fighting
      system.
      It's
      a
      step
      in
      the
      right
      direction,
      just
      needs

      more

      variety,
      it
      doesn't
      necessarily
      make
      it
      more
      fun,
      for
      me
      atleast.
      I
      enjoy
      playing
      a
      game
      more
      the
      more
      I
      enjoy
      moving
      the
      character,
      and
      to
      me
      that
      correlates
      to
      a
      refined
      and
      more
      balanced
      movement
      during
      fighting.
      And
      if
      by
      variety
      you
      mean
      weapon
      types,
      how
      can
      you
      say
      that
      about
      a
      game
      like
      Dark
      Souls?
      The
      items
      you
      carry
      and
      the
      armour
      you
      put
      on
      can
      affect
      your
      movement.
      If
      you
      have
      another
      definition
      of
      variety,
      please
      do
      say.
      And
      I
      don't
      think
      any
      developer
      intends
      to
      make
      a
      not
      fun
      game,
      so
      I
      would
      assume
      every
      game
      is
      about
      fun,
      but
      that
      may
      vary
      across
      a
      spectrum
      for
      each
      game.

      How

      Catalysts
      Actually
      Work?

      I'm
      a
      high-school
      student
      and
      the
      common
      definitions
      say
      that
      that
      they
      aren't
      used
      up
      in
      a
      reaction,
      as
      seen
      when
      writing
      the
      reactions.
      But
      there
      are
      simulations
      online
      often
      depicting
      the
      catalyst
      combining,
      even
      have
      if
      not
      permanently,
      to
      the
      reactant
      molecules.
      And
      surely,
      the
      enthalpy
      'hill'
      on
      a
      graph
      can't
      just
      be
      magically
      shortened
      without
      breaking
      the
      laws
      of
      thermodynamics.
      I
      would
      like
      to
      have
      a
      more
      thorough
      explanation
      than
      just
      "it
      makes
      a
      reaction
      go
      faster"

      I'm
      sorry,
      but
      I
      just
      finished
      the

      does

      Is

      of
      actually
      ending
