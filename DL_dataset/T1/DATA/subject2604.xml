    <TEXT>my life is okay at the moment but my head is still constantly throwing bad thoughts at me. i feel like a piece of shit constantly even though i know I'm not (as a friend). i used to be super suicidal but i don't remember what happened, i but just remember bein fine again. but i still kept that same mindset. i still believe that if I was dead it wouldn't matter that much, and that no one cares about me. even though, i also know that's not true for at least one person. she's the reason i'm not actually dead right now. what's troubling you, my friend?</TEXT>

    <TEXT>what's not worth the wait? i just feel like such and inconvenience to everyone around me, i see literally no excuses to why that's not true. i hurt myself, really bad. it wouldn't be "that bad" to certain people, but compared to everyone i've ever met including people close to me, it's abnormal. i find anyway to self destruct. i want to die so much it literally doesn't affect me anymore. i don't even feel sad, it's just a normal thing now. honestly, i just think I'm super stressed out and hormonal right now, but i still kept the mindset from when i had my last depressive episode. it never got better, i literally just got better at repressing and ignoring it.</TEXT>
