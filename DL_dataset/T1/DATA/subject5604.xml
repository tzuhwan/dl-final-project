      After
      a
      while
      of
      playing
      smite
      I've
      finally
      got
      a
      5
      man
      team
      for
      conquest.
      My
      team
      is
      up
      for
      competing
      in
      tournaments
      on
      a
      regular
      basis,
      with
      the
      intention
      of
      trying
      to
      get
      to
      challenger
      cup.
      Can
      people
      suggest
      any
      websites,
      current
      tournaments
      or
      organisers
      for
      5v5
      tournaments
      as
      so
      far
      I
      haven't
      been
      able
      to
      find
      any
      major
      ones.

      The
      community
      is
      the
      same
      as
      any
      online
      game.
      The

      and
      the
      way
      the

      is
      at

      Season
      5
      jungle
      starts

      In
      the
      first
      few
      days
      of
      playing
      the
      PTS
      for
      season
      5
      me
      and
      a
      friend
      have
      been
      testing
      out
      possible
      different
      jungle
      starts.
      In
      most
      of
      our
      games
      the
      duo,
      solo
      and
      mid
      will
      start
      in
      their
      respective
      lanes
      whilst
      the
      jungler
      starts
      at
      their
      speed
      buff.
      Duo
      lane:
      We
      found
      that
      gaining
      a
      level
      in
      the
      duo
      lane
      can
      be
      painful,
      especially
      with
      a
      low
      clear
      support.
      Because
      of
      this
      we
      wanted
      to
      see
      if
      we
      could
      take
      the
      purple
      buff
      and
      then
      move
      into
      the
      lane
      to
      gain
      an
      earlier
      boost
      in
      experience.
      What
      we
      started
      doing
      was
      using
      belt
      of
      frenzy
      to
      help
      clear
      the
      purple
      buff.
      We
      then
      move
      into
      lane
      where
      we've
      normally,
      at
      most,
      lost
      3
      creeps
      in
      experience.
      We
      clear
      the
      remaining
      lane
      minions,
      clear
      the
      next
      wave
      then
      move
      to
      oracles/red.
      This
      so
      far
      has
      relied
      on
      at
      least
      having
      one
      god
      with
      high
      clear
      attached
      to
      abilities.
      Mid/Jungle:
      With
      the
      speed
      buff
      spawning
      at
      25
      seconds,
      before
      the
      waves
      meet
      in
      the
      mid
      lane,
      we've
      had
      the
      mid
      laner
      throw
      an
      ability
      at
      the
      speed
      buff
      then
      run
      straight
      to
      lane.
      This
      speeds
      up
      the
      jungle
      clear
      significantly,
      whilst
      also
      giving
      the
      mid
      laner
      a
      slight
      boost
      in
      experience
      early
      as
      they
      are
      unlikely
      to
      miss
      more
      than
      1
      creep
      in
      the
      wave.
      This
      also
      lets
      the
      jungler
      get
      out
      of
      their
      speed
      buff
      much
      faster.
      Another
      start
      we
      have
      tested
      is
      both
      the
      mid
      and
      jungle
      invading
      the
      enemy
      speed
      buff.
      For
      this
      we
      have
      used
      good
      early
      game
      gods,
      for
      example
      Ne
      zha
      +
      Janus.
      We
      make
      our
      way
      over
      to
      the
      opposite
      side
      of
      the
      map
      trying
      to
      avoid
      being
      spotted
      by
      the
      enemy
      mid
      or
      solo.
      At
      around
      10
      seconds
      after
      minions
      spawn,
      we
      move
      forward
      to
      the
      rock
      just
      behind
      the
      speed
      buff,
      from
      here
      we
      can
      look
      over
      it
      and
      see
      who
      is
      currently
      at
      the
      buff.
      If
      only
      the
      jungler
      is
      present
      we
      wait
      for
      them
      to
      use
      an
      ability
      then
      attack
      them.
      If
      the
      jungle
      and
      mid
      is
      present
      we
      choose
      a
      target
      and
      attack
      as
      soon
      as
      the
      camp
      spawns,
      to
      ensure
      they
      can't
      get
      the
      exp
      for
      clearing
      any
      of
      the
      camp
      minions.
      In
      this
      we
      buy
      a
      sprint
      on
      the
      mid
      laner
      and
      a
      horrific
      emblem
      on
      the
      jungler,
      as
      a
      way
      to
      ensure
      we
      get
      a
      kill.
      So
      far
      the
      invades
      have
      gone
      uncontested
      and
      have
      led
      to
      a
      kill
      on
      either
      the
      mid
      laner
      or
      the
      jungler
      at
      level
      1.
      From
      the
      speed
      buff
      we
      rush
      to
      clear
      the
      enemy
      harpies
      then
      either
      go
      to
      mid
      camps
      or
      split
      up,
      with
      the
      jungler
      going
      to
      blue
      and
      the
      mid
      going
      to
      the
      wave.
      From
      what
      we've
      seen
      of
      this,
      getting
      a
      level
      1
      kill
      ensures
      that
      both
      the
      mid
      and
      jungle
      retain
      a
      massive
      gold
      lead
      for
      the
      majority
      of
      the
      match.
      Solo:
      We
      haven't
      found
      any
      better
      start
      for
      the
      solo
      laner
      other
      than
      to
      clear
      the
      wave
      or
      to
      do
      their
      blue
      buff,
      given
      that

      Having

      number
      will

      to
      toxic
      attitudes
      and
      bad
      reactions
      between
      players.
      If
      it's

      this
      might

      I
      can
      see
      players
      being
      kicked
      and
      bm'd

      regardless
      of
      how
      well
      they
      might
      be
      playing.
      It's
      something
      that
      is
      nice
      in
      a
      good
      environment
      but
      its
      another
      possible
      way
      towards
      toxic
      behaviour
      from
      players.

      throw.
      2.
      Power
      levels
      are
      mainly
      for
      the
      scaling
      of
      health
      in
      the
      different
      difficulties.
      So
      a
      1
      power
      weapon
      will
      do
      less
      than
      a
      300
      power
      weapon
      in
      legendary.
      3.
      Any
      box
      gained
      will
      give
      items
      towards
      the
      character
      you
      opened
      them
      on.
      So
      if
      you
      gain
      a
      chest
      as
      Kerillian
      (Elf)
      and
      open
      them
      on
      Bardin
      (Dwarf)
      it
      will
      give
      you
      items
      for
      Bardin.
      4.
      Potions
      of
      concentration
      give
      you
      a
      period
      of
      time
      where
      your
      ult/special
      ability
      charges
      up
      at
      a
      much
      faster
      rate.
      5.
      There's
      3
      acts
      in
      the
      standard
      game.
      So
      for
      act
      1
      you
      will
      have
      Righteous
      Stand
      unlocked,
      before
      you
      can
      move
      onto
      the
      second
      map
      in
      the
      act
      you
      must
      complete
      Righteous
      Stand.
      Running
      through
      all
      the
      maps
      in
      recruit
      custom
      mode
      should
      be
      easy
      enough
      to
      unlock
      them
      all
      for
      quickplay.
      Overall
      though
      there
      is
      15
      maps
      in
      the
      game.
      6.
      I
      can't
      help
      with
      Victor,
      I'm
      a
      Kerillian
      and
      Bardin
      main.
      If
      its
      a
      heavy
      attack
      (Held
      down
      button
      and
      charged)
      it's
      most
      likely
      armour
      piercing
      though.
      This
      game
      is
      meant
      to
      be
      learned
      and
      along
      with
      that
      comes
      the
      slow
      mastery
      of
      specific
      weapons
      and
      their
      playstyles.
      Learn
      through
      play
      is
      the
      best
      way.

      There's
      5
      unique
      Characters,
      each
      with
      3
      different
      classes.
      Each
      character
      class
      has
      a
      different
      archetype.
      Generally
      horde
      damage,
      tank
      and
      special
      slayer.
      The
      overall
      basis
      for
      the
      classes
      may
      be
      the
      same,
      but
      saying
      they're
      generic
      swinging
      suggests
      you
      haven't
      been
      forced
      to
      play
      each
      class
      at
      their

      The
      base
      class
      with
      its
      "base
      weapons"
      falls
      under
      the
      archetypes.
      With
      most
      the
      characters
      passive
      and
      active
      abilities
      you
      can
      clearly
      see
      that
      they
      were
      designed
      to
      fall
      under
      certain
      team
      roles.
      For
      instance
      Iron
      Breaker,
      he
      has
      a
      passive
      ability
      that
      absorbs
      a
      hit
      and
      then
      turn
      that
      into
      10
      temp
      hit
      points.
      Whilst
      his
      active
      literally
      pulls
      every
      enemy
      towards
      him.
      He's
      designed
      to
      be
      an
      aggro
      tank.
      When
      weapons
      come
      into
      play
      the
      devs
      have
      within
      reason
      left
      it
      up
      to
      the
      players.
      In
      terms
      of
      the
      dual
      hammers
      those
      pull
      from
      the
      slayer's
      axes
      and
      were
      added
      in
      the
      DLC
      as
      a
      spice
      weapon.
      Do
      they
      work
      on
      Iron
      Breaker,
      for
      sure,
      are
      they
      the
      best
      way
      to
      play,
      possibly
      but
      possibly
      not.
      Every
      class
      has
      been
      designed
      so
      that
      it
      can
      still
      function
      in
      a
      solo
      capacity
      whilst
      also
      filling
      a
      specific
      niche
      in
      a
      team.
      Weapon
      differences
      has
      opened
      that
      up
      massively.
      If
      you
      pick
      weapons
      that
      are
      bad
      at
      killing
      armour,
      they're
      generally
      better
      at
      something
      else.
       #8203;
      Saying
      that
      every
      class
      is
      the
      same
      simply
      because
      they
      can
      all
      achieve
      the
      same
      thing
      might
      be
      true,
      but
      you
      can
      tell
      it
      doesn't
      fit
      with
      how
      the
      characters
      were
      designed.
       #8203;
      Specifically
      the
      question
      though.
      Iron
      Breaker
      with
      hammers
      would
      fit
      between
      tank
      and
      horde
      damage.
      Mercenary
      with
      2h
      sword
      and
      repeater
      would
      be
      a
      horde
      damage
      with
      special
      damage.
      Zealot
      in
      itself
      is
      a
      strange
      mix
      class
      I
      will
      accept.
      Can
      they
      all
      tank,
      yes.
      Can
      they
      all
      do
      damage
      to
      everything
      on
      the
      board
      yes.
      Doesn't
      mean
      they
      don't
      fit
      under
      design
      archetypes.

      The
      game
      runs
      on
      weird
      peer
      to
      peer
      servers
      that
      are
      hosted
      by
      the
      player.
      What
      you're
      experiencing
      is
      your
      connection
      to
      the
      host
      server
      being
      bad,
      but
      your
      client
      side
      working
      fine.
      It's
      weird
      as
      I'm
      not
      100%
      convinced
      the
      game
      is
      run
      serverside
      or
      if
      only
      the
      player's
      inputs
      are
      serverside.
       #8203;
      In
      general
      this
      is
      just
      lag
      between
      the
      host
      and
      you

      I've
      had
      multiple
      games
      with
      people
      from
      other
      regions
      within
      quickplay.
      I'm
      South
      East
      England
      based
      and
      have
      played
      with
      people
      from
      Australia,
      Singapore,
      USA,
      Continental
      Europe
      etc.
      From
      my
      knowledge
      the
      matchmaking
      is
      simply
      down
      to
      player
      to
      player
      connections.
      In
      terms
      of
      hosting
      your
      own
      games
      I
      would
      assume
      it
      would
      take
      your
      host
      IP
      location
      and
      place
      that
      as
      your
      region
      within
      the
      lobby
      browser,
      however
      if
      that's
      not
      the
      case
      I'm
      not
      sure
      if
      there
      is
      a
      way
      to
      change
      it.

      Pretty
      sure
      the
      icons
      are
      on
      the
      correct
      sides,
      but
      the
      colours
      are
      the
      wrong
      way
      round
      on
      the
      actual
      phoenixes.

      The
      specific
      part
      of
      the
      model
      that
      the
      daji
      3
      teleports
      to
      is
      in
      the
      same
      place
      on
      the
      objective
      models
      compared
      to
      the
      player
      models.
      However
      as
      the
      Objective
      Models
      are
      much
      larger
      this
      teleport
      point
      has
      just
      been
      scaled
      higher,
      so
      when
      Daji
      teleports
      she's
      considered
      above
      the
      ground
      and
      so
      falls.
      It's
      not
      necessarily
      a
      bug,
      but
      just
      something
      that
      was
      missed
      when
      she
      was
      made.

      I
      play
      from
      South
      England
      and
      I
      somewhat
      enjoy
      the
      quickplay
      roulette.
      Each
      time
      you
      queue
      you
      ask
      where
      the
      host
      is
      from.
      Pretty
      sure
      I've
      had
      people
      from
      each
      continent
      matched
      with
      me.
      Granted
      this
      isn't
      a
      new
      thing
      and
      is
      more
      down
      to
      time
      zones
      and
      a
      lower
      playercount.
