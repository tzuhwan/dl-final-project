      Hi
      and
      thank
      you
      so
      much
      for
      your
      response!
      Yes,
      my
      retainer
      is
      ill
      fitted
      as
      I
      neglect
      wearing
      it
      often.
      I
      will
      speak
      with
      my
      orthodontist
      about
      getting
      a
      new
      one.
      Will
      flossing
      and
      proper
      dental
      hygiene
      get
      rid
      of
      hyperplasia?

      No
      worries,
      when
      I
      looked
      up
      gingival
      overgrowth
      I
      got
      an
      understanding
      of
      what
      you
      meant!
      I
      believe
      you #8217;re
      right
      about
      the
      infection.
      I
      am
      rinsing
      with
      hydrogen
      peroxide
      diluted
      with
      water
      until
      I
      can
      get
      an
      appointment
      with
      the
      dentist.
      Also,
      I
      had
      all
      four
      of
      my
      wisdom
      teeth
      taken
      out
      in
      high
      school!
      I
      think
      perhaps
      what
      happened
      is
      my
      retainer
      cut
      my
      gum
      and
      then
      the
      cut
      got
      infected.
      Hopefully
      I
      can
      get
      in
      to
      see
      a
      dentist
      soon
      and
      also
      an
      orthodontist!
      I
      really
      appreciate
      your
      help!

      My
      original
      plan
      for
      getting
      an
      MBA
      was
      to
      further
      my
      career
      in
      the
      healthcare
      field,
      but
      I
      am
      no
      longer
      interested
      in
      it!
      Now,
      I
      am
      interested
      in
      management,
      but
      not
      sure
      the
      type
      of
      position
      or
      field.
      An
      internship
      is
      a
      wonderful
      idea,
      and
      I
      will
      definitely
      be
      researching
      it
      more!
      Thank
      you
      so
      much
      for
      your

      After

      I

      I

      what
      comes
      to
      people's
      mind

      fiction
      book
      that
      took
      place
      in
      America
      during
      the
      20th
      century.
      I'm
      really
      not
      picky
      with
      genres!

      Sorry
      if
      this
      has
      been
      discussed
      before!!
      I
      was
      rewatching
      season
      6
      episode
      17
      when
      Rory
      finds
      out
      that
      Logan
      hooked
      up
      with
      a
      bunch
      of
      girls
      while
      he
      thought
      they
      were
      broken
      up.
      I
      know
      that
      many
      people
      can #8217;t
      stand
      Logan
      and
      this
      is
      a
      huge
      part
      of
      the
      reason
      but
      I
      can #8217;t
      help
      but
      think
      he
      didn #8217;t
      do
      anything
      wrong?
      Even
      though,
      yes,
      Rory
      thought
      they
      were
      just
      taking
      a
      hiatus,
      he
      actually
      DID
      think
      that
      they
      were
      broken
      up.
      In
      my
      opinion,
      he
      did
      nothing
      wrong.
      It #8217;s
      similar
      to
      Ross
      and
      Rachel
      in
      Friends!
      THEY
      WERE
      ON
      A
      BREAK!!
      Sure,
      it #8217;s
      not
      the
      best
      way
      to
      move
      on
      from
      someone,
      but
      it #8217;s
      not
      necessarily
      bad.
      Thoughts
      on
      Logan #8217;s
      behavior?
      Is
      it
      just
      because
      he
      didn #8217;t
      confirm
      with
      Rory
      that
      they
      were
      broken
      up?

      Valid
      point!!
      The
      fact
      that
      there
      wasn't
      an
      actual
      discussion
      about
      breaking
      up
      between
      Rory
      and
      Logan
      *does*
      make
      it
      seem
      less
      okay.
      It's
      hard
      to
      think
      that
      I
      wouldn't
      be
      just
      as
      upset
      as
      Rory
      if
      I
      were
      in
      the
      same
      position.

      Yes
      100%!
      Rory
      had
      a
      total
      right
      to
      be
      angry,
      but
      it
      wasn't
      fair
      to
      say
      that
      she
      forgave
      him
      when
      clearly
      she
      did
      not.
      At
      that
      point
      in
      their
      relationship,
      I
      felt
      they
      didn't
      communicate
      as
      well
      as
      they
      should
      have.

      For
      sure!
      He
      didn't
      communicate
      with
      Rory
      AT
      ALL.
      It's
      not
      fair
      to
      just
      assume
      something
      huge
      like
      that
      in
      a
      relationship
      without
      discussing
      it.
      And
      I
      think
      him
      saying
      that
      to
      Honor
      just
      to
      get
      her
      off
      his
      back
      is
      totally
      just
      him
      trying
      to
      get
      out
      of
      it
      when
      Rory
      confronted
      him.
      I
      think
      he
      meant
      it
      when
      he
      told
      Honor.

      Oh
      yes
      the
      Jess
      thing!
      I
      forgot
      about
      that!
      Rory
      100%
      just
      wanted
      to
      hook
      up
      with
      Jess
      and
      then
      felt
      bad
      after
      she
      kissed
      him.
      Technically,
      Logan
      never
      cheated
      on
      Rory
      (since
      he
      "broke"
      up
      with
      her
      through
      his
      sister),
      but
      Rory
      DEFINITELY
      cheated
      on
      Logan.
      And
      I
      don't
      remember
      her
      ever
      telling
      Logan
      that
      she
      kissed
      Jess?
      So
      that
      was
      definitely
      a
      huge
      secret
      she
      kept
      from
      him
      for
      the
      rest
      of
      their
      relationship.

      Completely
      agree!
      What
      he
      did
      DEFINITELY
      wasn't
      nice
      and
      Rory
      had
      a
      right
      to
      be
      upset.
      BUT
      it's
      still
      not
      classified
      as
      cheating.

      Totally
      agree
      about
      the
      ghosting
      thing.
      It
      doesn #8217;t
      seem
      fair
      that
      she
      didn #8217;t
      contact
      him
      for
      weeks
      and
      then
      she
      calls
      it
      cheating
      when
      she
      goes
      and
      kisses
      Jess
      just
      because
      she #8217;s
      mad
      at
      Logan?
      I
      love
      Rory
      but
      sometimes
      it
      feels
      like
      she
      only
      wants
      things
      done
      on
      her
      terms
      and
      puts
      the
      blame
      on
      everyone
      else.
      Even
      when
      she
      kissed
      Jess
      she
      said
       #8220;I
      couldn #8217;t
      even
      cheat
      on
      him
      the
      way
      he
      cheated
      on
      me. #8221;
      By
      saying
      that
      she #8217;s
      just
      justifying
      her
      actions
      when
      she #8217;s
      clearly
      being
      a
      hypocrite.

      Hahaha
      yeah
      Dean
      could
      get
      a
      little
      annoying
      from
      time
      to
      time.
      What
      annoyed
      me
      the
      most
      about
      him
      was
      after
      he
      got
      married
      and
      cheated
      on
      his
      wife
      with
      Rory...
      I
      felt
      that
      it
      completely
      went
      against
      the
      character
      that
      was
      originally
      portrayed
      for
      him.
      The
      show
      made
      us
      not
      like
      Dean
      by
      the
      end
      of
      it.
      I
      wish
      that
      Rory
      had
      never
      gone
      back
      to
      him.
      I
      loved
      Jess
      the
      most,
      I
      felt
      that
      especially
      towards
      the
      end
      he
      seemed
      the
      most
      mature
      and
      put
      Rory's
      best
      interest
      at
      heart.
      I
      love
      that
      he
      was
      the
      one
      who
      finally
      put
      her
      back
      on
      track
      when
      she
      dropped
      out
      of
      Yale.
      I
      like
      Logan
      a
      lot
      too,
      actually!
      I
      feel
      like
      Rory
      would've
      been
      happy
      marrying
      him.
      I
      thought
      it
      was
      so
      sweet
      that
      he
      put
      so
      much
      thought
      into
      her
      happiness
      and
      where
      she
      could
      work
      and
      how
      their
      lives
      would
      be
      if
      she
      moved
      to
      California
      with
      him.

      The
      morning
      commute
      to
      work
      was
      always
      a
      hassle
      for
      Tom.
      He
      always
      left
      for
      work
      at
      exactly
      8:10.
      He
      left
      at
      this
      time
      because
      he
      knew
      the
      neighbor
      in
      the
      house
      to
      his
      left
      always
      left
      for
      work
      at
      8:15,
      but
      his
      neighbor
      in
      the
      house
      to
      his
      right
      would
      wait
      outside
      on
      the
      sidewalk
      with
      his
      children
      until
      the
      8:05
      bus
      was
      there
      to
      take
      them
      to
      school.
      If
      he
      left
      before
      8:05,
      he
      might
      run
      into
      the
      newspaper
      delivery
      boy
      who
      made
      his
      rounds
      anywhere
      from
      7:30
      to
      8.
      8:10
      was
      the
      right
      time
      for
      Tom
      because
      he
      wouldn't
      have
      to
      speak
      with
      anyone
      on
      the
      way
      to
      his
      car.
      Tom
      opened
      the
      door
      to
      his
      house
      and
      peaked
      his
      head
      outside,
      glancing
      around.
      He
      saw
      the
      school
      bus
      already
      down
      the
      street
      and
      his
      neighbors
      car
      was
      no
      longer
      in
      the
      driveway.
      Tom
      quickly
      stepped
      outside,
      coffee
      in
      hand
      and
      keys
      in
      the
      other.
      He
      locked
      up
      and
      quietly
      made
      his
      way
      down
      his
      walkway
      towards
      the
      brown
      Volvo
      parked
      in
      front
      of
      his
      mailbox.
      Tom
      was
      just
      about
      to
      open
      the
      door
      when
      the
      newspaper
      delivery
      boy
      comes
      barreling
      down
      the
      street.
      "Good
      morning,
      Mr.
      Andrews!"
      The
      delivery
      boy
      exclaimed.
      *"Damn*,"
      Tom
      thought.
      "Good
      morning,
      Freddie."
      Tom
      said
      back
      as
      Freddie
      slowed
      to
      a
      stop
      in
      front
      of
      him.
      "**But,
      in
      fact,
      it
      was
      not
      a
      good
      morning
      for
      Tom
      at
      all**, #8221;
      A
      omniscient
      voice
      boomed
      overhead.
       #8220;**Tom
      had
      a
      headache
      from
      his
      usual
      lonely
      late-night
      drinking
      and
      had
      woken
      up
      to
      discover
      that
      he
      had
      left
      two
      voicemails
      and
      six
      text
      messages
      for
      his
      ex-girlfriend,
      Delia.
      She
      has
      not
      returned
      his
      messages.** #8221;
      Tom
      looked
      at
      Freddie.
      His
      mouth
      was
      hanging
      open
      and
      his
      eyes
      widened.
      He
      slowly
      closed
      his
      mouth
      and
      was
      silent
      for
      a
      moment.
       #8220;Well,
      I
      gotta
      run #8230;
      I #8217;m
      late
      with
      my
      delivery
      this
      morning, #8221;
      Freddie
      said,
      handing
      Tom #8217;s
      newspaper
      to
      him.
       #8220;See
      ya,
      Freddie, #8221;
      Tom
      said,
      embarrassed.
      He
      watched
      as
      Freddie
      hopped
      back
      on
      his
      bike
      and
      sped
      off
      down
      the
      street.
      Tom
      sighed
      and
      got
      into
      his
      car.
      He
      drove
      the
      usual
      route
      to
      work,
      silently
      convincing
      himself
      to
      forget
      the
      incident
      the
      whole
      way.
      Tom
      parked
      the
      car
      at
      8:21
      and
      sat
      in
      it,
      finishing
      his
      coffee.
      *Tap,
      tap,
      tap!*
      Startled,
      Tom
      dropped
      his
      coffee
      in
      his
      lap
      and
      screamed
      out
      in
      pain.
      The
      hot
      coffee
      was
      already
      seeping
      into
      his
      shirt.
      Tom
      heard
      a
      gasp
      and
      slight
      chuckle.
      He
      looked
      up
      to
      see
      his
      23
      year
      old
      coworker,
      Ron,
      waving
      at
      him
      from
      the
      passenger
      window.
      Annoyed,
      Tom
      rolled
      down
      the
      window.
       #8220;Had
      a
      spill
      there,
      eh? #8221;
      Ron
      said,
      laughing.
       #8220;You
      gotta
      be
      more
      careful. #8221;
       #8220;You #8217;re
      right,
      Ron.
      Sorry. #8221;
      Tom
      said,
      dripping
      with
      coffee
      and
      sarcasm.
       #8220;Well
      I
      hope
      I #8217;m
      not
      bothering
      you
      here,
      Tom.
      I
      just
      wanted
      to
      say
      hello. #8221;
      Ron
      said.
       #8220;You #8217;re
      not
      bothering
      me,
      Ron.
      I
      just
      need
      to
      clean
      this
      up. #8221;
      Tom
      said
      wiping
      his
      shirt
      with
      an
      old
      napkin.
       #8220;**Actually,
      Ron
      was
      bothering
      Tom.
      In
      fact,
      he
      often
      bothers
      Tom
      daily.
      Tom
      has
      even
      gone
      to
      his
      manager
      to
      complain
      about
      how
      annoying
      he
      found
      Tom,
      in
      hopes
      to
      get
      him
      moved
      to
      a
      different
      department.** #8221;
      The
      voice
      thundered.
      Ron
      stood
      there,
      wide-eyed.
      He
      slowly
      stood
      back
      up,
      away
      from
      the
      window,
      and
      walked
      away
      from
      Tom #8217;s
      car.
       #8220;Shit, #8221;
      Tom
      said
      aloud.
      He
      quickly
      tucked
      his
      coffee-stained
      shirt
      back
      into
      his
      pants,
      grabbed
      his
      briefcase
      and
      jumped
      out
      of
      the
      car.
      Tom
      walked
      nervously
      into
      work
      at
      8:32.
      He
      passed
      Ron
      sitting
      at
      his
      desk,
      who
      scoffed
      when
      Tom
      waked
      past
      and
      leaned
      over
      to
      whisper
      something
      in
      his
      colleague #8217;s
      ear.
      Both
      of
      them
      looked
      at
      Tom
      in
      disgust.
      Tom
      got
      to
      his
      cubicle
      and
      sat
      down
      at
      his
      desk.
       #8220;You #8217;re
      late, #8221;
      Tom
      heard
      a
      voice
      behind
      him.
      Tom
      turned
      around
      to
      see
      his
      boss
      standing
      there,
      impatiently
      tapping
      his
      foot.
       #8220;Yes,
      I
      apologize,
      Mr.
      Ruthersworth.
      I
      had
      a
      little
      accident
      with
      my
      coffee
      this
      morning, #8221;
      Tom
      said,
      sheepishly
      showing
      him
      the
      brown
      stain
      on
      his
      shirt.
      Mr.
      Ruthersworth
      briefly
      glanced
      at
      Tom #8217;s
      shirt
      and
      said,
       #8220;Follow
      me.
      I
      need
      to
      speak
      with
      you
      in
      my
      office. #8221;
      Tom
      got
      up
      and
      quickly
      followed
      behind,
      past
      Ron #8217;s
      desk
      and
      into
      Mr.
      Ruthersworth #8217;s
      large
      office.
       #8220;Sit
      down,
      Tom, #8221;
      Mr.
      Ruthersworth
      gestured
      to
      the
      gray
      chair
      in
      front
      of
      his
      oak
      wooden
      desk.
      Tom
      sat
      down
      and
      waited
      patiently
      while
      Mr.
      Ruthersworth
      shuffled
      through
      some
      papers
      on
      his
      desk.
       #8220;Ah, #8221;
      Mr.
      Ruthersworth
      said,
      finding
      the
      correct
      paper
      and
      placing
      it
      in
      front
      of
      him.
       #8220;Tom,
      you
      have
      worked
      at
      this
      office
      for
      six
      months.
      I
      hired
      you
      because
      had
      the
      correct
      qualifications
      and
      seemed
      capable
      enough
      to
      do
      the
      job
      asked
      of
      you.
      I
      hired
      you
      even
      though
      none
      of
      your
      previous
      employers
      would
      give
      me
      a
      good
      reference,
      and
      you
      haven #8217;t
      seemed
      to
      hold
      a
      job
      longer
      than
      a
      year
      at
      any
      of
      the
      corporations
      listed
      on
      your
      resume.
      I
      gave
      you
      the
      benefit
      of
      the
      doubt. #8221;
      He
      said,
      looking
      sternly
      at
      Tom.
      Tom
      shifted
      in
      his
      seat,
      but
      said
      nothing.
       #8220;During
      your
      time
      here,
      you
      have
      been
      late
      a
      total
      of
      11
      times,
      used
      up
      all
      of
      your
      sick
      days,
      offended
      multiple
      of
      your
      coworkers,
      and
      seem
      to
      put
      in
      minimal
      effort.
      Tom
      looked
      down
      into
      his
      lap,
      anger
      growing
      inside
      of
      him.
       #8220;I
      have
      given
      you
      every
      chance
      in
      the
      book,
      Tom,
      and
      I
      think
      I #8217;ve
      been
      very
      generous. #8221;
      Mr.
      Ruthersworth
      said.
      Tom
      looked
      up
      and
      glared
      at
      Mr.
      Ruthersworth.
      Tom
      had
      had
      enough.
       #8220;Mr.
      Ruthersworth,
      with
      all
      due
      respect,
      I
      hate
      working
      here.
      You,
      with
      your
      yellow
      teeth
      and
      your
      bad
      toupee?
      You
      walk
      around
      here
      as
      if
      you
      own
      the
      place
      when
      everyone
      knows
      you
      make
      little
      more
      than
      your
      own
      employees.
      You
      only
      got
      this
      job
      because
      your
      sister
      works
      in
      corporate
      and
      you
      couldn #8217;t
      find
      a
      job
      with
      the
      only
      thing
      on
      your
      resume
      being
      Assistant
      Manager
      at
      Dairy
      Queen.
      I
      hate
      this
      place,
      the
      people
      in
      it,
      and
      I
      hate
      working
      for
      you. #8221;
      Mr.
      Ruthersworth
      stood
      up
      from
      his
      chair,
      red
      in
      the
      face.
       #8220;You #8217;re
      fired! #8221;
      He
      exclaimed,
      furiously.
       #8220;Mr.
      Ruthersworth,
      you're
      not
      firing
      me.
      I
      quit! #8221;
      Tom
      shouted,
      getting
      up
      from
      his
      own
      chair.
       #8220;**But
      indeed,
      Tom
      was
      fired.** #8221;
      The
      voice
      boomed
      overhead.

      Oh
      that's
      a
      good
      way
      to
      get
      into
      the
      field!
      I
      left
      my
      job
      to
      pursue
      my
      MBA
      but
      I
      will
      look
      to
      see
      if
      they
      have
      any
      openings
      for
      project
      management!
      Thank
      you!!

      Hello!
      I
      am
      from
      the
      United
      States,
      and
      I
      am
      a
      student
      in
      the
      Czech
      Republic.
      My
      residence
      permit
      will
      expire
      on
      September
      26.
      I
      have
      two
      problems:
      1.
      I
      am
      leaving
      the
      country
      to
      go
      back
      to
      the
      United
      States
      until
      September
      17.
      I
      must
      take
      this
      trip,
      I
      am
      unable
      to
      cancel
      it.
      Does
      anyone
      know
      if
      I
      am
      able
      to
      extend
      my
      visa
      from
      a
      Czech
      embassy
      in
      the
      United
      States?
      I
      was
      unable
      to
      find
      information
      about
      it
      on
      their
      website.
      2.
      I
      am
      aware
      I
      must
      have
      a
      confirmation
      of
      accommodation
      in
      the
      form
      of
      a
      lease
      contract...
      I
      am
      moving
      out
      of
      my
      current
      apartment
      on
      October
      6
      and
      have
      not
      found
      a
      new
      one
      yet.
      My
      plan
      was
      to
      rent
      an
      AirBnB
      if
      I
      had
      not
      found
      one
      before
      I
      move
      out.
      My
      question
      is,
      will
      my
      current
      lease
      contract
      suffice,
      or
      must
      I
      have
      moved
      into
      a
      new
      apartment
      before
      applying?
      Thank
      you
      for
      your
      help!

      This
      is
      the
      episode
      where
      Lorelai
      and
      Sookie
      hire
      an
      interior
      decorator
      (Natalie)
      for
      the
      Dragonfly
      who
      also
      happens
      to
      have
      done
      a
      job
      at
      Emily #8217;s
      house.
      Is
      anyone
      else
      bothered
      by
      the
      fact
      that
      Lorelai
      just
      could
      not
      keep
      Natalie
      on
      as
      the
      Dragonfly #8217;s
      decorator
      even
      at
      the
      protest
      of
      Sookie?
      It
      bothers
      me
      so
      much.
      Yes,
      I
      get
      that
      she
      doesn #8217;t
      want
      to
      be
      associated
      with
      Emily
      in
      any
      way,
      however
      she
      completely
      ignores
      her
      partnership
      with
      Sookie
      and
      fires
      Natalie!
      She
      should
      be
      making
      her
      decisions
      WITH
      Sookie.
      I
      love
      Lorelai
      and
      her
      overall
      character
      but
      sometimes
      I
      can #8217;t
      stand
      her
      selfishness.
      Anyway,
      the
      rant
      is
      over
      hahaha

      It #8217;s
      so
      weird
      that
      Sookie
      wouldn #8217;t

      included
      in
      all
