      Hey
      Everyone
      So
      I
      bought
      an
      Alienware
      Aurora
      R7
      about
      3
      months
      ago
      for
      work
      and
      gaming.
      Everything
      has
      been
      going
      really
      well
      for
      a
      pre
      built
      buy
      (GPUs
      were
      still
      in
      the
      crypto
      bubble
      a
      few
      months
      back
      and
      this
      had
      an
      8700
      and
      a
      1080
      in
      it
      for
      $1600)
      but
      my
      insanity
      wanted
      more
      so
      I
      purchased
      a
      Nvidia
      Titan
      XP
      off
      a
      buddy
      of
      mine
      who
      had
      two
      and
      was
      not
      using
      the
      second.
      Then
      my
      problems
      began...
      For
      reasons
      unknown,
      every
      time
      I
      am
      in
      the
      lobby
      of
      a
      game,
      my
      computer
      will
      do
      a
      hard
      restart.
      No
      BSOD.
      No
      warning.
      Temps
      are
      within
      reason
      between
      78-83
      degrees.
      I
      did
      a
      fresh
      install
      of
      Windows.
      Multiple
      tests
      (more
      than
      I
      can
      count)
      with
      no
      red
      flags
      or
      issues,
      switched
      the
      external
      power
      strip,
      checked
      all
      my
      connections,
      etc
      etc.
      So
      I
      have
      dialed
      down
      what
      is
      occurring
      in
      the
      event
      manager
      and
      I
      am
      going
      to
      copy
      in
      the
      messages
      right
      before
      the
      "Critical"
      of
      the
      computer
      shutting
      down
      and
      auto
      restarting.

      **CRITICAL
      MESSAGE**
      The
      system
      has
      rebooted
      without
      cleanly
      shutting
      down
      first.
      This
      error
      could
      be
      caused
      if
      the
      system
      stopped
      responding,
      crashed,
      or
      lost
      power
      unexpectedly.
      I
      have
      done
      a
      lot
      of
      digging
      and
      research
      into
      these
      and
      this
      seems
      to
      be
      a
      pretty
      broad
      request
      so
      there
      is
      a
      lot
      of
      back
      and
      forth
      on
      what
      exactly
      the
      problem
      is.
      I
      did
      just
      read
      an
      article
      about
      the
      'npsvctrig'
      message
      which
      is
      the
      message
      right
      before
      the
      critical
      shut
      down
      and
      the
      reply
      was
      the
      solution
      was
      to
      disable
      Windows
      Fast
      Start
      Up.
      Which
      I
      did
      and
      am
      going
      to
      run
      through
      some
      tests
      now.
      I
      know
      you
      all
      probably
      get
      a
      bunch
      of
      people
      that
      come
      in
      here
      and
      beg
      for
      help.
      Although
      I
      am
      not
      a
      master
      PC
      guy
      as
      many
      of
      you
      surely
      are
      I
      am
      also
      not
      completely
      inept
      when
      it
      comes
      to
      tech
      and
      the
      world
      PC
      (albeit
      all
      of
      this
      is
      pretty
      new
      to
      me
      I
      have
      really
      dove
      into
      it
      since
      I
      purchased).
      ***Any
      help,
      I
      mean
      anything,
      would
      be
      greatly
      appreciated.
      I
      just
      want
      this
      to
      stop
      happening
      as
      it
      is
      INCREDIBLY
      frustrating.
      I
      appreciate
      any
      and
      all
      feedback
      in
      advance...***

      Cables
      fit
      fine
      (Its
      a
      6
      pin
      and
      an
      8

      Just
      looked
      in
      the
      Titan
      service
      manual
      and
      the
      MINIMUM
      requirement
      for
      a
      PSU
      is
      600
      W,
      I
      just
      got
      off

      with

      and
      confirmed

      the
      PSU
      I
      currently
      have
      is
      460W.
      Sooooo,
      this
      would
      be
      the
      issue

      Upgrade
      the

      to
      an
      850W
      and
      call
      it

      Why

      an

      Three
      times.
      Yes,
      three
      valid
      times
      in
      the
      last
      36
      hours.
      I
      have
      been
      in
      a
      fight
      with
      a
      duo
      or
      trio
      as
      a
      solo
      in
      multiple
      diff
      maps
      and
      a
      fully
      kitted
      guy
      or
      once
      TWO
      DIFFERENT
      GUYS
      ALT
      F4
      and
      freeze
      out
      on
      me.
      Why
      is
      this
      an
      option?
      What
      cowardice
      to
      not
      take
      a
      fight
      and
      just
      ALT
      out
      of
      the
      game
      and
      hopefully
      come
      back
      to
      get
      your
      stuff.
      I
      actually
      dont
      know
      what
      happens
      after
      the
      fact
      as
      I
      just
      can't
      find
      it
      in
      my
      heart
      to
      do
      this.
      I
      get
      it...Its
      a
      game.
      There
      are
      cheaters.
      There
      are
      hackers.
      But
      how
      easy
      would
      this
      be
      to
      take
      out?
      Devs?
      Anyone...????

      Whats
      up
      my
      shitters.
      Im
      a
      lvl
      41
      and
      would
      like
      to
      have
      a
      discussion
      on
      helmets.
      Ive
      tried
      them
      all.
      Literally
      from
      the
      retard
      bus
      Kolpak
      to
      the
      FAST
      with
      mandible
      or
      face
      shield.
      They
      say
      a
      headshot
      is
      a
      headshot.
      No
      matter
      what
      you
      wear
      you're
      going
      down.
      I've
      resorted
      to
      wearing
      a
      6B.
      I
      am
      tired
      of
      spending
      approx
      $170K
      roubles
      on
      a
      full
      FAST
      and
      receiving
      the
      same
      result
      as
      a
      6B
      or
      even
      an
      LZSH
      or
      ZSH
      with
      a
      face
      shield
      (Which
      just
      cracks
      as
      I
      am
      falling
      to
      the
      ground
      anyways).
      Sometimes,
      VERY
      RARELY,
      I"ll
      get
      a
      face
      crack
      in
      the
      shield
      and
      be
      able
      to
      survive
      it.
      What
      is
      everyone's
      thoughts
      on
      this
      as
      of
      now?

      I
      think
      this
      is
      a
      valid
      discussion
      and
      if
      anyone
      has
      some
      background
      from
      a
      development
      standpoint
      that
      would
      be
      great.
      If
      I
      am
      wearing
      nothing
      or
      a
      non
      protective
      helm
      I
      get
      one
      tapped.
      Do
      I
      get
      one
      tapped
      with
      a
      full
      FAST
      and
      mandible
      on
      as
      well?
      If
      so,
      then
      I
      am
      never
      spending
      money
      on
      an
      expensive
      helm
      again

      You're

      SKS,
      you
      would
      have
      one
      tapped
      him
      with
      a
      helmet
      anyways.
       #8203;
      Had
      a
      full
      FAST
      on
      yesterday
      and
      got
      one
      tapped
      with
      an
      SKS.
      If
      you're
      enemy
      is
      not
      using
      9
      mm
      (which
      most
      do
      not

      the
      pistol/auto
      pistol
      build),
      you
      will
      die.
      Helmets
      are
      useless
      at
      this
      point.
      Wear
      a
      6B
      and
      keep
      it
      at
      that
      because
      a
      one
      tap
      is
      a

      Hey
      everyone
      So
      been
      drinking
      coffee
      for
      years.
      Love
      it.
      It's
      great.
      It's
      why
      we're
      here
      and
      I
      just
      got
      here
      myself.
      I'm
      using
      a
      perculator
      now
      and
      testing
      out
      a
      bunch
      of
      different
      beans
      and
      roast
      profiles
      etc.
      Just
      trying
      to
      figure
      out
      what
      I
      like.
      My
      question
      is
      simple,
      what's
      the
      best
      brew
      method?
      I've
      brought
      it
      down
      to
      three.
      Just
      need
      a
      nice,
      concise
      debate
      amongst
      the
      community
      on
      where
      to
      put
      my
      money.
      Id
      rather
      not
      buy
      3-4
      different
      methods
      over
      the
      next
      year
      and
      only
      use
      one
      of
      them.
      I
      tend
      to
      do
      this
      a
      lot
      with
      all
      of
      my
      other
      hobbies.
      So,
      here's
      what
      I
      got:
      1.
      A
      nice
      size
      French
      press
      2.
      An
      Aeropress
      3.
      A
      pour
      over
      (Leaning
      towards
      a
      chemex
      or
      something
      I
      can
      brew
      more
      than
      1-2
      cups)
      And
      if
      I'm
      missing
      anything,
      definitely
      would
      like
      to
      hear
      any
      other
      methods
      /
      options.
      Reddit
      has
      helped
      me
      into
      so
      many
      other
      ventures
      and
      I
      bet
      this
      forum
      will
      do
      that
      again
      for
      me.
      Thanks
      everyone
      in
      advance!
      Looking
      forward
      to
      learning
      new
      things.
