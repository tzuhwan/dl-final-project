      Sounds
      a
      bit
      to
      me
      like
      it
      could
      be
      a
      mix
      of
      things.
      For
      example
      being
      so
      young
      and
      it #8217;s
      yalls
      first
      baby
      while
      trying
      to
      learn
      the
      ropes
      and
      find
      that
      balance
      and
      possibly
      even
      some
      postpartum
      depression
      as
      it
      seems
      she
      detaches
      herself
      from
      the
      baby
      a
      bit
      too.
      I
      would
      try
      to
      get
      her
      in
      with
      a
      therapist
      to
      maybe
      help
      get
      out
      her
      frustration
      and
      anxiety.

      That #8217;s
      how
      mine
      started!
      Two
      of
      my
      friends
      had
      asked
      to
      be
      gym
      buddies.
      One
      always
      complains
      about
      doing
       #8220;land
      sports #8221;
      and
      how
      dumb
      it
      is
      (then
      why
      want
      to
      go
      to
      a
      gym
      where
      that #8217;s
      all
      there
      is?!?!?!)
      and
      the
      other
      seemed
      more
      motivated
      but
      either
      waits
      an
      hour
      after
      we
      were
      suppose
      to
      meet
      up
      to
      say
      anything
      or
      just
      is
      a
      no
      call
      no
      show.
      But
      you
      keep
      doing
      you!
      That #8217;s
      what
      I #8217;m
      doing
      and
      I #8217;ve
      just
      ignored
      the
      back
      lash.
      Seems
      to
      work
      but
      gets
      a
      bit
      annoying
      since
      I
      see
      them
      all
      the
      time
      in
      class

      They #8217;re
      my
      only
      like
      two
      friends
      (I #8217;m
      in
      college
      and
      work
      almost
      full
      time
      and
      we #8217;ve
      been
      friends
      since
      middle
      school)
      so
      I
      don #8217;t
      have
      many
      options
      lol.
      But
      you #8217;re
      right.
      Once
      I
      move
      to
      be
      with
      my
      boyfriend
      at
      least
      I #8217;ll
      have
      him
      to
      go
      with
      me!

      My
      bf
      put
      it
      best
      this
      way:
      one
      friend
      for
      some
      reason
      thinks
      that
      it #8217;s
       #8220;cool #8221;
      to
      hate
      land
      sports
      which
      is
      why
      she
      always
      brings
      up
      how
      much
      she
      hates
      it
      or
      how
      she
      can #8217;t
      do
      it
      and
      is
       #8220;content
      with
      being
      fat #8221;.
      Her
      words
      not
      mine.
      And
      how
      she
      loves
      carbs
      and
      food
      too
      much
      to
      give
      it
      up.
      And
      he
      made
      a
      good
      point
      that
      it #8217;s
      almost
      nearly
      impossible
      to
      change
      that
      mindset
      of
      someone
      so
      I
      don #8217;t
      even
      bother
      anymore
      trying
      to
      persuade
      her.

      If
      they
      weren #8217;t
      long
      term
      friends
      I
      would #8217;ve.
      One
      genuinely
      I
      think
      wants
      to
      go
      but
      she
      gets
      bad

      so
      I
      think
      that
      might
      play
      a
      part
      in
      why
      she
      doesn #8217;t
      show.
      The
      other
      is
      just
      pure
      laziness
      and
      is
      very
      narcissistic
      and
      set
      in
      her
      ways.
      I
      might
      dump
      her
      tbh
      cause
      she #8217;s
      slowly
      getting

      Exercise
      is
      only
      a
      small
      part
      of
      losing
      weight
      honestly.
      The
      bare
      bones
      is
      calories
      in
      must
      be
      less
      than
      calories
      out.
      Sure
      exercise
      can
      help
      speed
      this
      up
      but
      the
      basics
      are
      just
      that
      simple.
      You
      don #8217;t
      need
      to
      go
      to
      the
      gym
      to
      notice
      change.
      Also
      up
      your
      protein
      intake
      as
      well.
      That
      will
      be
      way
      more
      important
      than
      just
      watching
      your
      carbs.
      Keeping
      track
      of
      all
      your
      macros
      in
      general
      is
      a
      good
      habit
      to
      get
      into.

      I
      have!
      Just
      wrapped
      up
      Year
      3
      of
      a
      LDR
      and
      hoping
      to
      close
      the
      gap
      in
      June.
      My
      family
      was
      more
      of
       #8220;what
      happens
      if
      y #8217;all
      break
      up
      though?
      You
      won #8217;t
      have
      support
      there.
      Etc.
      etc #8221;.
      My
      answer
      is
      always
      id
      rather
      try
      and
      it
      not
      go
      as
      planned
      than
      to
      not
      try
      and
      wonder
      what
      could #8217;ve
      been.
      That
      seems
      to
      quiet
      them
      a
      bit.
      That
      and
      I #8217;m
      in
      that
      time
      of
      my
      life
      where
      I #8217;m
      not
      tied
      down.
      I #8217;m
      in
      college
      and
      haven #8217;t
      started
      a
      career
      advancing
      job
      yet
      or
      have
      a
      mortgage
      or
      anything
      to
      worry
      about
      if
      I
      were
      to
      move
      where
      as
      he
      has
      all
      that
      to
      worry
      about
      so
      it
      just
      makes
      sense.
      You
      just
      tell
      them
      it #8217;s
      your
      life
      and
      you
      want
      to
      try
      and
      make
      things
      work
      because
      it #8217;s
      what
      would
      make
      you
      happy.
      And
      if
      they
      were
      true
      friends
      and
      family
      that
      want
      you
      to
      be
      happy
      then
      they #8217;ll
      understand.

      It #8217;s
      ultimately
      up
      to
      you.
      If
      you

      mind
      another
      year
      in
      school

      isn #8217;t

      for
      the
      one
      that #8217;s

      a
      lot
      more
      money
      coming
      out
      of
      it
      then
      I
      would
      choose
      the
      1
      year
      one.
      Yes
      it
      would
      be
      harder
      but
      if
      this
      is
      yalls
      future
      together
      than
      that
      one
      would
      give
      more
      financial
      stability
      (which
      finances
      can
      be
      a
      big
      burden
      on
      couples)
      Instead
      of
      being
      in
      school
      another
      year
      you #8217;ll
      be
      working
      instead
      and
      be
      able
      to
      be
      with
      your
      S.O.
      Faster.
      I
      would
      right
      the
      pros
      and
      cons
      out
      honestly
      and
      compare
      the
      two
      with
      your
      S.O.
      If
      it #8217;s
      this
      difficult
      of
      a
      choice.

      So
      I #8217;m
      wrapping
      up
      a
      3rd
      year
      of
      LDR
      being
      14hrs
      away.
      Communication
      is
      literally
      everything
      being
      that
      many
      hours
      apart.
      It #8217;s
      really
      gonna
      depend
      on
      how
      y #8217;all
      are
      functioning
      as
      an
      LDR.
      My
      boyfriend
      and
      I
      have
      lasted
      this
      long
      due
      to
      us
      not
      having
      to
      be
      side
      by
      side
      constantly
      (some
      couples
      prefer
      that)
      with
      about
      3
      trips
      a
      year
      that
      we
      take
      turns
      taking.
      Personally
      we
      Skype
      about
      3
      times
      a
      week
      depending
      and
      those
      are
      like
      actual
      sit
      down
      and
      talk
      for
      a
      couple
      of
      hours
      and
      we
      text
      when
      we
      can
      of
      course.
      But
      not
      every
      relationship
      can
      withstand
      that.
      Some
      people
      need
      that
      physical
      presence
      and
      that,
      in
      my
      opinion,
      would
      probably
      be
      the
      deciding
      factor
      in
      this.
      But
      if
      you #8217;re
      going
      to
      be
      busy
      with
      school
      and
      if
      it #8217;s
      gonna
      be
      hard
      to
      put
      that
      time
      aside
      even
      with
      only
      being
      2
      hrs
      away
      than
      I
      would
      opt
      for
      the
      12
      hr
      option.
      It #8217;s
      one
      year
      compared
      to
      two
      and
      in
      my
      opinion
      less
      painless
      that
      way.

      But
      how
      do
      people
      decide
      that
      it #8217;s
      insulting
      to
      them?
      Like
      they
      just
      go
       #8220;idk
      what
      that
      means
      but
      it
      sounds
      mean
      so
      bad! #8221;
      Or?
      Like
      I #8217;m
      an
      American
      and
      I #8217;ve
      never
      heard
      of
      nonce
      so
      I #8217;d
      probably
      just
      give
      you
      a
      weird
      look
      and
      walk
      off
      lol.
      Sorry

      As
      crappy
      as
      it
      may
      be,
      from
      the
      circumstances
      that
      your
      saying
      I
      unfortunately
      think
      he
      did
      it
      just
      to
      take
      your
      Virginity
      and
      run.
      Which
      is
      very
      very
      disgusting
      on
      his
      part.
      But
      this
      isn #8217;t
      your
      fault.
      AT
      ALL!
      You
      were
      manipulated
      into
      thinking
      he
      cared
      about
      you
      and
      loved
      you
      and
      wanted
      to
      start
      a
      future
      with
      you.
      After
      going
      through
      something
      like
      this
      which
      I #8217;m
      sure
      can
      be
      pretty
      traumatic,
      I
      would
      suggest
      completely
      cutting
      him
      off
      for
      now
      and
      getting
      some
      therapy
      to
      help
      build
      back
      up
      your
      self
      esteem
      and
      maybe
      get
      some
      better
      insight
      into
      what
      you
      need
      to
      do
      to
      help
      yourself
      and
      move
      on
      from
      this.
      And
      honestly
      if
      you
      were
      to
      try
      to
      get
      closure
      from
      him
      I
      highly
      doubt
      he
      would
      give
      you
      any,
      just
      give
      you
      the
      run
      around
      or
      try
      to
      place
      the
      blame
      on
      you.
      I #8217;m
      so
      sorry
      for
      what #8217;s
      happened
      and
      I
      hope
      you
      know
      that
      this
      isn #8217;t
      your
      fault
      and
      that
      you
      are
      amazing!
      And
      I
      hope
      you
      are
      able
      to
      get
      past
      this
      and
      build
      yourself
      back
      up
      again
      :)

      Not
      me
      but
      my
      brother:
      Him
      and
      two
      of
      his
      friends
      were
      outside
      in
      the
      front
      yard
      playing
      football.
      We
      have
      a
      cactus
      garden
      right
      at
      the
      edge
      of
      our
      porch.
      His
      friend
      threw
      it
      too
      far
      but
      my
      brother
      was
      determined
      to
      catch
      it
      so
      it
      wouldn #8217;t
      pop
      if
      it
      landed
      in
      the
      cactus
      (this
      was
      his
      3rd
      football)
      and
      took
      the
      fall
      himself
      and
      cradled
      the
      ball
      as
      he
      fell
      smack
      dab
      in
      the
      middle
      of
      the
      cactus
      garden.
      His
      ball
      survived!
      But
      he
      was
      covered
      in
      thorns.
      Took
      forever
      to
      get
      those
      pesky
      things
      off
      of
      him.

      I
      hate
      monthly
      weight
      fluctuations
      with
      a
      passion.
      I #8217;m
      a
      20
      F
      and
      started
      at
      155.
      Managed
      to
      drop
      5
      lbs
      and
      have
      put
      off
      exercising
      because
      of
      some
      personal
      stuff
      and
      just
      trying
      to
      maintain
      for
      a
      month
      before
      I
      hit
      the
      gym
      again,
      but
      every
      now
      and
      then
      for
      a
      few
      days
      I
      fluctuate
      back
      up
      towards
      155
      and
      it #8217;s
      the
      most
      obnoxious
      and
      depressing
      thing
      ever
      when
      I
      see
      the
      scale.
      I
      know
      it #8217;s
      normal
      but
      gosh
      I
      hate
      it
      so
      much.

      to
      walk
      to

      he
      tried
      to
      close
      it
      down
      for
      liability
      reasons?

      My

      did
      that!
      We
      bought
      him
      a
      big
      bed
      because
      he
      outgrew
      one
      similar
      to
      OPs
      but
      he
      prefers
      the
      small
      one
      instead
      and
      he
      looks
      like
      a
      fresh
      baked
      loaf
      of
      bread
      when
      he #8217;s

      I
      wish
      it
      was
      just
      one.
      We
      went
      through
      a
      whole
      change
      in
      management
      this
      time
      last
      year.
      All
      the
      ETLS
      got
      replaced
      except
      for
      our
      STL.
      It
      got
      to
      the
      point
      our
      new
      HR
      after
      almost
      a
      year
      couldn #8217;t
      get
      the
      schedule
      out
      on
      time
      so
      instead
      of
      the
      week
      schedule
      she
      had
      to
      tape
      out
      day
      by
      day.
      So
      if
      you
      didn #8217;t
      work
      but
      worked
      the
      next
      day
      you
      wouldn #8217;t
      know.
      It #8217;s
      been
      a
      mess.
      I
      have
      so
      many
      stories
      but
      maybe
      for
      another
      day

      So
      this
      happened
      around
      my
      2nd
      month
      at
      target
      (I #8217;ve
      been
      here
      almost
      2
      years
      now).
      I
      was
      transitioning
      out
      of
      softlines
      training
      and
      had
      girls
      by
      myself
      and
      was
      pushing
      out
      freight.
      My
      store
      just
      had
      a
      remodel
      done
      a
      couples
      days
      before
      and
      had
      added
      the
      movable
      white
      walls
      that
      are
      out
      in
      apparel.
      I #8217;m
      putting
      up
      some
      girls
      accessories
      when
      I
      started
      to
      smell
      something
      burning.
      At
      first
      I
      thought
      it
      was
      food
      ave.
      But
      it
      got
      super
      strong
      and
      smelt
      like
      it
      was
      coming
      the
      opposite
      direction
      of
      the
      lanes.
      So
      as
      I #8217;m
      turning
      to
      the
      other
      side
      of
      the
      white
      wall
      a
      guest
      starts
      screaming
      fire
      and
      I
      look
      at
      my
      clearance
      rack
      and
      this
      crazy
      lady
      had
      set
      it
      on
      fire!
      I
      try
      to
      call
      a
      code
      red
      over
      the
      walkie(funny
      enough
      we
      just
      went
      over
      codes
      in
      a
      huddle
      like
      30
      mins
      prior)
      but
      another
      TM
      kept
      interrupting
      me.
      Finally
      LOD
      tells
      them
      to
      stop
      talking
      and
      asked
      for
      the
      location.
      So
      I
      said
      girls
      clearance.
      Our
      GSTL
      runs
      over
      and
      at
      this
      point
      I
      had
      managed
      to
      get
      guests
      away
      and
      take
      off
      clothes
      from
      the
      racks
      to
      keep
      it
      from
      spreading,
      he
      grabs
      a
      shirt
      and
      tried
      to
      put
      it
      out
      by
      hitting
      it
      only
      to
      have
      the
      shirt
      catch
      on
      fire.
      My
      LOD
      who
      is
      like
      7
      months
      pregnant
      at
      this
      point
      is
      yelling
      for
      someone
      to
      grab
      a
      fire
      extinguisher
      and
      finally
      the
      cart
      attendant
      comes
      around
      and
      manages
      to
      put
      the
      fire
      out.
      However
      bEcause
      of
      the
      utter
      chaos
      this
      caused
      nobody
      was
      watching
      the
      lanes
      and
      the
      lady
      managed
      to
      walk
      out
      with
      over
      $3000
      worth
      of
      merchandise.
      Eventually
      she
      got
      caught
      but
      I
      heard
      from
      our
      AP
      she
      had
      done
      it
      to
      another
      target
      and
      a
      Walmart
      near
      us
      before
      they
      got
      her.
      So
      yeah
      needless
      to
      say
      it
      was
      pretty
      interesting
      and
      my
      mom
      was
      mad
      because
      I
      got
      a
      code
      red
      my
      first
      two
      months,
      she
      didn #8217;t
      get
      one
      for
      the
      first
      10
      years
      she
      worked
      for
      target
      lol.
      Always
      a
      cool
      story
      to
      share
      I
      think.
      And
      now
      it #8217;s
      used
      for
      training
      as
      an
      example
      when
      going
      over
      code
      Edit:
      thank
      you
      so
      much
      for
      the
      silver!
      It #8217;s
      my
      first
      time
      getting
      one!
      Ahhhh!!!!!
      *happy
      dance*

      How
      do
      you
      confront
      someone
      who
      doesn #8217;t
      do
      well
      at
      all
      with
      confrontation?
      We #8217;ve
      toyed
      with
      the
      idea
      of
      cutting
      her
      loose
      but
      the
      point
      has
      been
      brought
      up
      that
      she
      may
      mature
      and
      get
      better
      once
      she #8217;s
      forced
      to
      grow
      up
      (when
      she
      starts
      nursing
      school)
      my
      boyfriend
      made
      that
      point
      but
      she
      really
      does
      not
      do
      well
      at
      all
      with

      played
      the
      victim
      card
      before
      about
      it
      :/
      I #8217;d
      confront
      her
      if
      I
      knew
      how
      to.....

      So
      I #8217;m
      new
      to
      the
      sub
      and
      have
      just
      been
      informally
      diagnosed
      with
      IBS
      -C
      (my
      primary
      thought
      my
      flair
      up
      was
      my
      appendix
      or
      gallbladder
      but
      those
      were
      ruled
      out
      with
      testing
      so
      now
      it #8217;s
       #8220;potentially #8221;
      IBS
      C
      but
      my
      insurance
      is
      fighting
      me
      on
      seeing
      a
      specialist
      even
      with
      a
      referral
      so
      I #8217;m
      not
      formally
      diagnosed.
      My
      primary
      had
      told
      me
      to
      start
      taking
      miralax
      to
      help
      with
      my
      constipation
      and
      to
      try
      a
      pre/probiotic
      but
      I
      was
      wondering
      before
      I
      go
      out
      and
      spend
      a
      bunch
      of
      money,
      if
      anyone
      has
      had
      any
      success
      with
      this
      and
      if
      so
      what
      yalls
      recommendations
      would
      be
      on
      brand
      or
      type?
      Edit:
      Symptoms
      include
      bloating
      with
      abdominal
      pain,
      constipation
      for
      days
      to
      the
      point
      I
      slowly
      begin
      to
      look
      almost
      7
      months
      pregnant,
      followed
      by
      a
      day
      or
      two
      of
      diarrhea
      and
      then
      a
      couple
      of
      semi
      normal
      days
      before
      the
      process
      begins
      again.
      And
      constant
      tiredness
      from
      all
      the
      fluctuations

      My
      8th
      grade
      science
      teacher
      swore
      up
      and
      down
      that
      every
      time
      you
      eat
      chicken
      eggs
      that
      there
      is
      always
      a
      chicken
      embryo
      forming
      inside
      it
      so
      you #8217;re
      essentially
      eating
      an
      actual
      baby
      chicken
      every
      time.
      We
      had
      a
      30
      minute
      debate
      with
      her
      about
      this
      and
      had
      to
      pull
      the
      other
      science
      teacher
      in
      from
      next
      door
      to
      explain
      to
      her
      that
      that
      in
      fact
      is
      very
      very
      wrong.

      Yeah
      you
      would
      think
      instead
      of
      cutting
      eggs
      out
      entirely
      she
      would #8217;ve
      looked
      that
      up
      to
      make
      sure.
      I
      have

      lot
      of
      stories
      about
      teachers
      like
      that
      unfortunately.
      The
      school
      district
      didn #8217;t
      vet
      them
      out
      very
      well
      when
      hiring
      apparently

      Background:
      So
      currently
      I #8217;m
      waiting
      to
      hear
      back
      from
      a
      CNA
      program
      and
      for
      money
      I
      work
      retail
      until
      I
      hear
      back
      from
      the
      program.
      Well
      my
      boyfriends
      Uncle
      has
      2
      family
      members
      who
      need
      in
      home
      care
      24/7.
      The
      wife
      is
      all
      there
      cognitively
      but
      is
      just
      physically
      disabled
      and
      needs
      help
      to
      get
      around
      the
      house
      and
      eat.
      The
      husband
      on
      the
      other
      hand
      isn #8217;t
      really
      mentally
      all
      there
      but
      doesn #8217;t
      have
      any
      physical
      disability.
      You
      just
      have
      to
      keep
      him
      entertained
      and
      is
      apparently
      a
      super
      sweet
      guy
      (I #8217;ve
      yet
      to
      personally
      meet
      them).
      They
      pay
      $12/hr
      cash
      and
      are
      wanting
      me
      to
      watch
      them
      from
      7am-7pm
      3
      days
      a
      week.
      Btw
      this
      is
      in
      Georgia.
      I
      am
      not
      yet
      certified
      as
      a
      CNA
      which
      they #8217;re
      aware
      of
      and
      are
      ok
      with.
      I
      just
      don #8217;t
      know
      if/when
      my
      program
      starts
      how
      that #8217;ll
      all
      work
      out.
      There #8217;s
      3
      other
      caregivers
      and
      they
      rotate
      their
      days
      so
      not
      one
      person
      gets
      stuck
      on
      the
      weekends
      every
      time
      but
      I
      would
      also
      like
      to
      stay
      with
      my
      retail
      job
      at
      least
      2
      days
      a
      week
      until
      classes.
      What
      do
      y #8217;all
      think?

      I
      down
      a
      cup
      of
      coffee
      that
      had
      MCT
      oil
      in

      I
      learned
      by
      a

      I
      had
      ordered
      it
      and
      didn #8217;t
      realize

      hour
      later
      I
      was
      running
      to
      the
      bathroom.
      But
      I
      felt
      so
      much
      better
      afterwards.
      I
      just
      had
      to
      make
      sure
      I
      kept
      myself
      hydrated.
      Lots
      and
      lots
      of

      Well
      mine
      was
      a
      keto
      coffee
      that
      already
      had
      it
      in
      it.
      I
      had
      ordered
      it
      from
      a
      friend
      and
      I
      was
      not
      expecting
      that
      but
      it #8217;s
      effects
      have
      slowly
      diminished
      the
      more
      I
      use
      because
      I
      guess
      my
      gut
      bacteria
      is
      getting
      use
      to
      the
      dosage.
      You #8217;re
      not
      suppose
      to
      have
      a
      lot
      of
      the
      MCT
      portion
      otherwise
      it
      can
      do
      more
      harm
      than
      good.
      But
      it #8217;s
      definitely
      worth
      a
      shot.

      I
      actually
      ended
      up
      in
      the
      hospital
      and
      they
      had
      me
      take
      that.
      A
      worked
      for
      about
      a
      two
      months
      before
      the
      effects
      almost
      stopped
      which
      was
      sad
      because
      those
      were
      probably
      the
      most
      normal
      two

      my

      has
      a
      GA
      when
      it
      came
      back
      it
      stopped
      attacking.
      Like
      just
      stood
      there
      the
      whole
      match
      and
      didn #8217;t
      move.
      There
      was
      only
      one
      other
      character
      on
      the
      board
      so
      it #8217;s
      not
      like
      there
      wasn #8217;t
      room
      to
      move.
      Then
      it
      did
      it
      again
      the
      next
      round!
      But
      that
      time
      it
      didn #8217;t
      use
      GA.
      Then
      my

      did
      it
      but
      only
      after

      Even
      when
      I
      try
      to
      stay
      away
      from
      haulers
      I
      still
      managed
      to
      get
      hit!
      There
      was
      a
      truck
      hauling
      spare
      car
      parts
      and
      I
      was
      two
      lanes
      away
      and
      parts
      flew
      out
      and
      hit
      6
      cars!
      Mine
      being
      one
      of
      them!
      Ugh
      so
      annoyed

      Can
      attest.
      Am
      6
      years
      older
      than
      my
      brother
      and
      8
      years
      older
      than
      my
      sister.
      We
      are
      all
      super
      close
      even
      though
      I
      moved
      away.
      (They #8217;re
      still
      in
      Middle
      schools
      and
      high
      school)
      it
      was
      great
      because
      I
      can
      remember
      more
      from
      when
      they
      were
      little
      and
      was
      happy
      to
      help
      teach
      them
      to
      walk
      and
      talk
      and
      feed
      them
      when
      they
      were
      little
      and
      I
      reminisce
      in
      those
      memories
      with
      them

      Hey
      guys!
      20F
      here!
      This
      will
      be
      my
      first
      challenge
      and
      I #8217;m
      super
      excited
      for
      it!
      I
      was
      at
      my
      highest
      weight
      this
      summer
      and
      broke
      last
      the
      160
      lb
      mark.
      After
      a
      very
      stressful
      move
      from
      one
      state
      to
      another
      and
      finally
      getting
      settled
      in,
      I #8217;m
      ready
      to
      drop
      all
      that
      extra
      weight!
      I #8217;m
      at
      152
      now
      but
      hoping
      to
      get
      to
      135
      and
      think
      this
      challenge
      is
      just
      what
      I
      need
      to
      do
      that!

      Donating
      plasma
      is
      a
      good
      one
      if
      you #8217;re
      able
      to.
      I
      did
      that
      my
      first
      two
      years
      of
      college
      and
      in
      one
      month
      made
      almost
      $400.
      It #8217;s
      good
      money
      if
      you #8217;re
      consistent
      enough
      with
      it
      also
      since
      most
      places
      will
      do
      bonuses
      the
      more
      you
      go.
