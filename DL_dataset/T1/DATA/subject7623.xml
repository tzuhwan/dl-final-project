      They
      didnt
      even
      set
      the
      ps4
      version
      up
      to
      do
      well
      by
      dropping
      it
      between
      hella
      big
      3rd
      party
      games,
      not
      to
      mention
      spiderman
      one
      of
      sonys
      most
      hyped
      exclusives.
      So
      im
      not
      expecting
      this
      game
      to
      do
      well
      here
      atm.
      Switch
      is
      prolly
      its
      best
      shot
      if
      it
      drops
      in
      an
      empty
      month.

      Not
      going
      to
      lie,
      as
      a
      dragon
      quest
      fan.
      The
      3ds
      version
      is
      actually
      better,
      on
      top
      of
      essentially
      having
      a
      snes
      version
      of
      the
      game,
      an
      entire
      town
      is
      cut
      out
      of
      the
      ps4
      version
      that
      allows
      you
      to
      visit
      areas
      of
      past
      dragon
      quest

      I
      wouldnt
      doubt
      it.
      They
      need
      all
      the
      reasons
      they
      can
      to
      get
      people
      to
      double
      dip
      on
      the
      game
      after
      ps4/3ds
      versions
      in
      japan.
      Edit:
      You
      guys
      gotta
      realize
      they
      are
      tryin
      to
      sell
      Dragon
      Quest
      XI
      to
      japan
      a
      third
      time
      probably
      2
      years
      after
      its
      release.
      I
      fully
      believe
      they
      would
      add
      as
      much
      as
      they
      can
      to
      push
      another
      sale.
      Its
      not
      about
      the
      west,
      the
      series
      isnt
      popular
      here.
      Ive
      waited
      years
      for
      DQ
      games
      to
      come
      and
      some
      of
      them
      not
      ever
      showing
      up
      (doesnt
      help
      its
      popularity
      chances
      by
      dropping
      it
      near
      spiderman
      either).
      Japan
      is
      their
      target
      and
      the
      Switch
      is
      popular
      there.
      Theres
      a
      reason
      why
      the
      ps4
      didnt
      get
      a
      mode
      that
      was
      a
      snes
      version
      of
      the
      game,
      an
      extra
      dungeon,
      a
      town
      with
      sidequests
      that
      let
      you
      visit
      past
      towns
      in
      other
      dragon
      quest
      games.
      There
      are
      various
      reasons
      why
      the
      3ds
      versions
      didnt
      get
      alot
      of
      features
      the
      jp
      ps4
      version
      got
      like
      more
      town
      exploration,
      a
      crossbow
      aim
      mode,
      the
      world
      being
      more
      like
      an
      ecosystem
      etc.
      Hell,
      even
      our
      western
      version
      got
      a
      sprint
      function,
      and
      voice
      acting
      to
      make
      it
      different.
      They
      try
      to
      make
      the
      versions
      different
      enough
      to
      warrant
      a
      purchase.
      With
      the
      switch
      version
      pretty
      much
      being
      built
      in
      UE4
      more
      than
      likey
      theyll
      just
      just
      do
      a
      best
      of
      both
      worlds
      situation
      and
      throw
      in
      the
      soundtrack
      to
      get
      people
      to
      want
      to
      buy
      the
      game
      the
      third
      time.
      I
      would
      totally
      not
      be
      suprised
      if
      they
      did
      that
      is
      what
      im
      saying.

      Its
      not
      about
      selling
      a
      switch.
      Its
      about
      getting
      people
      to
      triple
      dip,
      the
      switch
      is
      already
      popular
      in
      japan.
      Japan
      has
      had
      two
      versions
      of
      the
      Dragon
      Quest
      XI
      and
      they
      are
      planning
      a
      third
      one
      for
      switch.
      The
      west
      is
      not
      their
      main
      audience,
      Japan
      is
      their
      number
      1
      target.
      I
      could
      totally
      see
      them
      having
      an
      orchestrated
      soundtrack
      among
      other
      things
      in
      order
      to
      try
      to
      sell
      this
      game
      to
      japan
      for
      a
      third
      time.

      To

      think
      seeing
      Venusaur
      actually
      move
      that

      and
      dq8
      here.
      Why
      would
      they
      drop
      another
      game
      on
      a

      dragon

      out

      if
      we
      see

      on

      a

      in
      the
      west.
      With
      the
      switch
      version
      not
      ready
      they
      only
      have
      3ds
      and
      ps4.
      With
      two
      failed
      attempts
      on
      3ds
      already,
      they
      decided
      to
      opt
      for
      ps4
      and
      go
      with
      steam
      as
      well.

      No
      i
      am
      considering
      those.
      You
      are
      comparing
      stats
      of
      an
      american
      release
      of
      a
      3ds
      game
      (released
      within
      the
      last
      2
      years)
      vs
      an
      american
      release
      of
      a
      ps1
      and
      a
      ps2
      game
      (which
      released
      14
      years
      ago).The
      ps1
      and
      ps2
      are
      not
      getting
      dqxi,
      the
      ps4
      is
      they
      dont
      know
      how
      it
      will
      do
      but
      felt
      it
      was
      better
      off
      trying
      there
      rather
      than
      attempting
      the
      3ds
      again.
      You
      cant
      blanket
      statement
      the
      audience
      of
      two
      different
      consoles.
      For
      example
      DQ9
      sold
      really
      well
      on
      the
      ds
      in
      america,
      3ds
      dq
      games
      did
      not.
      You
      also
      shouldnt
      be
      looking
      at
      ratios
      as
      a
      measure
      because
      if
      a
      ps4
      version
      in
      japan
      sold
      4
      and
      1
      in
      us
      vs
      4M
      japan
      and
      1M
      us
      on
      a
      nintendo
      console.
      The
      ratio
      is
      the
      same,
      but
      clearly
      one
      did
      horrible.
      Also
      PS
      sales
      have
      little
      to
      no
      relevance
      at
      all
      since
      the
      ps
      sales
      didnt
      affect
      the
      3ds
      not
      getting
      dqxi
      port.
      If
      the
      3ds
      games
      would
      have
      sold
      well,
      then
      the
      west
      would
      also
      be
      getting
      dq
      on
      the
      3ds.
      The
      3ds
      outsold
      the
      ps4
      version,
      but
      not
      by
      too
      much
      in
      japan
      (which
      was
      suprising).
      Considering
      that
      home
      consoles
      are
      more
      popular
      in
      the
      west
      (playstation
      even
      more
      im
      europe),
      and
      both
      recent
      3ds
      releases
      having
      around
      .25M
      sales.
      What
      sense
      does
      it
      make
      to
      drop
      a
      3ds
      version
      in
      the
      west
      when
      the
      ps4
      is
      more
      popular
      and
      the
      switch
      is
      becoming
      a
      hit
      as
      well.
      I'm
      not
      saying
      I
      don't
      want
      Dragon
      Quest
      11
      on
      the
      3DS
      but
      I
      am
      saying
      is
      that
      the
      decision
      made
      sense.
      Im
      more
      upset
      they
      announced
      it
      on
      NX
      and
      they
      still
      have
      nothing
      to
      show
      for
      it.

      After
      playing
      persona
      4
      golden
      on
      the
      vita
      and
      persona
      3
      portable,
      Im
      convinced
      persona
      is
      much
      more
      suitable
      for
      handhelds
      than
      home
      consoles.
      So
      hopefully
      either
      Sony
      drops
      a
      new
      handheld,
      or
      they
      bring
      persona
      to
      switch
      too.

      I
      hate
      to
      be
      that
      guy,
      everyone
      blaming
      him
      for
      rushing
      so
      quick
      to
      platinum.
      But
      to
      be
      honest,
      its
      just
      a
      very
      quick
      and
      easy
      game
      to
      platinum.
      Unless
      you
      just
      actively
      think
      the
      backpacks
      are
      boring,
      ignore
      crimes,
      dont
      like
      the
      challenges,and
      dont
      feel
      like
      exploring,
      You
      are
      making
      progress
      to
      100%.
      The
      only
      difference
      being
      that
      some
      people
      pad
      out
      the
      game
      longer
      by
      just
      webswinging
      and
      doing
      the
      photo
      mode
      and
      putting
      off
      content.

      Kinda
      surprised
      its
      not
      comin
      to
      switch.
      Usually
      when
      a
      franchise
      gets
      a
      rep
      in
      smash
      a
      huge
      boost
      in
      interest
      comes
      for
      that
      particular
      franchise.
      Partnered
      with
      switch
      still
      being
      in
      early
      console
      life
      seems
      like
      a
      pretty
      good
      place
      to
      also
      put
      it.
      But
      as
      long
      as
      we
      get
      it
      im
      happy.

      Im
      confused.
      Isnt
      the
      entire
      point
      of
      this
      game
      to
      provide
      new
      go
      players,
      very
      young
      players,
      and
      old
      players
      who
      fell
      out
      of
      pokemon
      years
      ago
      an
      entrance
      point
      to
      how
      pokemon
      is
      today
      while
      minimizing
      the
      amount
      of
      entry
      barriers
      to
      the
      game?
      I
      dont
      see
      how
      being
      a
      casual
      introduction
      game
      is
      a
      bad
      thing,
      so
      why
      are
      people
      treating
      it
      like
      a
      bad
      thing?

      Right
      but
      the
      entire
      game
      is
      designed
      around
      a
      specific
      set
      of
      people.
      Which
      by
      design
      choices
      are
      very
      young
      players
      and
      Go
      players.
      All
      the
      games
      are
      good
      entrance
      points
      because
      they
      are
      always
      designed
      assuming
      you
      dont
      know
      how
      to
      play
      pokemon.
      But
      this
      one
      in
      particular
      is
      for
      getting
      Go
      players
      to
      transition
      into
      the
      main
      games
      which
      is
      why
      alot
      of
      the
      changes
      are
      made
      to
      resemble
      Go
      alot.
      It
      has
      nothing
      to
      do
      with
      the
      game
      being
      easy
      cuz
      all
      of
      them
      are
      easy
      like
      you
      said.
      They
      are
      trying
      to
      make
      the
      game
      as
      appealing
      as
      possible
      to
      Go
      players
      which
      is
      why
      they
      told
      us
      from
      the
      beginning
      gen
      8
      was
      still
      coming
      and
      this
      isnt
      how
      pokemon
      is
      going
      to
      progress.
      There
      is
      no
      real
      reason
      for
      hardcore
      fans
      to
      be
      upset
      about
      this
      game
      other
      than
      us
      just
      being
      impatient.

      Good,
      from
      the
      TGS
      footage
      i
      saw
      it
      needed

      Kanto
      in
      HD
      is
      cool
      i
      guess.
      But
      it
      doesnt
      warrant
      $60
      imo
      especially
      when
      Kanto
      had
      the
      least
      amount
      of
      post
      game
      of
      any
      pokemon
      game,
      not
      to
      mention
      this
      game
      actually
      losing
      stuff
      you
      can
      do
      post
      game
      like
      breeding.
      So
      im
      hoping
      at
      least
      they
      add
      another
      story
      bit
      like
      the
      delta
      episode
      or
      something
      and
      its
      not
      just
      "Fight
      Mewtwo".
      The
      cutscenes
      look
      so
      much
      better
      than
      S/M
      tho.
      EDIT:

      Because
      we
      know
      for
      sure
      breeding,
      battle
      spot,
      wondertrade
      and
      stuff
      isnt
      in,
      since
      those
      were
      officially
      confirmed.
      Meltan
      could
      possibly
      add
      something
      when
      you
      capture
      it
      but
      there
      is
      no
      evidence
      of
      that
      yet.
      There
      is
      probably
      no
      battle
      tower
      like
      FR/LG
      since
      we
      dont
      have
      ability
      or
      held
      items
      either.
      The
      only
      thing
      officially
      confirmed
      is
      the
      battle
      vs
      mewtwo
      and
      thats
      the
      only
      post
      game
      kanto
      really
      had
      in
      gen1.
      So
      for
      $60
      i
      hope
      they
      added
      something
      else
      too.

      you

      They
      had
      alot
      more
      than
      this
      and
      at
      a
      lower
      price
      too.
      So
      i
      doubt
      this
      is
      the
      only
      thing
      they
      have
      for
      post
      game.

      Mat
      from
      NPD
      mentioned
      that
      DQ
      XI
      earned
      over
      double
      the
      revenue
      of
      any
      past
      DQ,
      including
      previous
      best
      (DQ
      IX).
      However,
      what
      Mat
      may
      have
      overlooked
      is
      that
      NPD
      used
      to
      give
      sales
      numbers
      for
      some
      games
      back
      in
      2010:
      http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/29893/Nintendo_Titles_Again_Reign_Over_NPD_Top_20_In_July.php
      Apparently
      DQ
      9
      sold
      132,000
      copies
      in
      NA
      in
      July
      2010.
      This
      would,
      at
      a
      $40
      price
      tag,
      translate
      to
      $5.28
      million
      in
      revenue.
      Double
      this
      would
      be
      $10.56
      million.
      At
      $60
      per
      copy
      of
      PS4,
      we
      can
      safely
      say
      this
      is
      at
      least
      176,000
      units
      in
      NA
      on
      PS4.
      However
      the
      tweet
      is
      "more
      than
      double",
      so
      176,000
      units
      is
      kind
      of
      the
      low
      end.
      However,
      we
      can
      safely
      assume
      that
      if
      it
      had
      been
      "more
      than
      triple",
      then
      Mat
      would
      have
      said
      as
      much,
      so
      it's
      likely
      less
      than
      264,000
      copies
      ($5.28
      million
      *
      3
      /
      $60).
      I
      think
      it's
      probably
      closer
      to
      176,000
      than
      264,000
      as
      if
      it
      was
      250,000
      he
      might
      have
      said
      "close
      to
      triple",
      but
      that's
      speculation.
      Thus,
      the
      estimate
      for
      PS4
      copies
      in
      NA
      using
      NPD
      numbers
      is
      nearly
      confirmed
      to
      be
      somewhere
      between
      176,000
      and
      264,000.
      This
      lines
      up
      VERY
      closely
      with
      my
      above
      estimate
      of
      175,000
      to
      250,000
      based
      on
      NPD
      placement
      and
      estimated
      Super
      Mario
      sales,
      so
      I
      think
      we
      have
      a
      pretty
      solid
      foundation
      for
      the
      total
      number
      of
      US
      PS4
      copies
      +
      Worldwide
      PC
      copies.
      We
      still
      don't
      have
      much
      information
      on
      Europe
      /
      other
      parts
      of
      the
      world
      beside
      them
      showing
      up
      as
      #2
      on
      the
      weekly
      charts
      and
      then
      disappearing
      below
      top
      10.
      The
      estimated
      number
      would
      include
      the
      US
      PC/Steam
      sales
      too.

      I
      personally
      dont
      care
      if
      its
      random
      or
      overworld
      tbh.
      But
      I
      will
      say,
      if
      they
      plan
      to
      do
      overworld
      encounters
      the
      world
      needs
      to
      be
      bigger
      as
      well
      as
      a
      lower
      spawn
      rate.
      When
      you
      dont
      have
      the
      room
      to
      actually
      avoid
      stuff
      in
      dungeons
      it
      is
      actually
      worse
      than
      random
      encounters.

      I
      think
      it's
      going
      to
      depend
      on
      how
      much
      they
      are
      actually
      adding
      to
      the
      switch
      version.
      If
      it's
      just
      VA
      and
      the
      marriage
      thing
      then
      they
      might
      sell
      it
      as
      dlc.
      Otherwise
      I'm
      not
      too
      sure.
      Probably
      wont
      tho
      due
      to
      give
      a
      reason
      to
      actually
      buy
      the
      switch
      version
      after
      spending
      that
      time
      pretty
      much
      making
      it
      over
      from
      the
      ground
      on
      switch.

      Because
      people
      take
      stuff
      from
      reddit
      and
      [repost
      it](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/079/173/ed2.png)
      on
      other
      social
      media
      sites
      without
      giving
      credit.
      So
      its
      literally
      just
      a
      safety
      precaution.
      Most
      of
      the
      times
      if
      I
      have
      to
      put

      no
      work
      to
      actual
      put
      something
      together
      its
      not
      worth
      a
      watermark.
      Not
      like
      this
      is
      the
      most
      impressive
      video
      edit
      I've
      done
      or
      anything,
      but
      I
      like
      to
      feel
      the
      time
      I
      put
      into
      making
      this
      isnt
      just
      attributed
      to
      someone
      else
      when
      they
      100%
      had
      no
      part
      in
      the

      and
      I
      hope
      they
      patch
      in
      a
      workaround
      the
      way
      Rocket
      League
      has.
      It's
      just
      really
      dissapointing
      that
      I
      can't
      consistenly
      be
      on
      the
      same
      TEAM
      as
      my
      2
      friends
      in
      a
      TEAM
      racing
      game.
      The
      only
      way
      we
      can
      even
      play
      on
      the
      same
      team
      is
      to
      do
      Private
      Matches
      and
      play
      against
      AI.
      TL;DRThe
      Switch
      version
      of
      Team
      Sonic
      Racing
      online
      is
      gimped.
      It's
      easier
      to
      get
      3
      friends
      and
      play
      Turf
      War
      on
      the
      same
      team
      in
      Splatoon
      2
      than
      it
      is
      to
      team
      up
      and
      play
      against
      other
      teams
      online
      in
      Team
      Sonic
      Racing.

      Honestly
      not
      even
      suprised.

      dont
      wanna
      abandon
      my
      friends

      both
      really
      wanted
      it
      on
      switch
      and
      cross
      play
      isnt

      for
      this

      From
      what
      I'm
      getting
      from
      the
      game
      there
      are
      2
      modes,
      Custom
      lobby
      and
      Regular
      matchmaking.
      From
      what
      I'm
      told
      the
      ps4/xbone
      version
      has
      the
      ability
      to
      party
      with
      friends
      up
      to
      6
      people
      and
      take
      their
      teams
      into
      the
      regular
      matchmaking
      mode.
      The
      switch
      version
      (and
      apparently
      the
      PC
      version)
      does
      not
      have
      this
      option.
      The
      only
      other
      way
      to
      consistently
      be
      able
      to
      play
      on
      the
      same
      team
      is
      by
      holding
      custom
      lobbies
      where
      they
      can
      join
      you
      there
      which
      is
      part
      of
      all
      versions
      of
      the
      game.
      There
      doesnt
      seem
      to
      be
      a
      way
      to
      take
      custom
      game
      lobbies
      into
      regular
      matchmaking
      and
      only
      people
      from
      the
      friend
      list
      can
      join
      so
      you
      cant
      play
      against
      randoms.
