      I'm
      just
      done
      with
      this
      life.
      With
      this
      body
      and
      the
      choices
      it's
      made.
      I
      don't
      believe
      in
      heaven
      or
      hell,
      if
      anything
      I
      believe
      in
      reincarnation
      but
      honestly
      I
      don't
      care
      what
      happens
      next.
      But
      it's
      even
      easier
      to
      want
      to
      die
      when
      I
      believe
      that
      this
      story
      will
      end
      but
      maybe
      I'll
      get
      the
      chance
      to
      start
      a
      new
      story.
      I
      work
      in
      the
      mental
      health
      field.
      I
      work
      for
      an
      inpatient
      crisis
      stabilization
      hospital,
      and
      every
      work
      day
      I
      answer
      the
      phone
      and
      help
      people
      in
      active
      crisis-
      by
      either
      just
      talking
      to
      them,
      offering
      resources,
      or
      getting
      them
      into
      a
      bed
      at
      my
      hospital.
      I've
      talked
      my
      fair
      share
      of
      people
      off
      the
      ledge,
      I
      know
      all
      the
      things
      to
      say
      and
      I've
      been
      saying
      them
      to
      myself
      over
      and
      over
      the
      past
      year.
      Maybe
      that's
      why
      now
      none
      of
      the
      words
      mean
      anything
      anymore.
      I
      was
      inpatient
      myself
      last
      year
      after
      a
      passive
      suicide
      attempt.
      But
      what
      I'm
      feeling
      now
      is
      even
      more
      hopeless
      than
      it
      was
      a
      year
      ago.
      I'm
      just
      done
      trying,
      done
      caring,
      I
      just
      want
      everything
      to
      be
      over.
      I
      have
      my
      plan,
      though
      not
      all
      the
      items
      needed
      to
      carry
      it
      out.
      The
      only
      thing
      keeping
      me
      from
      leaving
      work
      right
      now
      and
      being
      done
      with
      it
      all,
      is
      my
      parents.
      This
      will
      destroy
      them.
      But
      how
      long
      can
      I
      keep
      "living"
      in
      this
      pit,
      dreaming
      about
      it
      being
      over-
      when
      I'm
      only
      doing
      it
      for
      someone
      else?
      I've
      started
      writing
      letters
      to
      people.
      One
      common
      thing
      I've
      come
      to
      realize
      is
      no
      one
      did
      anything
      wrong
      to
      me.
      You
      know
      how
      a
      lot
      of
      suicidal
      people
      have
      been
      beaten
      down,
      made
      to
      feel
      insignificant,
      don't
      have
      a
      support
      system?
      That's
      not
      the
      case
      for
      me.
      I
      have
      a
      support
      system.
      I
      have
      parents
      who
      raise
      me
      up.
      I
      have
      friends.
      I'm
      not
      dealing
      with
      PTSD,
      or
      some
      traumatic
      event.
      I
      know
      I'm
      not
      alone.
      I
      just
      hate
      myself,
      and
      see
      absolutely
      no
      future,
      nor
      do
      I
      want
      one.
      I'm
      not
      asking
      for
      help,
      I
      just
      needed
      to
      write
      it
      out.
      Needed
      to
      try
      and
      explain
      everything
      in
      my
      head,
      maybe
      it
      would
      make
      more
      sense
      after
      I
      wrote
      it.
      Or
      maybe
      I
      would
      feel
      lighter
      and
      more
      hopeful.
      Maybe.

      at

      He's
      located
      at
      the
      old
      Rainier
      Brewery.
      He
      is
      a
      painter
      by
      trade,
      and
      it
      is
      definitely
      seen
      in
      his
      tattoo
      work.
      I've
      had
      about
      $5000
      worth
      of
      work
      down
      from
      him
      so
      far.
      I
      can
      guarantee
      if
      you
      work
      with
      him
      he
      will
      give
      you
      something
      breathtaking
      and
      unique
      to
      just
      you.

      I
      work
      at
      a
      behavioral
      health
      hospital.
      Our
      facility
      helps
      people
      struggling
      with
      suicidal
      thoughts,
      anxiety,
      depression,
      as
      well
      as
      people
      struggling
      with
      active
      psychosis.
      It's
      a
      crisis
      stabilization
      hospital-
      meaning
      it's
      short
      term
      (5-7
      days)
      to
      help
      a
      person
      mentally
      get
      back
      to
      a
      safe
      and
      stable
      place-
      and
      then
      get
      them
      set
      out
      with
      outpatient
      services.
      I
      explain
      this
      for
      two
      reasons:
      One,
      so
      you
      know,
      that
      I
      know,
      what
      I'm
      talking
      about.
      Two,
      If
      you
      would
      like
      any
      further
      information,
      or
      a
      recommendation
      for
      a
      facility
      in
      your
      state-
      I
      would
      be
      happy
      to
      help.
      The
      original
      question
      though!
      Mental
      health
      is
      the
      same
      as
      physical
      health
      when
      it
      comes
      to
      a
      patients
      HIPAA
      rights.
      The
      hospital
      will
      not
      share
      any
      of
      your
      medical
      information
      without
      your
      consent.
      So
      you
      don't
      have
      to
      share
      anything
      with
      anyone
      you
      don't
      want
      to.
      Legally,
      your
      employer
      cannot
      discriminate
      against
      you
      because
      of
      a
      mental
      illness.
      And
      if
      it
      is
      available
      to
      you,
      the
      hospital
      could
      help
      you
      get
      FMLA
      or
      short
      term
      leave.
      Of
      course
      there
      are
      lots
      of
      loopholes,
      and
      I
      could
      be
      specific
      with
      you
      if
      I
      knew
      your
      state
      and
      job.
      But
      basically,
      that's
      the
      jist
      of
      it.
      Hope
      I
      didn't
      word
      vomit
      all
      over
      you-
      these
      are
      the
      questions
      I
      answer
      on
      a
      daily
      basis
      at
      work.
      Let
      me
      know
      if
      you
      have
      any
      questions
      or
      want
      more
      information,
      or
      just
      to
      talk
      to
      someone
      who
      gets
      it.
      Cheers!

      So
      the
      past
      couple
      months
      I've
      been
      re
      reading
      books
      from
      my
      childhood
      and
      adolescence,
      books
      that
      shaped
      my
      obsession
      for
      reading.
      Stories
      that
      I'm
      so
      sure
      I
      remember,
      then
      read
      them
      again
      years!
      later
      and
      I'm
      blown
      away.
      The
      list
      so
      far:
      Harry
      Potter
      Hatchet
      (actually
      all
      5
      books
      of
      Brian's
      Saga)
      The
      Giver
      (and
      its
      three
      "sequels")
      Island
      of
      the
      Blue
      Dolphins
      Protector
      of
      the
      Small
      series
      by
      Tamora
      Pierce
      Where
      the
      Red
      Fern
      Grows
      Beautiful
      Joe
      Number
      the
      Stars
      Julie
      of
      the
      Wolves
      To
      Kill
      a
      Mockingbird
      Fellow
      readers,
      do
      you
      have
      any
      suggestions
      for
      books
      to
      put
      on
      my
      list?
      Preferably
      I'm
      looking
      for
      short
      stories,
      or
      books
      that
      were
      read
      in
      grammar
      or
      middle
      school.

      Hello
      there
      community!
      I'm
      basically
      brand
      new
      to
      the
      vaping
      scene,
      and
      haven't
      been
      very
      lucky
      in
      finding
      the
      answers
      to
      my
      questions
      on
      Google.
      I
      was
      hoping
      someone
      would
      be
      kind
      enough
      to
      answer
      a
      couple!
      I
      just
      purchased
      a
      Smok
      ProColor
      225w
      with
      a
      Smok
      TFV8
      Baby
      Beast
      tank.
      It
      was
      a
      coworkers
      spare
      that
      she
      sold
      me
      at
      a
      super
      great
      price.
      I've
      been
      playing
      around
      with
      it
      today,
      but
      still
      have
      a
      few
      questions.
      Firstly,
      what
      does
      the
      Watt
      setting
      exactly
      mean?
      Bigger
      smoke?
      Harsher
      smoke?
      Neither
      of
      those
      things?
      And
      what
      is
      the
      benefit
      to
      using
      a
      lower
      or
      higher
      watt
      level?
      Also,
      In
      the
      Mode
      setting
      there
      are
      five
      different
      options
      for
      me
      to
      choose:
      W,
      Ti,
      Wi,
      SS,
      and
      M.
      What
      do
      these
      options
      mean,
      what
      does
      it
      change
      and
      how
      does
      it
      change
      my
      vaping?
      On
      W
      mode
      it
      asks
      if
      I
      want
      to
      preheat?
      On
      Ti,
      Wi,
      and
      SS
      is
      also
      has
      the
      acronyms
      TCR-
      what
      does
      this
      mean?
      And
      then
      on
      M
      mode
      is
      states
      "mem".
      What
      does
      all
      this
      mean?
      I
      apologize
      for
      what
      are
      probably
      very
      noob
      questions,
      but
      hope
      someone
      would
      be
      willing
      to
      educate
      me.
      I
      also
      wanna
      say
      thanks
      in
      advance
      to
      anyone
      who
      will
      take
      the
      time!
      Any
      other
      hints,
      tips,
      or
      bit
      of
      education
      would
      be
      so
      greatly
      appreciated!
      Thanks
      all!

      Suggestion
      for
      dyslexic
      uncle

      This
      past
      week
      I
      have
      spent
      more
      time
      with
      my
      uncle
      than
      ever
      before
      in
      my
      life.
      We
      smoked
      and
      chatted
      on
      the
      back
      porch
      a
      lot.
      One
      thing
      we
      talked
      about
      was
      how
      much
      I
      love
      to
      read.
      You
      see
      I'm
      an
      avid
      reader
      (150
      books
      read
      this
      year
      so
      far)
      and
      my
      uncle
      was
      really
      interested
      in
      why
      I
      read
      so
      much.
      Other
      than
      just
      loving
      to
      read,
      I
      also
      love
      to
      escape
      into
      a
      fictional
      world.
      My
      uncle
      is
      severely
      dyslexic,
      he
      can
      barely
      write
      and
      can't
      read
      at
      all.
      Something
      he
      shared
      with
      me
      is
      how
      ashamed
      this
      makes
      him
      feel,
      and
      how
      he
      has
      always
      wanted
      to
      get
      lost
      in
      a
      book
      but
      can't.
      He
      isn't
      very
      technologucal
      and
      has
      never
      tried
      audiobooks.
      I
      would
      love
      to
      give
      him
      an
      audiobook
      this
      Christmas
      but
      have
      no
      clue
      where
      to
      start.
      I
      read
      mostly
      fantasy
      and
      I
      don't
      think
      he
      would
      really
      enjoy
      those
      types
      of
      books.
      I'm
      thinking
      something
      relativly
      short
      but
      engaging.
      My
      uncle
      has
      been
      a
      union
      glazer
      in
      Chicago
      for
      35
      years,
      he's
      a
      guys
      guy
      who
      has
      a
      short
      fuse,
      smokes
      a
      lot
      of
      cigarettes,
      drinks
      a
      lot
      of
      bee,
      and
      loves
      to
      laugh.
      All
      he
      knows
      is
      how
      to
      work
      with
      his
      hands,
      and
      would
      do
      anything
      for
      his
      family.
      Community
      would
      you
      have
      any
      suggestions
      for
      me?

      the

      book
      that
      came

      It's
      about
      female

      who
      are
      very

      For

      birthday
      my
      sister
      sent
      me
      her
      Playbill

      went

      Today
      I
      matted
      and

      I'm
      totally
      loving
      this
      theory.
      I
      would
      love
      for
      Nick
      to
      end
      up
      being
      Beta-
      though
      he
      very
      much
      does
      not
      have
      the
      same
      body
      structure
      (Beta
      being
      absolutely
      massive
      and
      towers
      over
      Negan).
      I
      can
      very
      much
      see
      Nick
      being
      a
      Whisperer,
      the
      character
      development
      is
      all
      right
      there.
      And
      maybe
      none
      of
      the
      Fear
      characters
      are
      ones
      we
      know
      from
      the
      comics,
      maybe
      they
      helped
      create
      the
      society
      of
      Whispers
      only
      for
      Alpha
      to
      come
      in
      and
      kill
      one
      or
      more
      of
      them
      to
      take
      her
      place
      as
      leader.

      There
      is
      an
      amazing
      show
      from
      Netflix
      Brazil
      called
      3%
      that
      is
      filmed
      in
      Spanish.
      I

      You
      can
      try
      Armada,
      also
      by
      Ernest
      Cline.
      I
      didn't
      find
      it
      quite
      as
      compelling
      as
      Ready
      Player
      One,
      but
      it
      was
      definitely
      entertaining.

      Very
      simple,
      easy
      to
      read
      books
      but
      "The
      Hatchet"
      by
      Gary
      Paulsen
      is
      your
      quitesensial
      survival
      book.
      There
      are
      actually
      five
      books
      in
      total,
      all
      part
      of
      "Brian's
      Saga".
      I
      re-read
      them
      all
      this
      past
      year
      (as
      an
      adult)
      and
      enjoyed
      them
      just
      as
      much
      as
      I
      did
      when
      I
      was
      a
      kid.

      Finally
      got
      some
      medication
      to
      help
      my
      severe
      anxiety.
      First
      little
      bit
      of
      relief
      in
      two
      weeks.
      Finally
      gave
      in
      and
      relapses
      two
      days
      ago-
      it'd
      been
      about
      six
      months.
      First
      night
      did
      some
      minor
      scratching
      and
      a
      couple
      barely
      there
      cuts.
      Not
      much
      stayed.
      But
      the
      release
      I
      got
      from
      it
      at
      the
      time
      was
      amazing.
      Got
      little
      sleep
      still,
      and
      was
      a
      mess
      at
      work-
      ended
      up
      coming
      home
      early
      and
      sleeping
      about
      14
      hours.
      Then
      last
      night
      I
      cut,
      small
      shallow
      lines.
      The
      relief
      was
      still
      there
      but
      so
      was
      pain
      this
      time.
      Typically
      this
      is
      why
      I
      scratch
      (or
      use
      sandpaper),
      it
      just
      feels
      better.
      Today
      I
      was
      constantly
      looking
      at
      them,
      or
      touching
      them
      to
      make
      sure
      they
      were
      still
      there.
      After
      work
      today
      I
      went
      to
      the
      ER
      (I
      live
      in
      a
      super
      small
      town
      and
      that's
      the
      only
      thing
      open
      at
      9pm)
      to
      get
      me
      a
      script
      to
      last
      me
      the
      weekend
      until
      my
      physician
      can
      write
      me
      something.
      So
      basically
      right
      now
      I'm
      feeling
      the
      best
      I
      have
      in
      weeks.
      Not
      manic
      or
      euphoric,
      or
      particulary
      happy-
      but
      not
      in
      a
      near
      constant
      state
      of
      needing
      to
      flee
      panic.
      But,
      all
      night
      (and
      most
      of
      the
      day)
      I've
      been
      thinking
      about
      self
      harming.
      Since
      I
      got
      home,
      I've
      been
      carrying
      my
      knife
      in
      my
      pocket.
      Feeling
      it.
      Wants
      so
      badly
      to
      use
      it.
      But
      I
      don't
      /need/
      it.
      I
      use
      self
      harm
      to
      help
      control
      my
      anxiety
      and
      get
      me
      calm,
      that's
      the
      excuse
      I
      allow
      myself.
      But
      now
      I
      am
      calm-
      I
      don't
      need
      to
      do
      something
      else
      to
      refocus
      me.
      But
      it's
      all
      I
      can
      think
      about,
      and
      all
      I
      want
      to
      do.
      /sigj/
      who
      ever
      said
      self
      harm
      wasn't
      an
      addiction,
      has
      apparently
      never
      truly
      felt
      self
      harm
      compulsions,
      or
      has
      never
      felt
      addiction.
