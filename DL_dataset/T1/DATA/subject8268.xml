      I #8217;m
      not
      using
      a
      throw
      away.
      Why?
      Bc
      everyone
      who
      does
      know
      me
      knows
      my
      story.
      So,
      while
      late
      to
      this
      party,
      here
      it
      goes:
      I
      didn #8217;t
      find
      out
      until
      much
      later
      in
      life
      that
      my
      sperm
      donor
      was
      actually
      married
      and
      my
      mom
      was
      the
      affair.
      She
      didn #8217;t
      know
      either...
      ...
      That
      is,
      until
      my
      dad #8217;s
      wife
      died
      in
      the
      same
      hospital
      I
      was
      born
      in.
      He
      left.
      My
      mom
      raised
      me.
      Last
      time
      I
      saw
      him
      consistently
      was
      at
      3.
      Mom
      told
      him
      to
      get
      out
      bc
      he
      was
      drunk
      and
      kept
      speaking
      in
      Spanish
      to
      me.
      I
      have
      brothers
      and
      sisters,
      aunts
      and
      uncles
      in
      Georgia
      I #8217;ve
      never
      met.
      When
      I
      was
      18,
      I
      saw
      him
      for
      the
      last
      time.
      He
      gave
      me
      some
      crap
      story
      about
      family
      and
      history
      and
      that
      I
      shouldn #8217;t
      be
      ashamed
      of
      my
      last
      name.
      He
      drove
      off
      and
      I
      never
      saw
      him
      again...
      I
      turned
      25
      in
      2010.
      That
      year,
      I
      found
      out
      my
      girlfriend
      was
      pregnant.
      I
      had
      nothing.
      No
      job,
      barely
      a
      car,
      no
      money,
      and
      no
      way
      to
      support
      a
      child.
      I
      swore
      I
      would
      never
      turn
      out
      like
      my
      father.
      He
      died
      in
      April
      of
      2010.
      Massive
      heart
      attack.
      Heard
      it
      second
      hand
      from
      my
      god-father.
      Contacted
      a
      relative
      down
      there
      to
      get
      funeral
      info.
      Never
      heard
      back.
      My
      daughter
      was
      born
      in
      September
      of
      2010.
      And
      yes,
      I
      have
      been
      with
      her
      almost
      every
      day
      of
      her
      life.
      Her
      mother
      and
      I
      got
      married
      in
      2011.
      Still
      together
      to
      this
      day
      and
      in
      more
      love
      everyday
      for
      it.
      I
      couldn #8217;t
      imagine
      abandoning
      my
      child
      for
      any
      reason.
      My
      wife
      stuck
      with
      me
      thru
      countless
      jobs
      and
      hardships
      always
      supporting
      my
      decisions
      along
      the
      way.
      We
      welcomed
      our
      second
      child
      in
      2015.
      That
      same
      year,
      I
      celebrated
      4
      years
      at
      the
      company
      I
      still
      work
      for.
      I
      always
      told
      her
      if
      I
      made
      enough
      money,
      she #8217;d
      never
      work
      again,
      besides
      taking
      care
      of
      the
      children.
      I
      made
      that
      promise
      a
      reality
      that
      same
      year.
      See,
      sometimes
      a
      person
      can
      make
      a
      mistake,
      or
      have
      an
      unwanted
      pregnancy
      and
      turn
      it
      around
      to
      be
      one
      of
      the
      greatest
      accomplishments
      of
      your
      life.
      I
      had
      no
      job.
      I
      had
      no
      life.
      I
      slept
      on
      a
      mattress
      on
      the
      floor
      in
      the
      smallest
      bedroom
      at
      my
      mom #8217;s.
      When
      she
      said
      she
      was
      pregnant,
      I
      grew
      a
      pair
      and
      made
      a
      decision
      to
      be
      a
      better
      man.
      The
      baby
      didn #8217;t
      ask
      to
      be
      born,
      and
      I
      would
      never
      allow
      them
      to
      experience
      what
      I
      did.
      7
      years,
      guys.
      Less
      than
      a
      decade.
      They #8217;re
      all
      wonderful
      and
      I #8217;m
      extremely
      lucky.

      I #8217;ve
      always
      watched
      V
      for
      Vendetta
      on
      November
      5th.
      However,
      it
      all
      changed
      in
      2015
      when
      my
      son
      was
      born
      on
      the
      same
      day.
      Now
      it #8217;s
      a
      mandatory
      family
      watch
      every
      November
      5th.
      Lame,
      but
      it #8217;s
      awesome.
      I
      also
      watch
      the
      2K3
      TMNT
      episode
      The
      Christmas
      Aliens
      every

      Because
      meat
      is
      tasty.
      I
      don #8217;t
      have
      to

      every
      new

      My

      My
      3
      year
      old
      loves
      the
      switch
      and
      plays
      the
      old
      NES
      emulator
      all
      the
      time.
      I
      have
      a
      SNES
      Classic
      and
      he
      loves
      that,
      minus
      the
      cords.
      He
      is
      constantly
      renting
      games
      from
      the
      library
      to
      play.
      He
      loves
      Spider-Man
      and
      plays
      it
      all
      the
      time.
      He
      loves
      crash
      bandicoot
      too.
      I
      got
      my
      first
      NES
      at
      6.
      Playing
      more
      and
      more
      as
      time
      goes
      on,
      but
      he #8217;ll
      be
      on
      another
      level
      than
      me.

      Congratulations...
      you
      made
      it
      drop
      8
      tenths
      of
      a
      point.
      Which,
      in
      the
      grand
      scheme
      of
      things
      is
      nothing.
      Average
      price
      of
      a
      share
      is
      still
      over
      $100.
      What
      they
      did
      was
      have
      a
      bad
      day
      on
      the
      market.
      Apple
      and
      amazon
      have
      lost
      more
      than
      4
      points
      in
      a
      day
      and
      rebounded
      double
      that
      the
      next
      day.
      Considering
      the
      manufacturing
      facilities
      in
      America
      and
      the
      employee
      stock
      options...
      nothing
      reddit
      can
      do
      to
      destroy
      the
      stocks.
      More
      people
      outside
      reddit
      will
      have
      to
      make
      a
      move
      to
      hurt
      them
      long
      term.
      Good
      effort,
      tho.
      Edit:
      Holy
      crap...
      now
      I
      get
      the
      RIP
      inbox
      saying.
      Look,
      all
      I
      am
      trying
      to
      say
      is
      that,
      despite
      the
      humor
      behind
      the
      meme,
      it
      just
      goes
      to
      show
      the
      pull
      of
      Reddit
      as
      a
      whole
      can #8217;t
      do
      much
      to
      hurt
      a
      company.
      Look
      at
      the
      results
      of
      the
       #8220;Disney
      Bad #8221;
      memes.
      It
      doesn #8217;t
      do
      jack
      to
      multi-billion
      dollar
      brands
      bc
      we
      don #8217;t
      have
      the
      pull
      we
      wish
      we
      did.
      Shit
      posting
      won #8217;t
      do
      any
      good
      unless
      it #8217;s
      actively
      protesting
      against
      the
      company.

      So

      Hard

      anything
      seriously
      when
      you #8217;re
      blind.

      Wanna
      know
      what
      you
      do?
      Suck
      it
      up,
      butter
      cup.
      My
      wife
      gained
      over
      100
      lbs
      and
      she #8217;s
      still
      the
      sexiest
      woman
      to
      me.
      She
      FINALLY
      stuck
      with
      a
      diet
      she
      could
      do,
      lost
      65
      lbs,
      and
      is
      still
      the
      sexiest
      woman
      to
      me.
      My
      wife
      gave
      up
      her
      body
      for
      OUR
      kids.
      If
      you
      have
      kids,
      bc
      of
      her,
      you
      shut
      up.
      You
      love
      her,
      pine
      after
      her,
      and
      chase
      her
      every
      day.
      Why?
      Bc
      that
      woman
      gave
      you
      everything
      she
      had
      to
      bear
      YOUR
      fucking
      hell-spawn.
      Stop
      bitching
      about
      the
      lack
      of
      sex
      and
      do
      something
      that
      makes
      her
      feel
      beautiful.
      If
      you
      aren #8217;t
      sexually
      attracted
      to
      her,
      that #8217;s
      your
      fucking
      fault.
      Suck
      it
      up
      and
      be
      a
      man.

      Wife
      was
      on
      bed
      rest
      for
      2
      and
      a
      half
      months.
      She
      was
      suffering
      from
      preeclampsia
      and
      HAD
      to
      stay
      off
      her
      feet.
      But
      I #8217;m
      sure
      all
      other
      keyboard
      warriors
      like
      yourself
      feel

      by
      one
      way
      or
      another.
      If
      you
      can #8217;t

      your
      wife #8217;s
      looks

      gone
      thru
      some
      fucked
      up
      shit,
      and
      possibly
      had
      postpartum,
      I
      feel
      that
      person
      is
      more
      disgusting
      than
      the
      woman
      who
      gained
      weight.

      The
      pilot
      was
      the
      only
      good
      thing
      about
      the
      show
      before
      the

      It
      veered
      so
      far
      after
      that
      initial
      pilot
      that

      FINALLY!!!
      I
      had
      to
      go
      all
      the
      way
      down
      to
      find
      this.
      Smallville
      is
      my
      favorite
      show
      of
      all
      time
      and
      the
      pilot
      just
      roped
      me
      in.
      I
      watched
      faithfully
      for
      6
      years,
      week
      in
      and
      out
      after
      I
      bought
      the
      first
      four
      seasons.

      I #8217;m
      gonna

      lost
      down

      but
      I
      will
      echo
      that
      Smallville
      had
      the
      best
      pilot!
      It
      was
      everything
      you
      wanted
      a
      Superman
      teen
      show
      to
      be
      in
      that
      episode.
      I
      bought
      the
      first
      two
      seasons
      on
      a
      whim
      and
      immediately
      bought
      3 amp;4.
      I
      watched
      faithfully
      for
      6
      years
      as
      Clark
      evolved.
      My
      daughter
      loved
      the
      show
      when
      she
      was
      3-4
      and
      we
      love
      it
      still
      today!
      Such
      a
      great
      pilot
      that
      didn #8217;t
      miss
      a
      beat.
      Close
      second
      and

      So,
      Friday
      the
      13th
      happened.
      It
      was
      glorious,
      for
      all
      intents
      and
      purposes.
      I
      run
      day
      to
      day
      operations
      for
      a
      decent
      sized
      company.
      We
      have
      a
      president
      who
      runs
      the
      company
      in
      house.
      He
      can
      be
      tedious,
      overwhelming,
      and
      an
      all
      around
      dick
      sometimes.
      Other
      times,
      he
      can
      be
      cool
      as
      can
      be.
      This
      was
      one
      of
      the
      times
      he
      was
      an
      overbearing,
      micro
      managing
      dickbag.
      As
      shop
      foreman,
      I
      take
      my
      job
      seriously
      with
      morale.
      If
      my
      guys
      aren #8217;t
      happy,
      good
      product
      isn #8217;t
      produced.
      If
      good
      product
      isn #8217;t
      produced,
      customers
      aren #8217;t
      happy.
      Looking
      towards
      quality
      control,
      it
      doesn #8217;t
      help
      when
      guys
      are
      over
      worked,
      under
      paid,
      and
      under
      appreciated.
      Friday
      was
      one
      of
      those
      days
      that
      started
      out
      well,
      but
      by
      6:40
      am,
      it
      had
      deteriorated
      to
      shit.
      (Note:
      We
      officially
      don #8217;t
      start
      work
      until
      7
      am.)
      After
      the
      start,
      it
      was
      bitch
      about
      this,
      micro
      manage
      that.
      Several
      people
      being
      cussed
      at
      and
      belittled,
      everyone
      had
      had
      enough.
      Once
      in
      our
      programming
      office,
      the
      idea
      was
      floated
      by
      someone
      that
      we
      should
      walk
      out.
      He
      can #8217;t
      fire
      us
      all.
      Now,
      we #8217;ve
      all
      joked
      about
      this
      time
      after
      time,
      but
      it #8217;s
      never
      been
      more
      than
      a
      thought.
      We
      grit
      our
      teeth
      and
      bear
      it.
      That
      day
      was
      something
      different.
      After
      getting
      yelled
      at
      again
      for
      something
      out
      of
      my
      control,
      I
      finally
      said
      fuck
      it.
      When
      someone
      asked
      if
      I
      was
      in
      and
      serious,
      I
      said
      yes.
      Then,
      it
      snowballed
      from
      there.
      A
      total
      of
      20
      were
      supposed
      to
      walk
      out,
      but
      due
      to
      cold
      feet,
      and
      a
      few
      taking
      a
      shit,
      only
      14
      made
      it.
      At
      10
      am,
      we
      made
      our
      move.
      I
      told
      everyone
      to
      wait
      until
      he
      would
      be
      distracted
      with
      a
      machine
      and
      we #8217;d
      all
      clock
      out
      and
      leave.
      We
      all
      waited.
      When
      he
      was
      distracted,
      I
      gave
      the
      round
      up
      signal,
      and
      everyone
      left.
      A
      few
      stopped
      for
      beer
      to
      relax.
      We
      weren #8217;t
      intending
      on
      going
      back
      to
      negotiate
      until
      Monday.
      We
      all
      met
      at
      a
      guys
      house
      and
      discussed
      why
      we
      walked,
      what
      we
      wanted,
      and
      what
      our
      terms
      were.
      One
      thing
      was
      very
      clear:
      We
      all
      came
      back
      or
      no
      one
      did.
      After
      talking
      for
      2
      1/2
      hours
      and
      coming
      to
      our
      terms,
      we
      decided
      to
      head
      back
      after
      a
      text
      from
      him.
      We
      were
      going
      to
      corner
      him,
      we
      were
      going
      to
      talk
      it
      straight,
      or
      we
      weren #8217;t
      working
      anymore.
      The
      talk
      lasted
      almost
      two
      hours,
      with
      both
      parties
      flexing
      their
      given
      muscles
      at
      some
      point.
      But
      one
      thing
      was
      made
      clear,
      things
      were
      going
      to
      change,
      or
      we #8217;d
      all
      go
      look
      for
      new
      jobs.
      After
      several
      people
      were
      threatened
      with
      being
      fired,
      and
      none
      being
      let
      go,
      we
      came
      to
      terms
      that
      benefitted
      us.
      For
      once,
      our
      work
      place
      had
      so
      much
      morale.
      People
      were
      excited
      to
      work
      again.
      We
      went
      back
      to
      work
      with
      a
      purpose,
      agenda,
      and
      pride.
      This
      is
      the
      first
      Monday
      I #8217;ve
      looked
      forward
      to
      work
      in
      a
      year.
      Even
      the
      guys
      who
      couldn #8217;t
      come,
      the
      people
      in
      the
      main
      office
      -
      we
      stirred
      the
      pot.
      We #8217;ve
      made
      it
      known,
      we #8217;re
      not
      going
      to
      go
      thru
      this
      anymore.
      I #8217;ll
      vouch
      for
      any
      of
      my
      men...
      and
      I #8217;d
      do
      it
      again
      in
      a
      heartbeat.
      Edit:
      Thanks
      for
      my
      first
      silver,
      kind
      person!
      I
      again
      retain,
      I #8217;m
      not
      posting
      this
      for
      karma.
      I #8217;m
      a
      huge
      lurker
      and
      posted
      bc
      I
      want
      people
      to
      know
      that
      solidarity
      and
      group
      leadership
      can
      lead
      to
      some
      extraordinary
      things.
      Edit
      2:
      Thanks
      to
      everyone
      who
      has
      commented
      and
      replied!
      Also
      thanks
      to
      the
      anons
      who
      gave
      me
      a
      Platinum,
      2
      golds,
      and
      another
      silver!
      I #8217;ve
      shared
      the
      success
      of
      our
      story
      with
      my
      comrades
      and
      they
      thank
      you
      too!

      The

      being
      we

      out?
      I

      Well,
      the
      president
      left
      that
      day
      like
      a
      scolded
      dog.
      He
      couldn #8217;t
      look
      anyone
      in
      the
      eye.
      As
      far
      as
      working,
      he
      is
      now
      more
      open
      to
      our
      ideas.
      He
      is
      more
      willing
      to
      let
      us
      work
      how
      we
      need
      to.
      I #8217;m
      not
      exaggerating
      when
      I
      say
      we
      should
      be
      the
      industry
      leader
      in
      our
      state.
      Instead,
      we
      get
      second
      rate
      billing.
      He
      would
      take
      credit
      for
      any
      and
      all
      good
      ideas,
      sometimes
      casting
      them
      aside
      for
      months
      until
      he
      could
      act
      on
      it
      and
      claim
      them
      as
      his.
      Our
      biggest
      client
      absolutely
      hates
      him.
      However,
      we #8217;re
      good
      at
      what
      we
      do,
      and
      they
      stay
      with
      us
      bc
      of
      it.
      He
      tried
      to
      take
      claim
      of
      him
      being
      the
      only
      reason
      why
      we
      have
      that
      client,
      when
      it #8217;s
      actually
      the
      girl
      who
      runs
      the
      account
      that
      Keeps
      them.
      She
      has
      put
      in
      hours
      and
      has
      earned
      the
      good
      faith
      among
      the
      supers
      of
      that
      account,
      not
      him.
      I
      coordinate
      with
      her
      to
      ensure
      proper
      and
      timely
      product.
      If
      it
      weren #8217;t
      for
      her,
      they
      would
      be
      gone.

      I #8217;m
      seemingly
      ok
      with
      it.
      Despite
      our
      antics,
      nothing
      was
      put
      in
      writing
      showing
      insubordination
      on
      our
      end.
      I
      may
      not
      know
      a
      lot,
      but
      I
      know
      unemployment
      is
      hard
      to
      argue
      against
      without
      a
      paper
      trail,
      of
      which
      I
      have
      none.
      He
      can
      fire
      me
      and
      I #8217;ll
      be
      fine.
      Many
      are
      ready
      to
      walk
      if
      that
      were
      to
      happen.
      In
      addition,
      I
      would
      have
      a
      job
      within
      a
      week
      bc
      of
      my
      position
      in
      this
      company.
      I #8217;m
      highly
      sought
      after
      and
      the
      training
      I
      have
      is
      invaluable.
      I #8217;m
      not
      worried
      about
      myself,
      I #8217;m
      more
      worried
      about
      the
      guys
      I
      backed,
      as
      they
      are
      more
      replaceable.
      Hence
      why
      I #8217;m
      so
      for
      having
      their
      backs.

      Again,
      if
      I
      am
      fucked,
      so
      be
      it.
      I
      can
      interview
      at
      a
      number
      of
      places
      and
      have
      a
      job
      after
      a
      brief
      vacation.
      I #8217;m
      not
      worried.
      I #8217;m
      not
      scared.
      I
      hold
      the
      keys
      to
      the
      big
      red
      button
      that
      can
      shut
      the
      whole
      place
      down
      (figuratively).
      I #8217;m
      the
      go
      to
      IT
      guy,
      I
      developed
      the
      programming
      procedures,
      I
      developed
      the
      operating
      procedures.
      The
      guys
      I
      trained
      below
      me
      still
      don #8217;t
      know
      the
      OS
      as
      well
      as
      me.
      It
      would
      take
      a
      group
      of
      guys
      3
      years
      or
      more
      to
      earn
      my
      experience.
      Without,
      what
      I
      call,
      the
      brain
      trust,
      they
      are
      dead
      in
      the
      water
      for
      a
      few
      months.
      Not
      fully
      operational
      to
      our
      capacity
      for
      at
      least
      1
      1/2
      years.

      They
      outsource
      to
      an
      IT
      company,
      but
      you #8217;d
      be
      naive
      to
      think
      this
      is
      a
      global
      scale
      production.
      What
      we
      do,
      and
      how
      we
      do
      it,
      I #8217;ve
      been
      at
      the
      forefront
      of
      the
      makings.
      Aside
      from
      the
      IT,
      I
      am
      the
      only
      person
      who
      has
      access
      to
      the
      servers.
      There #8217;s
      also
      the
      programming
      aspect.
      I
      developed
      those
      procedures.
      I
      have
      trained
      the
      people
      below
      to
      program
      as
      I
      had
      taught
      myself
      to.
      This
      isn #8217;t
      a
      huge
      company.
      This
      is
      a
      smaller
      company
      in
      scale.
      Losing
      all
      programmers
      would
      take
      months
      to
      retrain,
      reutilize,
      and
      redevelop.
      We
      are
      not
      something
      that
      can
      be
      cast
      aside.
      We
      are
      essential
      to
      the
      business
      model
      and
      how
      we
      operate.

      Everyone
      came
      back
      to
      work
      and
      no
      one
      had
      any
      issues.
      Big
      boss
      man
      is
      trying
      to
      flex
      by
      saying
      he #8217;s
      going
      to
      be
      training
      himself
      to
      do
      everything.
      I
      told
      him
      good
      luck.
      He
      thinks
      he
      can
      write
      G
      Code
      after
      reading
      about
      it
      for
      a
      few
      hours.
      I #8217;m
      light
      years
      ahead
      of
      him
      on
      coding
      aspects,
      and
      I
      can #8217;t
      even
      write
      G
      Code.
      I
      can
      read
      it.
      That #8217;s
      it.
      He #8217;s
      nuts
      if
      he
      thinks
      he
      can
      do
      it
      in
      a
      few
      hours.
      No
      one
      was
      threatened
      with
      being
      let
      go.
      However,
      we
      are
      still
      on
      our
      way
      for
      looking
      for
      better
      jobs
      just
      in
      case.
      He
      was
      gone
      doing
      something
      I #8217;ve
      had
      to
      pick
      up
      slack
      on
      for
      the
      last
      year
      today.
      He
      called
      me
      twice
      needing
      help
      with
      it.
      He
      still
      doesn #8217;t
      have
      it
      down.
      It #8217;s
      also
      taken
      him
      4
      times
      as
      long
      to
      finish
      projects
      as
      it
      does
      us.
      He
      insists
      his
      way
      is
      faster.
      The
      fact
      that
      I
      left
      before
      him
      today
      proves
      otherwise.
      We #8217;ll
      see
      how
      tomorrow
      goes.

      So...
      my

      love
      to
      stitch
      and
      sew.
      She

      with
      TMNT
      in
      and
      out

      she
      made
      this
      for
      me
      as
      a
      birthday
      gift.
      I
      need
      to
      cut
      it
      and
      frame
      it.
      Looks
      just
      like
      a
      video
      game
      and
      I
      love
      it!

      Many
      people
      asked
      that
      I
      give
      a
      progress
      report
      of
      what
      happened
      in
      the
      weeks
      following
      our
      walk
      out.
      As
      many
      have
      guessed,
      we
      were
      all
      fired
      2
      weeks
      later...
      Ok.
      That #8217;s
      a
      lie.
      No
      one
      had
      been
      fired
      at
      all.
      One
      guy
      has
      left
      because
      his
      sister
      died,
      and
      that #8217;s
      been
      all
      the
      casualties.
      Manager
      has
      been
      more
      accommodating
      to
      our
      requests.
      He
      has
      been
      more
      up
      front
      about
      when
      praise
      is
      due
      to
      other
      people
      and
      for
      the
      most
      part,
      he
      has
      stepped
      back
      quite
      a
      bit
      in
      production.
      We #8217;ve
      been
      in
      the
      process
      of
      working
      with
      new
      software
      that #8217;s
      supposed
      to
      make
      our
      lives
      easier.
      So
      far,
      I #8217;m
      the
      only
      one
      to
      learn
      it.
      We #8217;ve
      invited
      two
      former
      employees
      back
      and
      moved
      things
      around
      to
      make
      our
      lives
      easier.
      Things
      are
      actually
      running
      smoothly
      for
      once.
      With
      the
      help
      of
      our
      GM
      and
      our
      new
      software,
      we
      have
      been
      able
      to
      lay
      the
      hammer
      down
      on
      pushed
      thru
      jobs
      that
      stress
      everyone
      out.
      This
      makes
      it
      so
      labor
      isn #8217;t
      thru
      the
      roof
      and
      people
      aren #8217;t
      run
      down
      as
      much
      after
      60-70
      hour
      weeks.
      The
      only
      snide
      comment
      came
      from
      the
      silent
      owner
      who
      popped
      in
      2
      weeks
      after,
      saying
      repercussions
      were
      coming
      because
      of
      our
      stunt.
      Nothing
      has
      taken
      place.
      We
      all
      let
      it
      be
      known
      that
      should
      he
      do
      anything
      after,
      without
      so
      much
      as
      writing
      us
      up,
      we
      would
      all
      walk
      away
      again,
      this
      time
      not
      coming
      back.
      My
      employees
      look
      happier
      and
      have
      been
      working
      better.
      It #8217;s
      been
      a
      road
      to
      get
      to
      this
      point,
      but
      we #8217;re
      all
      the
      better
      for
      it.
      For
      those
      wondering
      -
      there
      is
      still
      no
      paper
      trail.
      No
      one
      was
      written
      up,
      and
      everyone
      refuses
      to
      sign
      anything
      almost
      a
      month
      after
      the
      fact.
      Should
      anyone
      get
      fired,
      we
      have
      all
      agreed
      to
      testify
      on
      behalf
      of
      anyone
      who
      should
      be
      let
      go
      so
      the
      can
      draw
      unemployment
      benefits.
      Union
      reps
      never
      called
      us.
      We
      look
      at
      it
      as
      we
      have
      no
      need
      for
      a
      rep
      at
      this
      time.
      We
      will
      move
      forward
      with
      one
      should
      things
      go
      south
      again.
      So
      that #8217;s
      it.
      Hope
      you
      enjoyed
      the
      journey.
      This
      is
      actually
      one
      time
      the
      small
      guys
      won
      the
      battle.
      Good
      luck
      to
      those
      UAW
      workers
      still
      fighting
      the
      good
      fight.
      Don #8217;t
      let
      the
      big
      shots
      threaten
      you
      into
      submission.
      And
      to
      the
      uppers
      who
      took
      away
      their
      benefits
      and
      caused
      a
      child #8217;s
      cancer
      treatment
      to
      be
      halted,
      shame
      on
      you!
      You
      are
      scum
      and
      this
      is
      why
      we
      fight!
