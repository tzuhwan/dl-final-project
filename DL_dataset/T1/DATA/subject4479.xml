      of

      flight

      I
      really
      want
      to
      get
      into
      app
      development
      for
      iOS.
      However,
      I've
      never
      actually
      developed
      an
      app
      before.
      I
      know
      basic
      C++
      and
      took
      a
      few
      software
      courses
      in
      college.
      Basically,
      I
      know
      it's
      time
      consuming,
      but
      are
      there
      any
      experiences
      other
      iOS
      developers
      want
      to
      share
      that
      might
      help
      someone

      just
      starting

      I
      could
      have
      sworn
      using
      Smartglass
      I
      was
      able
      to
      search
      with
      an
      actual
      keyboard
      versus
      the
      one
      in
      the
      Netflix
      app
      itself.
      Did
      this
      functionality
      change?
      It
      would
      be
      so
      much
      easier
      to
      search
      Netflix
      with
      an
      actual
      keyboard
      instead
      of
      using
      the
      one
      Netflix
      gives
      you.
      Like
      I
      said
      I
      could
      have
      sworn
      I
      have
      done
      this
      before...
      Also,
      unrelated,
      but
      when
      using
      the
      media
      remote,
      is
      one
      of
      the
      keys
      mapped
      to
      the
      search
      function
      in
      Netflix?

      Non

      Seiko
      dive
      watch?

      So
      I'm
      looking
      for
      a
      dive
      watch
      and
      really
      like
      the
      looks
      of
      the
      Seiko
      ones.
      However
      this
      wouldn't
      be
      an
      everyday
      watch,
      just
      something
      to
      wear
      in
      the
      pool,
      or
      out
      on
      a
      boat
      or
      doing
      something
      else
      where
      I
      don't
      care
      if
      the
      watch
      gets
      wet
      or
      anything.
      However
      the
      only
      ones
      I
      can
      find
      are
      automatic
      ones,
      which
      is
      rather
      not
      have
      because
      again,
      I
      won't
      be
      wearing
      it
      nearly
      everyday.
      I
      have
      another
      nice
      Seiko
      I
      just
      picked
      up
      for
      that.
      Does
      Seiko
      make
      any?
      If
      they
      do,
      I'd
      prefer
      one
      that
      has
      a
      bracelet,
      but
      I'm
      open
      to
      a
      nice
      NATO
      style
      strap
      or
      if
      I
      could
      buy
      a
      bracelet
      for
      it
      that
      would
      work
      too.
      Edit:
      thanks
      for
      the
      help
      guys.
      I
      wasn't
      aware
      they
      made
      solar
      divers.
      Seems
      like
      they're
      few
      and
      far
      between
      the
      automatics,
      but
      I
      have
      a
      place
      to
      start
      with
      a
      few
      model
      numbers.
      Thanks
      again!

      Good
      news!
      I
      finally
      was
      able
      to
      get
      time
      off
      work
      and
      schedule
      an
      appointment
      at
      Christopher
      Ward's
      showroom
      in
      NH
      at
      the
      end
      of
      May.
      I
      plan
      on
      getting
      the
      C60
      38mm,
      but
      I'm
      a
      little
      torn
      on
      which
      version
      I
      should
      get.
      I
      plan
      on
      MOSTLY
      using
      this
      watch
      as
      weekend/beach/whatever
      watch,
      occasionally
      wearing
      it
      to
      work
      in
      a
      business
      casual
      environment.
      I
      am
      currently
      looking
      at
      the
      Quartz
      version
      of
      the
      watch
      primarily
      because
      it
      will,
      for
      lack
      of
      a
      better
      term,
      be
      a
      beater
      watch
      and
      I
      don't
      want
      an
      automatic
      movement
      getting
      screwed
      up
      because
      of
      something
      I
      was
      doing
      while
      wearing
      the
      watch.
      My
      question
      for
      you
      is,
      what
      would
      you
      recommend
      and
      why?
      Automatic
      or
      Quartz?
      I
      want
      to
      be
      clear:
      I'm
      not
      trying
      to
      start
      a
      debate
      or
      argument
      over
      which
      type
      of
      movement
      is
      the
      overall
      better.
      I
      just
      want
      an
      opinion
      on
      whether
      or
      not
      an
      automatic
      is
      a
      good
      idea
      for
      a
      beater
      watch.
      Also:
      for
      anyone
      who
      has
      gone
      to
      the
      showroom
      to
      purchase
      a
      watch
      from
      CW,
      what
      was
      your
      experience
      like?
      I'm
      looking
      very
      much
      forward
      to
      finally
      getting
      my
      hands
      on
      one
      of
      these
      divers.

      I've
      been
      a
      Royals
      fan
      for
      5
      years
      now
      ever
      since
      I
      started
      to
      get
      back
      into
      baseball.
      While
      I'm
      from
      Upstate
      NY,
      my
      dad
      used
      to
      fly
      out
      to
      KC
      all
      the
      time
      and
      get
      me
      Royals
      stuff
      as
      souvenirs
      when
      I
      was
      a
      kid,
      so
      I
      decided
      to
      start
      following
      the
      Royals.
      And
      boy,
      am
      I
      glad
      I
      did.
      This
      is
      one
      of
      the
      greatest
      fan
      bases
      I've
      ever
      come
      across
      and
      am
      so
      happy
      to
      be
      a
      part
      of
      it.
      The
      cool
      part
      is
      I
      still
      get
      to
      see
      them
      play
      in
      person
      when
      they
      come
      to
      NYC
      or
      Boston.
      My
      fianc #233;,
      a
      Yankees
      fan,
      and
      her
      family
      were
      making
      fun
      of
      me
      for
      following
      them
      until
      last
      season.
      When
      we
      took
      it
      to
      game
      7
      the
      look
      on
      their
      faces
      was
      priceless
      haha.
      I
      just
      wanted
      to
      introduce
      myself
      and
      say
      Lets
      Go
      Royals!!!
      Don't
      know
      how
      it
      took
      me
      so
      long
      to
      find
      this
      subreddit
      but
      I'm
      glad
      I'm

      Trident
      Pro
      last
      week.
      Have
      had
      a
      lot
      of
      interest
      so
      I
      figured
      I
      would
      do
      a
      DIY
      post
      about
      it.

      [Polishing]
      Question
      about
      polishing
      a
      watch
      with
      brushed
      stainless
      steel

      So
      I'm
      going
      to
      try
      brushing
      the
      spare
      bracelet
      of
      my
      C60.
      What
      I
      would
      like
      to
      do
      is
      brush
      the
      top
      half
      of
      the
      case
      of
      the
      watch
      itself,
      and
      polish
      the
      sides
      to
      a
      mirror
      finish
      to
      match
      the
      bracelet.
      My
      question
      is
      how
      you
      would
      obtain
      that
      kind
      of
      finish
      on
      brushed
      steel?
      I
      can
      find
      plenty
      of
      information
      on
      brushing
      polished
      parts
      of
      a
      watch,
      but
      not
      so
      much
      on
      the
      reversal
      of
      that
      process.
      That's
      what
      I'm
      looking
      for.
      If
      any
      of
      you
      have
      suggestions
      on
      how
      to
      do
      it,
      or
      experience,
      I
      would
      love
      to
      hear
      them.

      Within
      the
      next
      year,
      I
      plan
      on
      purchasing
      my
      first
      Rolex.
      I
      am
      planning
      (right
      now)
      on
      buying
      a
      14060
      from
      1991.
      It
      is
      my
      birth
      year,
      and
      before
      I
      buy
      a
      house,
      get
      married,
      and
      start
      having
      kids
      (all
      things
      that
      will
      happen
      within
      the
      next
      two
      to
      five
      years)
      I
      figure
      this
      would
      be
      the
      best
      possible
      time
      to
      buy
      before
      all
      my
      funds
      get
      used
      up
      or
      allocated
      to
      different
      needs.
      I've
      been
      doing
      research
      and
      have
      a
      couple
      questions
      about
      the
      serial
      numbers,
      however.
      I
      keep
      seeing
      N
      and
      X
      serial
      numbers
      on
      sites
      like
      Chrono24
      or
      TRF.
      What
      are
      the
      differences
      between
      these
      serial
      numbers?
      All
      I
      can
      seem
      to
      find
      is
      what
      years
      they
      refer
      to
      as
      to
      when
      the
      watch
      was
      made.
      Is
      there
      any
      difference
      between
      the
      two
      serial
      numbers
      and
      what
      differences
      could
      be
      between
      the
      watches
      themselves?
      Also,
      I
      have
      a
      question
      about
      E
      serial
      numbers
      also.
      It
      seems
      according
      to
      my
      research
      that
      E
      serials
      are
      made
      in
      1990,
      but
      some
      sites
      refer
      to
      them
      as
      being
      made
      until
      1991
      as
      well.
      Because
      it
      will
      be
      a
      birth
      year
      watch,
      would
      I
      be
      safe
      with
      an
      E
      serial
      as
      well
      if
      I
      find
      one?
      I
      really
      want
      one
      that
      was
      made
      in
      1991,
      so
      I
      want
      to
      know
      if
      I
      should
      avoid
      these
      or
      not.
      Thanks
      in
      advance
      for
      all
      your
      help!

      So
      I
      just
      picked
      up
      a
      214270
      a
      week
      ago.
      Fantastic
      watch,
      however
      it's
      been
      running
      about
      3
      seconds
      slow
      per
      day.
      After
      some
      tracking
      of
      the
      accuracy,
      it
      turns
      out
      that
      when
      I'm
      wearing
      it
      during
      the
      day,
      it's
      running
      at
      -0.1
      seconds
      per
      day.
      However,
      at
      night,
      it's
      running
      at
      about
      -3
      seconds
      per
      day,
      leading
      to
      the
      loss
      of
      time.
      I'm
      currently
      leaving
      the
      watch
      face
      up.
      Any
      suggestions
      as
      to
      how
      to
      make
      it
      more
      accurate?
      I've
      been
      leaving
      it
      face
      up
      every
      night,
      but
      instead
      of
      gaining
      time
      like
      it
      should,
      it's
      losing
      time.
      I'm
      just
      perplexed
      because
      every
      watch
      I've
      left
      face
      up
      overnight
      has
      always
      gained
      time.
      Side
      note:
      -3
      isn't
      bad
      at
      all,
      I'm
      not
      complaining.
      Just
      trying
      to
      make
      it
      slightly
      more
      accurate.

      Question
      about
      HDMI
      converter

      Hi
      all,
      I
      decided
      to
      make
      a
      project
      about
      hooking
      up
      my
      N64
      through
      my
      Xbox
      One
      along
      with
      my
      cable
      box.
      I
      knew
      this
      would
      require
      two
      separate
      pieces
      of
      equipment:
      an
      HDMI
      converter,
      and
      an
      HDMI
      switch.
      I
      bought
      these
      two
      items:
      [HDMI
      swicth](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0049SCB2Y/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8 amp;psc=1)
      [RCA
      to
      HDMI
      converter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00I482KZI/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8 amp;psc=1)
      My
      question
      pertains
      to
      the
      output
      aspect
      ratio
      of
      the
      N64
      going
      through
      the
      converter.
      I
      would
      like
      it
      displayed
      in
      a
      4:3
      aspect
      ratio
      when
      playing
      on
      my
      TV.
      It
      seems
      possible
      to
      do
      this
      as
      when
      I
      switch
      the
      input
      or
      first
      turn
      on
      the
      N64,
      it
      briefly
      displays
      in
      a
      4:3
      ratio
      before
      switching
      to
      16:9.
      The
      picture
      quality
      in
      the
      16:9
      aspect
      ratio
      is....well,
      not
      the
      best.
      It's
      playable,
      but
      stretched
      out
      (obviously)
      and
      difficult
      to
      read
      text.
      When
      the
      4:3
      aspect
      ratio
      is
      displayed,
      albeit
      briefly,
      it
      is
      much
      better
      in
      quality.
      Oddly
      enough,
      running
      the
      HDMI
      cable
      directly
      into
      the
      TV
      produces
      a
      16:9
      image
      immediately
      without
      displaying
      4:3
      first.
      My
      question
      is
      this:
      is
      there
      a
      way
      to
      get
      it
      to
      display
      in
      4:3
      permanently?
      I
      would
      rather
      not
      mess
      with
      the
      TV
      aspect
      ratio
      settings
      as
      I
      am
      running
      this
      through
      my
      Xbox.
      Or,
      and
      this
      would
      be
      a
      possibility
      too,
      is
      there
      another
      converter
      which
      allows
      the
      customization
      of
      display
      settings?
      The
      only
      thing
      I
      keep
      seeing
      is
      the
      XRGB
      Mini
      Framemeister,
      but
      I
      would
      like
      to
      avoid
      spending
      $300+
      if
      possible.
      The
      picture
      quality
      isn't
      too
      much
      of
      a
      concern
      outside
      of
      the
      aspect
      ratio
      as
      well.
      I'd
      appreciate
      any
      help
      you
      all
      can
      offer!
      Edit:
      So,
      on
      a
      whim,
      I
      stopped
      at
      RadioShack
      on
      my
      way
      home
      from
      work
      and
      picked
      [this](https://www.radioshack.com/products/radioshack-composite-to-hdmi-converter?gclid=Cj0KEQjwo5--BRCS8ceLjv-XppUBEiQAGp15EFbsMM0_o2_K53kXVrOymjEc1qrW0RKXOt3oRU4KM3gaAm7V8P8HAQ amp;variant=17964750661)
      up.
      This
      actually
      has
      a
      maximum
      output
      of
      480i
      according
      to
      the
      box.
      It
      does
      not
      upscale.
      And,
      even
      better,
      it
      works!
      It
      displays
      in
      a
      4:3
      aspect
      ratio
      without
      messing
      with
      the
      picture
      settings
      on
      my
      tv.
      From
      what
      I
      can
      tell,
      it
      does
      not
      upscale
      at
      all.
      It
      merely
      converts
      to
      HDMI.
      There
      are
      no
      settings
      or
      switches
      to
      pick
      720
      or
      1080p.
      Just
      input
      and
      output.
      So
      what
      I've
      concluded
      is
      an
      upscale
      will
      (almost)
      always
      stretch
      to
      16:9,
      and
      a
      straight
      up
      converter
      such
      as
      the
      one
      I
      now
      have
      will
      keep
      the
      original
      aspect
      ratio.
      Honestly,
      the
      picture
      with
      the
      RadioShack
      converter
      looks
      fantastic
      on
      my
      tv,
      which
      is
      about
      52".
      Hope
      this
      helps
      everyone.

      Good
      morning
      all,
      I
      originally
      had
      a
      download
      speed
      of
      15/2
      (down/up)
      and
      over
      WiFi,
      it
      wasn't
      a
      strong
      or
      fast
      enough
      connection
      so
      I
      bought
      a
      powerline
      adapter
      to
      use.
      It
      solved
      the
      issue
      and
      with
      the
      adapter
      I
      was
      able
      to
      get
      an
      average
      of
      12-14/2.
      This
      worked
      great,
      I
      had
      better
      download
      speeds
      for
      games
      and
      less
      lag
      online.
      Recently,
      I
      upgraded
      my
      internet
      to
      a
      50/5
      connection
      (yay!)
      however
      it
      has
      now
      limited
      the
      connection
      I
      get
      with
      my
      Xbox.
      Through
      the
      powerline
      adapter
      I
      now
      get
      a
      6/5
      connection,
      and
      if
      I
      connect
      over
      WiFi,
      it
      improves
      to
      18/6,
      however
      the
      connection
      provides
      a
      lot
      of
      lag
      when
      I'm
      gaming.
      I
      have
      tried
      restarting
      my
      Xbox
      numerous
      times,
      physically
      unplugging
      it,
      going
      offline
      then
      back
      online,
      pretty
      much
      everything
      but
      a
      factory
      reset.
      Does
      anyone
      else
      have
      a
      solution
      to
      this
      issue?
      I
      have
      seen
      other
      threads
      in
      which
      this
      seems
      to
      be
      an
      issue
      however
      I
      can't
      seem
      to
      find
      a
      solution.
      Also,
      if
      I
      do
      a
      speedtest
      on
      my
      hardwired
      laptop
      (speedtest.net),
      it
      shows
      60/8,
      and
      on
      my
      phone
      it
      shows
      45/7,
      so
      it's
      definitely
      not
      an
      issue
      with
      the
      modem
      or
      router,
      but
      I
      have
      also
      restarted
      those
      to
      be
      safe.
      I'd
      rather
      not
      have
      to
      go
      through
      a
      factory
      reset
      (or
      worse,
      get
      a
      new
      Xbox)
      so
      if
      any
      of
      you
      could
      provide
      some
      insight
      I
      would
      greatly
      appreciate
      it!

      So
      I
      have
      iOS
      10
      on
      my
      6S
      and
      I
      was
      going
      through
      some
      of
      the
      features
      and
      one
      of
      them
      is
      the
      location
      where
      you
      parked
      your
      car.
      When
      I
      looked
      at
      the
      maps
      app
      last
      night
      I
      didn't
      see
      it
      pinned,
      but
      I
      figured
      it
      might
      be
      because
      I
      was
      home.
      Today,
      after
      getting
      to
      work,
      I
      looked
      again.
      My
      parking
      lot
      is
      about
      a
      7
      minute
      drive
      away
      from
      my
      office
      (park
      in
      an
      auxiliary
      lot
      then
      bus
      into
      work),
      so
      I
      figured
      it
      would
      definitely
      show
      up.
      Nope.
      My
      car
      has
      an
      aftermarket
      head
      unit
      with
      bluetooth
      capabilities
      (JVC
      KD-A95BT)
      and
      it
      is
      always
      connected
      when
      I
      am
      driving.
      I
      checked
      and
      frequent
      locations
      are
      enabled.
      I
      don't
      understand
      why
      this
      feature
      isn't
      working?
      I
      was
      under
      the
      assumption
      that
      it
      would
      work
      with
      bluetooth
      recievers
      even
      if
      your
      car
      audio
      system
      didn't
      have
      carplay.
      Any
      help
      would
      be
      appreciated.

      So
      just
      got
      my
      iPhone
      7
      last
      night,
      and
      was
      wondering
      if
      there
      was
      an
      adapter
      to
      use
      the
      lightning
      EarPods
      on
      my
      MacBook
      Air?
      I
      tried
      searching
      but
      I
      couldn't
      find
      one
      or
      any
      ideas
      on
      how
      to
      do
      it.
      Thanks
      in
      advance.
      Edit:
      I'd
      either
      be
      looking
      at
      a
      lightning
      to
      3.5
      jack
      (reverse
      of
      what
      came
      with
      the
      phone),
      lightning
      input
      to
      thunderbolt
      output,
      or
      lighting
      input
      to
      USB
      output.

      So
      this

      I
      noticed
      I
      had
      apps
      updating

      my

      when
      I
      was

      I
      double
      checked

      while
      I
      have
      automatic
      downloads
      for

      updates
      selected,
      the
      use
      cellular
      data
      option
      is
      deselected.
      The
      idea
      is
      to
      have
      my
      apps
      automatically
      update
      only
      when
      I'm
      connected
      to

      This
      is
      on

      on
      an

      I

      I

      Has

      So,
      I've
      been
      using
      a
      North
      Face
      Recon
      for
      a
      while
      now.
      I
      think
      it's
      about
      6
      years
      or
      so
      old
      (got
      it
      in
      college).
      It's
      always
      held
      up
      great
      until
      recently,
      when
      I
      noticed
      it
      was
      starting
      to
      rip
      at
      the
      zipper
      seams.
      It
      hasn't
      broken
      entirely
      yet,
      but
      I
      figure
      I
      might
      as
      well
      start
      looking
      now
      so
      I
      am
      not
      caught
      without
      a
      bag
      when
      it
      does
      finally
      give
      out.
      I've
      been
      looking
      for
      something
      a
      bit
      more...professional
      looking,
      I
      guess,
      as
      I
      just
      started
      a
      new
      position
      working
      in
      a
      new
      office.
      Previously,
      I
      had
      always
      been
      in
      more
      youthful
      environments,
      where
      a
      backpack
      was
      commonplace.
      Now,
      that
      is
      not
      the
      case,
      where
      I
      am
      the
      youngest
      by
      about
      10
      years.
      What
      I've
      decided
      is
      I
      want
      something
      that
      is
      like
      a
      2
      in
      1.
      I
      would
      still
      like
      the
      backpack
      functionality
      for
      the
      weekend,
      however
      I
      would
      like
      it
      to
      also
      convert
      to
      a
      messenger
      bag
      for
      the
      work
      week
      so
      it
      won't
      look
      way
      out
      of
      place.
      In
      my
      searching
      I
      found
      [this](http://topodesigns.com/products/travel-bag),
      which
      is
      exactly
      what
      I
      am
      looking
      for.
      The
      only
      issue
      is
      it's
      size.
      I
      am
      not
      a
      tall
      man
      (5'7"),
      and
      a
      22"
      height
      bag
      would
      I
      feel
      look
      almost
      comical
      on
      me.
      So,
      I
      would
      like
      it
      if
      there
      was
      something
      a
      little
      smaller.
      To
      give
      reference,
      my
      current
      North
      Face
      is
      about
      19.5"
      tall
      by
      13"
      wide,
      and
      about
      10"
      deep
      when
      packed.
      Is
      there
      anything
      out
      there
      that
      would
      fit
      what
      I'm
      looking
      for,
      or
      should
      I
      try
      to
      find
      a
      more
      "mature"
      looking
      backpack?
      To
      give
      reference
      I
      usually
      pack
      jeans
      or
      shorts
      and
      a
      t
      shirt
      for
      after
      work,
      and
      a
      small
      lunch
      box.
      The
      capacity
      of
      my
      current
      bag
      is
      fine,
      although
      a
      little
      more
      wouldn't
      hurt.
      New
      to
      this
      sub,
      and
      I
      would
      appreciate
      any
      help
      you
      could
      give
      me.

      Is
      there
      a
      list
      of
      cable
      providers
      that
      will
      be
      supported
      by
      SSO
      so
      they
      can
      be
      used
      in
      the
      new
      TV
      app?
      I
      currently
      have
      TWC
      and
      I
      see
      they're
      not
      listed.
      I
      was
      wondering
      if
      there
      was
      a
      list
      of
      providers
      that
      are
      slated
      to
      get
      support
      from
      the
      app.
      Also,
      I
      understand
      Netflix
      is
      not
      going
      to
      be
      participating,
      but
      I
      did
      see
      that
      Hulu
      was
      the
      only
      app
      that
      was
      supported
      by
      TV
      for
      me.
      I
      do
      have
      HBO
      Go,
      but
      it
      doesn't
      seem
      to
      be
      supported.
      HBO
      Now
      is,
      however,
      so
      is
      HBO
      Go
      getting
      added
      as
      well?
      It
      wouldn't
      make
      sense
      to
      include
      one
      but
      not
      the
      other.

      My
      current
      car
      is
      a
      2009
      Accent.
      I'm
      at
      the
      point
      where
      I
      can
      afford
      a
      nicer,
      newer
      car.
      Great
      starter
      car
      but
      time
      to
      move
      on.
      I
      was
      researching
      Audi
      mostly,
      but
      my
      fiancee's
      mother
      just
      bought
      an
      X3
      and
      I
      fell
      in
      love
      with
      it.
      So
      I
      started
      looking
      at
      BMW's
      and
      I
      think
      I
      would
      like
      a
      3
      Series
      (320i
      or
      330i).
      A
      couple
      questions:
      What
      are
      the
      main
      differences
      between
      the
      320i
      and
      330i?
      It
      seems
      the
      differences
      (from
      what
      I
      can
      tell)
      are
      negligible.
      I'm
      considering
      buying
      certified
      pre-owned.
      Is
      there
      a
      big
      difference
      if
      I
      buy
      a
      used
      vs.
      new?
      The
      price
      difference
      seems
      to
      be
      pretty
      significant.
      I
      would
      be
      buying
      at
      a
      dealer
      regardless.
      If
      I
      buy
      used,
      are
      there
      any
      specific
      things
      I
      should
      look
      out
      for
      when
      choosing
      a
      car?
      What
      is
      an
      idea
      of
      the
      cost
      of
      ownership
      and
      real
      world
      fuel
      mileage
      for
      the
      320i
      or
      330i?
      Disregarding
      insurance,
      I'm
      looking
      for
      an
      idea
      of
      regular
      and
      unplanned
      maintenance,
      reliability,
      etc.
      Living
      in
      the
      northeast,
      I
      would
      be
      getting
      the
      xDrive
      model.
      How
      does
      this
      actually
      perform
      in
      the
      snow/sleet/rain/etc.?
      If
      you've
      also
      owned
      an
      Audi
      with
      Quattro,
      does
      it
      compare
      positively
      or
      negatively?
      That's
      about
      it.
      If
      everything
      checks
      out,
      hopefully
      later
      this
      summer
      I
      will
      be
      able
      to
      get
      one.
      Never
      really
      considered
      BMW
      before
      but
      it
      impressed
      me
      in
      a
      way
      that
      Audi
      never
      did.

      Is
      my
      house
      too
      small
      for
      a

      Recently
      my
      fiancee
      and
      I
      decided
      we
      want
      a
      Berner
      for
      our
      first
      dog.
      We
      have
      a
      house
      that
      is
      about
      1,200
      sq
      ft.
      My
      concern
      is
      that
      could
      our
      house
      be
      too
      *small*
      for
      a
      Berner?
      We
      certainly
      don't
      want
      it
      to
      be
      too
      confined.
      I
      know
      they
      can
      build
      up
      a
      lot
      of
      energy.
      We
      have
      about
      a
      tenth
      of
      an
      acre
      of
      land
      and
      the
      development
      we
      are
      in
      has
      a
      big
      open
      area
      where
      we
      could
      take
      him
      to
      run
      around,
      and
      the
      development
      is
      very
      walkable.
      We
      just
      got
      put
      on
      a
      waiting
      list
      and
      the
      wait
      right
      now
      is
      about
      2
      years
      (although
      probably
      shorter
      -
      we're
      expecting
      about
      a
      year).
      We
      just
      don't
      want
      to
      get
      one
      and
      then
      have
      it
      be
      miserable
      because
      it's
      too
      big
      for
      our
      house.

      His
      is
      the
      43mm.
      You
      can
      tell
      by
      the
      hour
      marker
      to
      the
      right
      of
      the
      date
      window.
      I
      have
      a
      similar
      wrist
      to
      yours
      and
      chose
      the
      38mm.
      The
      43
      looked
      comically
      large
      on
      my
      wrist
      due
      to
      the
      lug
      design.

      I
      modified
      mine
      a
      bit
      but
      that #8217;s
      a
      good
      reference
      for
      the
      size.
      My
      wrist
      is
      a
      little
      bigger
      now
      due
      to
      some
      weight
      gain
      but
      it
      still
      fits
      about
      the
      same.
      The
      43mm
      would
      still
      be
      too
      large.

      I #8217;ve
      had
      a
      few
      of
      their
      straps
      for
      a
      couple
      years
      now,
      and
      they #8217;ve
      been
      in
      the
      shower,
      mud/dirt,
      swimming,
      golfing,
      playing
      tennis...the
      hardware
      hasn #8217;t
      faded.
      I
      wouldn #8217;t
      worry
      over
      it.
      Edit:
      the
      premium
      straps
      are
      worth
      the
      slight
      price
      increase
      btw.
      Not
      that
      the
      regular
      straps
      are
      bad,
      but
      the
      sewn
      in
      hardware
      vs.
      glued
      is
      a
      super
      nice
      touch.
      The
      grey
      one
      in
      OP #8217;s
      is
      a
      premium
      I
      believe.
      I
      have
      the
      same
      one.

      This
      team
      under
      TC
      is
      a
      Super
      Bowl
      contender
      easily.
      The
      worst
      decision
      the
      Giants
      have
      made
      in
      recent
      years
      is
      firing
      TC
      then
      going
      on
      a
      spending
      spree
      making
      McAdoo
      look
      great
      and
      that
      they
      didn #8217;t
      make
      a
      mistake
      firing
      the
      wrong
      guy.
      In
      reality,
      Reese
      should
      have
      gone
      and
      TC
      should #8217;ve
      stayed,
      but
      it #8217;s
      too
      late
      now.

      I
      understand
      what
      you #8217;re
      saying
      but
      his
      draft
      picks
      have
      been
      horrible.
      Sure
      you
      have
      players
      like
      Beckham,
      JPP,
      and
      Engram...but
      to
      be
      fair
      anyone
      could #8217;ve
      made
      the
      defense
      he
      put
      together
      with
      that
      much
      cap
      space.
      He
      was
      able
      to
      overpay
      for
      everyone
      and
      did
      just
      that.
      Now,
      it
      worked,
      but
      that
      wasn #8217;t
      exactly
      a
      showing
      of
      picking
      the
      right
      players
      for
      the
      right
      price
      and
      building
      a
      team
      with
      a
      philosophy.
      He
      just
      went
      out
      and
      got
      the
      best
      available
      players
      for
      each
      of
      their
      respective
      positions.
      The
      only
      thing
      I
      give
      him
      credit
      for
      is
      structuring
      the
      contracts
      so
      that
      they #8217;re
      all
      first
      year
      heavy
      and
      don #8217;t
      burden
      us
      down
      the
      road.
      His
      drafting
      has
      been
      almost
      horrid
      period.
      I
      forget
      what
      study
      it
      was
      but
      a
      few
      years
      ago
      they
      had
      a
      list
      of
      all
      players
      who
      were
      drafted
      in
      the
      2nd-3rd
      round
      and
      where
      they
      were
      in
      the
      NFL.
      Almost
      all
      the
      Giants
      players
      weren #8217;t
      in
      the
      league
      anymore.
      Drafting
      1st
      round
      is
      easy.
      Drafting
      in
      later
      rounds
      is
      a
      lot
      more
      difficult,
      and
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      Reese
      has
      the
      skill
      to
      do
      it.

      Nice
      watch!
      I
      just
      picked
      up
      a
      Speedmaster
      myself.
      What
      reference
      do
      you
      have?
      Edit:
      I
      see
      you
      (or
      your
      wife)
      went
      with
      the
      hesalite
      version.
      Good
      choice.

      Ah,
      that #8217;s
      the
      same
      one
      I
      have.
      That
      presentation
      box
      is
      a
      bit
      ridiculous
      and
      for
      me
      was
      a
      pain
      to
      get
      back
      home
      with
      it
      (bought
      mine
      on
      our
      honeymoon).
      Mine
      is
      insanely
      accurate
      though.
      I
      think
      it #8217;s
      only
      lost
      about
      10
      seconds/month
      which,
      for
      a
      mechanical
      watch,
      is
      unbelievable

      For
      the
      first
      time
      ever
      I
      woke
      up
      at
      3am
      (I'm
      on
      the
      east
      coast)
      to
      pre-order
      an
      iPhone.
      I
      actually
      pre-ordered
      two.
      A
      Space
      Grey
      256GB
      8+
      for
      myself,
      and
      a
      Gold
      256GB
      8+
      for
      the
      wife.
      Both
      were
      through
      the
      Apple
      Upgrade
      Program
      (I
      was
      existing,
      my
      wife
      just
      enrolled
      for
      the
      first
      time)
      and
      both
      will
      be
      picked
      up
      within
      the
      same
      time
      window
      on
      the
      22nd.
      I
      have
      to
      say,
      that
      was
      the
      easiest
      thing
      I've
      ever
      ordered
      online.
      This
      was
      my
      first
      experience
      doing
      such.
      Last
      year
      I
      just
      walked
      in
      on
      launch
      day
      and
      picked
      up
      a
      phone
      that
      was
      still
      in
      stock
      (didn't
      want
      the
      Jet
      Black,
      didn't
      want
      the
      +).
      I'm
      going
      from
      a
      7
      to
      an
      8+,
      so
      I
      didn't
      want
      to
      chance
      the
      +
      models
      being
      out
      of
      stock
      after
      we
      both
      get
      out
      of
      work.
      Totally
      doing
      this
      again
      next
      year.

      Just
      an
      FYI,
      I #8217;m
      in
      the
      US
      and
      the
      credit
      check
      was
      performed
      during
      the
      order.
      Both
      the
      Mrs.
      and
      I
      received
      emails
      this
      morning
      stating
      we
      were
      approved.
      We
      were
      also
      required
      to
      put
      in
      payment
      information
      for
      the
      initial
      deposit
      (first
      months
      payment/taxes)
      which
      I

      able

      put
      both
      on

      Other

      is
      in
      the
      UK.
      You
      pick
      your
      phone,
      pick
      Your
      in
      store
      pick-up
      or
      shipping
      window,
      and
      check
      out.
      Took
      her
      maybe
      all
      of
      15-20
      minutes
      to
      do
      the
      whole
      thing.
      Once
      you #8217;re
      in
      it #8217;s
      super
      easy
      also
      to
      upgrade.
      It
      took
      me
      maybe
      5-10
      minutes
      to
      confirm
      everything
      and
      place
      the
      order.

      Got
      an
      iPod
      Video
      (5th
      generation
      I
      believe)
      shortly
      after
      it
      was
      released.
      Then
      got
      a
      couple
      iPod
      Touch #8217;s
      and
      eventually
      I
      won
      a
      MacBook
      Air
      (still
      my
      main
      computer
      actually).
      Eventually
      got
      an
      iPhone
      5S
      and
      here
      I
      am
      today
      with
      my
      7,
      waiting
      until
      Friday
      to
      upgrade
      to
      the
      8+!

      Honestly
      wouldn't
      surprise
      me.
      What
      were
      our
      play
      options,
      try
      and
      run
      it
      up
      the
      middle
      only
      to
      get
      it
      stopped
      at
      the
      half
      yard
      line?
      We
      don't
      have
      Jacobs
      anymore
      and
      our
      receivers
      were
      dropping
      balls.
      Eli
      can't
      exactly
      tell
      McAdoo
      "no"
      when
      he's
      told
      to
      go
      for
      it,
      so
      you
      do
      the
      next
      best
      thing.
      He'll
      never
      come
      out
      and
      say
      it
      but
      I'd
      be
      damn
      curious
      to
      know
      if
      this
      was
      actually
      the
      case.

      I #8217;d
      say
      more
      so
      the
      OL
      than
      Eli.
      Reasons:
      yes
      Eli
      made
      some
      bad
      decisions
      (that
      throw
      behind
      for
      the
      INT
      was
      particularly
      poor),
      but
      even
      though
      he
      was
      holding
      the
      ball
      his
      receivers
      couldn #8217;t
      get
      open.
      The
      OL
      needed
      to
      hold
      more
      instead
      of
      getting
      LITERALLY
      run
      over
      by
      DE #8217;s
      and
      DT #8217;s.
      So
      yeah,
      I
      think
      the
      OL
      was
      at
      fault
      more,
      but
      it #8217;s
      an
      issue
      compounded
      with
      the
      RB #8217;s
      not
      being
      a
      threat,
      allowing
      more
      dropbacks
      in
      coverage,
      and
      the
      playcalling
      not
      being
      imaginative
      enough
      to
      allow
      the
      WR #8217;s
      to
      get
      more
      open.
      The
      OL
      is
      bad
      -really
      bad-,
      but
      if
      we
      had
      a
      run
      game
      and
      the
      play
      calling
      was
      better
      the
      offense
      would
      look
      so
      much
      better.
      Think
      about
      it,
      this
      is
      virtually
      the
      same
      line
      we
      had
      when
      McAdoo
      became
      our
      OC.
      What #8217;s
      changed?
      We #8217;ve
      lost
      a
      few
      running
      backs
      that
      were
      a
      threat
      and
      the
      playcalling
      has
      stayed
      virtually
      the
      same
      for
      three
      full
      years,
      going
      on
      a
      fourth.
      It #8217;s
      no
      wonder
      we
      look
      this
      bad.

      I
      think
      the
      point
      he #8217;s
      trying
      to
      make
      is
      that
      in
      the
      off-season,
      McAdoo
      said
      the
      offense
      was
       #8220;revamped #8221;
      and
      in
      general
      really
      good
      and
      improved
      from
      last
      season.
      Then
      the
      first
      two
      games
      happen
      and
      virtually
      nothing
      seems
      to
      have
      changed.
      So
      while
      yes,
      it #8217;s
      two
      separate
      seasons,
      I
      think
      it #8217;s
      important
      to
      take
      the
      last
      6
      games
      of
      last
      year
      and
      compare
      it
      to
      how
      this
      season
      is
      looking.

      Thanks
      for
      this!
      I
      always
      hard
      reset
      my
      phone
      after
      getting
      a
      new
      one
      and
      installing
      all
      my
      apps,
      and
      when
      I
      tried
      the
      old
      way
      I
      didn #8217;t
      realize
      that
      would
      activate
      the
      SOS
      feature.
      I #8217;m
      not
      quite
      sure
      why
      Apple
      would
      map
      that
      feature
      to
      holding
      power/volume
      down,
      as
      that #8217;s
      how
      you #8217;ve
      reset
      the
      iPhone
      for
      a
      year

      Yeah.
      Scroll
      up
      to
       #8220;pull #8221;
      the
      clock
      down.
      I
      think
      it #8217;s
      a
      bug,
      never
      seemed
      to
      get
      fixed
      in
      the
      beta
      but
      it
      didn #8217;t
      happen
      too
      frequently.
      Still
      frustrating
      though.

      I
      think
      it #8217;s
      certainly
      possible.
      Part
      of
      the
      issue
      today
      was
      time
      of
      possession.
      We
      only
      had
      the
      ball
      for
      about
      22
      minutes,
      which
      means
      the
      defense
      was
      out
      there
      for
      about
      38
      minutes.
      It #8217;s
      tough
      in
      that
      type
      of
      weather
      to
      play
      for
      40
      minutes
      and
      still
      be
      effective.
      Honestly,
      the
      offensive
      style
      we
      saw
      today
      may
      put
      a
      band
      aide
      over
      the
      hemorrhage
      that
      is
      our
      OL
      but
      until
      we
      manage
      possession
      better
      it #8217;s
      not
      going
      to
      get
      better.
      The
      defense
      just
      gets
      too
      worn
      out.
      Realistically
      I #8217;m
      guessing
      7-9.
      We
      were
      good
      enough
      to
      win
      today
      and
      I
      blame
      McAdoo
      for
      not
      taking
      the
      points
      when
      he
      should
      have.
      We
      should
      have
      won
      this
      game
      30-24,
      but
      instead
      lost
      24-27
      because
      of
      two
      missed
      opportunities
      for
      FGs
      and
      a
       #8220;dropped #8221;
      TD.
      Optimistically
      we
      go
      9-7
      and
      sneak
      in
      as
      a
      wild
      card,
      but
      we #8217;d
      have
      to
      pull
      some
      serious
      shut
      out
      of
      our
      asses
      to
      do
      that
      against
      some
      pretty
      good
      teams.

      8+
      here,
      11.0.1
      has
      dramatically
      *increased*
      my
      battery
      life.
      Same
      oddly
      enough
      with
      my
      watch,
      too.
      Both
      would
      be
      close
      to
      40%
      by
      now
      after
      a
      full
      day #8217;s
      use,
      now
      both
      are
      sitting
      in
      the
      high
      60s.
      Very
      pleased
      with
      that
      improvement.
      I
      was
      hoping
      t
      would
      fix
      the
      earpiece
      clicking
      noise
      on
      calls,
      but
      that
      hasn #8217;t
      been
      the
      case
      unfortunately.

      Could #8217;ve
      googled
      it,
      it
      was
      pretty
      well
      reported.
      Apparently
      his
      inaugural
      committee
      is
      also
      donating
      $3
      million
      to
      various
      hurricane
      relief
      organizations
      as
      well.

      Oh
      I
      know
      it
      was
      for
      Harvey.
      The
      user
      above
      me
      just
      asked
      for
      a
      source
      for
      his
      $1
      million
      donation.
      That #8217;s
      all
      I
      was
      providing.
      That #8217;s
      also
      why
      I
      included
      the
      information
      about
      the
      $3
      million
      donation
      from
      his
      inaugural
      committee,
      which
      was
      only
      announced
      a
      few
      days
      ago
      I
      believe.

      My
      apologies,
      I #8217;m
      on
      mobile.
      I
      didn #8217;t
      see
      it
      was
      you.
      You
      asked
      for
      a
      source
      on
      him
      donating
      $1
      million
      to
      hurricane
      relief.
      You
      didn #8217;t
      specify
      whether
      it
      was
      for
      Maria
      or
      Harvey.
      I
      was
      just
      giving
      you
      some
      information
      in
      case
      you
      didn #8217;t
      know.
      If
      you
      wanted
      something
      for
      Maria,
      then
      no,
      he
      hasn #8217;t
      donated
      anything.
      And
      his
      inaugural
      staff
      just
      announced
      it
      a
      few
      days
      ago.
      I
      doubt
      you #8217;ll
      see
      anything
      for
      a
      couple
      weeks
      while
      they
      delegate
      where
      it
      goes
      and
      ensuring
      it
      actually
      goes
      toward
      relief
      of
      Puerto
      Rico/Florida.
      I
      am
      pretty
      sure
      they #8217;ve
      already
      announced
      what
      organizations
      they
      intend
      to
      donate
      to
      though,
      but
      I
      don #8217;t
      have
      anything
      to
      back
      that
      up.
      Just
      something
      I
      heard.

      Again,
      you #8217;re
      claiming
      you
      asked
      a
      specific
      question
      when
      you
      didn #8217;t.
      A
      user
      mentioned
      that
      he
      made
      a
      $1
      million
      donation
      (didn #8217;t
      say
      what
      it
      was
      for)
      and
      you
      asked
      for
      a
      source
      for
      that.
      *You*
      should #8217;ve
      specified
      in
      your
      question
      whether
      or
      not
      it
      was
      for
      Maria
      or
      not.
      You
      can #8217;t
      get
      mad
      because
      I
      answered
      your
      question
      the
      way
      you
      asked
      it.
      Be
      a
      little
      bit
      more
      elaborate
      on
      how
      you
      organize
      your
      thoughts
      and
      questions
      and
      we
      wouldn #8217;t
      have
      had
      this
      issue.

      Implications
      and
      assumptions
      are
      what
      leads
      to
      miscommunications
      and
      misunderstandings.
      While
      I
      may
      be
      at
      fault
      for
      not

      you
      might
      be

      Maria,
      you

      understand
      you #8217;re
      also
      at

      for

      I
      know
      what
      you #8217;re
      referring
      to
      when
      you
      initially
      gave
      no
      specific
      information.
      Again,
      a
      thread
      topic
      means
      absolutely
      nothing
      in
      regards
      to
      a
      comment
      chain.
      It #8217;s
      reddit,
      you
      can #8217;t
      tell
      me
      you #8217;ve
      never
      seen
      an
      off-topic
      comment
      chain,
      especially
      one
      about
      politics/Trump.
      I
      honestly
      believe
      you
      worded
      that
      question
      just
      so
      you
      could
      throw
      some
      big
      boy
      internet
      punches
      and
      make
      yourself
      look
      smart,
      knowing
      that
      your
      question
      could
      be
      answered
      either
      way.
      Everything
      you #8217;ve
      criticized
      me
      here
      for
      you
      are
      equally
      guilty
      of.
      How
      about
      you
      just
      accept
      you #8217;re
      equally
      at
      fault
      here
      and
      we
      just
      drop
      it,
      because
      arguing
      semantics
      when
      a
      national
      tragedy
      should
      be
      the
      topic
      of
      discussion
      is
      pretty
      petty
      and
      I #8217;m
      upset
      I #8217;ve
      let
      myself
      go
      on
      this
      much
      with
      you
      when
      I
      should #8217;ve
      just
      ignored
      your
      responses
      a
      few
      comments
      ago.
      I #8217;m
      not
      going
      to
      continue
      his
      conversation
      further.
      Enjoy

      A
      lot
      of
      the
      Giants
      success
      under
      Reese
      is
      actually
      due
      to
      Ernie
      Acorsi...
      he's
      the
      one
      who
      traded
      for
      Eli
      and
      got
      players
      like
      Strahan,
      Toomer,
      Shockey,
      Barber.
      Not
      Reese.
      It's
      even
      worse
      when
      you
      think
      that
      without
      Acorsi,
      we
      likely
      wouldn't
      have
      won
      the
      2007
      Super
      Bowl.
      Hell,
      Reese
      fell
      ass-backwards
      into
      Cruz
      in
      2011.
      With
      Reese's
      track
      record
      I'm
      surprised
      we
      even
      signed
      Cruz
      to
      begin
      with
      now
      that
      I
      think
      about
      it.

      Not
      saying
      the
      INTs
      don #8217;t
      matter,
      but
      I
      can
      easily
      recall
      two
      picks
      that
      were
      deflected
      into
      a
      DBs
      arms
      or
      not
      fought
      for
      (looking
      at
      you,
      Marshall).
      I
      know
      ultimately
      picks
      are
      against
      the
      QB
      but
      I
      wish
      there
      would
      be
      a
      distinction
      of
      throws
      that
      are
      Eli #8217;s
      fault
      (and
      there
      definitely
      have
      been
      this
      year)
      and
      throws
      that
      just
       #8220;happen #8221;
      to
      fall
      or
      bounce
      off
      a
      WRs
      hands
      the
      right
      way.

      Had

      once
      for
      an
      entry
      level
      government

      Asked
      what
      the
      hierarchy
      was
      or
      who
      I
      would

      Answer:
       #8220;well
      we

      of
      all
      just
      report
      to

      other
      there
      really
      is
      no

      Yeah
      no
      thanks
      I
      want
      at
      least
      SOME
      opportunity
      for
      advancement.
      I
      was
      offered
      it
      and
      turned
      it
      down
      solely
      because
      of
      that
      reason.

      There
      was
      a
      weekend
      air
      show
      in
      my
      area
      years
      ago
      at
      a
      military
      airfield.
      They
      had
      two
      special
      planes
      that
      weekend:
      the
      F-117
      Nighthawk
      and
      B-2.
      We
      decided
      to
      go
      on
      the
      day
      the
      Nighthawk
      was
      flying.
      Well,
      funnily
      enough,
      we
      were
      close
      enough
      to
      the
      airport
      that
      the
      B-2
      flew
      over
      our
      house
      after
      doing
      a
      flyby
      at
      the
      air
      show.
      It
      was
      only
      a
      couple
      hundred
      feet
      up
      like
      this.
      It
      was
      the
      coolest
      fucking
      thing
      ever
      and
      I #8217;m
      so
      glad
      I
      happened
      to
      be
      outside
      to
      see
      it

      he

      never

      they
      fired

      That #8217;s
      ridiculous,
      Eli
      can #8217;t
      be
      traded
      under
      his
      current
      contract.
      He
      made
      sure
      there
      was
      a
      no-trade
      clause
      in
      it
      before
      he
      signed
      it.
      He
      wants
      to
      stay
      in
      NY.
      Now,
      if
      this
      continues
      like
      this,
      as
      sad
      as
      it
      would
      be
      for
      him
      to
      go,
      I #8217;d
      think
      he #8217;d
      be
      a
      good
      fit
      in
      Denver
      after
      his
      current
      contract
      is
      up,
      considering
      that #8217;s
      what
      Denver
      basically
      does:
      is
      taking
      aging
      QB #8217;s
      and
      make
      Super
      Bowl
      runs.
      I
      really
      don #8217;t
      want
      to
      see
      Eli
      go
      because
      it
      scares
      me
      that
      our
      current
      backup
      QB
      situation
      is
      awful,
      but
      I #8217;d
      rather
      him
      go
      to
      a
      team
      where
      his
      strengths
      will
      be
      showcased.
      I
      mean
      hell,
      if
      his
      brother
      could
      win
      a
      Super
      Bowl
      with
      Denver
      Eli
      could
      win
      two
      there.
      At
      his
      current
      state
      Eli
      is
      a
      better
      QB
      than
      his
      brother
      was
      during
      his
      last
      year.

      I
      think
      it
      wasn #8217;t
      so
      much
      Eli
      not
      looking
      his
      way,
      but
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      Cruz
      is
      good
      enough
      to
      get
      separation
      outside.
      He #8217;s
      good
      in
      the
      slot
      with
      mid
      zone
      coverage
      sure,
      but
      I
      think
      he
      has
      sever
      difficulty
      getting
      open
      when
      one
      on
      one.
      If
      Eli
      doesn #8217;t
      see
      you
      open
      he
      won #8217;t
      throw
      it
      there.
      I
      believe
      they
      were
      intentionally
      misusing
      him
      because
      they
      wanted
      Shepard
      as
      their
      new
      slot
      receiver
      and
      having
      Beckham
      being
      good
      in
      the
      slot
      certainly
      helped,
      but
      I #8217;d
      liked
      to
      have
      seen
      him
      in
      the
      slot
      more
      and
      see
      what
      he
      could #8217;ve
      done.
      While
      it
      was
      wrong
      to
      call
      it
      out
      publicly
      I
      can
      see
      it
      being
      a
      believable
      claim.

      Eli
      has
      a
      no
      trade
      clause.
      It #8217;s
      not
      like
      they
      can
      shop
      him
      around
      right
      now.
      I
      agree
      with
      you
      though.
      Eli
      deserves
      better
      than
      this.
      Honestly
      I
      think
      after
      his
      contract
      is
      up
      his
      best
      fit
      would
      be
      Denver.
      Competitive,
      talented,
      and
       #8220;weak #8221;
      at
      QB.
      Sure
      he #8217;d
      be
      following
      in
      his
      brothers
      footsteps
      but
      I
      honestly
      believe
      out
      of
      all
      the
      teams
      currently
      that
      are
      in
      need
      of
      a
      great
      QB,
      Denver
      is
      the
      best
      fit
      for
      a
       #8220;win
      now #8221;
      type
      system
      (which
      is
      what
      Eli
      needs
      because
      realistically
      he
      has
      2-3
      good
      years
      left
      before
      he
      might
      start
      to
      decline).

      To
      be
      fair,
      it
      was
      the
      Rams.
      I
      understand
      there
      were
      some
      locker
      room
      issues
      though
      while
      he
      was
      HC,
      but
      since
      I #8217;m
      not
      a
      Rams
      fan
      I
      never
      bothered
      looking
      too
      much
      into
      it.
      However
      that
      team
      hasn #8217;t
      been
      good
      for
      a
      long
      time
      and
      Spags
      isn #8217;t
      the
      only
      one
      that
      failed
      at
      STL/LA.
      Like
      it
      or
      not
      though
      if
      they
      fire
      McAdoo
      mid-season,
      Spags
      is
      likely
      the
      choice
      as
      the
      interim
      HC
      due
      to
      having
      actual
      HC
      experience.

      That #8217;s
      because
      in
      2013
      Coughlin
      had
      control
      of
      the
      team
      *and*
      the
      players
      respected
      him
      and
      tried
      their
      hardest
      no
      matter
      what.
      All
      that
      team
      wanted
      was
      a
      win.
      This
      2017
      team
      just
      seems
      to
      be
      going
      through

      and
      not
      caring
      whether
      or
      not
      they
      play
      hard.
      A
      win
      would
      be
      nice
      to
      them
      but
      they #8217;re
      so
      dejected
      it #8217;s
      not
      even
      really
      worth
      it.

      The
      blocking
      still
      wasn #8217;t
      *great*,
      though.
      I
      honestly
      think
      it
      was
      a
      symptom
      of
      play
      calling
      however.
      Different
      offensive
      style
      =
      defense
      miscuing
      a
      few
      times
      opening
      up
      holes
      for
      the
      run
      or
      longer
      protection
      of
      the
      passer.
      What

      however
      prove

      That #8217;s
      not
      exactly
      what
      net
      neutrality
      is.
      Net
      neutrality
      has
      nothing
      to
      do
      with
      data
      caps
      (which
      already
      exist
      in
      some
      major
      ISPs
      anyway)
      or
      pricing
      for
      that
      matter.
      Net
      neutrality
      is
      mainly
      focused
      on
      content
      and
      the
      availability
      of
      it
      over
      all
      ISPs
      equally.
      If
      a
      provider
      wants
      to
      charge
      more
      there
      really
      isn #8217;t
      anything
      stopping
      them.
      Net
      neutrality
      is
      far
      more
      focused
      on
      equal
      prioritization
      of
      data
      regardless
      of
      the
      source
      website/server.
      In
      fact,
      net
      neutrality
      has
      forced
      some
      states
      to
      regulate
      internet
      as
      a
      public
      utility,
      which
      in
      turn
      has
      shown
      a
      tendency
      to
      hurt
      competition
      between
      providers
      and
      limit
      options
      available
      to
      customers
      (the
      way
      natural
      gas
      and
      electricity
      are
      regulated
      comes
      to
      mind
      personally,
      at
      least
      in
      NYS).
      Thirdly,
      in
      my
      state
      (NY),
      cable
      franchises
      are
      granted
      by
      local
      governments
      instead
      of
      even
      at
      the
      state
      level.
      Therefore,
      it #8217;s
      very
      rare
      unless
      you #8217;re
      in
      the
      city
      to
      find
      an
      area
      with
      multiple
      providers.
      There
      was
      a
      PSC
      case
      in
      which
      the
      state
      forced
      NYC
      to
      sign
      a
      franchise
      agreement
      with
      Verizon
      to
      provide
      FiOS
      in
      all
      of
      NYC #8217;s
      footprint.
      Other
      than
      that,
      your
      options
      are
      essentially
      either
      Optimum,
      Charter,
      or
      Cablevision
      depending
      on
      where
      you
      live.
      Without
      the
      franchise
      process
      providers
      would
      be
      able
      to
      lease
      out
      access
      lines
      (similar
      to
      how
      phone
      providers
      are
      either
      CLECs
      or
      ILECs)
      and
      allow
      multiple
      options
      for
      service
      in
      an
      area.
      Your
      issue
      here
      is
      not
      with
      net
      neutrality,

      that
      should
      tell

      does

      its
      own
      regulations
      which
      is
      what

      argument
      against
      what
      I
      stated.
      That #8217;s
      the
      problem
      with
      today #8217;s
      society
      and
      political
      atmosphere:
      nobody
      wants
      to
      debate
      anymore;
      if
      it
      doesn #8217;t
      align
      perfectly
      with
      someone #8217;s
      ideology,
      it #8217;s
      automatically
      wrong
      regardless
      of
      the
      logic
      supporting
      it.
      Nobody
      wants
      to
      listen;
      all
      they
      want
      is
      a
      big
      echo
      chamber.

      There
      isn #8217;t
      much
      to
      do
      until
      emergency
      services
      arrive.
      As
      a
      general
      rule
      of
      thumb
      any
      time
      there
      may
      be
      a
      neck
      injury
      you
      do
      *not*
      move
      the
      patient.
      As
      long
      as
      their
      airway
      is
      clear
      and
      they #8217;re
      not
      in
      danger
      leave
      them
      alone.
      The
      ones
      with
      blood
      running
      out
      of
      their
      heads
      and
      onto
      the
      sidewalk
      are
      also
      likely
      already
      dead.
      No
      point
      in
      trying
      to
      help
      them
      if
      you #8217;ve
      checked
      for
      a
      pulse
      and
      it
      doesn #8217;t
      exist.
      Pretty
      morbid
      but
      that #8217;s
      probably
      what
      happened
      in
      that
      video.

      I'm
      not
      quite
      sure
      what
      "lies"
      you've
      caught
      me
      in,
      nor
      do
      I
      think
      it's
      appropriate
      to
      call
      someone
      retarded
      just
      because
      they
      don't
      necessarily
      agree
      with
      you
      and
      offer
      a
      differing
      opinion.
      Frankly,
      I
      find
      that
      rather
      insulting
      and
      a
      true
      telling
      of
      the
      kind
      of
      person
      you
      are.
      Regardless,
      the
      examples
      you
      have
      provided
      in
      your
      previous
      response
      were
      *all*
      hypothetical
      regarding
      the
      internet.
      You
      didn't
      provide
      one
      example
      that
      historically
      proved
      your
      point
      other
      than
      referencing
      a
      brief
      acknowledgement
      of
      the
      necessity
      to
      have
      a
      proper
      historical
      and
      economical
      background
      in
      the
      industry
      to
      fully
      understand
      the
      issue
      and
      what
      could
      theoretically
      happen
      if
      net
      neutrality
      is
      eradicated.
      Your
      comparison
      of
      the
      railroad
      (and
      other
      unnamed
      utilities)
      is
      a
      difficult
      one
      to
      prove
      because
      getting
      rid
      of
      net
      neutrality
      *won't*
      necessarily
      create
      monopolies
      in
      the
      traditional
      sense
      that
      you
      seem
      to
      be
      alluding
      to.
      Where
      the
      danger
      with
      removal
      of
      net
      neutrality
      *actually*
      lies
      is
      the
      total
      lack
      of
      control
      by
      the
      federal
      government
      to
      oversee
      how
      internet
      is
      regulated.
      By
      removing
      the
      designation
      of
      a
      "utility"
      under
      the
      cover
      of
      net
      neutrality,
      it
      opens
      up
      state
      regulation
      to
      determine
      what
      is
      and
      isn't
      readily
      available.
      We
      already
      see
      this
      in
      cellular
      data
      where
      throttling,
      data
      caps,
      and
      censorship
      exist
      in
      almost
      every
      option.
      You
      seem
      to
      have
      gotten
      the
      impression
      that
      I
      am
      against
      net
      neutrality.
      No,
      I
      am
      not
      against
      it.
      I
      am
      in
      favor
      of
      it,
      but
      not
      for
      the
      reasons
      that
      you
      seem
      to
      believe.
      Net
      neutrality
      is
      important
      because
      it
      prevents
      a
      state
      or
      municipality
      from
      preventing
      the
      availability
      of
      data
      from
      being
      hindered.
      While
      one
      can
      extrapolate
      that
      the
      rules
      can
      prevent
      the
      increase
      of
      prices
      for
      certain
      services,
      that
      really
      isn't
      the
      main
      issue
      here.
      Services
      like
      Netflix
      and
      Hulu
      have
      already
      seen
      comparably
      large
      price
      increases
      over
      the
      last
      year
      or
      so.
      Internet
      prices
      for
      major
      ISPs
      like
      Spectrum,
      Verizon
      have
      also
      risen
      as
      well.
      Net
      neutrality
      is
      so
      broad
      that
      its
      understandable
      that
      its
      so
      misunderstood
      by
      most
      people,
      and
      it
      also
      makes
      it
      incredibly
      easy
      to
      arrive
      at
      hypothetical
      situations.
      And
      it's
      also
      easy
      to
      yell
      "the
      price
      is
      going
      to
      go
      up
      if
      this
      happens"
      because
      nobody
      wants
      to
      spend
      *more*
      money
      for
      something.
      The
      real
      issue
      is
      censorship
      of
      data.
      The
      mayor
      of
      NYC
      does
      not
      represent
      the
      official
      stance
      of
      the
      State
      of
      NY.
      The
      PSC
      is
      responsible
      for
      filing
      comments
      (if
      desired)
      to
      the
      FCC
      for
      an
      official
      position.
      Not
      saying
      the
      mayor's
      stance
      doesn't
      matter,
      but
      he
      doesn't
      represent
      the
      *state*.
      He
      represents
      NYC.
      That
      lawsuit
      against
      Charter/Spectrum
      (which
      I
      am
      familiar
      with
      as
      I
      worked
      on
      researching
      it
      for
      my
      office
      when
      it
      was
      filed)
      is
      more
      related
      to
      the
      reelection
      campaign
      for
      2018
      and
      the
      lack
      of
      Charter/Spectrum's
      commitment
      to
      the
      merger
      requirement
      by
      NYS
      when
      they
      purchased
      TWC.
      The
      issue
      with
      the
      slowdowns
      was
      more
      so
      related
      to
      the
      infrastructure
      issues
      from
      acquiring
      the
      company
      (the
      networks
      were
      not
      meshing
      well
      together
      when
      they
      flipped
      the
      switch).
      The
      claim
      by
      the
      AG
      had
      nothing
      to
      do
      with
      specific
      services
      (as
      the
      article
      that
      eff.org
      mentioned
      didn't
      even
      allude
      to).
      The
      claim
      of
      the
      AG
      was
      that
      Charter/Spectrum
      (or
      then
      TWC)
      didn't
      provide
      the
      speeds
      promised
      by
      the
      plans
      (i.e.,
      a
      50
      Mbps
      plan
      only
      went
      up
      to
      20-30
      Mbps),
      and
      peak
      hours
      hurt
      this
      as
      well
      because
      more
      people
      were
      putting
      more
      strain
      on
      a
      network.
      To
      draw
      an
      example
      that
      might
      help
      you
      better
      understand,
      when
      9/11
      happened
      the
      cell
      towers
      weren't
      letting
      calls
      go
      through.
      Were
      the
      cell
      companies
      preventing
      calls
      from
      going
      through
      then?
      No,
      the
      network
      was
      under
      immense
      strain
      from
      everyone
      trying
      to
      simultaneously
      use
      it.
      The
      same
      could
      be
      said
      in
      Times
      Square
      during
      New
      Years.
      Try
      making
      a
      call
      right
      around
      midnight,
      I
      doubt
      you'll
      be
      able
      to
      get
      through.
      That
      isn't
      the
      carriers
      again,
      that's
      overuse
      of
      the
      system.
      The
      same
      happens
      for
      ISPs
      during
      peak
      hours
      with
      weak
      infrastructure.
      Read
      through
      the
      actual
      lawsuit.
      Most
      of
      it
      is
      related
      to
      outdated
      network
      infrastructure/equipment
      that
      the
      company
      refused
      to
      address.
      The
      Spectrum
      merger
      requirements
      were
      not
      fulfilled
      (it
      wasn't
      close),
      and
      this
      lawsuit
      is
      the
      AG's
      attempt
      to
      save
      some
      face
      with
      some
      of
      his
      constituents.
      That
      is
      *not*
      a
      show
      for
      cause
      of
      net
      neutrality,
      that's
      just
      a
      company
      doing
      shitty
      business
      practices
      to
      save
      a
      few
      bucks
      and
      an
      elected
      official
      piggybacking
      off
      of
      an
      issue
      to
      make
      him
      look
      better.
      Yes
      it
      is
      important
      to
      shove
      some
      blame
      onto
      the
      media
      for
      the
      vast
      majority
      of
      people
      voting
      on
      this
      for
      the
      wrong
      reason.
      Its
      a
      complex
      issue
      and
      its
      understandable
      tough
      for
      a
      simple
      ~1
      page
      article
      to
      completely
      grasp
      what
      the
      basic
      underlying
      principles
      of
      the
      issue
      are.
      Most
      media
      outlets
      (regardless
      of
      what
      side
      politically
      you
      are
      on)
      grab
      onto
      headlines
      and
      unproven
      accusations
      to
      help
      bolster
      their
      ratings,
      and
      online
      media
      outlets
      are
      no
      different.
      Lastly,
      I
      would
      like
      to
      post
      a
      source
      for
      NY's
      stance
      against
      net
      neutrality
      but
      there
      is
      none.
      You
      won't
      find
      it
      because
      the
      PSC
      never
      filed
      comments
      on
      the
      original
      petition.
      If
      a
      state
      is
      *so*
      against
      net
      neutrality,
      why
      won't
      the
      governing
      regulatory
      agency
      in
      the
      state
      file
      comments
      saying
      so?
      The
      PSC
      has
      been
      active
      in
      other
      issues
      in
      the
      past
      regarding
      telecommunications
      services
      (namely
      wire-line
      phone
      service
      and
      merger
      requirements
      for
      companies).
      The
      only
      stuff
      you
      see
      on
      this
      from
      NY
      is
      from
      people
      who
      are
      in
      an
      elected
      position
      who
      are
      worrying
      about
      reelection
      or
      continual
      support
      of
      their
      constituents.
      Not
      that
      that's
      necessarily
      a
      bad
      thing,
      but
      its
      interesting
      that
      the
      appointed
      positions
      by
      the
      Governor
      are
      silent
      on
      this
      if
      you
      ask
      me.

      Call
      for
      help
      and
      ask
      the
      dispatcher,
      honestly.
      First
      rule
      of
      being
      a
      first
      responder
      is
      *don't
      endanger
      yourself*.
      Unless
      you
      have
      specific
      training,
      there
      isn't
      much
      that
      you
      can
      do.
      The
      dispatcher
      will
      give
      you
      instructions
      to
      check
      for
      signs
      of
      life
      if
      you're
      the
      first
      on
      the
      scene,
      but
      if
      you're
      passing
      by
      an
      already
      handled
      situation,
      the
      best
      option
      is
      to
      just
      call
      emergency
      services.
      Don't
      ever
      assume
      that
      they've
      already
      been
      called,
      and
      don't
      endanger
      yourself.
      Side
      note,
      most
      states
      have
      laws
      protecting
      non-emergency
      personnel
      from
      lawsuit/charges
      for
      performing
      CPR
      on
      a
      patient
      if
      they
      are
      injured
      in
      the
      process
      (it
      WILL
      happen
      if
      performed
      correctly.
      You
      will
      break
      ribs
      on
      a
      person
      to
      correctly
      administer
      CPR).
      You
      might
      want
      to
      look
      into
      CPR
      training
      if
      you
      want
      to
      be
      more
      readily
      prepared
      for
      a
      situation,
      but
      I
      honestly
      hope
      you
      never
      have
      to
      witness
      that.
      In
      this
      case
      though,
      there
      honestly
      wasn't
      much
      anyone
      could
      do.
      The
      amount
      of
      potential
      neck/possible
      paralyzed
      injuries
      and
      the
      obvious
      dead
      people
      would
      make
      me
      just
      want
      to
      wait
      for
      a
      trained
      professional
      if
      I
      was
      a
      passerby.
      The
      last
      thing
      anyone
      would
      want
      to
      do
      is
      be
      responsible
      for
      someone
      dying
      or
      not
      being
      able
      to
      walk
      again
      when
      they
      could
      have
      had
      a
      chance
      if
      handled
      by
      a
      trained
      EMT.

      From
      my
      viewpoint
      and
      logged
      in
      it
      is
      removed.
      I
      read
      your
      comment
      and
      it
      is
      incredibly
      well
      thought
      out
      and
      a
      good
      summation
      of
      how
      a
      person
      opposed
      would
      find
      reason
      to
      disagree
      with
      net
      neutrality.
      My
      biggest
      issue
      with
      the
      argument
      for
      it,
      is
      that
      nothing
      has
      happened
      to
      require
      it
      yet.
      Right
      now
      it
      seems
      like
      a
      huge
      overreach
      by
      the
      government
      protecting
      us
      from
      some
      hypothetical
      boogeyman.
      I
      agree
      with
      the
      premise
      that
      it
      is
      difficult
      to
      prove
      internet
      is
      a
      basic
      right
      also.
      I
      am
      also
      for
      net
      neutrality
      for
      the
      record,
      if
      only
      for
      the
      protection
      against
      censorship.
      We
      need
      more
      people
      like
      you
      by
      the
      way.
      It
      should
      matter
      whether
      you
      are
      for
      or
      against
      something,
      education
      is
      essential
      to
      being
      a
      responsible
      and
      rational
      adult.
      If
      everyone
      thought
      like
      the
      way
      you
      laid
      out
      the
      arguments
      for
      eliminating
      net
      neutrality,
      we
      wouldn #8217;t
      have
      this
      much
      of
      a
      divide
      in
      the
      US.
      Thank
      you.

      I #8217;m
      not
      saying
      I
      agree
      with
      that
      statement,
      that #8217;s
      just
      how
      a
      non
      first
      responder
      would
      view
      it
      in
      my
      opinion.
      Most
      people
      wouldn #8217;t
      be
      able
      to
      carry
      that
      kind
      of
      mental
      baggage.
      Also,
      you
      shouldn #8217;t
      be
      performing
      CPR
      or
      moving
      a
      patient
      into
      the
      recovery
      position
      without
      proper
      training
      or
      instruction
      from
      a
      trained
      professional.
      Just
      wanted
      to
      make
      that
      clear
      as
      well.

      Thanks
      for
      at
      least
      replying
      even
      though
      you
      offered

      other

      a
      valid
      comparison #8221;,
      followed
      by
      an
      insult.
      And
      for
      the
      record
      I
      was
      at
      -3
      when
      I
      edited
      my

      so
      it
      wasn #8217;t

      me.
      I
      genuinely
      want
      to
      have
      a
      discussion
      about
      this.
      Why
      isn #8217;t
      it
      comparable?
      Can
      you
      actually
      give

      reason
      or

      continue
      to
      try
      to
      insult
      me?
      Also,
      it #8217;s

      of
      funny-
      your

      third

      I
      once
      met
      Donovan
      McNabb
      at
      Foxwoods
      casino.
      He
      won
      one
      of
      those
      wheel
      of
      fortune
      style
      games
      that
      a
      host
      calls
      players
      up
      from
      their
      machine
      to
      play
      and
      I
      heard
      his
      name.
      Walked
      up
      to
      see
      and
      sure
      enough
      it
      was
      him.
      I
      said
      hi
      and
      how
      I
      always
      thought
      Philly/Washington
      treated
      him
      the
      wrong
      way
      with
      regards
      to
      his
      stamina
      during
      a
      game
      and
      also
      said
      as
      a
      Giants
      fan
      I
      respected
      him
      for
      being
      the
      toughest
      QB
      to
      face
      in
      the
      division
      while
      he
      played.
      Didn #8217;t
      really
      talk
      to
      him
      much
      because
      I
      didn #8217;t
      want
      to
      intrude
      but
      he
      was
      actually
      a
      pretty
      cool
      dude
      to
      meet.

      As

      parties,
      yeah

      the

      Most

      anti-corruption.

      dislike
      McCain
      and
      Ryan
      for
      their
      clear
      corruption
      and
      flip
      flop
      on
      issues
      they
      supposedly
      ran
      on.
      If
      they
      get
      replaced
      by
      dems
      then
      cool
      as
      long
      as
      you
      aren #8217;t
      corrupt.
      They
      way
      both
      parties
      are
      ran
      right
      now
      reminds
      me
      too
      much
      of
      the
      political
      machines
      that
      we
      all
      learned
      were
      pure
      evil
      in
      history
      class.
      This
      nation
      was
      built
      on
      differing
      opinions
      and
      complete
      control
      of
      a
      government
      by
      one
      style
      of
      thought
      is
      incredibly
      volatile
      and
      dangerous,
      whether
      right
      or
      left.
      I #8217;d
      like
      to
      know
      what
      you
      feel
      about
      the
      left
      right
      now.
      They #8217;ve
      focused
      all
      their
      energy
      on
      anti-Trump
      stuff
      and
      haven #8217;t
      actually
      created
      any
      new
      policy
      or
      revised
      their
      political
      system
      in
      order
      to
      recover
      from
      the
       #8220;four
      more
      years
      of
      Obama #8221;
      campaign
      the
      Hillary
      ran
      on.

      My
      apologies,
      I
      misinterpreted
      your
      comment.
      I
      edited
      that
      quoted
      part
      out
      of
      my
      initial
      comment.
      Honestly,
      not
      sure
      where
      I
      was
      going
      with
      that.
      Feel
      free
      to
      leave
      it
      in
      your
      comment
      though.
      I
      believe
      I
      was
      aiming
      for
      a
      preface
      to
      the
      bulk
      of
      my
      comment
      but
      I
      apparently
      didn #8217;t
      connect
      it
      properly.

      I #8217;m
      convinced
      at
      this
      point
      Perkins
      wouldn #8217;t
      be
      able
      to
      even
      play
      well
      with
      the
      new
      line.
      Why?
      Even
      with
      out
      shitty
      old
      makeup
      of
      the
      line
      Darkwa
      and
      Gallman
      *still*
      we #8217;re
      averaging
      3-4
      yards/carry
      compared
      to
      Perkins
      1.5ish.
      Honestly
      I
      think
      he
      needs
      a
      giant
      ass
      hole
      and
      a
      bunch
      of
      air
      traffic
      controllers
      guiding
      him
      to
      said
      hole
      to
      get
      a
      decent
      run.
      He
      doesn #8217;t
      seem
      to
      be
      able
      to
      navigate
      his
      way
      through
      the
      blocks
      like
      Darkwa
      and
      Gallman
      have.
      That
      or
      run
      him
      around
      the
      outside
      behind
      a
      pick
      or
      TE/WR
      block
      because
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      he
      has
      what
      it
      takes
      to
      bust
      through
      tackles.

      I
      think
      he
      was
      more
      referring
      to
      having
      a

      (in

      case,
      the
      play
      calling
      being
      incredibly
      conservative).

      He
      hit
      his
      receivers
      more
      than
      a
      few
      times
      and
      they
      weren #8217;t
      even
      turned
      to
      look
      for
      the
      ball.
      I
      saw
      at
      least
      5
      plays
      where
      he
      hit
      his
      targets
      arm/hip/shoulder
      and
      they
      weren #8217;t
      even
      turned
      to
      catch
      the
      ball.
      Throwing
      downfield
      is
      one
      thing
      but
      when
      your
      target
      doesn #8217;t
      even
      know
      how
      to
      run
      a
      slant
      route
      or
      the
      right
      timing
      for
      it
      after
      two
      weeks
      of
      full
      practice
      I
      can #8217;t
      understand
      being
      mad
      at
      the
      QB.
      Sure
      some
      of
      his
      throws
      weren #8217;t
      great
      but
      they
      were
      all
      mostly
      catchable.
      Eli
      can #8217;t
      throw
      *and*
      catch
      the
      ball.

      I
      think
      we #8217;re
      all
      in
      agreement
      for
      that.
      It #8217;s
      just
      tough
      to
      see
      Eli
      being
      blamed
      for
      a
      problem
      that
      isn #8217;t
      necessarily
      his.
      Not
      saying
      he
      isn #8217;t
      partly
      guilty
      for
      some
      of
      the
      games
      this
      year
      (weeks
      1
      and
      2
      were
      pretty
      bad)
      but
      to
      say
      he
      needs
      to
      go
      after
      what
      he #8217;s
      done
      the
      last
      3-4
      games...sorry
      just
      can #8217;t
      agree

      I #8217;m
      not
      disagreeing
      that
      the
      *offense*
      hasn #8217;t
      scored
      that
      many
      points
      but
      when
      there
      are
      issues
      such
      as
      playcalling
      and
      protection
      along
      with
      a
      lack
      of
      diversity
      for
      receivers
      (which
      didn #8217;t
      appear
      to
      be
      a
      problem
      until
      we
      lost
      Beckham),
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      Eli
      takes
      the
      blame
      here.
      His
      numbers
      have
      improved
      ever
      since
      McAdoo
      became
      our
      OC
      initially.
      Remember
      the
      piss
      poor
      offense
      that
      he
      inherited?
      Eli
      isn #8217;t
      alone
      responsible
      for
      not
      being
      able
      to
      score
      points,
      that #8217;s
      kind
      of
      a
      ridiculous
      thing
      to
      say.

      I
      agree
      part
      of
      the
      blame
      is
      on
      Eli.
      However,
      Eli
      is
      currently
      10th
      in
      total
      yards
      (that's
      even
      with
      throwing
      for
      128
      and
      134
      the
      last
      two
      weeks)
      and
      12th
      for
      TD's
      thrown
      (10),
      all
      while
      being
      sacked
      17
      times
      (or
      an
      average
      of
      about
      2.5/game).
      He
      has
      no
      consistent
      protection
      and
      no
      WRs
      to
      throw
      to
      and
      is
      still
      roughly
      a
      top
      ten
      QB.
      If
      his
      WRs
      don't
      get
      injured
      he's
      close
      to
      a
      top
      5
      QB
      (he
      was
      5th
      overall
      in
      yards/TD's
      up
      until
      three
      weeks
      ago
      I
      believe).
      I
      honestly
      think
      film
      study
      is
      subjective
      to
      a
      great
      extent
      so
      I
      won't
      argue
      there
      as
      what
      Eli
      sees
      the
      defense
      doing
      compared
      to
      his
      trust
      for
      a
      player
      to
      catch
      a
      football
      and
      whether
      or
      not
      they
      ran
      the
      right
      route
      all
      have
      to
      be
      taken
      into
      consideration.
      But
      I'm
      sorry,
      I
      just
      don't
      get
      your
      "he
      has
      bad
      stats"
      argument.
      His
      stats
      aren't
      anywhere
      near
      the
      greatest
      but
      you're
      crazy
      if
      you
      think
      another
      QB
      (that
      isn't
      Brady/Rdogers/Brees)
      would
      do
      better
      in
      our
      offensive
      scheme.

      He
      has
      no
      pocket
      to
      really
      work
      with
      to
      begin
      with.
      Last
      week
      appears
      to
      be
      a
      fluke
      with
      how
      well
      he
      was
      protected.
      The
      lack
      of
      a
      run
      game
      forces
      him
      to
      throw
      quick
      passes
      because
      the
      defensive
      schemes
      are
      only
      rushing
      3-4
      and
      dropping
      the
      rest
      in
      a
      combination
      of
      man/zone
      cover
      2,
      effectively
      taking
      away
      all
      deeper
      options.
      This
      has
      been
      discussed
      for
      the
      last
      few
      weeks
      during
      the
      0-5
      start
      by
      analysts.
      -
      He
      never
      has
      been
      a
      mobile
      QB,
      but
      mobile
      QB's
      typically
      get
      injured
      more
      (look
      at
      Rodgers
      or
      Newton
      for
      example.
      RGIII
      would
      be
      another
      example).
      Brees
      isn't
      mobile,
      Brady
      isn't
      mobile,
      and
      they
      are
      still
      top
      QB's,
      despite
      their
      lack
      of
      mobility.
      -
      The
      few
      deeps
      shots
      he
      threw
      for
      downfield
      yesterday
      were
      on
      target,
      but
      well
      defended.
      Not
      his
      fault
      the
      receiver
      can't
      get
      separation
      to
      make
      a
      play
      (all
      it
      takes
      is
      a
      quick
      juke
      or
      hook
      to
      get
      the
      defender
      to
      bite
      usually.
      Plenty
      of
      other
      team's
      receivers
      can
      do
      this,
      why
      can't
      ours?).
      -
      He
      brings
      to
      the
      table
      an
      ability
      to
      read
      defenses
      and
      call
      an
      audible
      if
      the
      play
      called
      in
      will
      not
      work.
      How
      many
      times
      have
      you
      seen
      Eli
      check
      down
      (audible)
      the
      play
      call
      at
      the
      line
      of
      scrimmage
      to
      the
      secondary
      option?
      All
      this
      while
      ensuring
      his
      players
      are
      also
      in
      the
      correct
      position
      to
      lineup
      for
      the
      snap
      after
      calling
      the
      secondary
      play
      out.
      It's
      obvious
      we
      disagree
      here,
      but
      the
      only
      valid
      point
      I
      think
      you
      could
      have
      just
      made
      in
      that
      post
      was
      the
      yards
      after
      the
      catch
      stat.
      Yes,
      that's
      where
      most
      of
      his
      yards
      come
      from,
      but
      that's
      the
      style
      of
      offense
      this
      team
      runs
      (slant
      passes/short
      post
      patterns).
      Its
      not
      like
      a
      new
      QB
      would
      all
      of
      the
      sudden
      be
      able
      to
      throw
      a
      deeper
      ball
      with
      this
      style
      offense.
      Remember
      Gilbride's
      last
      year
      where
      all
      he
      did
      was
      chuck
      it
      downfield?
      I'm
      not
      sure
      what
      style
      of
      offense
      Sullivan
      wants
      to
      run
      but
      the
      owners
      made
      it
      clear
      when
      they
      hired
      him
      they
      liked
      McAdoo's
      offensive
      styling
      and
      wanted
      it
      to
      remain
      the
      same,
      so
      most
      throws
      are
      going
      to
      be
      5-10
      yard
      targets.

      Now
      you #8217;re
      talking.
      For
      what
      this
      offense
      style/scheme/direction
      is,
      Eli
      is
      being
      overpaid
      *and*
      underutilized.
      I
      agree
      with
      you
      there.
      On
      the
      same
      topic,
      I
      also
      hate
      salary
      caps.
      I
      get
      why
      they
      were
      put
      in
      effect
      initially,
      but
      it #8217;s
      not
      like
      they
      help
      poorer
      teams
      do
      better.
      Look
      at
      the
      Browns/Chargers/Rams/49ers...they #8217;ve
      all
      had
      big
      free
      agent
      signings
      or
      franchise
      players
      yet
      they
      still
      suck.
      Expanding
      the
      league,
      which
      is
      what
      Goodell
      wants,
      isn #8217;t
      gonna
      fix
      the
      issue
      either.

      Nice!
      I
      was
      expecting
      something
      downstate.
      Always
      nice
      to
      see
      a
      local
      course.
      I
      haven #8217;t
      gotten
      to
      play
      at
      Eagle
      Crest
      yet
      (only
      really
      started
      taking
      golf
      seriously
      this
      summer)
      but
      I
      typically
      play
      at
      Van
      Patten.
      Planning
      on
      getting
      to
      Eagle
      Crest
      early
      next
      year.

      He
      virtually
      ripped
      apart
      the
      franchise.
      That
      was
      a
      super
      bowl
      contending
      team
      turned

      NFL
      next

      the

      he
      had

      locker

      issues
      along
      with
      the
      whole
      Alex

      He
      may
      have
      been
      forced
      out
      but
      I
      don #8217;t
      believe
      it
      was
      because
      he
      wasn #8217;t
      who
      the
      owner
      wanted.
      I
      think
      there
      were
      larger
      issues
      that
      just
      weren #8217;t
      made

      Okay,
      having
      three
      passports
      seems
      pretty
      odd
      to
      me.
      However,
      a
      lot
      of
      people
      with
      a
      high
      social/political/economic
      status
      register
      cell
      phones
      under
      fake
      names.
      You
      see
      this
      a
      lot
      with
      celebrities.
      They
      do
      this
      so
      that
      people
      can't
      harass
      them
      by
      looking
      up
      their
      number
      and
      calling
      them.
      They
      can
      range
      from
      something
      outrageous
      (I
      believe
      Howard
      Stern
      has
      something
      like
      *Dickhead
      Buttface*
      or
      something
      like
      that)
      to
      "John
      Smith".
      Not
      really
      that
      big
      of
      a
      deal
      there.

      Yeah,
      while
      that #8217;s
      pretty
      shitty,
      it
      probably
      wouldn #8217;t
      stop
      sick
      people
      from
      going
      to
      work.
      Most
      of
      the
      time
      it #8217;s
      a
      cold
      or
      something,
      rather
      than
      the
      flu
      or
      strep
      that
      can
      be
      treated.
      Most
      people
      don #8217;t
      go
      to
      the
      doctor
      for
      a
      cold
      because
      nothing
      can
      be
      done
      other
      than
      rest
      and
      fluids.
      A
      better
      solution
      would #8217;ve
      been
      to
      give
      employees
      more
      sick
      days,
      but
      that
      would
      be
      exponentially
      more
      expensive
      and
      could
      easily
      be
      abused,
      so
      it #8217;s
      not
      as
      feasible.

      presser?
      Q:

      you

      I
      just
      can #8217;t
      even
      fathom
      why
      he #8217;s
      still
      here
      anymore.
      This
      is
      beyond

      Nope!
      That
      was
      his
      actual
      answer.
      This
      is
      beyond
      depressing
      bad,
      this
      is
      just
      laughably
      bad
      now.

      Jason
      Garrett
      comes
      to
      mind,
      but
      he #8217;s
      more
      of
      Jerry

      than
      a

      Ditka

      Still
      think
      Peyton
      should #8217;ve
      been
      the
      OC.
      How
      great
      would
      that
      have
      been?
      Peyton
      is
      probably
      one
      of
      the
      smartest
      players
      I #8217;ve
      watched
      and
      essentially
      ran
      his
      own
      offense
      while
      in
      Indy.
      Would
      love
      to
      see
      what
      he
      can
      do
      in
      an
      actual
      coaching
      position.

      I #8217;m
      convinced
      he
      didn #8217;t
      know
      he
      actually
      had
      to
      say
      anything
      at
      the
      half
      and
      he
      actually
      never
      did
      yesterday.
      He #8217;s
      so
      full
      of
      stupid
      little
      cliche
      phrases
      for
      his
      post
      game
      pressers
      and
      this
      one
      threw
      him
      off
      his
      feet.
      That
      shows
      he
      wasn #8217;t
      expecting
      the
      question
      and
      didn #8217;t
      actually
      say
      anything
      (or
      anything
      meaningful
      at

      I
      really
      think
      he
      just
      didn #8217;t
      say
      anything,
      or
      if
      what
      he
      did
      say
      would
      make
      him
      look
      worse.
      He
      has
      a
      cliched
      saying
      for
      everything
      it
      seems,
      so
      him
      just
      standing
      there
      mute
      really
      speaks
      volumes
      to
      the
      whole
      situation.

      Yeah,

      it
      was
      worse
      than
      Winston #8217;s

      Winston

      McAdoo

      maybe
      not,

      if

      fire
      him

      If
      he
      stays
      healthy
      and
      is
      consistently
      performing
      then
      I
      can
      see
      it
      happening.
      Not
      very
      likely
      I
      would
      agree,
      but
      he
      has
      yet
      to
      give
      us
      much
      reason
      to
      doubt
      his
      playing
      abilities.
      If
      he #8217;s
      still
      posting
      top
      5
      numbers
      after
      his
      contract
      then
      sure,
      why
      not
      resign
      him
      for
      a
      year
      extension
      and
      see
      how
      he
      does.
      That #8217;s
      what
      I #8217;ve
      always
      thought
      would
      happen.
      Either
      he
      retires
      at
      the
      end
      of
      this
      contract
      or
      they
      give
      him
      a
      1
      or
      2
      year
      extension
      if
      he #8217;s
      still
      playing
      well
      (and
      healthy
      of
      course).
      Does
      this
      include
      postseason
      starts
      as
      well?
      He
      could
      get
      it
      done
      earlier
      with
      a
      few
      postseason
      runs
      in
      there.
      I
      understand
      it
      would
      have
      to
      be
      two
      or
      three
      extra
      games
      a
      year
      (I
      mean
      it #8217;s
      not
      like
      they #8217;re
      going
      to
      the
      Super
      Bowl
      every
      year)
      but
      with
      the
      right
      changes
      in
      the
      offseason
      this
      team
      has
      showed
      that
      they
      have
      the
      ability
      to
      beat
      top
      teams
      in
      the
      NFL.
      They
      just
      have
      to,
      you
      know,
      try.

      I
      agree,
      which
      is
      why
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      we
      should
      sign
      him
      to
      a
      long
      term
      contract
      after
      this
      one
      is
      done.
      Hell,
      Brady
      could
      fall
      off
      a
      cliff
      statistically
      too
      at
      any
      point
      (he #8217;s
      40
      now
      right?)
      Although
      it #8217;s
      more
      unlikely
      that
      Brady
      will.
      Favre
      was
      weird.
      He
      had
      a
      lot
      of
      up
      and
      down
      years
      after
      he
      left
      Green
      Bay,
      but
      he
      definitely
      did
      fall
      off
      his
      last
      year.
      The
      only
      thing
      I
      can
      say
      about
      Peyton
      is
      that
      during
      his
      last
      year
      he
      was
      increasingly
      complaining
      about
      numbness
      in
      his
      fingers/arm,
      which
      was
      likely
      due
      to
      his
      neck
      injury.
      I
      think
      honestly
      if
      he
      never
      had
      that
      injury
      he
      wouldn #8217;t
      have
      fallen
      off
      as
      much.
      You
      could
      see
      that
      during
      his
      last
      year,
      Peyton
      just
      didn #8217;t
      have
      the
      strength
      to
      sling
      it
      as

      as
      he
      used
      to.
      Eli
      right
      now
      is
      still
      throwing
      pretty
      hard
      when
      he
      needs
      to,
      but
      whether
      or
      not
      he
      can
      in
      3-5
      years
      remains
      to
      be
      seen.

      I
      did
      some
      checking
      and
      believe
      it
      or
      not,
      I
      think
      his
      ineptitude
      was
      covered
      by
      Rodgers
      when
      he
      was
      with
      GB
      and
      Eli/Beckham
      when
      he
      was
      with
      NY
      as
      the
      OC.
      Rodgers
      QB
      stats
      overall
      declined
      the
      two
      years
      he
      was
      QB
      coach
      at
      GB
      and
      then
      bounced
      back
      the
      following
      year.
      I
      fully
      believe
      now
      that
      the
      same
      effect
      was
      masked
      by
      Eli
      and
      Beckham
      and
      now
      that
      there #8217;s
      no
      one
      to
      cover
      for
      (this
      is
      an
      entire
      team
      now
      vs.
      a
      portion
      of
      the
      team.
      Last
      year
      the
      defense
      bailed
      him
      out)
      he
      looks
      terrible.
      It #8217;s
      pretty
      shocking
      actually.
      I
      can #8217;t
      believe
      this
      didn #8217;t

      Short
      of

      injury,
      Eli
      isn #8217;t
      going
      in
      at
      all
      Sunday.
      This
      is
      damage
      control
      mode
      for
      McAdoo

      Nope.
      But
      to
      be
      fair,
      in
      that
      weeks
      span
      of
      football
      related
      events
      he
      made
      like
      1000
      other
      stupid
      decisions
      that
      made
      us
      all
      question
      his
      IQ
      and
      I #8217;m
      going

      assume

      a

      prior.
      Like,
      just
      when
      you
      can #8217;t
      think
      it
      will
      get
      any
      worse,
      McAdoo
      finds
      a
      way
      to
      astonish
      us
      all.
      It #8217;s

      really.

      I've
      always
      been
      at
      least
      a
      *little*
      overweight,
      but
      during
      the
      last
      5-6
      years,
      I'd
      gained
      about
      50
      pounds.
      That
      trend
      of
      gaining
      weight
      likely
      would've
      continued
      had
      I
      not
      heard
      about
      keto
      thanks
      to
      one
      of
      my
      friends.
      When
      I
      started
      this
      back
      at
      the
      end
      of
      August,
      I
      was
      skeptical.
      I
      had
      read
      a
      lot
      online
      about
      how
      people
      were
      losing
      a
      ton
      of
      weight,
      and
      fast.
      I'd
      tried
      other
      diets
      or
      just
      straight
      up
      calorie
      restriction
      and
      nothing
      seemed
      to
      work.
      My
      weight
      gain
      would
      stall
      at
      best,
      or
      I'd
      be
      left
      starving
      to
      the
      point
      where
      I
      wouldn't
      be
      able
      to
      continue
      the
      diet
      because
      it
      would
      start
      to
      affect
      judgement
      and
      energy
      levels,
      thus
      preventing
      me
      from
      doing
      day
      to
      day
      tasks.
      I
      figured
      it
      would
      be
      better
      to
      be
      overweight
      than
      just
      in
      a
      constant
      daze
      or
      starving
      because
      I
      was
      miserable.
      I
      realized
      keto
      really
      had
      the
      potential
      to
      work
      when
      I
      had
      my
      first
      "woosh"
      a
      few
      days
      in
      and
      lost
      the
      water
      weight,
      dropping
      about
      5lbs.
      I
      had
      a
      Christmas
      party
      I
      attended
      with
      some
      friends
      I
      hadn't
      seen
      since
      my
      wedding
      in
      July
      (I
      was
      about
      200lbs
      then,
      about
      20-25lbs
      more
      than
      I
      am
      today)
      on
      Saturday.
      They
      all
      commented
      how
      great
      I
      looked
      and
      how
      it
      looked
      like
      I
      had
      lost
      a
      ton
      of
      weight.
      I
      just
      said
      my
      thanks
      and
      asked
      my
      wife
      if
      I
      really
      looked
      that
      different.
      Since
      I
      look
      at
      me
      every
      day,
      I
      guess
      I
      didn't
      notice
      the
      change
      as
      much
      as
      everyone
      else!
      This
      morning,
      I
      passed
      30lbs
      lost.
      I
      honestly
      couldn't
      believe
      it
      and
      had
      to
      step
      on
      the
      scale
      a
      second
      time
      to
      make
      sure.
      Keto
      has
      been
      the
      only
      thing
      I've
      been
      able
      to
      do
      that
      helps
      me
      lose
      weight,
      stay
      feeling
      full,
      and
      still
      enjoy
      foods
      that
      I
      love.
      I
      have
      another
      added
      benefit,
      however.
      Both
      my
      parents
      are
      hereditary
      diabetics
      meaning
      I
      am
      likely
      to
      get
      it
      at
      some
      point
      in
      my
      life.
      The
      fact
      that
      keto
      seems
      to
      help
      diabetics
      is
      just
      a
      bonus
      to
      me.
      I'm
      about
      halfway
      to
      my
      goal
      weight
      and
      am
      looking
      forward
      to
      being
      at
      a
      healthy
      weight
      for
      the
      first
      time
      in
      years.
      While
      I
      don't
      participate
      much
      here,
      I
      will
      say
      that
      reading
      all
      your
      posts
      has
      kept
      me
      motivated
      to
      either
      not
      cheat
      or
      stay
      with
      it
      because
      it
      was
      hard
      to
      transition
      (I
      still
      miss
      bread
      and
      pasta).
      If
      anything
      comes
      out
      of
      this
      post,
      I
      hope
      it
      helps
      someone
      else
      stay
      motivated
      to
      continue!

      Friend
      went
      out
      drinking
      with
      his
      buddy.
      Took
      taxis
      all
      night
      long
      except
      for
      when
      he
      left
      his
      wallet
      in
      the
      last
      taxi
      they
      took.
      Decided
      to
      get
      in
      his
      car
      and
      drive
      (with
      his
      buddy)
      to
      the
      taxi
      headquarters
      to
      retrieve
      said
      wallet.
      Wrapped
      his
      car
      around
      a
      tree
      on
      the
      way
      there,
      instantly
      killing
      his
      friend.
      He's
      currently
      serving
      a
      9
      year
      prison
      sentence
      at
      a
      maximum
      security
      facility
      for
      vehicular
      manslaughter.
      This
      guy
      was
      a
      cop
      and
      had
      everything
      going
      for
      him,
      and
      one
      inexplicable
      choice
      to
      drive
      after
      blacking
      out
      to
      get
      a
      wallet
      you
      can
      get
      the
      next
      day
      just
      baffles
      me.
      I
      stopped
      drinking
      as
      much,
      even
      at
      home,
      for
      fear
      that
      I
      would
      try
      something
      similar
      if
      I
      ended
      up
      blacking
      out.

      Yup.
      Part
      of
      the
      reason
      he
      couldn #8217;t
      wait
      to
      get
      out
      of
      NY.
      I
      am
      happy
      he
      won
      a
      Super
      Bowl
      where
      he
      did
      participate
      though.
      Say
      what
      you
      want
      about
      his
      attitude,
      he
      was
      a
      pretty
      great
      player
      and
      did
      at
      least
      deserve
      that.

      Every
      good
      or
      service
      that #8217;s
      sold
      should
      have
      some
      tax
      associated
      with
      it.
      Do
      you
      have
      an
      argument
      as
      to
      why
      it
      shouldn #8217;t
      be
      taxed?

      Well,
      despite
      my
      flair
      I
      am
      on
      the
      right.
      As
      far
      as
      tax
      amounts,
      that's
      subjective
      but
      I
      view
      alcohol
      and
      tobacco
      warranting
      a
      higher
      tax
      due
      to
      the
      health
      issues
      that
      can
      be
      associated
      with
      repeated
      abuse
      of
      the
      two
      drugs.
      With
      marijuana,
      I'm
      not
      sure.
      I
      believe
      it
      does
      deserve
      to
      be
      taxed
      as
      does
      everything
      else
      that's
      sold
      that
      isn't
      a
      food
      product,
      however
      who
      decides
      that
      tax
      could
      be
      open
      for
      debate.
      Is
      it
      the
      state's?
      State
      tax
      is
      mostly
      what
      drives
      prices
      of
      tobacco
      (living
      in
      NY,
      for
      example,
      there
      is
      a
      very
      high
      NYS
      tax
      on
      tobacco
      products
      vs.
      other
      states).
      Short
      of
      altering
      a
      person's
      state
      of
      mind,
      marijuana
      has
      very
      few,
      if
      any
      at
      all
      negative
      side
      effects.
      I'm
      not
      sure
      if
      the
      evidence
      is
      there
      to
      warrant
      a
      similar
      tax.

      I #8217;m
      not
      sure
      I
      understand
      this.
      You #8217;re
      a
      first
      time
      home
      buyer
      looking
      at
      buying
      a
      $500,000+
      home?
      You
      say
      you
      can #8217;t
      save
      up
      the
      $100,000
      so
      how
      would
      you
      afford
      the
      mortgage
      payments?
      Keep
      in
      mind
      the
      difference
      in
      payments
      can
      vary
      greatly
      at
      that
      price
      point,
      as
      you #8217;d
      be
      financing
      an
      extra
      $80,000+
      into
      the
      loan.
      Not
      saying
      I
      don #8217;t
      believe
      you,
      but
      the
      numbers
      just
      seem
      outrageous.
      For
      reference,
      I
      bought
      my
      first
      home
      in
      April
      and
      put
      $40,000
      down
      (20%
      of
      what
      we
      paid).
      We
      bought
      our
      house
      for
      around
      $200,000.
      I
      used
      a
      first
      time
      home
      buyer
      program
      for
      the
      interest
      rate.
      I
      didn #8217;t
      take
      any
      extra
      benefits
      other
      than
      that
      because
      I
      didn #8217;t
      need
      it.

      Oh
      now
      that
      makes
      sense.
      Well,
      good
      luck
      with
      whatever
      you
      decide.
      Honestly
      I
      would
      be
      so
      discouraged
      if
      that
      was
      what
      I
      was
      facing
      to
      buy
      a
      home
      so
      I
      commend
      you
      for
      trying.
      I #8217;d
      say
      if
      you
      can
      maybe
      get
      up
      to
      say,
      $50,000
      (10%)
      that
      might
      be
      a
      decent
      number
      to
      work
      with
      for
      a
      down
      payment.
      Plus
      if
      you
      can
      put
      10%
      down
      it
      might
      look
      better
      for
      the
      offer
      as
      well.

      Wouldn't
      all
      of
      those
      theoretically
      benefit
      people
      though?
      401k's
      or
      other
      retirement
      plans
      are
      usually
      invested
      in
      the
      stock
      market
      and
      more
      jobs
      would
      mean
      lower
      unemployment
      rates
      and
      more
      people
      being
      able
      to
      provide
      a
      better
      living
      for
      their
      families.
      I'll
      give
      you
      tax
      cuts
      as
      its
      subjective,
      but
      as
      someone
      in
      the
      middle
      of
      the
      upper
      and
      lower
      ends
      of
      the
      tax
      bracket,
      my
      opinion
      doesn't
      account
      for
      what
      most
      people
      on
      this
      site
      would
      like
      to
      advocate
      for.

      That
      kind
      of
      makes
      sense
      if
      you
      ask
      me
      regarding
      the
      401k
      profits
      vs.
      growth
      rate.
      The
      company
      has
      to
      make
      money
      to
      pay
      its
      employees
      as
      well
      as
      invest
      back
      into
      the
      company
      to
      maintain
      various
      things
      (rental
      spaces,
      equipment,
      maintenance,
      etc.).
      I
      guess
      you
      could
      make
      the
      argument
      that
      shareholders
      are
      technically
      "employees"
      as
      they
      get
      paid
      based
      on
      how
      well
      the
      company
      is
      doing,
      but
      that's
      an
      argument
      I
      am
      not
      well
      versed
      in
      and
      feel
      I
      wouldn't
      be
      able
      to
      debate
      that
      without
      more
      research.
      I
      don't
      disagree
      that
      wage
      stagnation
      is
      a
      problem,
      however
      I
      would
      *definitely*
      argue
      that
      living
      as
      a
      "wage
      slave"
      is
      far
      better
      than
      being
      homeless
      or
      hungry,
      as
      living
      under
      a
      roof
      with
      basic
      utilities
      would
      help
      create
      a
      better
      standard
      of
      living
      than
      on
      the
      streets
      or
      in
      shelters
      (especially
      if
      you
      have
      children).

      You're
      right,
      I
      was
      going
      off
      a
      2016
      study
      which
      had
      anywhere
      between
      45-55%
      of
      employees
      utilizing
      a
      401k
      plan.
      In
      a
      2017
      study
      back
      in
      June,
      I
      found
      33%.
      I
      edited
      my
      original
      comment.
      I
      wouldn't
      necessarily
      argue
      that
      they
      are
      "working
      poor",
      however.
      401k
      contributions
      and
      pension
      plans
      have
      been
      slowly
      erased
      from
      corporations
      employer/employee
      contracts.
      For
      example,
      I
      used
      to
      work
      for
      Time
      Warner
      Cable
      (now
      Charter).
      When
      Charter
      took
      over,
      pensions
      were
      eliminated
      and
      401k
      matches
      dropped
      from
      10%
      to
      6%
      overall.
      Most
      employees
      were
      screwed
      in
      this
      case
      because
      they
      had
      been
      planning
      on
      utilizing
      the
      pension
      instead
      of
      a
      401k
      or
      other
      source
      of
      income.
      Working
      poor
      is
      of
      course
      a
      contributing
      factor
      to
      why
      people
      aren't
      contributing
      to
      retirement
      plans,
      however
      just
      like
      you
      refuted
      my
      initial
      "most"
      generalization,
      I'm
      going
      to
      choose
      to
      refute
      yours,
      although
      admittedly
      I
      couldn't
      find
      any
      data
      suggesting
      the
      percentage
      of
      that
      being
      a
      reason
      people
      weren't
      contributing.
      Workers
      have
      had
      to
      find
      new
      ways
      to
      save
      for
      retirement.
      For
      myself,
      I
      utilize
      a
      combination
      of
      a
      457b,
      along
      with
      municipal
      bonds
      and
      a
      few
      stocks,
      along
      with
      my
      pension.
      In
      case
      any
      one
      of
      those
      fails,
      I
      don't
      want
      to
      be
      caught
      without
      a
      "safety
      net",
      per
      say.
      Perhaps
      more
      education
      on
      retirement
      savings
      should
      be
      had
      earlier
      in
      people's
      careers
      or
      even
      in
      school.
      The
      percentages
      of
      what
      people
      are
      contributing
      to
      current
      plans
      increases
      every
      ten
      years
      of
      employee
      age
      it
      seems
      (people
      contributing
      at
      65
      are
      contributing
      around
      10%,
      while
      people
      at
      25
      are
      contributing
      2-3%).

      Do
      you
      have

      You

      Decision
      was
      probably
      a
      poor
      word
      choice
      for
      that
      sentence.
      I
      started
      with
      the
      last
      part
      of
      my
      sentence
      in
      mind
      and
      switched
      the
      order
      around
      as
      I
      wrote
      it.
      Decision
      is
      applicable
      for
      the
      second
      half
      of
      that
      sentence.
      Needless
      to
      say,
      we
      live
      in
      a
      world
      where
      we #8217;re
      constantly
      in
      a
      cycle
      of
      debt.
      That #8217;s
      where
      decision
      came
      up.
      Without
      proper
      budgeting,
      people
      are
      able
      to
      buy
      homes,
      cars,
      and
      take
      out
      personal
      loans
      that
      put
      them
      in
      a
      position
      that
      makes
      it
      difficult
      to
      afford
      monthly
      payments.
      That #8217;s
      where
      the
      word
       #8220;decision #8221;
      came
      in.
      Thanks
      for
      the
      link.
      That
      was
      an
      interesting

      Just
      something
      I've
      found
      after
      close
      to
      20
      years
      of
      bowling:
      I
      only
      change
      balls
      if
      there
      is
      a
      drastic
      change
      in
      lane
      conditions
      (i.e.,
      extremely
      oily
      to
      dry)
      in
      which
      an
      adjustment
      in
      line
      won't
      correct
      the
      reaction
      of
      the
      ball.
      If
      it
      isn't
      finishing
      correctly
      or
      only
      just
      missing,
      I
      typically
      try
      and
      adjust
      my
      release,
      speed,
      or
      line
      before
      making
      a
      ball
      change.
      I
      know
      some
      people
      can
      change
      balls
      on
      the
      fly
      however
      from
      my
      experience,
      it
      isn't
      easy
      for
      me
      because
      my
      balls
      are
      drilled
      for
      different
      lane
      conditions
      and
      therefore
      have
      extremely
      different
      lines.
      YMMV.
      Nice
      series
      though!
      Based
      on
      your
      first
      two
      games
      I'm
      willing
      to
      bet
      that
      178
      was
      actually
      fairly
      close
      to
      another
      200
      game.

      Depends

      I #8217;d

      I #8217;m
      not
      saying
      he
      destroyed
      the

      outright,

      to
      say
      he

      the

      the
      Bucs
      won
      that
      year
      is
      kind

      ridiculous.
      It #8217;s

      saying
      Reese
      was
      the
      only
      one
      responsible
      for
      2007.
      Yeah
      he
      was
      a

      if
      you

      talk
      about
      Acorsi
      then
      you #8217;re

      credit
      for
      winning
      the
      super

      credit
      for
      building

      building
      on

      See
      I
      thought
      the
      Admiral
      that
      took
      over
      was
      an
      SJW.
      I
      turned
      to
      my
      friend
      I
      saw
      it
      with
      before
      she
      even
      spoke
      and
      said
      "oh
      Jesus
      they
      threw
      an
      SJW
      in
      here"
      and
      then
      she
      made
      the
      speech
      on
      the
      ship
      about
      being
      inclusive
      and
      all
      that
      of
      minority
      planets.
      I
      actually
      started
      laughing.
      Yeah,
      that
      isn't
      what
      the
      Resistance
      is
      for.
      It's
      to
      defeat
      the
      First
      Order
      and
      Supreme
      Leader
      Snoke.
      Just
      like
      the
      Rebellion
      were
      supposed
      to
      defeat
      the
      Sith
      and
      Darth
      Vader.
      I
      was
      so
      disappointed
      by
      that
      movie
      in
      so
      many
      ways,
      especially
      because
      they
      didn't
      kill
      off
      Carrie
      Fisher
      when
      they
      had
      the
      chance
      to
      do
      it
      gracefully.
      No,
      they
      had
      her
      fucking
      fly
      back
      to
      the
      ship
      Superman
      style.

      however
      they

      pretty
      heavily
      in
      some

      that's
      fine
      but
      I'd
      rather
      not
      discuss
      it
      here.
      I
      hope
      you
      understand!

      Well,
      yeah.
      They #8217;re
      both
      extremes.
      One
      has
      an
      idea
      for
      a
      military
      oversight
      of
      everything
      and
      the
      other,
      well,
      does
      not.
      You
      could
      make
      that
      into
      a
       #8220;two
      party #8221;
      analogy
      if
      you
      want,
      but
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      that #8217;s
      how
      it
      was
      necessarily
      portrayed
      in
      the
      movie
      outside
      of
      what
      I
      mentioned
      above.
      The
      premise
      of
       #8220;good
      vs.
      evil #8221;
      is
      still
      the
      main
      feeling
      I
      got
      when
      I
      watched
      the
      movie
      regarding
      the
      Resistance/First
      Order.
      My
      point
      was
      certain
      aspects
      of
      each
      side
      were
      unnecessarily
      politicized
      (the
      speech
      by
      the
      Admiral
      was
      the
      most
      egregious
      in
      my
      opinion-
      that
      speech
      was
      totally
      unnecessary
      for
      the
      plot
      of
      the
      movie).

      It #8217;s
      more
      simplistic
      here
      because
      I
      don #8217;t
      want
      to
      get
      into
      anything
      that
      would
      spoilt
      the
      plot
      of
      the
      movie.
      If
      you
      want
      to
      get
      into
      a
      debate
      about
      it
      then
      PM
      me.
      I
      refuse
      to
      say
      anything
      that
      would
      ruin
      parts
      of
      the
      movie
      for
      those
      who
      haven #8217;t
      seen
      it
      yet
      publicly.

      Same
      thing
      happened
      to
      me
      when
      I
      bought
      a
      new
      TV
      a
      few
      weeks
      ago
      at
      Sams
      Club.
      I
      picked
      out
      the
      least
      damaged
      box
      and
      brought
      it
      home,
      and
      the
      bottom
      part
      of
      the
      screen
      was
      busted
      as
      if
      someone
      punched
      it.
      It
      wasn't
      necessarily
      repackaged
      and
      returned,
      but
      it
      was
      pretty
      upsetting
      nonetheless.
      When
      I
      went
      to
      exchange
      it,
      I
      asked
      if
      it
      was
      alright
      if
      I
      checked
      out
      the
      TV
      and
      opened
      the
      box
      before
      leaving
      to
      make
      sure
      the
      next
      one
      wasn't
      damaged.
      The
      guy
      doing
      my
      exchange
      was
      fine
      with
      it,
      and
      even
      helped,
      however
      the
      electronics
      guy
      that
      had
      to
      be
      called
      to
      approve
      the
      exchange
      saw
      me
      unboxing
      it
      there
      and
      made
      a
      comment
      like
      "well
      that's
      completely
      unnecessary,
      but
      okay".
      Yeah,
      if
      the
      first
      TV
      had
      a
      pristine
      box
      had
      a
      busted
      up
      screen,
      then
      I
      want
      to
      sure
      as
      hell
      make
      sure
      the
      TV
      box
      that
      looked
      like
      it
      cartwheeled
      down
      the
      ramp
      onto
      the
      sales
      floor
      was
      fine.

      LG
      is
      another
      brand
      that
      you
      have
      to
      do
      this
      for.
      Also
      check
      to
      see
      if
      its
      under
      there
      as
      a
      different
      setting.
      For
      my
      LG
      TV,
      I
      had
      to
      enable
      "HDMI
      Ultra
      Deep
      Black"
      or
      something
      like
      that
      in
      General
      Settings.
      HDMI
      2.0
      would
      be
      what
      I
      would
      look
      for
      first
      though.

      People
      talking
      as
      if
      they
      actually
      had
      a
      say
      in
      who
      the
      new
      GM
      was...
      I #8217;m
      glad
      my
      lobbying
      for
      Gettleman
      totally
      worked!
      Kidding
      aside,
      I #8217;m
      happy
      with
      the
      decision.
      I
      kind
      of
      wish
      we
      waited
      until
      after
      the
      season
      so
      more
      teams
      could
      have
      available
      candidates
      for
      interview,
      but
      Gettleman
      likely
      was
      going
      to
      be
      gone
      before
      that
      so
      it #8217;s
      not
      terrible.
      Plus,
      Carolina
      hasn #8217;t
      exactly
      been
      the
      worst
      team
      in
      the
      NFL
      over
      the
      last
      few
      years
      so
      I #8217;m
      not
      upset.
      I #8217;m
      curious
      as
      to
      what
      he
      does
      with
      Eli
      (maybe
      force
      him
      to
      take
      a
      pay
      cut?),
      but
      that
      will
      remain
      to
      be
      seen.

      Yes.
      I
      have
      a
      400
      sq
      ft
      garage
      (haven't
      measured
      but
      pretty
      sure
      it's
      20x20)
      and
      fit
      two
      cars
      inside
      along
      with
      shelving
      and
      storage
      on
      the
      side
      and
      in
      front
      of
      each
      car.
      Laundry
      units
      are
      also
      both
      in
      the
      front
      of
      my
      wife's
      car.
      The
      two
      cars
      are
      a
      2013
      Buick
      Encore
      and
      a
      2009
      Hyundai
      Accent
      (smaller
      cars
      for
      sure).
      I
      plan
      on
      getting
      a
      new
      Impreza
      hatch
      however
      this
      summer,
      but
      that
      should
      still
      fit
      as
      well.
      Before
      I
      get
      it
      I
      plan
      on
      remeasuring
      the
      length
      though.
      That's
      really
      the
      only
      limitation
      I
      dislike.
      My
      wife
      had
      a
      courtesy
      car
      while
      her
      Encore
      was
      getting
      work
      done
      and
      she
      got
      a
      LaCrosse.
      Man
      that
      was
      a
      nice
      car!
      Unfortunately
      it
      was
      too
      long
      to
      fit
      in
      the
      garage
      though,
      so
      unless
      we
      move
      we
      won't
      be
      able
      to
      get
      that
      as
      a
      potential
      next
      car.
      Honestly
      my
      next
      house
      is
      going
      to
      have
      at
      least
      a
      2.5
      car
      garage.
      2
      is
      doable
      but
      I'd
      like
      to
      have
      a
      little
      extra
      space
      on
      the
      side
      for
      door
      opening
      and/or
      my
      lawnmower/snowblower.
      Currently
      don't
      have
      room
      for
      the
      latter,
      and
      I
      have
      to
      back
      my
      car
      out
      in
      order
      to
      use
      my
      lawnmower
      (it's
      at
      the
      front
      of
      the
      garage
      in
      front
      of
      my
      car).
      There
      really
      isn't
      room
      enough
      to
      keep
      it
      next
      to
      my
      car,
      but
      I
      don't
      mind
      moving
      my
      car
      out
      in
      the
      spring,
      summer
      and
      fall
      to
      use
      it.
      In
      addition
      to
      the
      extra
      width
      I
      definitely
      want
      a
      slightly
      longer
      garage
      as
      well
      to
      fit
      a
      larger
      vehicle
      in
      it
      too.
      I
      made
      the
      decision
      to
      get
      a
      2
      car
      garage
      with
      the
      intent
      to
      park
      both
      cars
      in
      the
      garage
      however,
      so
      it
      may
      have
      been
      easier
      for
      me
      to
      figure
      out
      how
      everything
      was
      going
      to
      be
      organized.
      I've
      lived
      in
      NY
      my
      entire
      life
      and
      never
      had
      a
      garage
      spot,
      and
      when
      it
      finally
      came
      time
      to
      be
      a
      homeowner,
      I
      made
      the
      2
      car
      garage
      a
      priority.
      I'm
      done
      shoveling
      off
      my
      car
      for
      a
      while
      before
      work
      in
      the
      morning.
      Lol.
      If
      you
      live
      in
      the
      south
      or
      don't
      have
      to
      deal
      with
      snow
      otherwise,
      then
      leaving
      cars
      outside
      isn't
      a
      big
      deal
      imo.
      I'd
      probably
      use
      my
      garage
      as
      more
      of
      a

      While
      I
      don #8217;t
      disagree
      that
      Belichick
      is
      far
      more
      important
      than
      Brady
      to
      that
      organizations
      success,
      I
      can #8217;t
      see
      the
      argument
      being
      made
      that
      Brady
      is
      just
      a
      product
      of
      Belichick #8217;s
      system.
      Brady
      is
      pretty
      great;
      his
      success
      was
      just
      amplified
      by
      his
      coach
      and
      offensive
      system.
      Even
      without
      Bill,
      I
      feel
      Brady
      would #8217;ve
      still
      won
      a
      Super
      Bowl,
      maybe
      even
      two.

      understood

      it

      Yeah,
      no
      thanks.
      This

      met
      twice
      a

      for
      three

      not
      even
      including
      studying
      for
      tests/quizzes/exams,
      etc.
      For
      a
      freshman
      level
      class,
      that's
      ridiculous.
      It's

      due

      that
      my

      (it
      was
      a
      required
      freshman
      course
      for
      the
      program),
      but
      it
      worked
      out
      for
      me
      in
      the

      I
      ended

      and
      spent
      an

      in
      college
      but
      saved
      a
      ton
      of
      money
      in

      and
      met
      my

      at
      the
      job
      I
      picked
      up

      This
      is
      my
      favorite
      year/model
      Vette.
      I've
      been
      lucky
      enough
      to
      see
      one
      in
      Daytona
      Blue
      (favorite
      color)
      and
      lucky
      enough
      to
      have
      driven
      one
      (neighbor
      owned
      one
      and
      let
      me
      drive
      it
      around
      the
      neighborhood).
      My
      neighbor's
      was
      considered
      a
      survivor
      (original
      car
      and
      not
      restored).
      The
      only
      thing
      changed
      on
      the
      car
      was
      the
      exhaust
      system
      was
      modified
      to
      have
      two
      side
      pipes
      instead
      of
      going
      out
      the
      rear
      end.
      It
      dramatically
      increased
      the
      sound
      and
      was
      incredibly
      awesome.

      I

      I #8217;d
      rather
      not
      have

      losing
      in

      someone
      else.
      Last
      year
      was
      close
      enough.
      If
      the
      Pats
      are
      in
      it,
      go
      Pats,
      otherwise
      any
      team
      but
      the
      Pats
      are
      my
      favorite
      for
      the
      SB.

      I'm
      Platinum
      in
      Doubles
      and
      Gold
      III
      in

      in

      Standard,
      I'm
      Silver
      II.
      I
      honestly
      use
      Solo
      Standard
      as
      a
      "lets
      try

      game

      and
      don't
      necessarily
      care
      what
      my
      rank
      is.
      Too
      many
      toxic/apathetic
      players
      in
      Solo
      Standard
      to
      make
      it
      consistent
      for
      me,
      even
      if
      I
      play
      defensive.
      I
      usually
      get
      spammed
      with
      What
      a
      save!
      or
      yelled
      at
      for
      staying
      in
      goal
      and/or
      mid,
      so
      I
      move
      out
      of
      goal
      and
      try
      to

      and
      my
      teammates
      then
      blow
      a
      save
      or
      were
      way
      out

      Its
      actually
      not
      that
      simple.
      While
      the
      flag
      was
      obviously
      pro-slavery,
      being
      simulataneously
      anti-black
      is
      a
      bit
      of
      a
      muddier
      issue.
      Slave
      owners
      didn't
      necessarily
      care
      what
      race
      the
      slaves
      were,
      as
      long
      as
      they
      had
      slaves
      to
      do
      labor
      for
      them.
      Slavery
      in
      the
      1850s
      was
      in
      place
      largely
      for
      economic
      reasons.
      When
      the
      Founding
      Fathers
      initially
      drafted
      the
      Constitution,
      the
      debate
      about
      whether
      or
      not
      to
      abolish
      slavery
      was
      pretty
      heated
      actually.
      In
      the
      end,
      however,
      slavery
      was
      neither
      authorized
      nor
      abolished
      in
      the
      Constitution
      because,
      economically,
      the
      south
      could
      not
      handle
      the
      withdrawal
      of
      the
      slave
      labor
      they
      depended
      on
      at
      the
      time.
      The
      issue
      was
      put
      off
      because
      greater
      issues
      (debatable,
      of
      course,
      but
      things
      are
      a
      lot
      different
      now
      than
      they
      were
      back
      250
      years
      ago)
      were
      a
      bit
      more
      pressing
      at
      the
      time.
      You're
      forgetting
      the
      fact
      that
      while
      racism
      was
      a
      large
      part
      of
      life
      in
      the
      first
      50
      or
      so
      years
      of
      the
      United
      States,
      the
      biggest
      reason
      for
      the
      Civil
      War
      was
      that
      slavery
      was
      the
      economic
      backbone
      of
      the
      south.
      The
      south,
      knowing
      the
      issue
      of
      slavery
      had
      been
      put
      off
      constantly,
      refused
      to
      reform
      their
      economic
      systems
      to
      handle
      labor
      without
      slavery.
      Largely,
      it
      was
      greed
      from
      the
      plantation
      owners
      because
      they
      didn't
      have
      to
      pay
      for
      the
      labor
      their
      slaves
      provided.
      The
      illusion
      that
      the
      north
      wasn't
      racist
      at
      all
      is
      insane.
      One
      of
      the
      biggest
      issues
      that
      caused
      the
      war
      to
      start
      was
      due
      to
      what
      to
      do
      with
      labor
      in
      territorial
      expansions.
      The
      south
      wanted
      to
      continue
      slavery
      in
      new
      territories,
      while
      the
      north
      wanted
      white-only
      labor.
      Hell,
      Britain
      and
      France
      continued
      to
      trade
      with
      (and
      therefore
      support)
      the
      south
      because
      that's
      where
      they
      got
      most
      of
      their
      cotton
      imported
      from,
      and
      both
      countries
      had
      abolished
      slavery
      at
      least
      20
      years
      earlier
      (Britain
      in
      1833
      and
      France
      in
      1794).
      While
      they
      took
      "neutral"
      stances
      during
      the
      war,
      they
      helped
      both
      the
      north
      and
      the
      south
      because
      they
      honestly
      wanted
      to
      be
      economically
      secure
      with
      whichever
      half
      of
      the
      country
      came
      out
      victorious.
      Britain
      actually
      allowed
      use
      of
      ports
      for
      the
      south
      to
      build
      warships
      during
      the
      war.
      Yes
      racism
      played
      a
      big
      part
      in
      the
      Civil
      War,
      but
      the
      economic
      repercussions
      of
      outlawing
      slavery
      was
      just
      as
      big
      a
      part,
      if
      not
      bigger
      in
      why
      most
      southerners
      fought
      to
      keep
      slavery.
      Similarly,
      its
      why
      a
      lot
      of
      companies
      today
      (that
      can
      get
      away
      with
      it)
      pay
      people
      under
      the
      table
      or
      hire
      illegal
      immigrants
      to
      do
      work
      for
      them:
      they're
      looking
      for
      any
      way
      possible
      to
      save
      money
      on
      labor/insurance/etc.,
      just
      how
      the
      slave
      owners
      both
      a)
      didn't
      want
      to
      do
      the
      manual
      labor
      themselves
      and
      b)
      didn't
      want
      to
      have
      to
      pay
      anyone
      to
      do
      what
      they
      could
      already
      have
      done
      for
      free.
      PBS
      did
      a
      documentary
      on
      Civil
      War
      and
      it
      goes
      a
      lot
      more
      in
      depth
      than
      this.
      It's
      pretty
      great
      actually,
      I
      highly
      suggest
      you
      watch
      it.
      P.S.
      what
      I
      actually
      find
      somewhat
      hysterical
      is
      that
      historically
      Republicans
      are
      considered
      to
      be
      the
      "racist"
      party.
      Yet
      in
      the
      50s/60s,
      the
      south
      was
      largely
      controlled
      by
      Democrats,
      and
      in
      the
      1850s/60s,
      it
      was
      a
      Republican
      President
      that
      won
      the
      Civil
      War
      and
      also
      won
      his
      first
      election
      without
      a
      single
      electoral
      vote
      from
      the
      southern
      states.
      LBJ
      was
      almost
      famously
      racist.
      I
      just
      find
      it
      funny
      how
      the
      meaning
      of
      the
      flag
      (pro-slavery
      to
      southern
      pride)
      and
      who
      flies
      it
      has
      changed
      so
      drastically
      over
      the
      course
      of
      the
      last
      150
      years
      or
      so.
      It
      makes
      you
      wonder
      if
      say,
      in
      another
      100
      to
      150
      years,
      the
      Nazi
      Germany
      or
      U.S.S.R.
      flags
      will
      have
      a
      different
      meaning
      as
      well.
      I
      mean
      the
      swastika
      itself
      was
      never
      considered
      an
      "evil"
      symbol
      until
      Hitler
      used
      it.
      You
      just
      never
      know.

      that's
      a
      fair
      generalization
      of
      the
      term
      anti-black
      to
      describe
      the
      Confederate
      flag.
      My
      point
      was
      more
      so
      to
      argue
      that
      it
      could've
      easily
      have
      been
      Asian
      slaves,
      for
      example,
      had
      Asia
      been
      an
      underdeveloped
      or
      easy
      to
      manipulate
      land
      mass.
      To
      your
      second
      point,
      sorry!
      I
      was
      a
      history
      major
      in
      college
      and
      I
      tend
      to
      geek
      out
      a
      bit
      when
      it
      comes
      to
      talking
      about
      American
      war
      history
      (my
      concentration).
      I
      studied
      war
      and
      specifically
      U.S.
      involvement
      both
      internally
      and
      externally,
      so
      I
      guess
      I
      went
      on
      a
      bit
      further
      than
      I
      should
      have.
      It's
      crazy
      to
      think
      how
      had
      the
      south
      won,
      we
      probably
      wouldn't
      even
      be
      discussing
      this,
      similar
      to
      how
      we
      would
      likely
      be
      talking
      entirely
      differently
      about
      Germany
      if
      Hitler
      never
      abandoned
      his
      air
      raid
      strategy
      against
      Britain
      in
      WWII.

      I
      had
      the

      something
      the
      modern
      version
      just
      doesn #8217;t
      have.
      Although
      what
      I #8217;d
      really
      like
      is
      a
      14060.
      Love
      dive
      watches.
      If
      I #8217;ve
      learned
      anything
      in
      my
      years
      of

      I
      love
      dive
      watches
      almost
      unhealthily.

      Giants
      fan
      here.
      Thought
      legitimately
      you
      hired
      McAdoo
      to
      call
      Your
      plays
      once
      you
      got
      the
      lead.
      Way
      too
      conservative,
      starting
      with
      the
      kneel
      downs
      with
      55
      seconds
      and
      two
      timeouts.
      I
      don #8217;t
      know
      why
      your
      coaches
      took
      the
      ball
      out
      of
      Bortles #8217;
      hands.
      He
      matched
      Brady
      throw
      for
      throw
      until
      the
      4th
      quarter
      and
      looked
      great
      with
      his
      reads/accuracy.
      You
      had
      no
      business
      trying
      to
      run
      it
      up
      the
      middle
      on
      almost
      every
      first
      and
      second
      down
      you
      had
      in
      the
      second
      half.
      It
      was
      ridiculous.
      I #8217;m
      sincerely
      sorry.

      That #8217;s
      fair.
      I
      assumed
      you
      meant
      you #8217;re
      guaranteed
      $24k
      per
      year
      before
      tax.
      Salary/hourly
      pay
      are
      two
      different
      things.
      If
      you
      have
      a
      job
      that #8217;s
      only
      20
      hours/week,
      it #8217;s
      very

      that #8217;s
      a
      salaried
      position
      and
      is
      most
      likely
      hourly.
      When
      you

      you

      $X/year,
      it #8217;s

      you

      not

      That #8217;s
      not
      always
      the
      case,

      that #8217;s

      how

      Haha,
      I'm
      kind
      of
      in
      the
      same
      position
      myself.
      I
      guess
      I
      got
      lucky
      when
      I
      hit
      my
      heaviest
      because
      of
      the
      expandable
      waist,
      however
      now
      that
      my
      waist
      is
      a
      lot
      smaller
      the
      pants
      are
      honestly
      a
      bit
      more
      worn
      out
      and
      stretched
      than
      too
      big.
      In
      reality
      I
      think
      I
      went
      from
      36ish
      to
      33-34ish
      but
      the
      stretch
      makes
      the
      pants
      feel
      bigger
      I
      think.
      Although
      to
      be
      fair
      I
      really
      don't
      think
      of
      pant
      size
      as
      too
      much
      of
      a
      big
      deal
      anymore
      though.
      Sizes
      are
      so
      far
      off
      I
      have
      some
      shorts
      that
      are
      36
      that
      fit
      great
      and
      other
      pants
      that
      are
      32
      and
      fit
      the
      exact
      same.
      I
      usually
      just
      grab
      something
      close
      and
      go
      up
      or
      down
      in
      size
      depending
      on
      the
      fit
      haha

      Nice
      analysis.
      Also
      living
      in
      upstate
      NY,
      I
      highly
      recommend
      an
      AWD
      vehicle
      as
      your
      next
      purchase.
      I
      currently
      drive
      a
      2009
      Hyundai
      Accent
      and
      it
      isn #8217;t
      bad
      in
      the
      snow,
      but
      AWD
      is
      something
      that
      I #8217;ve
      come
      to
      want
      as
      my
      commute
      consists
      of
      quite
      a
      few
      hills
      that
      have
      caused
      me
      to
      lose
      traction
      a
      few
      times
      during
      the
      past
      two
      winters.
      Plus
      my
      driveway
      is
      uphill,
      so
      not
      having
      to
      floor
      it
      essentially
      or
      hit
      the
      driveway
      at
      speed
      to
      get
      up
      into
      the
      garage
      would
      be
      nice.

      Used
      to
      work
      at
      a
      large
      supermarket
      chain
      as
      a
      service
      desk/supervisor.
      This
      was
      largely
      how
      we
      operated,
      except
      we
      had
      to
      call
      a
      department
      manager
      over
      for
      refunds
      greater
      than
      $20.
      People
      knew
      this
      and
      would
      frequently
      return
      stuff
      just
      less
      than
      $20.
      It
      was
      pretty
      easy
      to
      spot
      them,
      and
      all
      we
      could
      do
      was
      report
      them
      to
      our
      manager
      and
      LP,
      but
      it
      almost
      always
      went
      nowhere.
      One
      lady
      that
      sticks
      to
      my
      memory
      would
      get
      stuff
      from
      a
      food
      pantry
      and
      then
      return
      it
      for
      the
      cash.
      People
      legit
      need
      that
      stuff
      and
      you #8217;re
      using
      it
      to
      just
      make
      a
      quick
      buck.
      It
      really
      sickened
      me
      doing
      the
      return
      but
      there
      was
      literally
      nothing
      we
      could
      do.

      Urbanizing
      shouldn #8217;t
      be
      a
      requirement
      for
      any
      political
      party.
      Some
      of
      us
      don #8217;t
      want
      to
      live
      in
      cities
      and
      enjoy
      having
      some
      space
      between
      us
      and
      our
      neighbors/a
      large-ish
      house.
      If
      you
      meant
      being
      modernized
      (i.e.,
      expanding
      available
      industry
      in
      the
      state
      to
      match
      economic
      and
      technological
      advances),
      then
      fine,
      but
      being
      urban
      and
      being
      modern
      are
      two
      completely
      different
      things.

      The
      thing
      that
      sticks
      out
      here
      to
      me
      the
      most
      is
      that
      you #8217;re
      not
      as
      heavy
      as
      some
      of
      the
      other
      people
      posting.
      My
      wife
      for
      example
      is
      4 #8217;11 #8221;
      and
      was
      about
      160,
      and
      she
      only
      lost
      three
      pounds
      in
      her
      first
      week,
      while
      I
      (5 #8217;7 #8221;
      207
      start
      weight)
      lost
      7
      pounds
      in
      my
      first
      week.
      Everyone
      is
      different
      but
      those
      who
      are
      larger
      tend
      to
      lose
      a
      lot
      more
      at
      first
      than
      others.
      Keep
      with
      it
      and
      see
      what
      happens
      over
      the
      next
      month,
      and
      remember
      that
      losing
      2lbs/week
      is
      pretty
      great
      anyway!

      Also
      doing
      Keto
      (and
      IF
      as
      well),
      and
      I
      agree
      about
      the
      carbs.
      Been
      doing
      it
      for
      around
      7
      months
      now
      and
      I'll
      have
      the
      occasional
      slice
      of
      bread
      or
      bite
      or
      two
      of
      pasta,
      but
      that's
      it.
      Baked
      potatoes
      are
      a
      weakness
      though,
      but
      if
      I
      plan
      ahead
      it
      isn't
      always
      terrible.
      Although
      the
      thing
      I
      miss
      most
      is
      Reese's
      cups.
      I
      still
      miss
      those,
      even
      now
      after
      all
      this
      time
      without
      them.

      I #8217;ve
      noticed
      the
      same
      recently.
      I #8217;ve
      actually
      had
      to
      resize
      a
      few
      of
      my
      watches
      because
      they
      were
      too
      lose.
      I
      also
      now
      need
      to
      wear
      my
      wedding
      band
      on
      my
      right
      hand
      because
      my
      left
      ring
      finger
      is
      too
      small
      now
      for
      the
      ring
      size
      I
      got.
      I
      plan
      on
      resizing
      that
      too
      however
      that
      will
      happen
      after
      I
      hit
      my
      goal
      weight.
      No
      reason
      to
      do
      it
      when
      I
      plan
      on
      losing
      another
      20-30
      more
      lbs.
      Congrats!

      You

      want
      to
      be
      stationed
      in
      the

      Military.
      You
      create
      a
      preference
      list
      and
      hope
      you

      There #8217;s
      two
      extremes
      to
      this
      in
      NYS:
      either
      they
      drive
      as
      if
      nothing
      is
      falling
      out
      of
      the
      sky,
      or
      they
      drive
      as
      if
      their
      headlights
      went
      out
      in
      the
      middle
      of
      the
      night
      on
      an
      unlit
      highway.
      I
      can
      handle
      the
      people
      driving
      stupidly
      fast,
      but
      what
      irritates
      me
      is
      the
      people
      that
      drive
      so
      slow
      it
      actually
      negatively
      affects
      traction
      when
      going
      up
      an
      incline.
      I
      can #8217;t
      tell
      you
      how
      many
      times
      I #8217;ve
      nearly
      gotten
      stuck
      or
      have
      been
      stuck
      because
      the
      guy
      ahead
      of
      me
      slowed
      down
      to
      a
      crawl
      going
      up
      a
      hill
      and
      subsequently
      lost
      traction.
      So
      what
      if
      you
      fishtail
      a
      bit,
      if
      you
      keep
      the
      gas
      into
      it
      a
      little
      and
      weave
      slightly
      to
      cut
      through
      the
      slush
      or
      snow
      you #8217;ll
      keep
      your
      traction.
      And
      this
      is
      with
      a
      2WD
      car.
      People
      don #8217;t
      understand
      that
      going
      to
      slow
      is
      possible
      in
      a
      snowstorm.
      I
      wish
      people
      were
      taught
      in
      this
      state
      (or
      any
      state
      that
      gets
      snow
      really)
      how
      to
      properly
      drive
      in
      the
      snow.

      comfortable
      life
      then
      you
      should
      probably
      find
      somewhere
      else
      where
      cost
      of
      living
      is
      less
      (i.e.,
      not
      a
      metropolitan
      area,
      like
      a
      suburb
      or
      something
      a
      bit
      more
      rural).
      I
      can #8217;t
      tell
      you
      how
      many
      people
      I
      know
      who
      work
      in
      NYC
      and
      live
      with
      a
      long
      commute
      outside
      the
      city.
      My
      dentist
      even
      moved
      his
      practice
      from
      NYC
      to
      upstate
      NY
      because
      cost
      of
      living
      was
      so
      much
      less
      that
      he
      made
      more
      money
      here
      even
      with
      a
      lower
      salary
      than
      he
      made
      in
      the
      city.

      This
      is
      a
      big
      part
      of
      it,
      but
      I
      wouldn #8217;t
      be
      surprised
      if
      other
      political
      forces
      in
      the
      state
      are
      influencing
      rent
      as
      well.
      The
      only
      other
      problem
      is
      real
      estate
      prices
      have
      also
      skyrocketed
      for
      whatever
      reason
      and
      that #8217;s
      driven
      rent
      up
      as
      well.
      Unfortunately
      *one*
      person
      can #8217;t
      say
       #8220;I
      won #8217;t
      pay
      $1600/month
      to
      rent
      this,
      make
      it
      cheaper. #8221;
      The
      landlord
      would
      laugh
      because
      there #8217;s
      probably
      a
      line
      behind
      said
      person
      willing
      to
      pay
      that
      or
      even
      more.

      I
      think
      the
      issue
      is
      more
      to
      blame
      on
      the
      boomers
      due
      to
      the
      retirement
      age
      being
      effectively
      pushed
      back
      *and*
      boomers
      not
      adequately
      preparing
      for
      retirement
      (savings,
      401k,
      etc.).
      Employers
      are
      willing
      to
      lay
      off
       #8220;expensive #8221;
      boomers,
      but
      with
      the
      experience
      gained
      over
      the
      last
      30-40
      years
      they
      can
      easily
      find
      an
      entry
      level
      position
      and
      often
      do,
      due
      to
      the
      fact
      they
      need
      the
      money
      because
      they
      never
      planned
      for
      retirement
      properly,
      effectively
      taking
      jobs
      away
      from
      younger
      people.
      The
      other
      side,
      millennials,
      are
      to
      blame
      because
      of
      the
      fact
      that
      the
      studies
      of
      liberal
      arts
      programs
      are
      becoming
      far
      more
      popular
      than
      the
      job
      market
      and
      available
      salaries
      can
      allow.
      It #8217;s
      not
      uncommon
      to
      see
      liberal
      arts
      being
      a
      majority
      of
      majors
      in
      a
      college
      graduating
      class
      for
      a
      lot
      of
      school,
      however
      the
      jobs/pay
      just
      isn #8217;t
      there
      to
      match
      demand
      whereas
      sciences
      and
      programming
      continue
      to
      drive
      higher
      and
      higher
      wages.
      Why
      is
      this
      the
      case?
      Easier
      course
      load?
      Honestly
      not
      sure,
      but
      it #8217;s
      an
      exponentially
      increasing
      issue
      and
      you
      have
      people
      with
      bachelors
      degrees
      working
      minimum
      wage
      because
      of
      it,
      creating
      a
      cycle
      of
      debt
      that
      they #8217;ll
      be
      lucky
      to
      get
      out
      of
      in
      their
      lifetime.

      Blame
      your
      town
      not
      the
      company
      for
      that
      one.
      Municipalities
      are
      responsible
      for
      licensing
      cable/broadband
      providers
      for
      access
      in
      their
      jurisdiction.
      If
      you #8217;re
      complaining
      because
      of
      that
      reason,
      elect
      new
      officials
      who
      are
      willing
      to
      allow
      competition
      in
      your
      area
      for
      cable
      providers.
      There
      was
      a
      town
      in
      NY
      that
      did
      this
      a
      while
      ago.
      Verizon
      wanted
      to
      come
      in
      with
      FiOS
      (and
      had
      overwhelming
      public
      support
      as
      well),
      yet
      the
      town
      blocked
      the
      for
      Cablevision
      or
      something
      like
      that.
      Edit:
      the
      town
      was
      Brookhaven,

      I
      was
      at
      the
      Chiefs
      game,
      so
      that
      may
      lead
      me
      to
      be
      a
      bit
      more
      impartial
      on
      this
      question,
      but
      that's
      my
      favorite
      game
      this
      past
      season.
      The
      Denver
      game
      was
      also
      very
      good,
      also
      was
      Sully's
      first
      time
      calling
      offensive
      plays
      this
      season.
      Even
      though
      we
      lost,
      both
      Eagles
      games
      were
      pretty
      well
      played
      offensively
      as
      well
      (highest
      scoring
      games
      of
      the
      season
      I
      believe).
      The
      last
      game
      of
      the
      season
      (Giants/Chiefs)
      as
      also
      a
      great
      game,
      not
      only
      because
      we
      won,
      but
      it
      was
      pretty
      emotional
      at
      the
      end
      with
      Spags
      and
      Eli
      together
      not
      really
      knowing
      their
      futures
      with
      the
      team.

      Not
      OP
      but
      my
      wife
      actually
      has
      mentioned
      the
      same
      to
      me
      about
      mine...I
      think
      it #8217;s
      the
      less
      fat
      around
      it
      that
      makes
      it
      seem
      bigger.
      Not
      that
      her
      (nor
      I)
      are
      complaining
      though!

      big

      Jack
      may
      be
      an
      asshole,
      but
      gender
      (or
      sex)
      is
      determined
      biologically
      by
      a
      set
      of
      two
      chromosomes.
      Even
      if
      you
      have
      sex
      reassignment
      surgery,
      you
      are
      still
      biologically
      whatever
      gender
      you
      were
      born
      as,
      even
      if
      you
      have
      a
      penis
      now
      instead
      of
      a
      vagina
      (or
      vice
      versa).
      Hormone
      therapy,
      sex
      reassignment
      surgery,
      and
      what
      the
      brain
      thinks
      does
      not
      determine
      which
      chromosomes
      your
      body
      has
      determining
      your
      gender.
      Just
      to
      be
      clear,
      I #8217;m
      not
      dismissing
      trans
      people
      as
      illegitimate
      or
      wrong,
      I #8217;m
      just
      disputing
      the
      gender
      question.
      Until
      they
      figure
      out
      a
      way
      to
      transplant
      different
      chromosomes
      into
      a
      person
      (which
      would
      be
      awesome
      because
      it
      could
      inadvertently
      cure
      Down
      Syndrome
      as
      well),
      gender
      will
      never
      be
      a
       #8220;social #8221;
      construct.
      And
      even
      then,
      it
      will
      always
      in
      some
      way
      be
      biological.

      I
      appreciate
      your
      argument,
      however
      that
      isn #8217;t
      consistent
      with
      a
      lot
      of
      official
      forms
      used
      by
      both
      corporations
      and
      governments
      in
      the
      US.
      Some
      use
       #8220;sex #8221;,
      while
      others
      use
       #8220;gender #8221;,
      giving
      the
      impression
      they
      are
      in
      fact
      interchangeable.
      Like
      I
      said,
      I #8217;m
      totally
      okay
      if
      you
      want
      to
      be
      a
      girl
      if
      you #8217;re
      a
      guy
      or
      whatever,
      but
      that
      doesn #8217;t
      physically
      change
      your
      gender.
      Just
      because
      you
      wear
      dresses
      or
      play
      with
      dolls
      or
      wear
      heels
      (or
      even
      have
      reassignment
      surgery)
      doesn #8217;t
      make
      you
      a
       #8220;girl #8221;
      biologically.

      I
      respectfully
      disagree.
      Plenty
      of
      official
      forms
      by
      both
      corporations
      and
      governments
      use
      gender
      and
      sex
      interchangeably.
      Whether
      you
      want
      to
      argue
      that
      those
      forms
      need
      to
      be
      updated
      or
      not
      is
      certainly
      another
      debate,
      however
      in
      today #8217;s
      world,
      the
      two
      terms
      are
      not
      separately
      defined.

      This
      is
      my
      personal
      experience:
      Last
      week
      my
      wife
      and
      I
      visited
      her
      parents
      in
      FL.
      Planned
      on
      cheating
      all
      week
      because
      we
      were
      going
      out
      every
      night.
      This
      included
      beer.
      My
      calories
      in/out
      probably
      was
      close
      to
      what
      I
      was
      maintaining
      before
      vacation
      (we
      played
      tennis/pickleball
      and
      swam
      a
      lot,
      so
      exercising
      was
      about
      normal
      as
      well)
      however
      carbs
      skyrocketed
      as
      I
      expected.
      Ended
      up
      coming
      home
      feeling
      bloated
      and
      6
      lbs
      heavier
      than
      when
      I
      left.
      Again,
      I
      expected
      this
      and
      switched
      back
      to
      Keto
      as
      soon
      as
      I
      got
      back
      on
      Friday.
      Today
      I
      weighed
      in
      at
      161.5,
      or
      .2
      lbs
      heavier
      than
      when
      I
      left.
      BE
      CAREFUL
      THOUGH!
      You
      have
      to
      be
      really
      disciplined
      to
      cheat
      like
      that
      and
      switch
      back
      to
      Keto
      after.
      In
      December,
      I
      cheated
      a
      lot
      and
      it
      stalled
      my
      weight
      loss
      for
      a
      month
      but
      I
      was
      able
      to
      get
      back
      on
      track.
      It
      is
      really
      tough
      to
      swap
      back
      and
      forth,
      and
      until
      I
      hit
      my
      goal
      weight
      I
      will
      be
      doing
      strict
      Keto
      (only
      about
      20-25
      lbs
      left).
      If
      you
      don #8217;t
      think
      you #8217;d
      have
      the
      discipline
      to
      be
      strict
      about
      after
      your
      beer
      fest,
      I #8217;d
      honestly
      just
      stick
      to
      vodka
      sodas
      or
      whiskey
      diets
      (my
      personal
      go
      to).
      If
      I #8217;m
      craving
      beer,
      I #8217;ll
      have
      a
      Michelob
      Ultra
      or
      Corona
      Premier.

      They
      came
      to
      an
      upstate
      NY
      show
      years
      ago
      when
      air
      shows
      were
      popular
      at
      the
      Scotia
      ANG
      base.
      So
      happy
      I
      got
      to
      see
      them
      perform.
      That
      and
      seeing
      the
      F-117
      and
      B-2
      flying
      are
      probably
      my
      top
      three
      favorite
      aviation
      memories.
      Also
      got
      to
      see
      the
      Thunderbirds,
      but
      imo
      Blue
      Angels
      were
      better.

      Depending
      on
      your
      tolerance,
      it
      could
      vary.
      For
      me,
      I
      used
      to
      be
      able
      to
      handle
      5
      or
      6
      whiskey
      diets
      (drank
      them
      before
      Keto
      too,
      never
      really
      cared
      for
      regular
      soda).
      Now
      I #8217;m
      good
      after
      3,
      anything
      higher
      can
      push
      blackout
      territory
      (happened
      once
      when
      I
      had
      5).
      Beer
      doesn #8217;t
      seem
      to
      affect
      me
      (Mich
      Ultra
      or
      Corona
      Premier,
      so
      super
      low
      carb).
      Hangovers
      also
      suck
      soooo
      much
      so
      if
      you
      can
      make
      sure
      you
      don #8217;t
      have
      anything
      planned
      in
      the
      morning.
      I #8217;ve
      had
      a
      hangover
      last
      nearly
      a
      full
      day.
      Make
      sure
      you
      drink
      plenty
      of
      water.

      What
      I've
      found
      (because
      for
      me,
      decreasing
      drink
      totals
      by
      50%
      made
      me
      feel
      like
      a
      lightweight,
      and
      when
      people
      would
      be
      ordering
      new
      drinks
      and
      I'd
      sit
      there
      awkwardly
      sometimes)
      is
      that
      if
      I
      alternate
      a
      glass
      of
      water
      between
      every
      drink,
      I'm
      still
      "participating"
      in
      drinking
      when
      out
      with
      friends,
      however
      I
      am
      not
      actually
      consuming
      any
      alcohol.
      That
      helps
      balance
      it
      out
      and
      you
      always
      have
      something
      in
      your
      hand,
      which
      can
      also
      prevent
      drunk
      munchies
      too.
      Also
      have
      fun
      in
      Vegas.
      Never
      been,
      but
      its
      on
      my
      bucketlist.

      FYI,
      that
      looks
      more
      like
      a
      pilots
      watch

      bezel)
      than
      a
      dive
      watch.
      Still
      awesome
      though!
      I
      haven #8217;t
      seen

      Nice!
      I
      got
      to
      wear
      a
      2007
      Super
      Bowl
      ring
      at
      training
      camp
      in
      2008...pretty
      great
      memory,
      although
      I
      wish
      I
      saw
      whose
      it
      was.
      Pretty
      sure
      it
      was
      just
      an
      exec
      or
      backup
      player,
      but
      still
      super
      cool
      nonetheless.

      My
      eye
      just
      started
      twitching
      and
      I'm
      pretty

      my

      rose

      Sorry
      to
      hijack,
      but
      I #8217;m
      from
      NY,
      and
      planning
      to
      go
      to
      my
      first
      game
      in
      KC
      next
      year.
      Is
      there
      a
      place
      where
      I
      can
      find
      information
      on
      where
      to
      stay,
      restaurants,
      etc.?
      We #8217;re
      (wife
      and
      I)
      are
      looking
      at
      getting
      tickets
      to
      a
      weekend
      series
      and
      making
      the
      most
      out
      of
      our
      trip
      before
      we
      fly
      back
      to
      NY.
      Usually
      I
      go
      to
      the
      games
      at
      Fenway
      or
      Yankee
      Stadium
      because
      they #8217;re...kinda
      close,
      but
      I
      really
      need
      to
      get
      out
      to
      the
      K.

      Apache
      helicopters
      and
      F-18
      jets
      are
      not
      weapons,
      they
      are
      vehicles
      that
      carry
      weapons
      payloads
      and
      automatic
      machine
      guns.
      And
      sure,
      if
      the
      technology
      is
      declassified
      and
      I
      had
      the
      money
      to
      buy
      an
      F-18
      jet
      then
      yeah,
      I #8217;d
      want
      it.
      The
      aviation
      engineering
      that
      went
      into
      that
      jet
      is
      pretty
      astounding.
      People
      can
      buy
      old
      P-51
      Mustangs
      or
      B-17s
      that
      have
      been
      decommissioned,
      are
      you
      against
      civilians
      owning
      those
      as
      well?

      Law
      prohibits
      any
      fully
      automatic
      weapon
      made
      after
      1986
      from
      being
      sold
      to
      a
      civilian.
      Even
      then,
      it #8217;s
      tough
      to
      get
      your

      a

      Rocket
      launchers
      are
      a
      bit
      different.
      You
      can
      buy
      one,
      however
      certain
      ones
      are
      one-time-use
      only,
      and
      others
      are
      technically
      rocket
      launchers
      but
      have
      no
      explosive
      that
      will
      actually
      work
      with
      it
      due
      to
      the
      tube
      diameter.

      It
      was
      one
      AR,
      actually.
      And,
      well,
      that #8217;s
      on
      his
      mom
      I
      would
      say
      for
      not
      keeping
      it
      secured
      properly.
      He
      clearly
      shouldn #8217;t
      have
      had
      or
      been
      allowed
      access
      to
      any
      kind
      of
      weapon
      with
      his
      mental
      state.
      His
      weapon
      also
      wasn #8217;t
      illegal
      even
      before
      the
      roll
      back
      of
      the
      ban.
      It
      was
      a
      semiautomatic,
      meaning
      it
      fired
      a
      single
      shot
      without
      having
      to
      reload
      after
      every
      round
      spent.
      The
      pistol
      he
      used
      was
      also
      a
      semiautomatic
      weapon.
      Neither
      of
      the
      weapons
      used
      were
      fully
      automatic
      weapons.
      And
      let #8217;s
      be
      clear,
      I
      am
      in
      no
      way
      defending
      what
      this
      guy
      did
      and
      don #8217;t
      condone
      physical
      violence
      at
      all
      regardless
      of
      the
      weapon
      used,
      I #8217;m
      just
      stating
      what
      actually
      happened.
      As
      a
      gun
      enthusiast
      it
      irritates
      me
      the
      most
      when
      someone
      states
      a
      misconception
      because
      it
       #8220;sounds
      right #8221;,
      especially
      when
      the
      topic
      of
      guns
      are
      involved.
      There
      are
      innumerable
      amounts
      gun
      and
      weaponry
      vocabulary
      that
      are
      used
      (incorrectly)
      interchangeably
      used
      as
      scare
      tactics
      because
      it
      gets
      good
      ratings.

      You
      know,
      my
      wife
      and
      I
      made
      a
      combined
      $66k
      (similar
      setup
      to
      you,
      I
      make
      ~$50k,
      wife
      makes
      the
      rest)
      last
      year.
      Both
      our
      paychecks
      went
      up.
      We
      also
      don #8217;t
      claim
      any
      exemptions
      on
      our
      tax
      forms.
      If
      your
      paycheck
      went
      down
      I
      am
      going
      to
      suggest
      refining
      your
      withholdings
      and
      exemptions
      and
      update
      your
      W-4/state
      tax
      forms.
      My
      wife
      and
      I
      take
      a
      look
      at
      it
      every
      few
      years
      just
      to
      make
      sure
      everything
      is
      still
      accurate.
      I
      would
      also
      suggest
      discussing
      this
      with
      your
      employer.

      Great
      attitude!
      You #8217;ll
      get
      better
      with
      time,
      and
      the
      important
      thing
      is
      you #8217;re
      having
      fun.
      So
      many
      people
      get
      too
      caught
      up
      in
      their
      ranks
      that
      the
      game
      is
      no
      longer
      fun,
      but
      frustrating
      and
      irritating.
      As
      long
      as
      you #8217;re
      enjoying
      the
      game
      that #8217;s
      all
      that
      really
      matters.
      Also,
      Diamond
      2
      is
      pretty
      good,
      I #8217;d
      say
      you #8217;re
      not
       #8220;bad #8221;
      at
      all!
      You #8217;re
      better
      than
      most.

      Man,

      Great

      say
      don't
      necessarily
      bulk
      up
      but
      work
      more
      on
      toning
      and
      definition
      next,

      Gun
      regulation
      and
      outright
      banning
      of
      all
      firearms
      are
      two
      entirely
      different
      things.
      I
      am
      pro-2nd
      Amendment
      and
      also
      pro-stronger
      background
      checks,
      mental
      health
      evaluations,
      and
      interconnection
      of
      both
      federal
      and
      state/local
      police
      forces
      regarding
      personal
      history
      before
      being
      allowed
      to
      own
      a
      firearm.
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      I #8217;ve
      met
      one
      person
      who
      was
      also
      pro-2A
      and
      didn #8217;t
      also
      want
      what
      I
      just
      listed
      there.
      The
      problem
      isn #8217;t
      gun
      regulation
      though
      (even
      though
      it
      needs
      to
      be
      improved),
      the
      problem
      is
      that
      if
      someone
      is
      sick
      enough
      to
      want
      to
      commit
      a
      crime
      such
      as
      a
      school
      shooting
      or
      gang
      shooting,
      they #8217;re
      not
      going
      to
      walk
      down
      to
      Dicks
      or
      Walmart
      and
      buy
      a
      gun
      to
      do
      it.
      They #8217;re
      going
      to
      buy
      it
      illegally.
      Even
      if
      you
      ban
      all
      firearms,
      you #8217;re
      just
      going
      to
      create
      an
      even
      more
      dangerous
      black
      market
      for
      weapons.
      I
      honestly
      feel
      it
      will
      be
      similar
      to
      prohibition
      in
      the
      20s
      with
      alcohol.
      That #8217;s
      why
      it
      irritates
      every
      NRA
      member
      and
      pro-2A
      person
      when
      they
      claim
      the
      NRA
      helps
      encourage
      these
      shootings.
      The
      NRA
      is
      also
      for
      stronger
      and
      more
      thorough
      background
      checks
      and
      removal
      of
      illegal
      firearms
      from
      the
      public.
      It #8217;s
      a
      reactionary
      measure
      and
      it #8217;s
      wrong,
      but
      it
      gets
      good
      ratings
      so
      hey,
      whatever,
      right?

      Okay,

      know
      you're
      not

      stupid
      troll
      trying
      to
      get
      under
      my
      skin.
      You
      should
      go
      back
      and
      see
      I
      didn't
      quote
      *you*
      in

      but
      **the

      you
      initially

      If

      have

      fine,

      debate
      you
      on
      what
      gun
      regulation
      actually
      means.
      But
      until
      you
      read
      what
      I
      wrote
      and
      write
      a
      formulated
      response
      instead
      of
      just
      vaguely
      dismissing
      one
      part

      I'm
      not
      going

      you
      further.
      PM
      me

      you
      change
      your
      mind
      and
      are

      should),
      you'd
      see
      that.
      Have
      a
      nice
      day!

      Okay,
      thanks
      for
      the
      clarification.
      I
      agree
      the
      NRA
      is
      largely
      against
      the
      banning
      of
      firearms
      and
      certain
      accessories
      or
      attachments
      that
      individual
      states
      have
      places
      restrictions
      on
      (for
      example,
      magazines
      in
      the
      state
      of
      NY),
      and
      fully
      against
      the
      restrictions
      of
      which
      firearms
      a
      citizen
      can
      purchase
      (which,
      in
      my
      opinion,
      there
      shouldn #8217;t
      be
      any).
      However,
      I
      still
      stand
      by
      the
      premise
      I
      made
      about
      background
      checks
      though,
      as
      I
      have
      yet
      to
      see
      any
      representative
      or
      member
      (myself,
      a
      member,
      included)
      of
      the
      NRA
      state
      that
      background
      checks
      or
      mental
      health
      checks
      or
      mandatory
      training
      should
      be
      reduced
      or
      abolished
      altogether.
      I
      really
      think
      that #8217;s
      the
      disconnect
      between
       #8220;the
      left #8221;
      and
       #8220;the
      right #8221;
      when
      it
      comes
      to
      gun
      or
      weapon
      regulation.
      Both
      sides
      appear
      to
      want
      stronger
      checks
      and
      balances
      in
      place
      to
      help
      prevent
      the
      wrong
      people
      from
      being
      able
      to
      obtain
      weapons.
      If
      both
      sides
      could
      put
      aside
      their
      differences
      in
      what
      to
      do
      beyond
      that,
      it
      would
      be
      amazing.
      That
      still
      doesn #8217;t
      stop
      the
      illegal
      black
      market
      for
      guns
      though,
      which
      is
      what
      a
      lot
      of
      gangs
      and
      terrorists
      use
      to
      buy
      weapons
      because
      they
      know
      they
      won #8217;t
      pass
      the
      background
      checks
      in
      a
      legal
      purchase.
      Idk
      how
      to
      fix
      that,
      though,
      nor
      does
      anyone
      else
      apparently
      because
      the
      common
      solution
      offered
      is
      an
      outright
      ban,
      which,
      in
      my
      opinion,
      won #8217;t
      work,
      whether
      you #8217;re
      pro-2A
      or
      not.
      Drugs
      and
      alcohol
      are
      two
      big
      examples
      of
      how
      this
      method
      can
      fail.
      I
      think
      better
      mental
      health
      resources
      and
      stronger
      family
      support
      along
      with
      a
      few
      other
      bits
      could
      go
      a
      long
      way
      to
      stopping
      school
      shooters,
      at
      least.

      I
      can
      definitively
      tell
      the
      difference
      between
      a
      Cuban
      RyJ
      and
      a
      Dominican
      RyJ.
      The
      Cubans
      are
      much
      stronger.

      I #8217;d
      say
      the
      reluctance
      is
      more
      so
      on
      the
      lenders
      than
      the
      buyers,
      at
      least
      in
      NY.
      I
      bought
      my
      house
      at
      25
      (almost
      27
      now).
      Few
      of
      my
      friends
      in
      the
      same
      age
      range
      were
      also
      able
      to
      buy
      a
      house.
      Demand
      appears
      to
      be
      there,
      but
      ability
      to
      afford
      or
      save
      up
      for
      things
      like
      closing
      costs
      and
      the
      down
      payment
      are
      preventing
      the
      actual
      purchase.
      Sure,
      there
      are
      programs
      that
      try
      to
      lend
      most
      of
      the
      down
      payment
      and
      closing
      costs,
      but
      by
      the
      time
      you
      take
      into
      account
      PMI
      and
      the
      additional
      amount
      lended,
      the
      mortgage
      payment
      becomes
      too
      high
      compared
      to
      rent
      (average
      rent
      in
      my
      area
      is
      around
      $1,000-$1,500/month).
      One
      program
      I
      looked
      into
      required
      3%
      down,
      and
      everything
      else
      was
      financed.
      Wife
      and
      I
      decided
      to
      just
      go
      traditional
      and
      put
      20%
      down
      to
      avoid
      PMI
      and
      didn #8217;t
      finance
      the
      closing
      costs,
      and
      our
      mortgage
      is
      still
      $1,100/month.
      The
      lack
      of
       #8220;starter
      homes #8221;
      is
      also
      a
      driving
      factor
      I
      think.
      We
      were
      able
      to
      find
      a
      2
      bed
      2
      bath
      townhouse
      for
      around
      $200k,
      but
      that
      was
      an
      outlier
      compared
      to
      what
      other
      places
      were
      available
      in
      the
      same
      area.
      Every
      few
      months
      I
      look
      at
      Zillow
      just
      to
      see
      what #8217;s
      available
      and
      has
      sold
      and
      compare
      it
      to
      our
      house
      and
      purchase
      price,
      and
      to
      date
      I
      have
      yet
      to
      find
      a
      home
      that
      has
      what
      we
      have
      within
      $20k
      of
      what
      we
      got
      our
      home
      for.
      Another
      factor
      I
      can
      think
      of
      is
      staying
      at
      home
      to
      save
      up
      money
      for
      owning
      a
      house,
      which
      I
      did
      with
      my
      wife
      (then
      fianc #233;e).
      We
      were
      together
      6
      years
      yet
      didn #8217;t
      live
      together
      and
      stayed
      with
      our
      parents,
      essentially
      saving
      up
      what
      would #8217;ve
      been
      spent
      on
      rent
      for
      the
      purchase
      of
      a
      house.
      Not
      too
      many
      people
      do
      that
      in
      my
      area
      and
      often
      get
      an
      apartment
      shortly
      after
      they
      graduate
      college,
      where
      we
      had
      3-4
      years
      of
      full
      time
      work
      to
      save
      up
      after.
      We
      do
      consider
      ourselves
      very
      lucky.

      For
      a
      watch
      of
      lesser
      quality,
      I #8217;d

      protection?
      He #8217;s
      fine.
      I
      golfed
      last
      year
      with
      my
      Explorer
      1
      a
      number
      of
      times
      and
      it
      never
      skipped
      a
      beat.
      These
      are
      tool
      watches
      and
      honestly
      they #8217;re
      more
      than

      taking

      a

      While
      I
      don #8217;t
      disagree
      that
      urban
      public
      schools
      (and
      a
      lot
      of
      suburban
      ones,
      too),
      are
      underfunded,
      dumping
      more
      money
      into
      them
      isn #8217;t
      a
      long-term
      fix.
      My
      wife
      teaches
      at
      an
      elementary
      school
      that
      is
      considered
      inner-city
      and
      honestly,
      the
      lack
      of
      home
      support
      is
      far
      worse
      of
      an
      issue
      than
      funding.
      The
      modern
      day
      parent
      just
      doesn #8217;t
      appear
      to
      have
      as
      much
      of
      an
      interest
      in
      their
      kid #8217;s
      learning
      career
      as
      they
      did
      in
      previous
      generations.
      Teachers
      unfortunately
      can #8217;t
      force
      the
      parent
      to
      be
      more
      involved,
      either.
      When
      my
      wife
      and
      I
      have
      kids,
      we #8217;re
      damn
      sure
      going
      to
      be
      involved;
      our
      kids
      won #8217;t
      be
      neglected
      like
      that.
      School
      taxes
      are
      already
      high
      for
      most
      urban
      school
      districts,
      and
      putting
      a
      greater
      financial
      stress
      on
      parents
      who
      most
      likely
      aren #8217;t
      financially
      stable
      to
      begin
      with
      wouldn #8217;t
      be
      the
      best
      thing
      to
      do.
      And
      a
      lot
      of
      that
      money
      already
      goes
      toward
      great
      programs
      that
      give
      students
      who
      need
      food
      and
      before
      and
      after
      school
      care.
      If
      you
      want
      a
      real
      fix
      for
      inner-city
      schools,
      fix
      the
      culture
      at
      home
      first.
      Then
      we
      can
      talk
      about
      funding
      issues.
      In
      my
      opinion,
      anything
      extra
      into
      what
      is
      already
      a
      system
      broken
      at
      a
      point
      where
      funding
      can #8217;t
      help
      is
      a
      waste
      of
      taxpayer
      money
      and
      should
      be
      avoided.

      consequently

      I
      agree
      with
      you
      that
      a
      voter
      ID
      system
      should
      be
      free
      and
      easily
      accessible
      to
      every
      citizen
      who
      wishes
      to
      register
      to
      vote,
      however,
      I
      disagree
      with
      your
      notion
      that
      it #8217;s
      unnecessary
      because
      voter
      fraud
      doesn #8217;t
      appear
      to
      be
      a
      problem.
      Preventative
      measures
      to
      protect
      the
      integrity
      of
      our
      democracy
      should
      absolutely
      be
      at
      least
      discussed
      and,
      if
      agreed
      upon,
      implemented.
      The
      last
      50
      or
      so
      years
      have
      seen
      advancements
      in
      technology
      that
      make
      hacking
      into
      elections
      a
      very
      scarily
      realistic
      thing,
      and
      while
      I
      can #8217;t
      look
      it
      up
      right
      now,
      I #8217;d
      bet
      there
      are
      a
      few
      countries
      that
      have
      suffered
      from
      it
      recently,
      internally
      and
      externally.
      A
      voter
      ID
      that
      has
      security
      features
      that
      prevent
      it
      from
      being
      faked,
      free
      or
      not,
      is
      just
      as
      important
      to
      discuss
      as
      is
      immigration
      reform
      and
      ensuring
      that
      firearm
      regulations
      are
      actually
      enforced.

      They
      already
      stated
      they #8217;d
      be
      in
      favor
      of
      voter
      ID
      if
      it
      was
      free
      and
      no
      burden
      on
      the
      taxpayer.
      The
      problem
      with
      that
      is
      nothing
      is
       #8220;free #8221;.
      Taxes
      pay
      for
      everything
       #8220;free #8221;
      that
      citizens
      can
      utilize.
      So
      even
      if
      it
      doesn #8217;t
      cost
      anything
      to
      obtain,
      it
      will
      still
      cost
      taxpayers
      on
      the
      back
      end
      just
      like
      everything
      else.
      The
      Federal
      government
      is
      just
      not
      going
      to
      print
      off
      millions
      of
      laminated
      ID
      cards
      and
      out
      the
      manpower
      in
      to
      verify/validate
      every
      eligible
      voter
      in
      the
      US
      without
      compensation.
      In
      short,
      it
      seems
      they
      support
      voter
      ID
      only
      in
      an
      unrealistic
      scenario,
      so
      it
      sounds
      good
      to
      people
      who
      aren #8217;t
      fiscally
      knowledgeable
      when
      it
      comes
      to
      government.
      Also,
       #8220;no
      proof #8221;
      over
      fraudulent
      voting
      doesn #8217;t
      mean
      it
      doesn #8217;t
      exist
      or
      hasn #8217;t
      happened.
      My
      mom
      works
      the
      elections
      and
      is
      in
      charge
      of
      verifying
      people #8217;s
      identity
      before
      allowing
      to
      vote.
      Not
      everyone
      asks
      for
      ID
      (my
      mom
      does).
      I #8217;ve
      had
      people
      just
      give
      me
      a
      ballot
      before
      I
      even
      sign
      anything
      as
      a
      affidavit.
      My
      mom
      has
      also
      said
      she #8217;s
      turned
      people
      away
      because
      they
      don #8217;t
      have
      ID
      and
      claim
      to
      be
      someone
      else,
      as
      well
      as
      people
      voting
      twice
      with
      absentee
      ballots.
      This
      is
      in
      NY.
      It
      does
      happen,
      you
      just
      never
      hear
      about
      it.

      The
      issue
      I
      (and
      the
      other
      user)
      have
      with
      your
      argument
      is
      that
      you're
      contradicting
      yourself.
      Social
      Security
      cards
      are
      also
      not
      free,
      they
      are
      paid
      through
      taxes.
      Even
      if
      you
      would
      be
      replacing
      the
      Social
      Security
      card
      with
      another,
      more
      secure
      form
      of
      national
      ID
      (which
      I
      agree
      needs
      to
      be
      done,
      being
      a
      victim
      of
      ID
      theft
      myself),
      you'd
      still
      be
      paying
      for
      the
      national
      ID
      through
      taxes.
      So
      if
      you
      use
      that
      to
      vote,
      you'd
      still
      be
      supporting
      a
      "pay
      to
      vote"
      system
      which
      you
      are
      so
      vehemently
      against.
      My
      argument
      is
      that
      nothing
      is
      "free".
      It's
      paid
      for
      one
      way
      or
      another,
      and
      in
      this
      case
      it
      would
      be
      through
      taxpayer
      money.
      So
      if
      you're
      going
      to
      be
      against
      a
      "pay
      to
      vote"
      system
      as
      you
      describe
      it,
      then
      be
      against
      it.
      Don't
      feign
      support
      for
      something
      you
      are
      so
      fervently
      against
      just
      because
      might
      sound
      good
      in
      an
      ideal
      world.
      You're
      claiming
      you're
      against
      something
      yet
      a
      few
      sentences
      later
      you're
      saying
      you
      would
      support
      it.
      That
      weakens
      your
      argument
      and
      people
      may
      take
      you
      less
      seriously
      because
      of
      it.

      A
      voter
      ID
      program
      isn't
      necessary
      in
      my
      opinion
      and
      can't
      be
      implemented
      at
      no
      cost,
      so
      I
      wouldn't
      support
      it.
      Either
      you're
      wasting
      taxpayer
      money
      or
      charging
      a
      fee
      for
      a
      voter
      ID
      card
      (I'm
      strongly
      against
      any
      pay-to-vote
      system).
       gt;
      I'm
      not
      constradicting
      myself;
      you're
      just
      not
      understanding
      my
      point.
      I
      want
      any
      program
      to
      be
      funded
      through
      taxes,
      not
      through
      fees.
      That's
      what
      I
      mean
      by
      pay
      to
      vote.
      That
      quote
      was
      just
      above
      from
      your
      earlier
      comment.
      There's
      where
      you
      are
      contradicting
      yourself.
      You
      also
      mentioned
      being
      against
      a
      voter
      ID
      system
      funded
      through
      taxes
      earlier
      as
      well.
      It's
      not
      a
      matter
      of
      my
      misunderstanding,
      but
      rather
      you
      flipping
      between
      support
      for
      something
      and
      being
      against
      it.
      And
      for
      the
      record,
      I
      agree
      with
      you
      that
      a
      voter
      ID
      shouldn't
      cost
      anything
      "extra"
      (read:
      through
      fees).
      A
      proper
      voter
      ID
      should
      be
      provided
      for
      each
      eligible
      citizen
      at
      no
      cost
      to

      Okay,
      so
      your
      priority
      is
      a
      generic
      national
      ID
      first,
      and
      use
      of
      it
      for
      voting
      second.
      That's
      fair.
      I
      believe
      that
      if
      such
      an
      ID
      is
      going
      to
      be
      created
      as
      a
      universal
      form
      of
      identification
      for
      things
      like
      citizenship
      or
      personal
      identification,
      a
      consequent
      use
      for
      the
      ID
      would
      be
      for
      voting,
      whether
      intended
      or
      not.
      I
      believe
      that's
      where
      the
      disconnect
      occurred
      between
      the
      two
      points
      we
      were
      advocating
      for.
      My
      aim
      is
      not
      to
      change
      your
      opinion,
      however,
      [take
      this
      report](http://www.g-a-i.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Voter-Fraud-Final-with-Appendix-1.pdf)
      and
      do
      with
      it
      what
      you
      wish.
      Whether
      you
      think
      fraudulent
      voting
      was
      influential
      in
      the
      outcome
      of
      the
      election
      or
      not
      (and
      I
      believe
      you
      would
      say,
      "no"),
      its
      an
      interesting
      read.
      When
      some
      states
      were
      decided
      by
      only
      a
      few
      thousand
      votes,
      duplicate
      votes
      or
      fraudulent
      votes
      can
      most
      certainly
      influence
      an
      outcome
      of
      an
      election.
      Honestly
      its
      a
      shame
      so
      many
      states
      refused
      to
      participate
      in
      this
      study.
      I'd
      like
      to
      see
      some
      hard
      numbers
      regarding
      voting
      and
      I'm
      sure
      the
      outcome
      of
      such
      a
      study
      would
      influence
      people
      both
      for
      and
      against
      voter
      ID,
      as
      well
      as
      the
      candidates.

      You
      raise
      some
      interesting
      points.
      No,
      an
      ID
      itself
      would
      not
      prevent
      duplicate
      voting.
      This
      would
      have
      to
      work
      in
      conjunction
      with
      staff
      employed
      at
      polling
      stations
      at
      minimum.
      Ideally,
      I #8217;d
      (personal
      opinion)
      like
      to
      see
      something
      akin
      to
      a
      microchip
      as
      found
      in
      debit/credit
      cards,
      conjoined
      with
      the
      input
      of
      a
      pin
      which
      needs
      to
      be
      validated
      via
      IP
      before
      casting
      a
      vote.
      Obviously
      there
      would
      have
      to
      be
      an
      overhaul
      of
      not
      only
      voting
      policy
      but
      also
      a
      creation
      of
      infrastructure
      to
      handle
      this.
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      it
      would
      necessarily
      be
      difficult,
      it #8217;s
      just
      tough
      to
      sell.
      If
      it
      works
      as
      I
      would
      like
      to
      see,
      the
      machine
      would
      validate
      the
      PIN
      and
      check
      if
      that
      ID
      had
      been
      used
      already
      for
      the
      ballot.
      Photo
      ID
      alone
      isn #8217;t
      a
      solution
      in
      my
      opinion.
      I #8217;ve
      voted
      a
      number
      of
      times
      and
      they
      haven #8217;t
      checked
      my
      ID
      (happened
      one
      time,
      called
      them
      out
      on
      it)
      or
      glanced
      at
      it
      so
      quickly
      there #8217;s
      no
      way
      they
      could
      tell
      if
      my
      ID
      was
      real
      or
      fake.
      There
      needs
      to
      be
      a
      secondary
      verification
      that
      doesn #8217;t
      rely
      on
      human
      input.
      Honestly,
      since
      voting
      requirements
      are
      federally
      mandated
      as
      opposed
      to
      being
      decided
      by
      the
      individual
      states
      (with
      a
      few
      exceptions,
      namely
      regarding
      criminal
      history),
      this
      should
      solely
      be
      handled
      by
      the
      federal
      government
      and
      left
      at
      that.
      It #8217;s
      a
      bit
      ridiculous
      that
      there
      are
      different
       #8220;requirements #8221;
      across
      the
      country
      that
      are
      used
      to
      determine
      voter
      eligibility,
      and
      that
      leads
      to
      the
      problem
      as
      well.

      Man,
      that
      watch
      is
      gorgeous
      and
      has
      some
      serious
      vintage
      vibes
      going
      on.
      Not
      usually
      a
      fan
      of
      Orient
      (can't
      get
      past
      the
      logo)
      but
      that
      one
      looks
      amazing.
      If
      you
      don't
      mind,
      do
      you
      know
      what
      movement/power
      reserve
      it
      has?

      40
      is

      the

      Nice
      addition!
      Were
      you
      wearing
      your
      Tissot
      as
      an
      everyday
      watch
      prior
      to
      this?
      If
      so,
      Your
      Tissot
      is/was
      *your*
      everyday
      piece
      and
      you
      shouldn #8217;t
      let
      anyone
      tell
      you
      otherwise!
      Watch
      etiquette
      has
      sort
      of
      been
      thrown
      aside
      recently
      as
      more
      people
      wear
      different
      combinations
      of
      watches/attire.
      A
      couple
      decades
      ago,
      it
      was
      heresy
      to
      wear
      any
      kind
      of
      watch
      with
      a
      tux/formal
      attire
      with
      a
      few
      exceptions.
      Now,
      people
      show
      off
      their
      gold
      submariners
      and
      other
      sports
      watches
      with
      their
      formal
      attire.
      I
      myself
      have
      a
      Tissot
      PR100
      that,
      off
      of
      the
      bracelet
      it
      came
      with,
      could
      be
      considered
      a
      dress
      watch,
      yet
      I
      wear
      it
      all
      the
      time
      regardless
      of
      what
      I #8217;m
      wearing.
      Hell,
      I
      wore
      my
      Rolex
      for
      my
      wedding
      and
      I
      was
      in
      a
      three
      piece
      tux!

      Interestly,
      I
      just
      noticed
      the
      same
      with
      my
      Tissot.
      Different
      model
      though
      (3
      year
      old
      PR
      100).
      I
      can #8217;t
      normally
      hear
      it
      but
      I
      had
      the
      watch
      around
      a
      foot
      from
      my
      ear
      today
      in
      a
      completely
      quiet
      room
      and
      heard
      a
      chiming
      type
      noise.
      If
      I
      put
      it
      right
      next
      to
      my
      ear,
      I
      don #8217;t
      hear
      a
      chime,
      but
      as
      you
      say
      a
       #8220;clean #8221;
      ticking
      sound.
      Doesn #8217;t
      bother
      me
      though,
      as
      in
      3
      years
      it #8217;s
      honestly
      the
      first
      time
      I #8217;ve
      noticed
      it.

      You #8217;ll
      get
      there!
      Congrats
      on
      the
      200
      though.
      I
      remember
      my
      first,
      my
      legs
      were
      shaking
      in
      the
      tenth
      and
      I
      almost
      missed
      the
      10
      pin
      that
      would #8217;ve
      sealed
      it
      haha

      Haha,
      been
      there.
      Hopefully
      now
      that
      you #8217;ve
      broken
      the
      200
      mark
      there
      will
      be
      plenty
      more
      to
      come

      Don't
      feel
      too
      bad.
      My
      299
      was
      my
      first
      game,
      followed
      by
      a
      190
      and
      170
      game.
      Honestly
      think
      I
      was
      so
      mentally
      charged
      from
      the
      299
      (previous
      high
      game
      was
      280),
      it
      screwed
      with
      me
      for
      the
      rest
      of
      the
      series.

      I #8217;ve
      always
      preferred
      to
      hand
      wind
      a
      watch
      that
      has
      stopped
      instead
      of
      letting
      the
      rotor
      wind
      it
      on
      my
      wrist
      and/or
      shaking
      it
      a
      few
      times.
      For
      me,
      I #8217;d
      wind
      it
      almost
      full
      and
      then
      hack
      and
      set
      it
      because
      I
      can
      get
      a
       #8220;better #8221;
      accuracy
      when
      comparing
      it
      to
      an
      atomic
      clock.
      I
      also
      remember
      reading
      somewhere
      that
      you
      should
      never
      let
      the
      rotor
      wind
      your
      watch
      from
      a
      stop
      and
      always
      hand
      wind
      it
      to
      prevent
      damage
      to
      the
      movement,
      which
      may
      have
      been
      true
      years
      ago
      but
      with
      modern
      movements
      and
      the
      way
      things
      like
      lubricants
      used
      have
      been
      improved,
      I
      wouldn #8217;t
      be
      surprised
      if
      that
      is
      no
      longer
      the
      case.
      Lastly,
      a
      fully
      wound
      watch
      is
      far
      more
      accurate
      than
      a
      watch
      that
      almost
      is
      out
      of
      a
      wind.
      Three
      minutes
      fast?
      I
      doubt
      it,
      especially
      in
      a
      Rolex,
      but
      you
      never
      know.
      Edit:
      I
      also
      never
      noticed
      that
      much
      of
      a
      deviation
      with
      my
      Explorer.
      It
      was
      always
      a
      consistent
      +4
      per
      day
      even
      when
      running
      out
      of
      its
      power
      reserve.

      That #8217;s
      a
      good
      comparison,
      but
      Tudor
      would
      be
      a
      better
      example.
      Tudor
      is
      owned
      by
      Rolex,
      and
      has
      watches
      that
      function
      the
      same
      for
      a
      fraction
      of
      the
      cost.
      For
      example,
      at
      Basel
      a
      few
      weeks
      ago,
      Tudor
      announced
      a
      GMT
      watch
      as
      did
      Rolex.
      The
      Tudor
      is
      less
      than
      half
      the
      price
      of
      the
      Rolex,
      yet
      they
      were
      extremely
      similar
      (case
      material,
      functions
      of
      the
      movement,
      color
      scheme,
      etc.).
      Even
      more
      interesting
      is
      that
      vintage
      Tudor
      watches
      actually
      used
      Rolex
      parts,
      such
      as
      the
      case,
      crown,
      and
      bracelet.
      If
      you
      do
      some
      research,
      you #8217;ll
      find
      watches
      with
      Tudor
      on
      the
      dial,
      yet
      the
      crown
      and
      bracelet
      have
      the
      Rolex
      logos
      on
      them.
      These
      watches
      new
      still
      cost
      less
      than
      a
      new
      Rolex
      at
      the
      time,
      and
      essentially
      they
      were
      the
      exact
      same
      watch.
      The
      only
      difference
      is
      usually
      in
      the
      movement
      and
      dial.
      Modern
      Tudor #8217;s
      have
      obviously
      deviated
      from
      this,
      however.

      Yeah,
      OP
      is
      technically
      right
      about
      the
      price
      of
      the
      pack
      where
      it
      originates,
      however
      how
      he
      uses
      that
      data
      is
      misleading.
      Honestly,
      most
      NY
      smokers
      who
      buy
      smuggled
      cigarettes
      don #8217;t
      know
      they #8217;re
      smuggled.
      The
      gas
      station
      or
      convenience
      store
      that
      sold
      them
      sell
      them
      at
      around
      the
      same
      rate
      as
      regular
      taxed
      cigarettes
      and
      pocket
      the
      difference
      (which
      it
      is
      illegal
      to
      do
      so
      as
      it #8217;s
      tax
      evasion).
      Honestly
      though,
      you
      can
      pretty
      much
      buy
      anything
      online
      tobacco
      related
      including
      cigarettes,
      and
      why
      most
      smokers
      don #8217;t
      just
      do
      that
      regardless
      of
      where
      they
      live
      is
      beyond
      me.
      If
      you
      buy
      online
      in
      bulk,
      you
      typically
      get
      a
      much
      cheaper
      (usually
      market
      value
      from
      where
      you #8217;re
      buying
      from)
      rate
      per
      pack
      and
      *then*
      you #8217;d
      be
      saving
      money.

      Not
      private,
      I #8217;ll
      agree,
      but
      it
      is
      certainly
      identifying.
      It
      may
      not
      be
      identifying
      personal
      information,
      such

      name,
      age,
      location,
      etc.,
      but
      it
      does
      identify
      the
      individual,
      as
      there
      is
      only

      I #8217;m
      not
      embarrassed
      by
      anything
      I
      post
      online.
      My
      opinion
      is,
      that
      if
      you #8217;re
      embarrassed
      by
      something
      you
      post
      or
      nervous
      that
      it
      may
      impact
      you
      negatively,
      you
      shouldn #8217;t
      be
      posting
      it
      in
      the
      first
      place.
      In
      fact,
      if
      you
      look
      at
      my
      comment
      history
      (I #8217;m
      assuming
      you
      already
      have),
      I #8217;m
      sure
      you #8217;ll
      find
      something
      to
      criticize
      me
      for,
      as
      I
      would
      you.
      I
      also
      never
      once
      said
      I
      was
      fearful
      of
      it.
      My
      issue
      is
      with
      the
      fact
      that
      a
      defamatory
      remark
      was
      tagged
      with
      a
      user
      after
      a
      comment
      was
      deleted
      in
      a
      reply
      to
      a
      that
      comment.
      To
      those
      who
      came
      to
      the
      thread
      after
      the
      comment
      was
      deleted,
      there
      is
      nothing
      suggesting
      that
      the
      tagged
      user
      was
      in
      fact
      the
      user
      that
      posted
      the
      initial
      comment.
      I #8217;m
      not
      suggesting
      the
      information
      in
      the
      post
      is
      incorrect,
      either.
      To
      me
      it #8217;s
      just
      something
      low
      or
      sleazy
      to
      do.

      It
      wouldn #8217;t
      be
      doxing
      if
      what
      you
      posted
      wasn #8217;t
      intended
      with
      malicious

      the
      key
      part
      to
      the
      definition
      of
      doxing
      that
      establishes
      what
      it
      is.
      You
      can
      tag
      me
      all
      you
      want,
      but
      if
      you
      start
      going
      around
      saying
       #8220;supermclovin
      is
      an
      awful
      person #8221;
      or
      something
      like
      that,
      that
      would
      be
      doxing
      me.
      But
      if
      you
      don #8217;t
      want
      to
      debate
      anymore,
      don #8217;t
      say
       #8220;I #8217;m
      wrong #8221;
      and
      then
      walk
      away.
      That #8217;s
      incorrect
      unless
      we
      came
      to
      an
      agreement
      I
      was
      wrong,
      which
      we
      didn #8217;t.
      Saying
      you
      don #8217;t
      want
      to
      argue
      anymore,
      and
      then
      writing
      a
      sentence
      adding
      another
      argument,
      in
      my
      opinion
      makes
      you
      somewhat
      hypocritical.
      Just
      say
       #8220;I #8217;m
      not
      going
      to
      argue
      this
      anymore #8221;,
      and
      leave
      it
      at
      that.

      I
      consider
      what
      I
      said
      is
      inclusive
      with
      the

      of
      the
      definition
       #8220;with

      So
      that #8217;s
      actually
      exactly
      what

      The

      was
      discussed
      negatively
      with
      no

      they
      were
      the
      one
      to
      write
      the
      comment.
      That
      would
      be
      what
      I
      define
      as,
       #8220;malicious #8221;.
      So
      yes,
      it #8217;s

      I
      have
      one
      as
      well
      and
      it #8217;s
      rather
      heavy
      and
      kinda
      tall.
      That #8217;s
      why
      I
      wouldn #8217;t
      say
      it #8217;s
      my
      most
      comfortable
      watch
      I #8217;ve
      worn.
      It #8217;s
      still
      insanely
      comfortable
      and
      easy
      to
      wear,
      and
      does
      sit
      fairly
      well
      on
      the
      wrist.
      I
      also
      had
      a
      tough
      time
      finding
      a
      size
      for
      the
      bracelet
      that
      fit
      comfortably.
      It
      wasn #8217;t
      major,
      but
      I
      was
      in
      between
      micro
      adjustments
      I
      think.
      When
      CW
      unveiled
      their
      quick
      adjust
      clasp,
      I
      ordered
      a
      new
      bracelet
      (had
      to
      order
      the
      whole
      thing,
      couldn #8217;t
      just
      get
      the
      clasp),
      and
      that
      made
      the
      watch
      fit
      so
      much
      better.
      I
      had
      an
      Explorer
      1
      for
      a
      while
      and
      *that*
      was
      the
      most
      comfortable
      watch
      I #8217;ve
      ever
      worn,
      by
      far.

      Tbh
      (statistically
      speaking)
      last
      year #8217;s
      Eli
      was
      pretty
      good
      still,
      he
      put
      up
      some
      pretty
      amazing
      stats
      considering
      we
      had
      what
      felt
      like
      a
      3rd
      grader
      as
      a
      coach
      and
      a
      GM
      who #8217;d
      neglected
      multiple
      offensive
      and
      defensive
      positions
      for
      years.
      I
      honestly
      don #8217;t
      think
      Eli
      ever
      dropped
      off
      on
      skill
      or
      ability.
      I
      truly
      think
      it #8217;s
      a
      product
      of
      coaching/play
      calling/personnel
      management
      and
      hopefully
      this
      year
      that
      all
      changes
      back
      to
      run
      first
      to
      give
      Eli
      more
      time
      to
      let
      his
      WRs
      get
      open
      (which,
      with
      this
      pick,
      theoretically
      should).

      Pretty
      sure
      in
      context,
      Eli
      said
      he
      didn #8217;t
      want
      to
      be
      a
      *number
      2*
      QB
      and
      mentor,
      with
      (insert
      other
      QB
      here)
      starting.
      Eli
      has
      spent
      a
      ton
      of
      time
      teaching
      Webb
      what
      he #8217;s
      learned
      over
      the
      last
      13
      years
      he #8217;s
      been
      in
      the
      league.
      There
      have
      been
      numerous
      reports
      of
      that
      happening.
      Eli
      has
      no
      problem
      being
      a
      mentor,
      but
      he #8217;s
      a
      competitor
      and
      will
      always
      want
      to
      be
      the
      number
      one
      guy
      until
      he
      physically
      can #8217;t
      anymore.

      Most

      consider
      at
      least
      10atm
      required
      to
      go
      swimming.
      For
      example,
      in
      Seiko #8217;s
      manual,
      they
      have
      a
      chart
      and
      5atm
      according
      to
      them
      is
      good
      for
      splashing/hand
      washing,
      but
      not
      submersion.

      I #8217;ve
      had
      a
      lot
      of

      I #8217;ve
      seen
      is
      at
      the

      No

      I
      don #8217;t
      disagree,
      I
      was
      just
      explaining
      how
      watch
      manufacturers
      state
      what
      you
      can
      and
      can #8217;t
      do
      to
      the
      watch.
      If
      I
      had
      to
      guess,
      it #8217;s
      probably
      okay
      to
      submerge
      a
      5atm
      watch
      and
      go
      swimming,
      however
      in
      the
      off
      chance
      the
      watch
      may
      leak
      they
      understate
      the
      pressure
      capabilities
      in
      order
      to
      avoid
      warranty
      claims.
      Just
      my
      guess.

      I
      didn #8217;t
      buy
      the
      deluxe
      set,
      however
      I
      did
      buy
      the
      game.
      I
      think
      what
      led
      to
      me
      dropping
      it
      and
      not

      was
      the
      lack
      of
      online
      co-op
      when
      it
      was
      released.
      That
      really
      killed
      it
      imo
      (I
      drum
      and
      my

      guitar/bass)

      Oh
      God.
      I
      did
      the
      same
      thing.
      It
      lasted
      two
      months
      I
      think,
      maybe
      less,
      then
      it
      just
      shit
      the
      bed.
      Thank
      God
      I
      got
      the
      extended
      warranty
      to
      it.
      Was
      able
      to
      return
      it
      to
      Best
      Buy
      and
      get
      store
      credit
      (they
      were
      getting
      so
      many
      return/exchange
      requests
      at
      the

      they
      didn #8217;t
      even
      argue
      to
      a
      replacement
      vs.

      Bought
      an
      iPod
      Video
      that
      day
      and
      never

      Oh
      man,
      the
      hangovers
      part
      is
      so
      true.
      I #8217;ve
      had
      hangovers
      last
      longer
      than
      24
      hours
      before
      while
      in
      ketosis.
      So
      brutal.
      Honestly
      the
      hangovers
      caused
      me
      to
      drink
      less,
      though,
      due
      to
      not
      wanting
      to
      get
      a
      hangover.
      I
      went
      from
      drinking
      (getting
      drunk)
      2-3
      times
      per
      week
      to
      now
      maybe
      once
      a
      week
      or
      once
      every
      other
      week.
      I #8217;ll
      have
      a
      Corona
      Premier
      or
      Miller
      Lite
      on
      a
      hot
      day
      or
      something
      to
      enjoy
      it,
      however
      that #8217;s
      about
      it.
      I
      guess
      that #8217;s
      better
      since
      alcohol
      doesn #8217;t
      really
      provide
      any
      benefits,
      and
      I #8217;m
      sure
      my
      liver
      is
      thanking
      me
      too

      A
       #8220;living
      wage #8221;
      is
      something
      that
      sounds
      good
      on
      paper,
      but
      when
      you
      realize
      that
      the
      cost
      of
      living
      varies
      as
      much
      as
      it
      does
      in
      the
      US,
      it #8217;s
      virtually
      impossible.
      $7/hour
      could
      be
      considered
      a
       #8220;living
      wage #8221;
      in
      the
      Midwest,
      whereas
      $20/hour
      might
      be
      considered
      a
       #8220;living
      wage #8221;
      in
      NYC
      or
      LA.
      It #8217;s
      just
      not
      possible
      in
      a
      county
      the
      size
      of
      the
      US
      combined
      with
      the
      economic
      diversity
      in
      each
      region
      of
      the
      country.
      That #8217;s
      why
      in
      the
      US
      there
      is
      a
      minimum
      wage,
      varying
      from
      state
      to
      state,
      instead
      of
      a
      federally
      mandated
      living
      wage.
      The
      minimum
      wage
      is
      also
      not
      intended
      to
      be
      a
      career
      option
      for
      employees
      as
      well.
      It
      is
      intended
      to
      be
      applied
      to
      entry
      level
      positions
      so
      that
      the
      employee
      can
      develop
      skills
      necessary
      to
      get
      promoted
      and/or
      move
      to
      a
      different
      company.
      When
      an
      employee
      is
      incapable
      of
      doing
      either
      of
      those
      things,
      welfare
      kicks
      in
      to
      make
      up
      the
      difference.
      It
      isn #8217;t
      being
      hateful
      to
      oppose
      an
      across-the-board
      minimum
      wage
      increase,
      either.
      It #8217;s
      a
      simple
      matter
      of
      economics
      and
      the
      fear
      of
      that
      kind
      of
      wage
      increase
      leading
      to
      a
      stagnation
      in
      skill
      and
      personal
      development.
      Working
      up
      the
      ranks
      through
      a
      company
      theoretically
      wouldn #8217;t
      be
      a
      desire
      anymore
      if
      you
      are
      giving
      essentially
      double
      the
      pay
      for
      no
      additional
      work.
      In
      addition
      it #8217;s
      also
      about
      keeping
      employment
      up
      because
      as
      many
      users
      have
      mentioned
      in
      this
      thread
      there
      is
      a
      significant
      decrease
      in
      staffing
      and
      replacement
      of
      existing
      staffing
      with
      automated
      machines.

      minimum

      There
      technically
      already
      is.

      will
      never
      (and
      should

      adjusted
      with
      cost

      living.
      That
      should
      always

      like
      housing,
      food
      pricing,
      and
      utility
      costs.
      There
      are
      also
      a
      number
      of
      reasons
      (also
      mentioned
      in
      this
      thread)
      that
      would
      make
      this
      kind
      of
      increase
      of
      minimum
      wage
      extremely
      lethal
      to
      small
      businesses
      and
      franchise
      owners.
      Profit
      margins
      are
      already
      small
      for
      them
      and
      a
       #8220;living
      wage #8221;
      would
      force
      layoffs
      and/or
      closures.
      How
      do
      you
      propose
      that #8217;s
      fixed?
      Increase
      welfare
      to
      cover
      the
      living
      wage?
      Okay,
      that #8217;s
      great,
      until
      you
      realize
      the
      tax
      burden
      it
      would
      put
      on
      citizens.
      Also,
      a
      welfare
      system
      that
      compensates
      for
      a
      living
      wage
      would
      force
      an
      even
      greater
      portion
      of
      the
      population
      abusing
      welfare
      to
      never
      search
      for
      a
      job
      and
      get
      their
      monthly
      check
      from
      the
      government.
      Welfare
      was
      never
      designed
      as
      a
      substitute
      however
      a
      stop
      gap
      until
      consistent
      work
      is
      found
      again,
      because
      those
      on
      welfare
      do
      not
      pay
      or
      pay
      minimal
      taxes
      (I.e.,
      not
      the
      full
      rate
      as
      a
      full
      time
      employee).
      Look,
      I
      get
      it,
      a
      living
      wage
      sounds
      good
      and
      all,
      but
      it #8217;s
      impossible,
      at
      least
      in
      the
      US.
      We #8217;re
      already
      falling
      in
      education
      and
      specialized
      professions,
      and
      this
      kind
      of
      policy
      wouldn #8217;t
      help
      develop
      that.
      Unfortunately,
      people
      will
      always
      struggle,
      but
      that #8217;s
      just
      how
      life
      is,
      and
      realizing
      it
      isn #8217;t
      economically
      possible
      to
      subsidize
      the
      day
      to
      day
      living
      costs
      of
      millions
      of
      Americans
      is
      just
      something
      that
      most
      people
      end
      up
      refusing.

      Pilots
      essentially
      have
      been
      replaced
      by
      computers
      at
      this
      point.
      They
      exist
      now
      more
      as
      a
      backup
      to
      the
      autopilot
      and
      sensory
      systems
      of
      modern
      aircraft.
      Planes
      now
      have
      the
      capability
      of
      taking
      off,
      landing,
      and
      flying
      themselves
      to
      a
      destination
      if
      programmed
      in
      correctly.
      That
      being
      said,
      I
      think
      lumping
      pilots
      in
      with
      bank
      tellers
      and
      waiters
      is
      ludicrous.
      Pilots
      are
      in
      charge
      of
      being
      a
      safeguard
      for
      a
      lot
      of
      human
      lives
      per
      flight.
      If
      a
      waiter
      screws
      up
      my
      order,
      hundreds
      of
      people
      aren #8217;t
      going
      to
      die.

      I've
      learned
      to
      just
      basically
      say
      "low
      carb",
      because
      for
      some
      reason
      "I
      eat
      as
      few
      carbs
      as
      possible
      on
      any
      given
      day"
      confused
      people
      when
      I
      first
      decided
      to
      stop
      trying
      to
      explain
      keto
      due
      to
      your
      exact
      experience.
      If
      they
      ask
      for
      more,
      then
      I'll
      go
      into
      things
      like
      IF
      and
      macros
      and
      how
      I
      eat
      daily.

      I #8217;m
      impressed
      you
      answered
      a
      call
      at
      6am
      after
      getting
      drunk
      the
      night
      before!
      When
      I
      used
      to
      work
      a
      shift-based
      job,
      I
      learned
      to
      just
      not
      answer
      the
      phone
      unless
      I
      was
      ready
      to
      pick
      up
      an
      extra
      shift.
      That
      morning
      would #8217;ve
      been
      one
      of
      the
      times
      my
      phone
      went
      to
      vm.
      That #8217;s
      also
      when
      I
      learned
      to
      just
      say
       #8220;I
      can #8217;t #8221;,
      and
      not
      give
      them
      a
      reason
      why
      (because
      if
      you
      give
      them
      a
      reason,
      chances
      are
      they #8217;ll
      find
      a
      way
      to
      work
      through
      your
      reasoning
      and
      push
      even
      harder
      for
      you
      to
      come
      in).

      I
      don #8217;t
      know
      why
      they
      stuck
      with
      the
      6
      body
      for
      so
      long,
      it #8217;s
      bland
      and
      annoying
      to
      hold
      So
      much
      this.
      I
      tried
      the
      other
      day
      taking
      the
      case
      off
      my
      8+
      and
      the
      thing
      is
      so
      freaking
      slippery,
      I
      nearly
      dropped
      it
      right
      away.
      Never
      had
      that
      problem
      with
      my
      5S
      (which
      I
      still
      have,
      but
      I #8217;ve
      been
      spoiled
      by
      the
      larger
      screen
      and
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      I
      could
      go
      back,
      ruling
      out
      getting
      an
      SE).
      If
      they
      made
      the
      iPhone
      11
      (or
      whatever
      it #8217;s
      called)
      have
      the
      case
      design
      of
      the
      4-5S,
      screen
      size
      of
      the
      +/X,
      and
      a
      flat
      back
      (I.e.,
      no
      camera
      bump),
      that
      would
      be
      the
      perfect
      phone
      imo.
      I
      miss
      the
      days
      of
      being
      able
      to
      comfortably
      use
      my
      phone
      without
      a
      case,
      and
      I
      am
      pretty
      sure
      I #8217;m
      not
      alone.
      The
      8+
      is
      such
      a
      beautiful
      phone
      it #8217;s
      a
      shame
      that
      it
      has
      to
      be
      covered
      all
      the
      time
      just
      for
      me
      to
      be
      able
      to
      use
      it.

      Could

      I
      don #8217;t
      know
      that
      statistic
      (or
      where
      to
      even
      research
      it),
      and
      frankly
      I
      wasn #8217;t
      advocating
      for
      that
      position.
      Recently
      though
      (like
      maybe
      a
      few
      months
      ago),
      a
      teenager
      shot
      and
      killed
      three
      home
      invaders.
      Although,
      I
      believe
      he
      was
      old
      enough
      to
      own
      his
      own
      weapon
      and
      I #8217;m
      pretty
      sure
      it
      was
      his,
      but
      it
      does
      happen.
      Maybe
      the
      father,
      in
      response
      to
      that,
      told
      his
      kid
      how
      to
      get
      the
      gun
      if
      he
      ever
      had
      to
      defend
      himself
      at
      home?
      I
      don #8217;t
      agree
      with
      it
      but
      I
      can
      see
      it
      happening.
      As
      a
      gun
      owner
      myself
      I
      plan
      on
      teaching
      my
      kids
      (when
      I
      have
      them,
      that
      is)
      basic
      gun
      safety
      (trigger
      discipline,
      not
      to
      point
      at
      anything
      they
      don #8217;t
      intend
      to
      shoot,
      how
      to
      check
      the
      safety,
      etc.)
      and
      to
      not
      be
      afraid
      of
      handling
      a
      gun
      when
      they #8217;re
      old
      enough,
      which
      will
      probably
      be
      when
      they
      are
      around
      this
      kids
      age.
      I
      most
      certainly
      won #8217;t
      let
      them
      have
      access
      to
      any
      weapons
      stored
      in
      the
      house,
      however,
      and
      any
      parent
      or
      guardian
      that
      does,
      in
      my
      eyes,
      is
      as
      guilty
      as
      the
      shooter
      for
      enabling
      that
      to
      happen.

      Poor
      choice
      of
      wording
      on
      OPs
      part

      using

      use

      if
      you

      it

      Be
      careful
      with
      that
       #8220;9-5 #8221;.
      I
      worked
      for
      a
      large
      cable
      company
      as
      a
      sales
      agent
      and
      was
      sold
      on
       #8220;9-5 #8221;
      as
      well
      as
      a
      high
      rate
      of
      pay,
      and
      as
      it
      turns
      out
      the
      9-5
      was
      only
      for
      my
      3
      months
      of
      training
      before
      it
      was
      transitioned
      into
      shifts
      based
      on
      performance
      metrics.
      Thankfully
      I
      did
      pretty
      well
      and
      the
      latest
      I
      ever
      worked
      was
      6:30,
      but
      I
      could #8217;ve
      had
      a
      shift
      until
      11pm
      if
      I
      didn #8217;t
      perform
      well.
      That
      being
      said,
      inbound
      sales
      wasn #8217;t
      so
      bad.
      I
      made
      a
      lot
      of
      money
      but
      man,
      it
      was
      exhausting.
      You
      wouldn #8217;t
      think
      that
      it
      would
      be
      so
      demanding
      however
      I
      have
      never
      been
      so
      exhausted
      after
      a
      day
      of
      work
      before
      or
      since
      that
      job,
      and
      I
      have
      done
      manual
      labor,
      retail,
      and
      restaurant
      positions
      prior
      to
      that.
      To
      date,
      that
      call
      center
      job
      is
      the
      only
      job
      where
      I
      had
      to
      call
      in
      sick
      for
      a
      mental
      health
      day
      once
      a
      month
      (thankfully,
      the
      company
      I
      worked
      for
      was
      pretty
      good
      with
      that
      stuff).
      Also
      look
      for
      opportunities
      for
      advancement.
      If
      you
      end
      up
      hating
      the
      job,
      see
      where
      else
      you
      can
      transition
      to
      and
      how
      quickly
      you
      can
      do
      it.
      For
      example,
      in
      my
      case,
      after
      1
      year
      I
      was
      able
      to
      apply
      to
      become
      a
      training
      assistant
      which
      took
      me
      off
      the
      phones,
      and
      gave
      me
      a
      more
      stable
      set
      of
      hours
      that
      didn #8217;t
      depend
      on
      performance.
      The
      rate
      of
      pay
      was
      lower,
      but
      I
      was
      happier
      and
      it
      was
      the
      right
      move.
      Good
      luck
      OP!

      Giants/Knicks/Rangers/.......Royals!
      Somehow
      ended
      up
      a
      KC
      Royals
      fan
      for
      baseball
      along
      the
      way,
      but
      as
      long
      as
      the
      Yankees
      aren't
      playing
      the

      I
      don't
      mind
      if
      they
      win.

      Upstate
      NY,
      missed
      the
      first
      quarter
      but
      the
      rest
      of
      the
      game
      was
      buffer-free
      and
      great
      quality.
      Maybe
      dipped
      a
      bit
      in
      frame
      rate
      here
      or
      there,
      but
      that
      happened
      on
      cable
      too
      when
      I
      had
      it
      with
      a
      lot
      of
      nationally
      televised
      sporting
      events.
      I
      always
      assumed
      it
      has
      something
      to
      do
      with
      demand/viewership
      being
      a
      lot
      higher
      than
      normal
      and
      the
      cable
      servers
      not
      being
      able
      to
      handle
      the
      load
      properly.

      I #8217;m
      still
      considering
      myself
      incredibly
      lucky
      to
      watch
      Ace
      pitch.
      It
      was
      in
      Boston,
      two
      seasons
      ago,
      our
      seats
      were
      just
      behind
      third
      base.
      Salvy
      hit
      a
      homer
      over
      the
      Monster.
      Ace
      got
      the
      win.
      It
      was
      a
      good
      day.
      I
      wish
      I
      could
      see
      him
      pitch
      again,
      and
      had
      he
      been
      alive
      last
      season
      I
      feel
      we
      would #8217;ve
      had
      a
      shot
      too.
      Rest
      In
      Peace,
      Ace.
      I
      know
      when
      I
      reach
      Heaven
      I #8217;ll
      be
      able
      to
      watch
      you
      fire
      those
      strikes
      off
      with
      that
      chip-on-shoulder
      attitude
      I
      loved
      to
      watch
      so
      much.

      Thanks!
      I
      had
      that
      option
      deselected,
      however
      the

      appeared
      for
      me.
      As
      it
      turns
      out,
      I
      had
      two
      apps
      set
      to
      "always"
      use
      my
      location.
      Changing
      those
      to
      "while
      using"
      solved
      the
      problem
      and
      the
      icon
      disappeared.

      My
      wife
      found
      a
      Weber
      KC
      BBQ
      rub
      that's
      absolutely
      delicious!
      2g
      net
      carbs
      per
      serving,
      which
      is
      roughly
      2
      tbsp
      per
      lb
      of
      meat
      (according
      to
      Weber).
      We've
      been
      using
      it
      on
      steaks,
      burgers,
      and
      chicken
      and
      it
      is
      awesome.
      If
      I
      don't
      have
      access
      to
      that,
      usually
      I
      go
      for
      steak
      sauce.
      I
      think
      Keto
      has
      made
      my
      taste
      buds
      more
      sensitive
      to
      sweets
      because
      A1
      now
      tastes
      like
      BBQ
      sauce
      did
      before
      Keto.

      I
      mean,
      impeachment
      is
      one
      thing
      (and
      what
      Clinton
      did
      actually
      did
      deserve
      impeachment),
      however
      don #8217;t
      forget
      the
      Republican
      controlled
      Senate
      (55-45)
      elected
      not
      to
      remove
      him
      from
      office.

      I
      live
      in
      NY
      and
      wish
      we
      had
      these.
      Massachusetts
      has
      embedded
      reflectors
      in
      the
      road
      so
      that
      a
      plow
      can #8217;t
      rip
      them
      out
      of
      the
      pavement.
      Don #8217;t
      know
      why
      there
      isn #8217;t
      a
      bigger
      push
      for
      these
      in
      roads.
      Otherwise,
      god
      help
      you
      if
      it
      rains
      or
      snows
      and
      you #8217;re
      not
      familiar
      with
      the
      roads
      and
      know
      where
      to
      go.
      It #8217;s
      honestly
      really
      bad.

      Update:
      so
      far
      so
      good,
      haven't
      had
      this
      issue
      pop
      up
      yet,
      but
      my
      issue
      didn't
      happen
      100%
      of
      the
      time,
      so
      I
      can't
      say
      for
      sure
      its
      been
      fully
      fixed.
      I'm
      hoping
      over
      the
      next
      few
      days
      I
      know
      for
      sure
      (as
      do

      set
      up
      right.
      However
      my
      control
      isn #8217;t
      to
      the
      point
      yet

      something
      like
      what
      you
      did.
      Or
      I
      get
      the
      setup
      right
      and
      forget
      to
      reverse

      down
      to
      try

      make
      a

      effed

      it
      tough
      for
      us.
      I
      actually
      had
      a
      friend
      over
      last
      night
      and
      I
      had
      RL
      open
      and
      he
      said
       #8220;you
      should
      get
      everything
      before
      your
      shells
      expire! #8221;
      I
      have
      about
      900
      shells
      currently,
      and
      I
      already
      bought
      every
      item/decryptor
      available.
      I
      also
      wish
      crates
      were
      tradable.
      Say,
      trade
      5
      crates
      of
      one
      type
      for
      a
      rarer
      crate?
      Idk.
      I
      have
      probably
      100+
      crates
      and
      just
      don #8217;t
      want
      to
      spend
      the
      $100+
      it
      would
      cost
      to
      open
      them
      all.

      Agreed!
      I #8217;m
      from
      NY
      and
      pay
      for
      At
      Bat
      so
      I
      can
      watch
      as
      many
      games
      as
      possible.
      People
      think
      I #8217;m
      crazy
      because
      we #8217;re
      this
      bad
      now
      but
      that #8217;s
      what
      separates
      true
      fans
      from
      band
      wagoners.
      I
      remember
      in
      08
      and
      13
      after
      the
      Giants
      won
      the
      Super
      Bowl
      how
      many
      more
      fans
      I
      saw,
      yet
      in
      04-06
      I
      was
      the
      only
      guy
      rocking
      the
      jersey
      every
      Sunday
      when
      we
      were
      barely
      making
      the
      postseason
      and
      Eli
      was,
      well,
      being
      Eli.
      And
      13-15
      was
      amazing.
      My
      dad
      always
      said
      to
      cherish
      world
      championships
      because
      they
      don #8217;t
      happen
      often.
      I
      wasn #8217;t
      alive
      for
      the
      85
      season
      however
      I
      do
      hope
      we
      don #8217;t
      have
      to
      wait
      another
      30
      years
      (well,
      27
      now)
      for
      another
      one!

      To
      me,
      a
       #8220;good #8221;
      job
      is
      one
      that
      doesn #8217;t
      always
      feel
      like
      work.
      A
      good
      job
      should
      be
      not
      only
      one
      that
      has
      enough
      of
      a
      salary
      to
      support
      yourself
      relatively
      comfortably
      on
      (i.e.,
      not
      paycheck
      to
      paycheck,
      affording
      a
      few
      extra
      nice
      things
      here
      and
      there,
      etc.)
      but
      also
      one
      that
      you
      look
      forward
      to
      or
      at
      minimum
      don #8217;t
      dread
      that
      you
      have
      work
      the
      next
      day.
      The
      sad
      part
      is
      that #8217;s
      an
      incredibly
      tough
      balance
      to
      find
      and
      that
      leads
      to
      a
      lot
      of
      situations
      like
      what
      OP
      is
      experiencing.
      Most
      people
      never
      get
      to
      have
      that
      kind
      of
      working
      experience
      due
      to
      availability
      of
      jobs
      in
      a
      given
      field,
      and
      the
      competitive
      job
      market
      in
      which
      you
      now
      usually
      need
      a
      grad
      degree
      for
      a
      lot
      of
      fields
      to
      even
      be
      considered.

      Oh,
      if
      only
      I
      had
      known
      this
      as
      well.
      Wife
      and
      I
      got
      in
      the
      shower
      together
      and
      then
      in
      bed,
      but
      looked
      at
      each
      other
      and
      basically
      said
       #8220;yeah,
      we #8217;ve
      had
      sex
      before,
      we #8217;ve
      both
      had
      essentially
      a
      12
      hour
      day,
      let #8217;s
      just
      postpone
      the
      sex
      thing
      at
      least
      till
      tomorrow #8221;
      and
      then
      passed
      out.
      No
      regrets
      though,
      we
      slept
      like
      babies!
      Lol.
      We
      weren #8217;t
      the
      only
      ones
      either.
      A
      number
      of
      our
      friends
      that
      subsequently
      got
      married
      also
      had
      similar
      wedding
      night
      experiences.
      Our
      hotel
      was
      pretty
      nice
      though.
      We
      got
      married
      at
      a
      fairly
      upscale
      resort
      and
      ended
      up
      having
      a
      pretty
      sweet
      room
      with
      a
      private
      balcony
      and
      lake
      view.
      However,
      it
      sucked
      that
      we
      only
      got
      that
      room
      one
      night
      and
      barely
      could
      enjoy
      it.
      For
      our
      first
      anniversary
      though
      we
      got
      the
      same
      room
      and
      went
      away
      for
      the
      weekend
      and
      actually
      enjoyed
      it.
      We
      plan
      on
      doing
      this
      every
      anniversary
      we
      can
      from
      now
      on.

      I #8217;m
      working
      on
      restoring
      my
      original
      collection
      as
      well.
      I
      recently
      picked
      up
      Blue,
      Red,
      Gold
      and
      TCG.
      All
      I #8217;m
      missing
      now
      is
      Yellow
      and
      Pinball
      (never
      owned
      Silver).
      Just
      make
      sure
      you
      swap
      the
      batteries
      before
      playing.
      I
      checked
      all
      my
      carts #8217;
      batteries
      and
      they
      were
      all
      original
      (Gold
      was
      the
      only
      one
      that
      didn #8217;t
      save,
      R/B/TCG
      surprisingly
      did).

      What #8217;s
      cool
      about
      playing
      it
      on
      a
      GBC
      vs.
      something
      like
      an
      emulator
      is
      that
      the
      emulator
      doesn #8217;t
      use
      those
       #8220;main #8221;
      colors
      to
      tint
      a
      lot
      of
      things
      that
      the
      GBC
      would.
      They
      just
      show
      it
      in
      mostly
      full
      color.
      It #8217;s
      a
      nice
      little
      touch
      that
      you
      don #8217;t
      realize
      right
      away
      but
      appreciate
      when
      you
      notice
      it.
      I
      wish
      they
      transferred
      this
      to
      the
      VC
      version;
      I
      was
      kind
      of
      disappointed
      when
      I
      realized
      it
      would
      only
      be
      greyscale.

      take
      the
      chance
      of
      getting
      halfway
      through
      and
      then
      the
      battery
      crapping
      out.

      If
      you
      have
      a
      GBA,
      you
      can
      easily
      swap
      the
      battery
      while
      the
      game
      is
      running.
      If
      the
      game
      is
      powered
      by
      the
      GBA
      it
      isn #8217;t
      running
      off
      the
      save
      battery
      and
      you
      can
      keep
      your
      save
      file
      with
      a
      new
      battery.
      I
      replaced
      my
      Gold #8217;s
      battery
      I
      just
      picked
      up
      and
      plan
      on
      replacing
      it
      in
      5
      years
      with
      my
      GBA
      to
      keep
      whatever
      save
      file
      I
      have
      at
      that
      point.
      You
      just
      have
      to
      be
      careful
      to
      not
      move
      or
      accidentally
      eject
      the
      cartridge
      as
      if
      it
      loses
      power
      or
      resets
      the
      game
      without
      the
      battery,
      you
      will
      obviously
      lose
      your
      save
      file.

      Yeah.
      That #8217;s
      why
      when
      I
      replaced
      my
      batteries
      last,
      I
      used
      the
      electrical
      tape
      method
      to
      make
      it
      easier
      to
      swap
      out
      later
      without
      losing
      my
      saves.

      I
      used
      to
      work
      for
      TWC
      (left
      shortly
      after
      the
      merger
      however).
      When
      Spectrum
      took
      over,
      there
      was
      a
      two-year
      bar
      on
      getting
      rid
      of
      any
      N.Y.
      employees.
      Pretty
      sure
      it
      was
      a
      merger
      condition.
      Since
      the
      merger
      conditions
      will
      apply
      to
      the
      new
      entity(-ies)
      I
      assume
      there
      will
      be
      a
      similar
      condition
      enforced.

      Yes.
      I
      was
      in
      a
      call
      center
      and
      actually,
      everyone
      who
      was
      a
      legacy
      TWC
      employee
      is
      still
      there
      that
      I
      interacted
      with.
      You
      could
      still
      get
      fired
      for
      incompetence
      but
      as
      long
      as
      you
      did
      your
      job
      accurately,
      you
      were
      fine.
      I
      think
      the
      caveat
      was
      that
      if
      you
      transitioned
      to
      a
      new
      role,
      whether
      it
      be
      lateral/promotion/demotion,
      you
      were
      no
      longer
      covered
      by
      the
      merger
      condition #8217;s
      protection.
      Some
      of
      my
      former
      coworkers
      were
      promoted
      to
      various
      positions
      throughout
      the
      center,
      however
      they
      are
      still
      employed
      by
      Charter.
      The
      thing
      that
      sucked
      the
      most
      though
      was
      that
      almost
      immediately
      following
      the
      merger,
      Charter
      lowered
      the
      company
      match
      for
      the
      401k
      and
      removed
      vested
      pensions
      for
      all
      employees.
      You #8217;d
      get
      paid
      out
      one
      lump
      sum
      what
      your
      pension
      would
      be
      had
      you
      retired
      that
      day
      but
      that
      extra
      protection
      was
      gone
      and
      screwed
      over
      a
      lot
      of
      older
      employees
      planning
      on
      utilizing
      the
      pension
      in
      retirement.
      Didn #8217;t
      affect
      me
      thankfully
      as
      I
      wasn #8217;t
      there
      long
      enough
      to
      be
      vested
      but
      it
      certainly
      put
      a
      bad
      taste
      in
      a
      lot
      of
      employee #8217;s
      mouths.

      Idk
      about
      Android,
      but
      with
      iPhones
      there #8217;s
      a
      setting
      in
      the
      Bluetooth
      options
      to
      allow
      your
      device
      to
      have
      access
      to
      things
      like
      contacts,
      music,
      etc.,
      and
      IIRC
      you
      have
      to
      have
      this
      enabled
      in
      order
      to
      stream
      music
      if
      the
      phone
      doesn #8217;t
      recognize
      the
      Bluetooth
      device
      as
      a
       #8220;speaker #8221;
      (so
      if
      I
      were
      to
      connect
      to
      a
      Bose
      speaker,
      for
      example,
      my
      phone
      would
      see
      it
      as
      a
      speaker
      and
      automatically
      allow
      streaming,
      whereas
      my
      car
      would
      not
      be
      recognized
      and
      I #8217;d
      have
      to
      enable
      the
      setting).
      Maybe
      you
      can
      try
      and
      find
      a
      similar
      setting
      in
      your
      phone?

      No.
      My
      dad
      passed
      last
      week
      of
      cancer
      after
      only
      showing
      symptoms
      for
      three
      weeks
      (ended
      up
      having
      a
      very
      rare
      and
      extremely
      aggressive
      cancer
      that
      is
      almost
      never
      caught
      until
      it #8217;s
      too
      late).
      The
      amount
      of
      pain
      he
      was
      in
      at
      the
      end
      was
      almost
      unbearable
      to
      watch.
      I
      honestly
      wouldn #8217;t
      wish
      that
      fate
      on
      my
      worst
      enemy.

      Not
      OP
      but
      just
      an
      observation
      -
      it #8217;s
      sad
      that
      it #8217;s
      considered
       #8220;outing #8221;
      oneself
      as
      a
      republican.
      It
      really
      puts
      it
      into
      a
      different
      perspective
      when
      you
      think
      of
      it
      that
      way.
      Similar
      to
      how
      gay
      people
      shouldn #8217;t
      have
      to
       #8220;out #8221;
      themselves
      to
      others,
      you
      should
      be
      unashamed
      and
      proud
      to
      admit
      you #8217;re
      a
      member
      of
      a
      political
      party
      (whether
      it
      be
      republican,
      democratic,
      green,
      libertarian,
      etc.)

      As
      someone
      who
      just
      lost
      my
      dad
      a
      few
      weeks
      to
      cancer,
      I
      know
      the
      feeling.
      It
      sucks!
      My
      dad
      only
      had
      23
      days
      between
      showing
      symptoms
      and
      diagnosis
      to
      his
      passing.
      Just
      cherish
      the
      time
      you
      have
      left
      and
      be
      prepared,
      as
      it
      will
      be
      insanely
      hard
      to
      watch
      her
      struggle
      through
      the
      end.
      Just
      keep
      telling
      her
      you
      love
      her
      and
      make
      sure
      she
      is
      as
      comfortable
      as
      possible.
      I #8217;m
      sorry,
      internet
      friend.

      This.
      I
      hate
      people
      that
      use
      their
      phone
      while
      driving.
      This
      morning
      I
      had
      a
      woman
      stop
      mid-backing
      out
      of
      her
      parking
      spot,
      pick
      up
      her
      phone,
      and
      start
      texting
      while
      just
      sitting
      there
      blocking
      the
      whole
      lane.
      I
      promptly
      honked
      my
      horn
      and
      got
      her
      to
      move
      so
      I
      could
      back
      out
      and
      leave.
      Idk
      what
      goes
      through
      people #8217;s
      minds
      sometimes.
      I
      also
      am
      a
      wis
      and
      see
      that
      a
      lot
      but
      I
      refuse
      to
      take
      a
      wrist
      shot
      while
      driving.
      Parked,
      okay,
      sure,
      but
      in
      gear
      or
      even
      at
      a
      stoplight?
      No
      thanks.
      It #8217;s
      still
      a
      cool
      pic,
      but
      dangerous
      at
      that.

      Side
      question,
      wtf
      was
       #8220;logo #8221;
      supposed
      to
      even
      mean?
      Is
      it
      like
      customizable
      apparel
      or
      something
      where
      you
      can
      put
      whatever
      you
      want
      on
      it?
      Because
      if
      not
      having
      a
      shirt
      that
      says
       #8220;logo #8221;
      above
      your
      company #8217;s
      logo
      seems
      pretty
      stupid
      to
      me.

      Key
      word
      on
      that
      last
      one
      (and
      sort
      of
      including
      Kobe
      I
      guess
      too)
      is
       #8220;alleged #8221;.
      Should
      be
      innocent
      until
      proven
      guilty
      however
      in
      sports
      and
      entertainment,
      it #8217;s
      almost
      never
      the
      case
      (especially
      when
      politics
      are
      involved).
      For
      doping,
      that
      answer
      should
      be
      obvious
      though.
      Doping
      can
      (and
      usually
      will
      with
      prolonged
      suspensions)
      get
      you
      permabanned
      from
      whatever
      sport
      you #8217;re
      an
      athlete
      for,
      whether
      it
      be
      cycling,
      football,
      baseball,
      soccer,
      curling,
      etc.
      For
      the
      other
      ones
      above
      this
      post
      it #8217;s
      all
      criminal
      acts
      that
      have
      relatively
      solid
      proof
      that
      it
      occurred.
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      it #8217;s
      a
      matter
      of
       #8220;where
      Nike
      draws
      the
      line #8221;,
      I
      think
      it #8217;s
      a
      matter
      of
       #8220;what
      will
      and
      won #8217;t
      hurt
      Nike
      and
      how
      is
      it
      perceived
      by
      customers #8221;.
      In
      other
      words,
      if
      it
      can
      be
      proved
      beyond
      the
      reason
      of
      doubt,
      and
      if
      it #8217;s
      criminal
      or
      will
      get
      you
      banned
      from
      competing
      again,
      then
      they #8217;ll
      drop
      you.

       gt;
      proven
      innocent
      You
      make
      a
      lot
      of
      good
      points
      but
      this
      right
      here
      is
      why
      I
      disagree
      with
      most
      of
      them,
      especially
      suspending
      endorsements
      because
      of
      an
      accusation.
      There
      are
      so
      many
      false
      accusations
      against
      athletes
      or
      celebrities
      because
      the
      accuser
      wants
      to
      get
      a
      quick
      payday
      through
      a
      settlement.
      I
      truly
      think
      it
      would
      be
      unfair
      to
      the
      athletes
      because
      they
      could
      get
      suspensions
      on
      endorsements
      left
      and
      right.
      It
      should
      be
      proven
      guilty,
      not
      innocent.
      It
      shouldn #8217;t
      be
      on
      the
      accused
      to
      prove
      why
      they #8217;re
      innocent
      and
      still
      suffer
      consequences
      even
      if
      the
      charges
      are
      dropped.

      NY
      was
      considering
      a
      law
      a
      couple
      years
      ago
      that
      mandated
      a
      premium
      reduction
      of
      10%
      if
      the
      driver
      had
      a
      dash
      cam.
      Not
      sure
      where
      that
      went
      now
      that
      I
      think
      about
      it
      though.
      I
      know
      the
      biggest
      counter
      argument
      though
      would
      be
      that
      insurance
      companies
      would
      just
      raise
      the
      rates
      10%
      to
      cover
      the
      mandated
      discount.

      I
      completely
      agree
      with

      I

      stating
      what
      NY
      was
      thinking
      of
      doing
      with

      The
      garage
      HVCC
      built
      helped
      the
      parking
      problem
      a
      *little*,
      but
      when
      I
      went
      there
      (around
      5
      years
      ago
      now),
      it
      was
      still
      awful.
      I
      had
      to
      pick
      8am
      classes
      because
      I
      didn #8217;t
      feel
      like
      showing
      up
      at
      7:30
      to
      park
      and
      then
      sitting
      around
      for
      a
      few
      hours.
      UAlbany
      wasn #8217;t
      any
      better.
      Usually
      had
      to
      show
      up
      between
      30-45
      minutes
      early
      for
      later
      classes
      to
      make
      sure
      I
      could
      find
      parking
      and
      walk
      to
      class
      on
      time.
      I #8217;m
      kind
      of
      thinking
      that
      UAlbany
      has
      a
      lack
      of
      parking
      on
      purpose
      though,
      as
      $50
      per
      ticket
      is
      probably
      a
      decent
      enough
      revenue
      stream
      they
      can
      capitalize
      on
      with
      commuter
      students.

      Yes
      I
      do
      remember
      that
      lot.
      That #8217;s
      ridiculous
      that
      they #8217;re
      adding
      another
      building.
      And
      removing
      parking.
      Pretty
      sure
      classroom
      space
      was
      never
      an
      issue

      It #8217;s
      actually
      a
      nationally
      televised
      game.
      I #8217;m
      in
      NY
      and
      watching
      it.
      Monday
      Night
      Football
      is
      always
      nationally
      televised.
      I #8217;m
      surprised
      the
      finale
      is
      even
      being
      run
      at
      the
      same
      time
      as
      the
      game.
      I
      feel
      like
      the
      network
      should
      know
      better.

      Why
      would
      they
      double
      broadcast?
      That #8217;s
      stupid.
      I
      don #8217;t
      get
      Giants
      games
      on
      two
      networks

      they #8217;re
      on
      Sunday
      or
      Monday
      Night
      Football.
      I
      only
      get
      them
      on
      NBC
      or
      ESPN.
      I
      get
      ABC
      and
      ESPN
      are

      companies

      still,
      that
      just
      seems

      I

      with
      his

      He
      was
      incredibly
      accurate
      minus
      a
      few
      throws.
      One
      of

      overthrows
      wasn #8217;t
      his

      don #8217;t
      blame
      the
      pick
      on

      either.
      That

      I #8217;ve
      never
      gotten
      a
      Giants
      game
      on
      anything
      other
      than
      the
      original
      network
      it
      was
      supposed
      to
      be
      broadcasted
      on
      (so
      ESPN
      for
      Monday
      games,
      NBC
      for
      Sunday
      night
      games,
      etc.)
      with
      the
      exception
      of
      Thursday
      night
      games
      (but
      I
      get
      every
      Thursday
      game,
      usually
      on
      Fox,

      it #8217;s
      almost
      as
      if
      they #8217;re
      treated
      as
      national

      I
      wonder
      if
      that #8217;s
      due
      to
      my
      local

      not

      Interesting.
      Even
      though
      I #8217;m
      in
      the
       #8220;home
      market #8221;,
      I
      live
      in
      upstate
      NY
      (Albany
      area)
      so
      maybe
      they
      consider
      the
       #8220;home
      market #8221;
      to
      be
      extremely
      local
      for
      broadcasting
      purposes.

      I #8217;d
      wear
      it
      anyway.
      I
      wore
      an
      Explorer
      for
      years
      at
      my
      government
      job
      and
      no
      one
      ever
      said
      anything.
      It #8217;s
      only
      as
      noticeable
      as
      you
      feel
      like.
      Most
      people
      I
      bet,
      even
      if
      they
      notice
      it,
      won #8217;t
      say
      anything.
      I
      never
      got
      one
      compliment
      or
      statement
      of
      recognition
      about
      either
      the
      Explorer
      or
      Speedmaster
      Pro
      I
      wore
      on
      a
      daily
      basis.
      Although
      I
      had
      to
      sell
      both
      watches
      for
      financial
      reasons,
      I
      now
      wear
      a
      two
      tone
      Seiko,
      Tissot,
      and
      Christopher
      Ward
      that
      I
      modded
      to
      imitate
      a
      Submariner
      and
      no
      one
      still
      says
      anything.

      Man,
      that
      sucks.
      I
      mean
      my
      position
      is
      somewhat
      public
      facing
      or
      interacting
      with
      corporations
      and
      executives,
      so
      maybe
      that #8217;s
      why
      it #8217;s
      more
      acceptable?
      Either
      way,
      I
      hope
      you
      wear
      it
      as
      often
      as
      you
      can.
      It #8217;s
      a
      beautiful
      piece.
      Also,
      congrats
      on
      the
      wedding!

      Yes,
      about
      $1K
      on
      each
      from
      what
      I
      bought
      them
      for.
      I
      understood
      if
      I
      ever
      had
      to
      sell
      them
      I #8217;d
      have
      to
      take
      some
      kind
      of
      loss
      though,
      so
      it
      wasn #8217;t
      unexpected.
      I
      enjoyed
      each
      for
      a
      few
      years
      though
      so
      while
      I
      was
      disappointed
      I
      had
      to
      sell
      them,
      I
      was
      happy
      I
      got
      to
      have
      them
      for
      the
      time
      I
      did,
      and
      plan
      on
      rebuying
      each
      in
      the
      future.

      Is
      there
      any
      way
      to
      turn
      off
      the
      swipe
      up
      to
      go
      home
      gesture
      in
      iOS
      12?
      I
      have
      an
      issue
      with
      bringing
      up
      the
      dock,
      because
      every
      time
      I
      try
      to
      swipe
      up
      it
      brings
      up
      the
      home
      screen
      instead
      of
      the
      dock.
      It
      just
      seems
      like
      the
      gesture
      is
      too
      sensitive
      to
      use
      the
      multitasking
      features
      that
      I
      use
      a
      lot.
      Or,
      if
      there
      is
      another
      way
      to
      bring
      up
      the
      dock
      with
      the
      smart
      keyboard
      instead
      (I
      use
      the
      Logitech
      Slim
      Combo
      case/keyboard),
      that
      would
      be
      great
      too
      but
      I
      can #8217;t
      find
      a
      way
      to
      do
      it.
      EDIT:
      I
      found
      a
      way
      to
      use
      the
      keyboard,
      it
      is
      Command-Option-D,
      however
      I
      would
      still
      like
      to
      know
      if
      there
      is
      a
      way
      to
      turn
      off
      the
      swipe
      up
      to
      go
      home
      gesture.

      Yeah,
      that #8217;s
      what
      I #8217;m
      trying
      to
      avoid
      having
      to
      do.
      Swiping
      slow
      does
      work,
      but
      it
      feels
      like
      I
      have
      to
      swipe
      slowly
      for
      like,
      5
      or
      so
      seconds
      to
      not
      trigger
      the
      go
      home
      feature.
      Maybe
      it
      will
      become
      second
      nature
      soon
      and
      I
      will
      learn
      it
      quicker,
      however
      until
      then,
      it #8217;s
      just
      annoying
      for
      me.
      If
      I
      didn #8217;t
      have
      a
      home
      button
      and
      had
      to
      use
      it,
      that
      would
      be
      fine,
      however
      I
      have
      a
      home
      button
      on
      both
      the
      iPad
      and
      keyboard
      and
      for
      me
      it
      should
      be
      an
      optional
      feature
      to
      turn
      on
      or
      off.

      Nah,
      I #8217;m
      not.
      For
      a
      couple
      reasons:
      -There
      will
      be
      a
      price
      hike
      most
      likely.
      My
      2nd
      gen
      10.5 #8221;
      256GB
      model
      was
      ~$800,
      and
      the
      keyboard
      case
      (Logitech
      Slim
      Combo)
      was
      ~$130.
      That #8217;s
      $930
      for
      an
      iPad.
      I
      know
      we #8217;re
      getting
      to
      the
      point
      where
      iPads
      can
      be
      laptop
      replacements
      but
      the
      price
      hike
      would
      likely
      put
      the
      total
      cost
      of
      my
      setup
      well
      over
      $1k.
      -iOS
      12,
      with
      its
      performance
      updates,
      makes
      my
      iPad
      faster
      than
      it
      ever
      has
      been.
      For
      what
      I
      use
      it
      for
      (note
      taking,
      word
      processing,
      email,
      Skype
      messages,
      light
      split
      screen
      multitasking,
      some
      Excel),
      it
      has
      no
      problem
      handling
      that.
      The
      4GB
      of
      RAM
      along
      with
      the
      processor
      has
      never
      stuttered
      for
      me
      yet.
      -I
      like
      my
      bezels
      and
      TouchID.
      I
      like
      being
      able
      to
      hold
      my
      iPad
      and
      not
      feel
      like
      my
      hands
      are
      crowding
      the
      display
      and
      I
      also
      like
      having
      the
      TouchID
      to
      unlock
      it.
      I
      don #8217;t
      really
      care
      for
      FaceID
      in
      its
      current
      state,
      however
      that
      may
      change
      down
      the
      road
      (not
      like
      I #8217;ll
      have
      a
      choice
      whenever
      I
      upgrade
      my
      phone
      next,
      unless
      I
      switch
      to
      Android
      which
      likely
      won #8217;t
      happen).
      That
      being
      said,
      I
      will
      be
      a
      little
      salty
      if
      the
      (potentially)

      isn #8217;t
      backwards
      compatible
      with
      the
      1st/2nd
      gen
      pros.
      I #8217;m
      actually
      holding
      out
      for
      an
      Apple
      Pencil
      because
      I #8217;d
      like
      the
      rumored
       #8220;eraser #8221;
      functionality
      added
      and
      then
      for
      me
      it
      would
      be
      an
      instant
      buy
      even
      if
      they
      raise
      the
      price
      a
      bit.
      Won #8217;t
      be
      the
      end
      of
      the
      world
      or
      anything
      but
      I #8217;d
      be
      a
      bit
      salty
      about
      it.
      Although
      based
      on
      current
      Apple
      trends
      I
      think
      they #8217;d
      certainly
      make
      it
      backwards
      compatible,
      especially
      if
      they
      phase
      out
      the
      current
      Pencil.

      Don #8217;t
      know

      the
      tabbed
      feature
      isn #8217;t
      advertised

      it
      makes
      productive
      work
      so
      much
      more
      possible.
      Wouldn #8217;t
      have
      been
      so
      hesitant
      to
      purchase

      Thanks
      everyone!
      I
      recently
      just
      got
      a
      10.5 #8221;
      iPad
      Pro
      as
      a
      companion
      device
      for
      work.
      For
      my
      work
      I
      typically
      need
      to
      have
      a
      few
      PDF
      files
      quickly
      accessible
      depending
      on
      what
      I
      am
      working
      on
      at
      the
      moment.
      Is
      there
      an
      app
      that
      allows
      multiple
      PDF
      files
      to
      be
      open
      at
      the
      same
      time
      in
      a
      tabbed
      setup
      like
      Adobe
      on
      PC?
      I
      don #8217;t
      need
      to
      view
      them
      side
      by
      side,
      however
      I
      would
      like
      to
      have
      both
      documents
      open
      and
      easily
      be
      able
      to
      switch
      between
      them.
      I
      have
      tried
      using
      multiple
      apps
      to
      view
      them,
      however
      when
      I
      also
      have
      Word/OneNote/etc.
      open
      to
      take
      notes
      during
      a
      meeting,
      that
      forces
      one
      of
      the
      PDFs
      to
      be
      designated
      to
      the
      floating
      multitasking
      window,
      which
      is
      less
      than
      ideal.
      I
      tried
      searching
      the
      app
      store
      and
      online
      however
      I
      couldn #8217;t
      find
      anything.
      Maybe
      my
      wording
      is
      wrong?
      Any
      help
      would
      be
      appreciated.

      Exactly.
      I #8217;m
      the
      biggest
      Eli
      supporter
      I
      know
      personally
      and
      the
      only
      reason
      I
      was
      so
      upset
      was
      because
      Geno
      Smith
      started.
      I #8217;d
      understand
      it
      if
      Webb
      was
      the
      starter
      instead.
      We
      knew
      what
      Smith
      was
      as
      a
      starting
      QB.
      We
      didn #8217;t
      (and
      still
      don #8217;t)
      know
      what
      Webb
      was/is.
      It
      doesn #8217;t
      matter
      now,
      but
      if
      he
      was
      gonna
      lose
      his
      streak,
      it
      would #8217;ve
      at
      least
      made
      sense
      to
      see
      Webb
      out
      there
      instead.
      And
      if
      it
      comes
      to
      that
      point
      this
      season
      as
      well
      (I
      hope
      it
      doesn #8217;t)
      I
      want
      to
      see
      what
      Lauletta
      can
      do.

      This
      is
      the
      case
      with
      my
      HOA.
      They

      truly
      care
      less
      about
      most
      stuff,

      want
      you
      to
      make
      sure
      your
      lawn
      is
      mowed,
      exterior
      of
      your
      house
      is
      clean,
      external
      structure
      reasonably
      look
      well
      with
      the
      house/property,
      etc.
      Really
      not
      that
      bad.
      I #8217;d
      still
      rather
      have
      no
      HOA
      at
      all,
      though.

      I #8217;ll
      give
      you
      all
      the
      others
      but
      I
      disagree
      about
      WWII.
      That
      was
      more
      Japan
      attacking
      us
      than
      us
      willingly
      getting
      into
      a
      war,
      even
      if
      you
      want
      to
      point
      to
      all
      of
      our
      land
      lease
      programs
      and
      trade
      pacts
      essentially
      alienating
      Germany/Axis.
      Personally,
      the
      second
      world
      war
      was
      justified
      in
      us
      getting
      involved.
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      the
      First
      World
      War
      was
      justifiable,
      however.
      And
      Korea
      was
      just
      a
      waste
      of
      resources
      since
      we
      basically
      stopped
      before
      we
      hit
      China.
      If
      Korea
      was
      going
      to
      be
      successful
      we
      needed
      to
      push
      into
      China
      but
      instead
      we
      just
      stopped
      and
      allowed
      them
      to
      retake
      half
      the
      peninsula.
      So
      many
      lives
      wasted
      on
      some
      proxy
      war
      that
      we
      refused
      to
      finish.
      It #8217;s
      a
      shame
      really.

      basically
      disowning

      It

      on
      both
      sides.

      That #8217;s
      the
      whole
      point
      of
      the
      electoral
      college

      It #8217;s

      a

      Otherwise,

      I
      know
      they
      have
      less
      population.
      In
      case
      you
      didn #8217;t
      read
      my
      post,
      THATS
      THE
      POINT
      OF
      THE
      ELECTORAL
      COLLEGE.
      It #8217;s
      to
      give
      more
      voting
      and
      representation
      power
      to
      those
      areas
      with
      less
      population.
      I
      didn #8217;t
      say
       #8220;more
      red #8221;,
      or
      anything
      like
      that.
      The
      article
      you
      posted
      is
      factually
      correct
      with
      regard
      to
      basic
      math,
      however
      it
      doesn #8217;t
      mean
      that
      the
      electoral
      college
      doesn #8217;t
      work.
      If
      it
      didn #8217;t,
      wed
      have
      a
      President
      Clinton
      instead
      and
      over
      90%
      of
      the
      geographical
      United
      States
      would
      be
      furious
      because,
      despite
      how
      many
      votes
      they
      had,
      ultimately
      it
      meant
      nothing
      because
      more
      people
      are
      in
      NYC
      and
      LA.
      For
      example,
      I
      live
      in
      Upstate
      NY,
      and
      NYC
      basically
      decides
      all
      our
      elections
      because
      there
      isn #8217;t
      anything
      to
      balance
      out
      the
      upstate
      and
      downstate
      voting
      demographics.
      Almost
      all
      areas
      above
      Westchester
      County
      vote
      red,
      yet
      blue
      overruns
      much
      of
      the
      higher
      political
      offices.
      Doesn #8217;t
      matter
      how
      many
      people
      vote
      upstate
      and
      out
      west
      because
      NYC
      has
      more
      people
      and
      the
      vast
      majority
      of
      upstate
      NY
      residents
      feel
      they
      aren #8217;t
      represented
      as
      a
      result.
      The
      point
      of
      posting
      the
      map
      was
      to
      show
      that
      without
      the
      electoral
      vote,
      the
      geographical
      majority
      of
      the
      US
      wouldn #8217;t
      be
      represented
      properly.
      All
      Clinton
      really
      did
      was
      focus
      on
      areas
      with
      big
      populations
      and
      liberal
      cities.
      If
      you
      look
      in
      the
      link
      I
      posted,
      without
      the
      majority
      of
      the
      most
      populated
      counties,
      Clinton
      would #8217;ve
      lost
      the
      popular
      vote
      by
      almost
      13
      million
      votes.
      Like
      I
      said,
      the
      electoral
      college
      did
      its
      job
      and
      prevented
      the
      election
      from
      being
      decided
      by
      CA
      and
      NYC/DC.

      I

      a
      bit
      better.
      And
      yes,

      That #8217;s

      because
      you
      don #8217;t
      like
      how
      they
      vote.
      Everyone
      deserves
      equal
      voting
      power,
      whether
      you
      live
      in
      the
      middle

      Popular
      vote
      only
      works
      in
      small
      geographical
      areas.
      Otherwise
      you
      need
      to
      have
      something
      to
      balance
      out
      the
      different
      population
      sizes
      and
      other
      issues
      common

      a

      as
      large
      as
      the

      have
      three
      times
      the

      density.

      who
      don #8217;t.
      It #8217;s
      not
      exact
      but
      it
      certainly
      makes
      it
      more
      equal
      that
      it
      would
      be
      without
      it.
      That
      is
      literally
      the
      point
      of
      the
      electoral
      college.
      The
      entire
      country
      shouldn #8217;t
      be
      represented
      by
      a
      few
      cities
      on
      either
      coast!
      That #8217;s
      utterly
      ridiculous
      and
      if
      you
      think
      that
      so
      few
      geographical
      areas
      know
      what #8217;s
      best
      for
      the
      entire
      country,
      including
      rural
      areas
      and
      the
      Midwest,
      then
      I
      can #8217;t
      further
      help
      you
      understand
      the
      point
      of
      the
      electoral
      college
      and
      why
      it
      was
      created
      by
      the
      nations
      Founders
      almost
      250
      years
      ago.

      No
      problem.
      I
      don #8217;t
      care
      about
      the
      downvotes,
      honestly.
      It #8217;s
      stupid
      to
      care
      about
      fake
      internet
      points
      that
      do
      absolutely
      nothing
      in
      return.
      It #8217;s
      just
      a
      form
      of
      validation
      that
      some
      more
      shallow
      people
      depend
      on,
      and
      that #8217;s
      cool
      too,
      whatever
      floats
      your
      boat
      is
      fine
      with
      me.
      I
      just
      frankly
      don #8217;t
      care.
      All
      I
      care
      about
      is
      having
      a
      decent
      conversation
      without
      getting
      insulted
      or
      cursed
      at
      or
      whatever.

      Why
      shouldn #8217;t
      it?
      Does
      that
      mean
      you #8217;re
      okay
      with
      abolishing
      the

      The
      Senate
      follows
      the
      exact
      same
      premise
      -
      to
      give
      small
      states
      and
      low
      populated
      states
      more
      voting
      power
      so
      that

      don #8217;t
      create

      dictatorship.

      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      it #8217;s
      that
      he #8217;s
      too
      scared
      to
      throw
      accurately
      but
      he #8217;s
      actually
      not
      willing
      to
      put
      the
      ball
      in
      harms
      way
      (i.e.,
      intercepted)
      on
      a
      throw
      where
      he
      can #8217;t
      tell
      if
      the
      receiver
      will
      have
      a
      good
      shot
      at
      it.
      I
      don #8217;t
      blame
      him.
      All
      fans
      and
      analysts
      ever
      criticized
      him
      for
      was
      that
      he
      was
      a
      turnover
      machine.
      And
      if
      he
      starts
      throwing
      picks
      and
      trying
      to
      force
      the
      ball
      the
      argument
      will
      be
       #8220;Eli
      sucks
      because
      he
      throws
      so
      many
      picks,
      replace
      him! #8221;
      He
      can #8217;t
      win.
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      there
      will
      ever
      be
      a
      time
      again
      with
      him
      as
      a
      Giant
      where
      fans
      love
      him
      and
      the
      media
      won #8217;t
      critique
      his
      every
      move
      on
      the
      field,
      and
      that
      truly
      makes
      me
      sad.
      He
      deserves
      better
      than
      this.

      Couldn #8217;t
      agree
      more
      with
      this.
      I #8217;d
      have
      been
      happy
      getting
      married
      at
      City
      Hall.
      My
      wife
      is
      my
      soulmate,
      and
      I
      don #8217;t
      need
      a
      fancy
      wedding
      to
      prove
      that
      to
      the
      world.
      I
      had
      two
      main
      reasons
      for
      having
      a
      rather
      expensive
      wedding,
      however:
      1)
      I #8217;m
      Catholic.
      I
      enjoyed
      the
      actual
      wedding
      ceremony
      in
      Church
      prior
      to
      the
      reception.
      2)
      I
      wasn #8217;t
      footing
      the
      bill
      and
      my
      wife #8217;s
      mother
      offered
      to
      pay
      for
      the
      reception
      at
      a
      very
      expensive
      place.
      I
      still
      protested
      but
      ultimately
      I
      didn #8217;t
      have
      to
      pay
      for
      my
      wedding
      and
      I #8217;m
      thankful
      I
      didn #8217;t
      have
      to
      foot
      the
      $30k
      bill
      for
      200
      guests.
      I
      had
      a
      great
      time
      but
      it
      was
      completely
      unnecessary
      in
      my
      opinion.
      I
      should
      mention
      though
      that
      the
      money
      we
      saved
      by
      not
      paying
      for
      the
      wedding
      was
      used
      as
      a
      down
      payment
      on
      a
      house,
      and
      financially
      we
      are
      better
      off
      owning
      rather
      than
      renting
      in
      our
      area.
      Rent/our
      mortgage
      is
      roughly
      the
      same
      and
      in
      most
      cases
      rent
      is
      slightly
      more
      expensive.

      Thanks
      for
      this.
      I
      have
      had
      a
      similar
      body
      type
      to

      your
      before
      shot
      (around
      155
      now
      though-
      been
      maintaining
      just
      to
      see
      if
      I
      could
      or
      not)
      and
      have
      been
      as
      low
      as
      146
      within
      the
      last
      six
      or
      so
      months,
      but
      I
      still
      look
      skinny-fat
      at
      146-150ish.
      I
      know
      some
      of
      it #8217;s
      probably
      loose
      skin
      since
      my
      highest
      was
      210
      but
      it #8217;s
      good
      to
      know
      that
      if
      I
      go
      a
      little
      lower
      then
      work
      on
      build
      I
      should
      hopefully
      turn
      out
      okay!

      Darkwa

      Depends.
      Some
      modern
      computer
      power
      supply #8217;s
      have
      surge
      protection
      already
      built
      in,
      and
      you
      don #8217;t
      want
      to
      plug
      anything
      in
      with
      built
      in
      surge
      protection
      to
      a
      surge
      protector.
      Other
      electronics
      have
      this
      too.
      My
      Xbox
      One
      X,
      for
      example,
      has
      built
      in
      surge
      protection.
      Best
      thing
      to
      do
      would
      be
      to
      check
      your
      device
      manuals
      and
      see
      before
      plugging

      I #8217;ve
      only
      been
      able
      to
      get
      one
      299,
      no
      300.
      I
      have
      the
      same
      feeling
      as
      you.
      Do
      I
      wish
      I
      didn #8217;t
      pull
      it
      half
      a
      board
      so
      it
      didn #8217;t
      nose
      a
      bit
      high?
      Yep.
      Am
      I
      bitter
      about
      it?
      Not
      really.
      I
      was
      17,
      and
      299
      was
      pretty
      freaking
      cool.
      For
      me,
      the
      score
      that #8217;s
      horrible
      and
      I
      get
      bitter
      about
      is
      280.
      I #8217;ve
      had
      maybe
      about
      10
      of
      them.
      All
      of
      them,
      maybe
      expect
      one
      or
      two,
      have
      been
      single
      pin
      spares
      that
      could #8217;ve
      been
      strikes
      too.
      280
      is
      a
      great
      score
      but
      after
      the
      first
      few
      I
      just
      got
      sick
      of
      them.
      It #8217;s
      almost
      worse
      than
      a
      297,
      -8,
      or
      -9,
      imo,
      because
      you
      have
      ten
      throws
      to
      sit
      there
      and
      think
      about
      whatever
      mistake
      you
      made.

      With
      regard
      to
      the
      first
       #8220;question #8221;,
      I #8217;m
      not
      entirely
      sure
      it
      would
      save
      $17
      million
      in
      cap.
      I
      believe
      only
      a
      small
      portion
      of
      that
      is
      guaranteed
      money.
      I
      remember
      reading
      only
      $4
      or
      $5
      million
      was
      guaranteed
      ad
      that #8217;s
      what
      counted
      toward
      cap
      if
      he #8217;s
      cut.
      That
      being
      said,
      I
      believe
      the
      date
      is
      sometime
      in
      March.
      This
      past
      year
      he
      was
      due
      a
      roster
      bonus
      mid
      March,
      so
      if
      he
      was
      going
      to
      be
      cut
      it #8217;d
      likely
      be
      before
      he #8217;s
      due
      his
      next
      roster
      bonus.
      So
      probably
      March
      but
      I #8217;m
      not
      sure
      of
      the
      exact
      date.
      Pretty
      sure
      if
      he
      retires
      and
      breaks
      his
      contract
      he
      isn #8217;t
      due
      his
      payout
      so
      idk.
      Don #8217;t
      know
      enough
      about
      contracts,
      specifically
      his,
      to
      know
      for
      sure.
      If
      (god
      forbid)
      he
      gets
      injured,
      they
      throw
      Lauretta
      into
      the
      gauntlet
      and
      see
      how
      he
      does
      before
      drafting
      a
      QB
      in
      April
      anyways.

      Defense
      especially
      has
      been
      killing
      us.
      We #8217;re
      averaging
      about
      20
      points
      a
      game,
      which,
      while
      not
      great,
      should
      be
      more
      than
      enough
      to
      win
      a
      game.
      But
      the
      defense
      allowing
      about
      27
      per
      game
      is
      what #8217;s
      hurting.
      Doesn #8217;t
      matter
      how
      much
      you
      score
      if
      your
      defense
      is
      constantly
      allowing
      essentially
      a
      touchdown
      more
      than
      your
      offense.

      him

      Sorry
      you #8217;re
      getting
      downvoted
      to
      hell,
      bud.
      For
      people
      that
      claim
      to
      be
      tolerant
      they
      sure
      do
      hate
      opposing
      opinions.
      I
      support
      you,
      though,
      whether
      your
      gay,
      straight,
      black,
      purple,
      or
      if
      you
      even
      identify
      as
      a
      broom.
      No
      worries

      For
      that
      last
      point,
      my
      biggest
      annoyance
      is
      the
      apparent
      lack
      of
      drywall
      anchors
      for
      things
      like
      mirrors,
      towel
      hooks,
      etc.
      I #8217;ve
      fixed
      four
      or
      five
      things
      that
      were
      hung
      without
      them
      and
      I
      just
      can #8217;t
      comprehend
      why
      the
      previous
      owners
      didn #8217;t
      use
      them.
      I #8217;ve
      had
      two
      mirrors
      nearly
      fall
      and
      a
      towel
      hook
      literally
      rip
      out
      of
      the
      wall
      when
      my
      wife
      hung
      a
      towel
      on
      it.
      There #8217;s
      been
      other,
      more
      important
      things
      done
      wrong
      (like
      no
      labeling
      on
      the
      circuit
      breaker
      panel),
      but
      that #8217;s
      by
      far
      the
      most
      annoying.

      I #8217;d
      actually
      argue
      Barkley
      overran
      the
      route.
      If
      you
      watch
      the
      replay
      he
      barely
      turned
      around
      to
      see
      if
      the
      ball
      was
      coming
      to
      him,
      and
      when
      he
      did
      it
      was
      too
      late.
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      he
      expected
      the
      pass
      to
      go
      to
      him,
      so
      in
      his
      mind
      he
      was
      just
      a
      decoy
      probably
      trying
      to
      open
      up
      coverage
      for
      another
      receiver.
      But
      if
      you #8217;re
      someone
      who
      is
      a
      playmaker
      like
      him
      and
      in
      one
      on
      one
      coverage,
      you
      better
      bet
      your
      ass
      Eli #8217;s
      gonna
      go
      your
      way
      100%
      of
      the
      time.

      To
      be
      fair,
      I #8217;m
      not
      sure
      Eli
      has
      a
      lot
      of
      faith
      in
      Engram
      based
      on
      his
      performance
      the
      last
      few
      games.
      Eli
      even
      avoided
      him
      in
      Week
      8
      choosing
      to
      go
      to
      a
      player
      in
      double
      coverage
      because
      of
      Engram
      not
      being
      able
      to
      hold
      onto
      it.
      Whether
      you
      want
      to
      agree
      with
      that
      decision
      or
      not
      is
      subjective
      for
      sure
      but
      I
      can
      understand
      the
      hesitance
      to
      go
      to
      him
      with
      how
      inconsistent
      he #8217;s
      been.

      25.
      Fianc #233;e
      and
      I
      stayed
      together
      at
      our
      parents #8217;
      houses
      and
      saved
      money
      for
      a
      down
      payment
      in
      lieu
      of
      renting.
      Best
      decision
      we
      ever
      made
      because
      rent
      is
      around
      what
      our
      mortgage
      is
      currently.
      Even
      if
      you
      tack
      on
      utilities
      we #8217;re
      still
      only
      paying
      a
      few
      hundred
      more
      a
      month
      than
      if
      we
      were
      to
      rent
      however
      we
      get
      all
      that
      sweet
      sweet
      equity
      when
      it
      comes
      time
      to
      sell
      and
      move
      on
      to
      our
      next
      house.

      Yikes.
      I
      live
      in
      Halfmoon
      and
      often
      take
      Fonda
      on
      my
      commute.
      Glad
      I
      decided
      just
      to
      take
      Route
      9
      instead
      this
      morning.
      I
      remember
      last
      year
      there
      was
      a
      moderate
      snowstorm
      and
      I
      almost
      got
      stuck
      on
      that
      hill.
      Not
      because
      my
      car
      couldn #8217;t
      handle
      it
      but
      because
      the
      idiot
      in
      front
      of
      me
      was
      going
      too
      slow
      and
      I
      almost
      lost
      traction
      a
      few
      times.
      Luckily
      I
      didn #8217;t
      slide
      back
      down.
      Knowledge
      of
      driving
      skills
      in
      ice
      and
      snow
      should
      be
      a
      mandatory
      requirement
      in
      drivers
      tests
      before

      I
      used
      to
      have
      a
      2009
      Hyundai
      Accent,
      but
      it
      never
      had
      a
      problem
      getting
      up
      that
      hill
      (or
      in
      snow,
      for
      that
      matter,
      with
      a
      few
      exceptions)
      other
      than
      that
      one
      time
      last
      year.
      So
      I
      do
      have
      heart,
      but
      only
      to
      an
      extent.
      The
      benefit
      of
      having
      such
      a
      small
      car
      is
      the
      tires
      are
      generally
      super
      thin,
      so
      they
      can
      typically
      just
      cut
      through
      unpacked
      snow.
      Also,
      when
      I
      say
       #8220;go
      fast #8221;,
      I
      don #8217;t
      mean
      the
      speed
      limit.
      You
      can
      get
      up
      Fonda
      doing
      25-30
      for
      the
      first
      part
      of
      that
      hill
      no
      problem
      and
      then
      slow
      it
      down
      to
      20
      the
      rest
      of
      the
      way.
      They
      guy
      I
      was
      behind
      didn #8217;t
      want
      to
      do
      more
      than
      10-15.
      Wayyyyyyy
      too
      slow.
      The
      key
      is
      to
      make
      sure
      you
      have
      enough
      traction
      and
      find
      a
      balance
      in
      speed
      so
      you
      don #8217;t
      slip
      but
      keep
      going.
      Sliding
      a
      little
      is
      expected,
      but
      don #8217;t
      freak
      out
      and
      slow
      down
      if
      you
      feel
      a
      little
      slip.
      You
      risk
      losing
      a
      ton
      on
      momentum
      and
      traction
      if
      you
      do
      that.
      Steer
      into
      the
      slide
      and
      give
      it
      a
      bit
      of
      gas
      to
      straighten
      yourself
      out
      and
      you
      should
      be
      good
      to
      go
      unless
      you
      hit
      ice
      in
      which
      case
      you #8217;re
      fucked
      either
      way
      lol.
      I
      ended
      up
      inheriting
      a
      Subaru
      Outback
      this
      summer,
      however,
      replacing
      my
      Accent.
      Dare
      I
      say
      I #8217;m
      actually
      looking
      forward
      to
      the
      snow
      this
      year
      because
      the
      things
      a
      beast
      in
      snow.
      Not
      that
      I
      plan
      on
      speeding
      or
      driving
      like
      an
      asshat
      but
      the
      extra
      grip
      is
      for
      sure
      welcome
      especially
      with
      where
      I
      commute.

      That #8217;s
      what
      Eli
      supporters
      have
      been
      saying
      all
      year.
      Not
      so
      much
      Eli
      (although
      he
      has
      had

      more
      of
      it
      is
      on

      for
      not
      giving
      him
      enough
      time
      to

      Look
      at
      that
      pass
      to
      Shepard
      on
      that
      last
      drive.
      Could #8217;ve
      stood
      there
      for
      another
      5
      seconds
      honestly.

      Yeah,
      but
      last
      week
      was
      especially
      bad.
      There
      were
      a
      few
      instances
      where
      the
      announcers

       #8220;comfort #8221;
      the
      Eagles
      defense
      in
      the
      first
      half.
      Usually
      I #8217;d
      agree
      with
      you
      but
      not
      last

      Noticed

      same
      thing
      that
      happened
      to
      the
      Bucs
      game.
      It #8217;s
      almost
      as
      if
      we
      didn #8217;t
      prepare

      of
      a

      switch.
      I
      put
      that
      one
      on

      for
      not

      both
      QBs
      if
      it #8217;s
      a

      possibility.
      Maybe
      they
      thought
      Sanchez
      would
      play
      the
      whole
      game
      barring

      but

      In
      every
      job
      I #8217;ve
      had,
      this
      is
      already
      the
      case.
      You
      are
      typically
      allowed
      three(ish)
      hours
      of
      paid
      leave
      to
      go
      vote
      and
      then
      return
      if
      you
      need
      it.
      The
      problem
      is
      no
      one
      ever
      uses
      it
      because
      elections
      (at
      least
      in
      NY)
      are
      held
      from
      6AM
      to
      9PM,
      and
      the
      vast
      majority
      of
      the
      working
      public
      do
      not
      work
      15
      hour
      days.

      Pretty
      sure
      in
      this
      case
      the
      media
      only
      got
      involved
      because
      the
      radio
      station
      banned
      the
      song,
      and
      then
      told
      everyone
      they
      banned
      it
      on
      air.
      I
      doubt
      you #8217;d
      have
      heard
      about
      it
      if
      they
      radio
      station
      didn #8217;t
      say
      anything
      and
      just
      chose
      not
      to
      play
      the
      song.
      I
      think
      this
      was
      more
      of
      a
      marketing
      move
      by
      the
      radio
      station
      to
      get
      more
      publicity/listeners.

      inaccuracy
      from
      our
      QB
      and
      when
      he
      was

      it
      was
      dropped
      I

      I #8217;m
      not

      he

      wrong
      with
      the
      offensive
      performance

      block
      a
      toddler
      from
      rushing
      them
      today.
      A

      old
      could #8217;ve
      called
      more
      imaginative
      plays
      on
      first
      down
      today.
      There

      a
      lot
      of
      things
      wrong
      with
      today #8217;s
      game
      and
      unfortunately,
      Eli
      will
      get
      most
      of
      the
      blame
      as

      than
      he
      probably
      deserves.

      IIRC
      the
      endlinks
      won #8217;t
      fit
      because
      of
      the
      spring
      bar
      placement
      for
      the
      oyster
      flex
      strap.
      Might
      have
      changed
      though
      but
      I
      doubt
      it.
      This
      watch
      is
      solely
      offered
      with
      oyster
      flex
      and
      it
      would
      seem
      silly
      for
      Rolex
      (who
      is
      historically
      against
      customization
      of
      an
      existing
      watch)
      to
      allow
      that.
      It #8217;s
      a
      shame,
      too,
      because
      this
      watch
      would
      look
      freaking
      bad
      ass
      on
      an
      all-rose-gold
      bracelet.

      Okay...I
      took
      up
      your

      see
      anything
       #8220;insanely

      that
      you
      would #8217;ve
      been
      banned
      for.
      In
      fact,
      most
      times
      you
      requested
      sources
      and
      in
      most
      cases
      you
      received
      them,
      with
      no

      Time
      management?
      Yes.
      Waste
      of
      a
      first
      time
      out
      in
      the
      second
      half.
      Defensive
      coaching?
      You
      bet
      your
      ass.
      No
      way
      in
      hell
      we
      should
      give
      up
      that
      many
      points
      in
      the
      second
      half.
      Offense
      coaching?
      You
      bet
      your
      ass.
      Shitty
      offensive
      play
      calling
      gave
      us
      no
      chance
      in
      the
      second
      half
      as
      Shurmur #8217;s
      adjustments
      prove
      terrible
      once
      again.
      So
      yeah,
      coaching
      was
      at
      fault
      for
      most
      of
      it.
      Missed
      PI
      on
      the
      last
      play
      didn #8217;t
      help
      but
      oh
      well.
      Shurmur
      has
      a
      lot
      to
      learn
      but
      a
      lot
      of
      today
      was
      on
      coaching.

      *second
      half
      offensive
      play
      calling
      I
      mentioned
      adjustments
      at
      the
      half
      were
      bad,
      figured
      that
      was
      implied.
      Our
      offense
      was
      diverse
      and
      unpredictable
      in
      the
      first
      half.
      In
      the
      second
      half
      it
      was
      lackluster
      and
      unproductive.
      So
      yes,
      second
      half
      offensive
      play
      calling
      was
      absolute
      horseshit.

      Tough

      be
      able
      to
      play
      well
      when

      line
      is
      essentially
      garbage.

      depresses
      me
      the

      OL
      has
      been

      and
      it #8217;s
      a

      it #8217;s
      only
      now
      being

      I
      actually
      like
      the
      change
      of
      play
      style
      as
      opposed
      to
      what
      Mario
      Party
      traditionally
      was.
      There #8217;s
      a
      lot
      more
      strategy
      involved
      now
      with
      where
      to
      position
      yourself
      and
      move
      depending
      on
      your
      roll,
      although
      the
      whole
       #8220;allies #8221;
      thing
      tends
      to
      be
      a
      bit
      overpowered
      imo.
      Still
      the
      most
      fun
      I #8217;ve
      had
      playing
      Mario
      Party
      (previous
      favorite
      game
      was
      MP
      6/7).

      It #8217;s
      Christmas
      man.
      I
      was
      with
      family
      doing
      stuff
      and.
      It
      near
      my
      phone.
      I
      don #8217;t
      have
      time
      to
      be
      on
      reddit
      24/7
      or
      anything.
      That
      being
      said,
      I
      appreciate
      the
      message
      but

      you
      actually
      link
      the
      comment
      itself
      to
      me?
      I #8217;m
      on
      mobile
      for
      the
      next
      few
      days

      can #8217;t
      really
      do
      much
      with
      the
      screenshot.
      Edit:
      I
      asked
      for
      the
      comment,
      not
      the

      notification

      So
      let

      get
      this
      straight,
      if
      we

      use
      the
      family

      so
      we
      both
      have
      access),
      the
      saves
      would
      be
      cloud
      saved
      for
      games
      that

      and
      therefore
      *could*
      be

      the
      way
      we
      want?

      I
      don #8217;t
      know
      why
      you #8217;re
      getting
      downvoted.
      The
      whole
      reason
      the
      WTC
      attacks
      (both
      in
      93
      and
      01)
      happened
      was
      because
      the
      Muslims
      in
      the
      Middle
      East
      wanted
      the
      Americans
      out
      of
      their
      part
      of
      the
      globe
      entirely.
      They
      wanted
      (and
      still
      probably
      want
      to)
      kill
      as
      many
      Americans
      as
      possible
      to
      force
      us
      to
      retreat.
      Saudi
      Arabia
      disguised
      themselves
      as
      a
      US
      ally
      while
      simultaneously
      funding
      Al
      Qaeda.
      They
      hate
      us
      over
      there,
      and
      honestly
      I #8217;d
      even
      argue
      having
      a
      friend
      in
      that
      region
      is
      relatively
      worthless.
      You
      can #8217;t
      fight
      an
      ideology
      war
      the
      same
      way
      you
      fight
      a
      physical
      war,
      because
      the
      more
      people
      you
      kill
      the
      more
      the
      people
      you #8217;re
      fighting
      against
      turn
      against
      you.

      just
      got
      mine
      this
      past
      week
      but
      now
      that
      I
      have
      a
      screen
      protector
      and
      case/extra
      power
      supply
      yes
      I
      plan
      on
      every
      day
      carrying
      my
      switch.
      Even
      if
      I
      don #8217;t
      play
      it
      every
      day
      on
      my
      lunch,
      I
      will
      still
      carry
      it.
      I
      didn #8217;t
      honestly
      expect
      to
      love
      it
      this
      much,
      but
      between
      Rocket
      League
      (main
      account
      is
      on
      Xbox)
      and
      Pok #233;mon
      I #8217;ve
      had
      a
      hard
      time
      actually
      putting
      it
      down.
      Can #8217;t
      wait
      to
      get
      Breath
      of
      the
      Wild
      and
      Mario
      Odyssey
      when
      I
      can
      afford
      them.

      Play
      calling
      this
      season
      has
      definitely
      been

      has
      been
      a

      Honestly?
      I
      have
      no
      idea.
      I
      know
      voice
      chat
      is
      only
      supported
      through
      the
      Nintendo
      app
      I
      think?
      I #8217;d
      rather
      use
      discord
      to
      be
      honest
      but
      I #8217;ve
      never
      actually
      used
      either
      for
      game
      chat
      so
      it #8217;ll
      be
      interesting
      to
      find
      out.

      I
      tend
      to
      agree.
      Maybe
      use
      a
      splitter?
      Idk.
      Still
      unsure
      why
      Nintendo
      failed
      to
      bake
      in
      a
      party
      system
      like
      on
      Xbox
      or
      PS.
      I
      honestly
      just
      find
      quick
      chat
      easier
      to
      use
      on
      the
      Switch
      because
      of
      this
      reason
      and
      just
      haven #8217;t
      looked
      too
      much
      else
      into
      it.
      I
      did
      search
      and
      it
      appears
      Rocket
      League
      doesn #8217;t
      support
      voice
      chat
      natively,
      so
      a
      headset/mic
      plugged
      directly
      into
      the
      Switch
      won #8217;t
      work.

      I
      think

      allows
      systematic
      abuse
      by
      any
      one
      particular

      I

      Does
      there
      have
      to
      be
      an
      example
      of
      something
      to
      have
      a
      legitimate
      concern
      over
      something?
      Should
      a
      preventative
      concern
      be
      just
      as
      important,
      especially
      when
      protecting
      the
      integrity
      of
      something
      like
      an
      election?
      Without
      looking
      at
      the
      law
      myself,
      and
      not
      being
      a
      lawyer,
      I
      can #8217;t
      confidently
      say
      there
      aren #8217;t
      loopholes
      that
      can
      be
      exploited.
      But
      maybe
      there
      are,
      maybe
      there
      aren #8217;t.
      Having
      a
      concern
      of
      them
      is
      just
      as
      valid
      with
      or
      without
      evidence.

      Hopefully
      you
      didn #8217;t
      make
      the
      same
      mistake
      I
      did.
      We
      don #8217;t
      have
      a
      long
      driveway
      (only
      2.5
      cars
      long
      and
      2
      cars
      wide)
      so
      I
      figured,
      sure
      I
      can
      shovel
      I
      don #8217;t
      need
      a
      snowblower.
      Boy
      was
      I
      wrong.
      I
      also
      forgot
      to
      take
      into
      account
      my
      neighbors
      driveway
      is
      about
      3
      feet
      from
      the
      one
      side
      of
      my
      driveway
      and
      the
      fact
      that
      my
      driveway
      has
      somewhat
      of
      a
      steeper
      incline
      than
      most.
      Shoveling
      my
      driveway,
      while
      doable,
      is
      insanely
      harder
      than
      any
      shoveling
      I
      had
      to
      do
      as
      a
      kid
      at
      my
      parents
      house
      with
      a
      flat
      and
      isolated
      driveway.
      I
      have
      a
      snowblower
      now.
      Lol.

      Don #8217;t
      let
      it
      pain
      you
      to
      say
      that.
      I #8217;ve
      always
      respected
      Romo
      as
      a
      player
      because
      even
      though
      he
      never
      had
      much
      postseason
      success,
      I
      always
      thought
      he
      was
      a
      better
      QB
      than
      people
      gave
      him
      credit
      for.
      Honestly
      thought
      he
      was
      always
      limited
      by
      Jason
      Garrett
      and
      Jerry
      Jones.
      Had
      he
      been
      on
      literally
      any
      other
      team
      with
      a
      halfway
      decent
      coaching
      staff
      and
      ownership
      he
      probably
      would #8217;ve
      won
      a
      super
      bowl.
      I
      also
      love
      Romo
      as
      an
      announcer.
      Now,
      Troy
      Aikman

      the
      other

      Thanksgiving
      to
      Valentines
      Day
      or
      something)
      and
      then
      periods
      in
      between
      with
      a
      ton
      of
      work
      that
      I
      don #8217;t
      always
      have
      time
      in
      the
      day
      to
      finish.
      YouTube
      keeps
      me
      sane
      during
      the
      slower
      periods
      where
      there
      isn #8217;t
      much
      work.

      That #8217;s
      one
      of
      the
      reasons
      I
      love
      Miller
      Lite.
      Regular
      cans,
      and
      also
      it
      doesn #8217;t
      scream
       #8220;I #8217;m
      on
      a
      diet #8221;
      like
      Mich
      Ultra
      or
      whatever.
      For
      the
      difference
      of
      half
      a
      gram
      of
      carbs
      per
      can,
      it #8217;s
      worth
      it
      to
      me.
      Plus
      I
      like
      the
      taste
      of
      Miller
      Lite
      better
      anyway.
      So
      that #8217;s
      just
      a
      bonus.

      From
      what
      I #8217;ve
      seen
      with
      my
      dad,
      there #8217;s
      definitely
      some
      sort
      of
      medical
      laxative
      taken
      to
      purge
      everything.
      However
      that
      was
      a
      few
      years
      ago
      and
      things
      may
      have
      changed,
      but
      still.

      I
      don #8217;t
      disagree,
      just
      pointing
      out
      there #8217;s
      more
      than
      just
      HVAC
      involved
      here.
      In
      the
      second
      pic
      OP
      posted
      there #8217;s
      also
      electrical
      fittings
      on
      the
      opposite
      side
      as
      well.
      If
      they
      remove
      the
      wall
      as
      long
      as
      the
      HVAC
      is
      a
       #8220;simple #8221;
      fix,
      I #8217;d
      integrate
      the
      electrical
      outlets
      and
      switches
      into
      the
      island
      and
      retain
      their
      functionality,
      but
      that #8217;s
      just
      me.
      I #8217;m
      always
      searching
      for
      extra
      outlets,
      especially
      in
      the
      kitchen.

      I
      think
      the
      floors
      look
      great
      OP.
      Before

      your
      decision
      though
      I #8217;d
      see
      them
      during

      day
      when
      that
      window
      allows
      in
      some
      natural
      light.
      Darker
      floors
      will
      make
      that
      room
      look
      darker
      though
      at

      so
      also

      I
      never
      cited
      Wikipedia.
      That #8217;s
      just
      bad
      practice,
      and
      I
      can #8217;t
      argue
      anyone
      should
      *ever*
      cite
      it.
      Wikipedia
      is
      basically
      just
      paraphrasing
      other
      sources
      to
      create
      a
      convenient
      place
      for
      all
      general
      information
      about
      any
      certain
      subject.
      What
      I
      did
      use
      Wikipedia
      for
      was
      the
      cited
      sources
      at
      the
      bottom
      of
      whatever
      article
      I
      was
      looking
      at.
      Those
      were
      incredibly
      useful
      and
      often
      saved
      my
      ass
      in
      high
      school/college.
      The
      cited
      sources
      should
      be
      the
      first
      place
      anyone
      goes
      when
      concerned
      about
      the
      validity
      of
      an
      article
      or
      premise
      they #8217;re
      researching.

      I

      but
      my
      body
      doesn #8217;t
      digest
      well
      after
      8pm,
      so
      that #8217;s
      how
      I
      started
      12-8.
      I
      tend
      to
      eat
      dinner
      between
      5-7
      so
      to
      be
      safe,
      I #8217;d
      probably
      keep
      the
      8pm
      end
      time
      and
      work
      my
      lunch
      to
      1pm
      and
      then
      eventually
      2pm.
      Most
      days
      I
      probably
      do
      6:18
      (lunch
      at
      12
      dinner
      around
      5:30)
      but
      I #8217;m
      not
      able
      to
      keep
      that
      dinner
      time
      consistent
      enough
      unfortunately.
      I
      also
      tend
      to
      skip
      lunch
      on
      the
      weekends
      because
      of
      working
      around
      the
      house,
      or
      errands
      or
      whatever
      so
      technically
      I
      am
      8:16
      M-F
      and
      1:23
      Saturday
      and

      I
      live
      in
      Clifton
      Park.
      I
      own
      a
      Subaru
      Outback,
      but
      at
      least
      I
      know
      how
      to
      drive
      in
      the
      snow.
      It
      baffles
      me
      seeing
      people
      go
      like
      70
      mph
      or
      tailgaiting
      others
      on
      787
      in
      the
      middle
      of
      a
      snow/ice
      storm.
      The
      Northway
      is
      no
      different.
      The
      biggest
      misconception
      with
      AWD
      I
      feel
      like
      is
      that
      it's
      only
      meant
      to
      help
      you
      get
      going/keep
      you
      going.
      It
      won't
      help
      you
      stop
      and
      it
      won't
      stop
      you
      from
      spinning
      out
      on
      pure
      ice.
      I
      honestly
      think
      if
      you
      live
      in
      a
      state
      which
      gets
      a
      moderate
      amount
      of
      snow
      per
      year,
      you
      should
      have
      to
      learn
      how
      to
      drive
      in
      the
      snow
      before
      you
      get
      your
      license.
      The
      guy
      was
      lucky;
      had
      he
      slammed
      into
      that
      guardrail,
      he
      may
      have
      been
      seriously
      injured
      because
      of
      how
      fast
      he
      was
      going.

      I #8217;d
      argue
      spares
      and
      pin
      count
      are
      more
      important.
      That
      8-
      could #8217;ve
      turned
      that
      210
      into
      a
      220
      easily.
      If
      OP
      makes
      that
      spare
      and
      his
      game
      is
      222.
      Sometimes
      strikes
      aren #8217;t
      falling
      every
      throw
      and
      you
      need
      to
      rely
      on
      spares
      to
      keep
      your
      scores
      up.
      Hell
      if
      you
      9/
      your
      way
      through
      the
      whole
      game
      it #8217;s
      a
      191,
      which
      isn #8217;t
      far
      off
      from
      this
      210.
      Also,
      congrats
      OP!
      I
      hope
      there
      are
      many
      more
      to
      come
      for
      you.

      Can
      someone
      please
      explain
      to
      me
      what
      all
      the
      hype
      is
      about
      Bridgewater?
      I
      saw
      his
      name
      thrown
      around
      a
      lot
      when
      people
      were
      calling
      for
      Eli #8217;s
      head
      this
      season.
      Here
      it
      is
      again.
      His
      entire
      career
      is
      littered
      with
      mediocrity
      and
      he
      has
      almost
      a
      1
      to
      1
      TD
      to
      INT
      ratio
      and
      has
      injury
      issues.
      What #8217;s
      the
      bright
      side
      to
      him?
      What #8217;s
      with
      the
      obsession?
      Look,
      I #8217;ll
      admit
      Foles
      and
      Flacco
      are
      more
       #8220;long
      term #8221;
      solutions
      at
      QB
      for
      any
      given
      team
      than
      Bridgewater
      but
      that #8217;s
      because
      those
      two
      QBs
      are,
      well,
      actual
      starting
      caliber
      QBs
      and
      in
      my
      opinion
      Bridgewater
      is
      at
      best
      a
      serviceable
      backup.

      One
      thing
      I #8217;ve
      noticed
      is
      to
      not
      tell
      whoever
      is
      offering
      me
      food
      what
      kind
      of
      diet
      you #8217;re
      on.
      For
      me
      it #8217;s
      a
      mix
      of
      Keto
      and
      zero
      carb,
      but
      I #8217;ve
      simplified
      it
      to
      just
       #8220;cutting
      back
      on
      carbs #8221;.
      It #8217;s
      so
      much
      easier
      than
      being
      judged
      on
      what
      I #8217;m
      trying
      to
      eat
      or
      not
      eat.
      My
      family
      knows
      and
      is
      great
      but
      friends
      and
      stuff
      just
      know
      I #8217;m
      eating
      less
      carbs
      so
      I
      may

      both
      types
      of
      straps
      though,
      one
      that
      works
      with
      the
      Rolex
      clasp
      and
      one
      with
      a
      traditional
      buckle.
      And
      yes,
      that #8217;s
      the
      dream:
      have
      a
      permanent
      model
      on
      rubber
      for
      the
      gym
      and
      a
      dressier
      one
      for
      day
      to
      day!

      Mine
      is
      a
      huge
      cuddle
      bug!
      She #8217;ll
      back
      herself
      right
      into
      you
      and
      curl
      up
      into
      a
      little
      ball
      if
      you
      start
      petting
      her.
      She #8217;s
      also
      a
      bed
      hog
      but
      loves
      sleeping
      against
      the
      backs
      of
      my
      legs.
      Oh
      and
      she
      loves
      giving
      kisses
      too.

      I
      think
      the
      key
      word
      here
      is
       #8220;generally #8221;.
      You
      cannot
      possibly
      claim
      that
      all
      right
      wing
      and
      religious
      people
      are
      more
      predisposed
      at
      committing
      murder
      simply
      because
      abortion
      clinics
      exist.
      That #8217;s
      ridiculous.
      It #8217;s
      the
      classic
      problem
      of
      extremism.
      Extremists
      (whether
      right,
      left,
      Islamic,
      etc.)
      get
      far
      more
      attention
      due
      to
      the
      nature
      of
      the
      crimes
      they
      commit.
      I #8217;d
      completely
      agree
      with
      OPs
      statement
      that
      the
      vast
      majority
      of
      right
      wing
      and
      religious
      people
      are
      non-violent,
      just
      like
      I #8217;d
      agree
      with
      the
      sentiment
      that
      the
      vast
      majority
      of
      left-wing
      people
      or
      Muslims
      are
      also
      non-violent.
      As
      an
      aside,
      I
      think
      the
      biggest
      issue
      causing
      this
      kind
      of
      rhetoric
      is
      essentially
      immortalizing
      people
      who
      commit
      heinous
      crimes
      through
      incessant
      media
      coverage.
      If
      these
      degenerates
      that
      go
      stab,
      shoot,
      or
      torture
      innocent
      civilians
      keep
      getting
      the
      kind
      of
      coverage
      they
      do,
      the
      epidemic
      won #8217;t
      stop.
      Yes,
      these
      things
      should
      be
      reported,
      but
      the
      coverage
      should
      be
      exponentially
      shorter
      than
      it
      is
      now.
      But
      that #8217;s
      just
      my
      own
      opinion.

      Fun
      fact:
      my
      first
      NASCAR
      race
      I
      attended
      was
      in
      Watkins
      Glen
      in
      August
      of
      2000.
      Steve
      Park
      won
      that
      race!
      I #8217;m
      a
      Jeff
      Gordon
      fan
      and
      unfortunately
      him
      and
      Earnhardt
      crashed
      early
      on
      but
      both
      their
      pit
      stalls
      were
      right
      in
      front
      of
      my
      seat
      so
      it
      was
      pretty
      cool
      to
      watch
      the
      teams
      work

      People
      act
      like
      Eli
      wouldn #8217;t
      have
      done
      shit
      this
      year
      when
      he
      had
      4300
      yards
      and
      a
      2:1
      TD
      to
      INT
      ratio
      behind
      the
      crap
      line
      he
      had.
      Now,
      if
      you #8217;d
      said
      we #8217;re
      a
      decent
      LB
      or
      DT
      away
      from
      a
      talented
      team
      I #8217;d
      agree
      entirely.
      The
      second
      half
      we
      scored
      like
      27
      or
      28
      a
      game
      basically
      but
      the
      defense
      allowed
      what...30ish?
      Can #8217;t
      win
      if
      your
      defense
      can #8217;t
      stop
      a
      piece
      of
      paper
      blowing
      in
      the
      wind.
      We #8217;re
      getting
      a
      QB
      this
      year
      but
      it #8217;s
      likely
      another
      2
      before
      we
      see
      him
      play.
      Eli
      will
      only
      be
      better
      this
      year
      behind
      a
      better
      line.
      He
      isn #8217;t
      getting
      younger
      and
      his
      time
      is
      coming
      quick
      but
      he
      isn #8217;t
      going
      anywhere
      that
      fast.
      I
      agree
      though
      trading
      OBJ
      after
      acquiring
      Zeitler
      just
      makes
      my
      brain
      hurt.
      I
      guess
      we #8217;re
      all
      in
      on
      hoping
      Saquon
      doesn #8217;t
      have
      a
      sophomore
      slump.

      The
      biggest
      problem
      imo
      with
      Obamacare
      was
      forcing
      people
      to
      pay
      a
      penalty
      if
      they
      couldn #8217;t
      afford
      health
      insurance.
      That
      penalty
      was
      so
      expensive
      it
      was
      actually
      cheaper
      to
      buy
      Obamacare.
      It
      effectively
      removed
      competition
      because
      it
      gave
      a
      definite
      amount
      for
      healthcare
      companies
      to
      charge
      premiums
      to
      while
      still
      being
      less
      than
      the
      penalty
      the
      IRS
      charged
      for
      not
      having
      12
      consecutive
      months
      of
      healthcare.
      Obamacare
      might
      have
      actually
      be
      decent
      if
      that
      penalty
      was
      never
      there,
      but
      we #8217;ll
      never
      know.
      My
      premiums
      went
      from
      roughly
      $50
      a
      month
      to
      $100
      a
      month
      after
      Obamacare
      went
      into
      effect.
      When
      I
      got
      married,
      it
      would #8217;ve
      gone
      from
      $100
      a
      month
      to
      $400

      This.
      Once
      you
      drop
      into
      Gold,
      it #8217;s
      tough
      to
      get
      back
      to
      Platinum.
      I
      haven #8217;t
      gotten
      back
      out
      of
      Gold
      3
      yet
      in
      2s
      after
      peaking
      at
      Plat
      3
      last
      season
      (drunk
      queued,
      dropped
      severely,
      and
      couldn #8217;t
      recover
      solo
      queueing).
      I #8217;m
      Plat
      3/Diamond
      1
      in
      3s
      and
      it
      only
      seems
      to
      take
      a
      few
      games
      to
      get
      back
      to
      where
      I
      was
      if
      I
      lose
      a
      rank
      or
      so
      at
      that
      level.
      Most
      players
      are
      competent
      and
      rotate
      well
      enough
      to
      where
      you
      can
      manage
      pretty
      easily
      it
      seems.
      At
      Gold,
      you
      miss
      one
      shot
      and
      they
      hit
      you
      with
      the
       #8220;What
      a
      save! #8221;,
      then
      proceed
      to
      own
      goal
      and
      leave
      the
      match
      leaving
      you
      with
      a
      1v2.
      Reporting
      helps
      but
      like
      you
      said
      the
      base
      of
      players
      like
      that
      seems
      to
      be
      exponentially
      growing.
      Lesson
      learned:
      don #8217;t

      Nice!
      I
      remember
      my
      first
      600.
      My
      next
      goal
      was
      a
      600
      where
      all
      three
      games
      were
      above
      200,
      then
      700,
      etc.
      Just
      don #8217;t
      get
      frustrated
      if
      you
      don #8217;t
      hit
      another
      one
      for
      a
      while,
      even
      if
      you
      come
      close!
      The
      worst
      thing
      you
      can
      do
      is
      let
      something
      like
      a
      580
      or
      590
      screw
      you
      up
      just
      because
      you
      missed
      a
      spare
      or
      didn #8217;t
      have
      a
      good
      fill
      in
      a
      frame
      or
      two.

      The
      last
      few
      days
      have
      been
      unreasonably
      tough
      it
      feels.
      I
      think
      I #8217;m
      more
      bipolar
      than
       #8220;fully #8221;
      depressed
      because
      I
      seem
      to
      have
      incredible
      mood
      swings
      every
      few
      weeks
      or
      so.
      I #8217;ll
      be
      alright
      then
      get
      depressed
      for
      a
      few
      days
      to
      a
      week
      or
      so
      then
      flip
      back
      slowly.
      However
      the
      last
      few
      days
      I #8217;ve
      felt
      the
      lowest
      I #8217;ve
      remembered
      feeling
      in
      a
      long
      time.
      I
      don #8217;t
      know
      how
      to
      describe
      it,
      other
      than
      incessant
      powerful
      waves
      of
      sadness
      and
      what
      feels
      like
      a
      massive
      weight
      over
      my
      upper
      body.
      I
      have
      no
      strength
      for
      anything.
      I
      usually
      can
      manage
      to
      smile
      and
      hide
      my
      lows
      but
      today
      at
      work
      I
      just
      slumped
      in
      my
      chair
      and
      was
      lucky
      no
      one
      really
      talked
      to
      me
      today.
      I
      keep
      realizing
      I #8217;m
      zoning
      out
      because
      I
      have
      no
      will
      to
      engage
      in
      daily
      activities
      that
      I
      usually
      find
      relative
      joy
      in.
      I
      just
      feel
      like
      a
      massive
      dark
      ominous
      cloud
      is
      hanging
      over
      me
      and
      there #8217;s
      no
      real
      end
      in
      the
      foreseeable
      future
      for
      this.
      Idk.
      I
      never
      really
      post
      about
      how
      I #8217;m
      feeling
      or
      whatever
      because
      I #8217;m
      so
      introverted.
      But
      this
      swing
      is
      so
      intense
      that
      I
      just
      feel
      like
      writing
      about
      it
      will
      make
      it
      seem...
      I #8217;m
      not
      sure.
      I
      just
      don #8217;t
      really
      know
      right
      now.
      It
      feels
      like
      I #8217;m
      slowly
      suffocating
      without
      any
      air
      in
      sight.
      That #8217;s
      all
      I
      guess.

      about
      it,
      so
      I
      figured
      I #8217;d
      let
      you
      all
      know.
      If
      someone
      has
      posted
      already
      about
      this,
      my

      It #8217;s
      new
      to
      the

      For

      reason,
      Fitbit
      did
      not

      I #8217;m

      I
      hate
      people
      that
      bring
      up
      the
      Titans
      game
      trying
      to
      prove
      Eli
      is
      done.
      It #8217;s
      like
      everyone
      just
      takes
      the
      stats
      and
      ignores
      the
      shitty
      downpouring
      and
      windy
      conditions
      in
      that
      game.
      The
      original
      game
      plan
      was
      to
      depend
      heavily
      on
      the
      run
      because
      of
      the
      weather.
      Then
      we
      had
      no
      run
      game
      because
      our
      offensive
      line
      couldn #8217;t
      open
      up
      a
      hole
      at
      all.
      So
      Eli
      was
      forced
      to
      throw
      it
      in
      terrible
      conditions.
      The
      Titans
      didn #8217;t
      even
      break
      100
      passing
      yards
      and
      just
      ran
      it
      down
      our
      throats
      the
      whole
      time.
      You
      can
      make
      arguments
      that
      Eli
      made
      poor
      decisions
      this
      past
      year
      but
      please
      stop
      using
      the
      Titans
      game
      as
      an
      example.

      I

      lucky
      enough
      a
      number
      of
      years
      ago
      to
      actually
      get
      a
      position
      within
      a
      State
      agency

      a
      result
      of
      taking
      this
      test.
      Don #8217;t
      know
      where
      I #8217;d
      be
      otherwise
      right

      Good
      luck
      everyone
      who
      took
      this
      test
      today!
      Don #8217;t
      give
      up
      either
      or
      get
      discouraged
      if
      you
      don #8217;t
      get
      canvasses
      or
      interviews
      even
      right
      away.
      Took
      my
      a
      year
      and
      a
      half
      to
      start
      getting
      canvass
      letters
      and
      then
      another
      6
      months
      for
      interviews
      and
      then
      *another*
      6
      months
      to
      actually
      get
      a
      position.
      Being
      patient
      was
      the
      hardest
      part
      of
      the
      whole
      process.

      they
      almost
      always
      extend
      it
      because
      they
      usually
      run
      these
      tests
      every
      3-4
      years
      since
      so
      many
      people
      take
      them.
      My
      eligibility
      was
      actually
      extended
      for
      two
      years
      IIRC.
      Then
      they
      announced
      the
      next
      PCO
      test
      a
      few
      months
      after
      I
      got
      my
      position
      lol.
      Even
      though
      I
      didn #8217;t
      need
      it
      my
      eligibility
      was
      3
      total
      years
      (instead
      of
      the
      four
      they
      said
      I
      was
      good
      for).
      I #8217;d
      actually
      expect
      the
      results
      in
      August.
      That #8217;s
      when
      I
      got
      mine
      but
      idk
      how
      many
      people
      took
      this
      test.

      You
      know,
      it #8217;s
      funny.
      I
      don #8217;t
      remember
      shaking
      or
      being
      nervous
      or
      whatever
      for
      my
      299.
      I
      remember
      after
      completely
      sucking
      though
      because
      the
      299
      was
      my
      first
      game
      that
      day.
      Don #8217;t
      even
      think
      I
      shot
      700
      lol.
      I
      think
      I
      remember
      being
      pissed
      the
      most
      because
      I
      pulled
      it
      a
      bit
      on
      the
      last
      throw
      and
      left
      a
      ringing
      4
      pin.
      Previous
      high
      was
      280
      (twice)
      so
      it #8217;s
      not
      like
      I
      was
      in
      that
      range
      often
      too
      lol.
      Congrats
      though!
      Seriously
      that #8217;s
      an
      incredible
      feat
      for
      anyone
      to
      hit!

      This
      is
      me
      but
      with
      twos.
      I #8217;m
      Plat
      3-D1
      in
      threes,
      but
      when
      it
      comes
      to
      twos
      I #8217;m
      anywhere
      from
      Gold
      2-Plat
      1.
      I
      can
      play
      with
      my
      friend
      who #8217;s
      D2
      in
      twos
      and
      we #8217;ll
      win
      most
      games
      or
      at
      least
      be
      competitive,
      but
      solo
      queueing
      I
      tend
      to
      drop
      my
      rank.
      I
      know
      I
      make
      mistakes
      in
      solo
      twos
      but
      I
      think
      my
      biggest
      problem
      is
      I
      assume
      teammates
      will
      rotate
      and
      at
      that
      level,
      they
      tend
      not
      to
      as
      consistently
      as
      higher
      levels.
      It
      tends
      to
      either
      put
      myself
      or
      my
      teammate
      out
      of
      position
      on
      challenges
      sometimes
      and
      that
      leads
      to
      goals
      for
      the
      other
      team.
      I #8217;m
      not
      blaming
      my
      solo
      queueing
      teammates,
      here,
      let #8217;s
      be
      clear
      with
      that.
      I #8217;m
      blaming
      myself
      because
      I
      know
      I
      should
      be
      more
      conservative
      with
      my
      rotations
      and
      challenges
      and
      shots
      when
      I
      solo
      queue
      due
      to
      my
      current
      rank
      (Gold
      3).
      Maybe
      one
      day
      I #8217;ll
      be
      able
      to
      adjust
      my
      mentality
      enough
      to
      get
      up
      to
      consistent
      Plat
      level
      play
      in
      solo
      twos.

      I
      would
      get
      it.
      I
      love
      getting
      as
      much
      natural
      light
      inside
      the
      car
      as
      possible.
      Since
      a
      panoramic
      isn #8217;t
      available
      (maybe
      on
      the
      2020...?
      One
      can
      hope),
      I #8217;d
      say
      it #8217;s
      still
      worth
      it.
      Even
      if
      you
      never
      open
      it,
      having
      the
      shade
      open
      just
      makes
      the
      car
      feel
      so
      much
      roomier
      and
      open,
      which
      I
      like.
      Maybe
      you
      should
      test
      drive
      both
      versions.
      See
      if
      you
      notice
      a
      big
      difference
      in
      headroom
      and
      if
      you
      do,
      don #8217;t
      get
      it.
      If
      you
      don #8217;t,
      I #8217;d
      say
      go
      for
      it
      and
      just
      leave
      the
      shade
      open.

      2010
      Outback
      owner
      here.
      Rear
      brakes
      lasted
      about
      60k
      miles.
      Fronts
      lasted
      about
      100k,
      but
      I
      pushed
      it
      to
      about
      103k
      and
      got
      it
      done
      with
      my
      belts.
      I
      was
      wondering
      the
      same
      thing.
      Maybe
      it
      has
      to
      do
      with
      the
      brake
      bias
      from
      Subaru?
      Fronts
      are
      more
      expensive
      than
      rears
      though
      and
      I
      don #8217;t
      notice
      any
      difficulty
      braking
      so
      I #8217;m
      fine
      just
      letting
      it
      go
      but
      you
      aren #8217;t
      the
      only
      one
      that
      thinks
      that
      is
      weird.

      to
      upgrade
      my
      2010
      Outbacks
      stock
      radio
      to
      a
      head
      unit
      with
      CarPlay/Android
      Auto.
      I
      have
      questions
      about
      the
      parking
      brake
      bypass
      and
      what
      effect
      it
      has
      on
      the
      head
      unit.
      I
      keep
      seeing
      posts
      on
      how
      to
      do
      it,
      but
      rarely
      I
      see
      posts
      on
      what
      benefits
      it
      gives
      you,
      or
      more
      specifically,
      what
      features
      are
      limited
      by
      the
      head
      unit
      if
      this
      is
      not
      done?
      Like,
      for
      example,
      if
      I
      (or
      we #8217;ll
      say
      my
      wife
      as
      a
      passenger)
      connects
      my
      phone
      to
      the
      head
      unit
      while
      I #8217;m
      driving
      to
      access
      Car
      Play,
      will
      the
      head
      unit
      not
      do
      it
      because
      I #8217;m
      driving
      or
      the
      car
      is
      in
      motion?
      I #8217;m
      looking
      at
      getting
      the
      Alpine
      ILX-W650
      if
      that
      helps.
      Thanks

      there

      They

      come
      in
      many
      different
      forms,
      such
      as
      the
      love
      of

      Yes!
      Well,
      maybe
      not
      this
      specifically,
      but
      I
      always
      enjoyed
      it
      when
      you
      could
      actually
      watch
      the
      race
      and
      then
      go
      buy
      the
      car
      the
      next
      day
      at
      a
      showroom.
      Like
      if
      I
      wanted
      to,
      in
      1970,
      I
      could
      go
      buy
      a
      Challenger
      and
      with
      the
      exception
      of
      things
      like
      window
      nets
      or
      roll
      cages
      etc,
      it
      would
      look
      exactly
      like
      it
      did
      on
      the
      track
      on
      Sunday.
      I
      get
      all
      the
      requirements
      and
      rules
      and
      safety
      involved
      with
      the
      current
      cars,
      but
      man
      would
      it
      be
      cool
      to
      see
      something
      like
      that
      again.

      Now
      that #8217;s
      not
      true.
      Guilderland,
      Colonie,
      Latham,
      etc
      are
      all
      very
      well
      off
      places.
      Schenectady
      is
      the
      only
       #8220;run
      down #8221;
      place
      I
      can
      think
      of
      immediately
      outside
      Albany
      and
      even
      then
      with
      the
      new
      casino
      they #8217;re
      really
      trying
      to
      invest
      in
      the
      city
      and
      build
      it
      back
      up.

      I
      guess
      I
      see
      your
      point.
      I
      wouldn #8217;t
      consider
      them
      run
      down
      but
      rather
      incredibly
      rural,
      but
      they #8217;re
      all
      weird
      in
      their
      own
      way
      which
      I
      admit.
      Certainly
      weird
      names
      too.
      It #8217;s
      crazy
      though
      how
      20
      minutes
      south,
      west
      or
      east
      of
      Albany
      you
      hit
      rural
      farmland.
      Like
      you
      wouldn #8217;t
      expect
      to
      see
      any
      of
      that
      driving
      down
      the
      Northway
      but
      once
      you
      go
      south
      of
      Albany
      it #8217;s
      like
      you
      drove
      straight
      into
      a
      different
      part
      of
      the
      country
      until
      you
      hit
      Westchester/Orange
      counties

      Yeah.
      Kinda
      sucks
      because
      I
      love
      it
      out
      in
      Stephentown
      or
      West
      Sand
      Lake
      or
      wherever
      because
      it #8217;s
      so
      scenic
      but
      there #8217;s
      just
      nothing
      at
      all
      within
      a
      half
      hour
      of
      your
      house
      if
      you
      live
      out
      there.
      So
      I #8217;m
      forced
      to
      live
      north
      of
      Albany
      just
      to
      have
      a
      house
      with
      relative
      privacy
      and
      close
      accommodations.

      This
      problem
      appears
      to
      be
      back
      again
      tonight.
      What #8217;s
      weird
      is
      CW
      normally
      streams
      but
      I
      guess
      they
      don #8217;t
      have
      the
      baseball
      rights?
      That
      seems
      really
      odd.
      I #8217;m
      a
      Royals
      fan,
      though,
      so
      I
      mainly
      watch
      them
      through
      At
      Bat.
      But
      since
      I
      live
      in
      Upstate
      NY
      I
      can #8217;t
      watch
      it
      today.
      Guess
      I
      won #8217;t
      be
      able
      to
      see
      them
      today.

      I
      think
      a
      lot
      of
      that
      was
      because
      he
      lost
      Evernham
      as
      his
      Crew
      Chief.
      Yeah
      he
      would #8217;ve
      won
      7
      championships
      under
      the
      old
      points
      system,
      but
      the
      fact
      that
      his
      crew
      chief #8217;s
      couldn #8217;t
      really
      adapt
      to
      the
      chase
      format
      proved
      fatal
      to
      his
      chances
      at
      a
      5th
      championship.
      I
      feel
      if

      That

      me
      too
      but
      that #8217;s
      an
      issue
      with
      the

      more
      than
      anything.
      It #8217;s
      like
      in
      2007
      where
      he
      was
      easily
      one
      of
      the

      week

      week

      with

      hydrated
      and
      have
      food
      before
      I
      smoke.
      After
      the
      first
      two
      or
      three
      I #8217;m
      fine

      No,
      because
      it #8217;s
      not
      stricter.
      It #8217;s
      enforcing
      laws
      that
      already
      exist.
      How
      is
      enforcing
      a
      law
      that #8217;s
      currently
      not
      being
      enforced
      stricter
      gun
      control?!
      That
      makes
      zero
      sense.
      It #8217;s
      already
      passed.
      So
      your
      solution
      is,
      what,
      to
      pass
      *more*
      laws
      that
      aren #8217;t
      enforced?
      What #8217;s
      the
      purpose?
      Maybe
      if
      laws
      and
      regulations
      were
      followed
      by
      various
      law
      enforcement
      agencies
      there
      would
      be
      less
      shootings.
      But
      sure,
      let #8217;s
      just
      blindly
      pass
      more
      laws
      just
      because
      it
      looks
      good
      on
      paper.

      is
      stricter

      have
      to

      I
      think
      the
      bigger
      issue
      is
      that
      Apple
      got
      complacent
      due
      to
      their
      lead
      in
      how
      well
      their
      software
      and
      hardware
      worked
      together.
      Now
      that
      Windows
      10
      does
      enough
      to
      be
      competitive
      to
      OSX
      on
      much
      cheaper
      hardware,
      it #8217;s
      tough
      to
      sell
      the
      benefits
      of
      picking
      a
      Mac
      over
      PC
      anymore.
      Personally
      I
      think
      it #8217;s
      just
      the
      advances
      in
      processing
      that #8217;s
      put
      Apple
      at
      the
      cliff #8217;s
      edge
      here.
      Back
      even
      ten
      years
      ago,
      the
      way
      Macs
      worked
      was
      so
      much
      better
      and
      more
      efficient
      due
      to
      the
      way
      the
      hardware
      and
      software
      were
      developed
      together.
      Now,
      with
      faster
      processing
      and
      larger
      RAM
      capacity
      available,
      Windows
      can
      work
      almost
      as
      fast
      and
      efficiently
      as
      OSX.
      I
      think
      Apple
      sees
      this
      trend
      and
      I
      agree
      that
      their
      focus
      is
      going
      to
      be
      on
      iOS
      for
      the
      next
      few
      years.
      I
      think
      if
      Apple
      is
      going
      to
      survive
      as
      well
      (or
      at
      least
      maintain
      their
      current
      market
      share),
      they #8217;re
      going
      to
      have
      to
      come
      out
      with
      a
      completely
      different
      OS
      for
      laptops
      and
      desktops.
      Maybe
      they #8217;ll
      figure
      out
      the
      issues
      Windows
      had
      with
      8
      and
      create
      a
      near-perfect
      mix
      of
      iOS
      and
      Mac
      OS
      that
      can
      run
      anything
      regardless
      of
      whatever
      device
      you #8217;re
      using.
      That
      seems
      to
      be
      the
      way
      they #8217;re
      going
      at
      least
      with
      natively
      run
      iOS
      apps
      and
      handoff.
      Who
      knows
      though.
      All
      I
      know
      is
      if
      my
      MacBook
      Air
      ever
      dies,
      I #8217;ll
      probably
      replace
      it
      with
      a
      Windows
      laptop
      because
      it #8217;s
      just
      cheaper
      and
      I
      can
      do
      almost
      everything
      I
      would
      ever
      need
      to
      on
      it.
      Unless
      Apple
      releases
      something
      revolutionary
      with
      either
      their
      hardware
      or
      software,
      that
      is.

      I
      had
      a

      with

      in
      the
      extra
      games
      modes
      for
      this
      one.
      It
      took
      12
      games
      to
      get
      5
      goals
      because
      all
      everyone
      did
      was
      chase
      and
      try
      to
      steal
      goals.
      Ended
      up
      getting
      all
      5
      in
      hoops
      because
      it
      was
      2v2
      and
      less
      chance
      of
      chasing/stealing

      That
      sucks,
      that #8217;s
      the
      mouse
      I #8217;d
      want
      to
      add
      too
      because
      it #8217;s
      the
      only
      Bluetooth
      mouse
      I
      own
      (other
      mice
      have
      USB
      adapters).
      Hope
      this
      gets
      fixed
      soon

      Man
      I

      it

      my
      local
      retro
      game

      In
      my
      2010
      Outback
      the
      PTY/CAT
      button
      controlled
      what
      selection
      of
      a
      certain
      category
      the
      radio
      would
      play.
      You
      need
      to
      pick
      a
      category
      with
      the
      1-6
      buttons
      at
      the
      bottom
      of
      the
      radio.
      You
      can
      pick
      between
      artists,
      songs,
      playlists,
      etc.
      and
      then
      pressing
      the
      PTY/CAT
      button
      after
      would
      allow
      you
      to
      use
      the
      tune
      knob
      to
      pick
      a
      playlist/artist/genre
      or
      whatever
      you
      have
      selected.
      If
      you
      shut
      the
      car
      off
      you
      would
      need
      to
      repress
      one
      of
      the
      1-6
      buttons
      to
      be
      able
      to
      re-access
      the
      different
      selections.

      Don #8217;t
      feel
      too
      bad
      OP.
      Sales
      is
      a
      tough
      career
      to
      pursue.
      May
      I
      give
      you
      some
      advice
      though?
      While
      you #8217;re
      working
      Uber
      or
      Lyft,
      do
      some
      serious
      reflecting
      on
      what
      you
      want
      to
      do
      with
      your
      life.
      While
      money
      is
      important,
      you
      shouldn #8217;t
      only
      be
      looking
      at
      jobs
      that
      pay
      enough
      to
      stay.
      I
      went
      through
      something
      similar
      to
      this
      actually
      when
      I
      worked
      for
      Time
      Warner
      Cable
      years
      ago.
      I
      was
      originally
      in
      sales
      and
      while
      I
      was
      good
      at
      it
      I
      was
      unhappy.
      I
      transitioned
      into
      a
      non-sales
      position
      and
      while
      I
      took
      about
      a
      $15k/year
      hit
      in
      salary,
      I
      was
      less
      stressed
      and
      overall
      happier.
      Even
      if
      it #8217;s
      going
      to
      school/back
      to
      school
      for
      a
      degree
      or
      something,
      you #8217;ll
      continue
      this
      somewhat
      toxic
      cycle
      of
      job
      hopping
      unless
      you
      can
      figure
      out
      what
      career
      you
      actually
      enjoy
      doing
      on
      a
      daily
      basis.
      Best
      of
      luck
      OP.

      If
      you
      turn
      on
      the
      classic
      drum
      fills
      for
      overdrive
      activation,
      you
      can
      play
      whatever
      you
      want
      in
      the
      measure
      before
      overdrive
      is
      activated.
      I
      do
      this
      and
      fill
      in
      whatever
      I
      feel
      like
      matches
      well
      with
      the
      song.
      You
      get
      a
      few
      times
      usually
      per
      song
      to
      do
      this.

      I
      think
      the
      bigger
      issue
      is
      that
      it #8217;s
      a
      slippery
      slope.
      If
      one
      law
      isn #8217;t
      enforced
      (legal
      vs.
      illegal
      immigration
      in
      this
      case),
      do
      other
      laws
      start
      to
      not
      get
      enforced
      because
      it
      isn #8217;t
      a
       #8220;big
      deal #8221;?
      I
      think
      of
      it
      like
      speeding.
      Sure,
      in
      most
      cases,
      nobody
      gets
      hurt,
      but
      the
      potential
      for
      someone
      getting
      hurts
      exists
      so
      it
      needs
      to
      be
      maintained.
      The
      same
      applies
      to
      immigration.
      In
      most
      cases,
      illegal
      immigrants
      cause
      no
      harm,
      contribute
      to
      society
      in
      one
      way
      or
      another,
      and
      are
      decent
      people.
      However,
      there
      will
      always
      be
      a
      few
      that
      are
      violent,
      so
      as
      a
      result
      immigrants
      need
      to
      be
      vetted
      properly
      before
      being
      allowed
      into
      the
      country.
      And,
      because
      I
      know
      I
      probably
      will
      be
      called
      a
      xenophobic
      bigot
      for
      this
      view,
      my
      wife
      is
      an
      immigrant
      fro
      Guatemala.
      She
      came
      here
      legally.

      I
      really
      heard

      that

      looks

      you

      Seen

      good
      things
      about
      it,
      but
      the
      engine
      just
      feels
      like
      it #8217;s
      underpowered
      for
      the
      size
      of
      the

      That #8217;s
      great
      to
      hear.
      I
      love
      that
      Subaru
      is
      bringing
      the
      turbo
      back
      for
      other
      vehicles.
      My

      would
      be
      for
      a
      brand
      new
      Forester
      STI.
      I #8217;d
      probably
      trade
      my
      2010
      outback
      for
      that!

      This
      was
      me
      yesterday.
      Had
      a
      long
      day
      from
      8am
      until
      about
      9pm
      of
      doing
      stuff
      either
      around
      the
      house
      or
      with
      my
      wife
      or
      whatever,
      and
      then
      right
      when
      I
      had
      some
      time
      to
      myself
      it #8217;s
      like
      a
      ball
      of
      tension
      or
      despair
      or
      something
      released
      in
      my
      chest
      and
      I
      felt
      like
      a
      total
      piece
      of
      shit,
      because
      why
      not?
      Nothing
      like
      already
      being
      tired
      and
      then
      having
      your
      mind
      decide
      it #8217;s
      a
      great
      time
      to
      micro
      analyze
      everything
      going
      wrong
      and
      everything
      that
      can
      or
      will
      go
      wrong.
      It #8217;s
      exhausting
      pretending
      to
      be
      okay.

      you

      (assuming

      a

      and
      not

      and
      have
      them
      replace
      it
      again,
      as
      it
      clearly
      wasn #8217;t
      done
      right
      the
      first

      This
      was
      me
      this
      afternoon.
      I
      hadn #8217;t
      folded
      or
      put
      away
      laundry
      in
      weeks
      and
      today
      I
      told
      myself
      I
      would
      do
      it
      regardless
      of
      how
      much
      energy
      or
      will
      I
      had.
      It
      had
      gotten
      to
      the
      point
      where
      the
      amount
      of
      clothes
      I
      had
      to
      fold
      and
      put
      away
      was
      honestly
      a
      bit
      overwhelming.
      Looking
      at
      my
      closet
      and
      bedroom
      floor
      after
      I
      was
      done
      gave
      me
      such
      a
      great
      feeling.

      Baker

      the

      was
      bad

      the

      Accidentally
      opened

      So
      yesterday
      I
      went
      to
      a
      concert
      with
      a
      friend.
      We
      were
      tailgating
      and
      having
      a
      few
      beers
      before
      going
      in.
      I
      had
      the
      set
      list
      saved
      as
      a
      playlist
      on
      my
      phone.
      I
      also
      have
      a
      playlist
      I
      basically
      exclusively
      listen
      to
      when
      I
      am
      worse
      than
      most
      days.
      I #8217;m
      also
      creative
      and
      came
      up
      with
      a
      super
      original
      title,
       #8220;Depressed #8221;.
      Well,
      she
      saw
      the
      playlist
      and
      kind
      of
      laughed
      a
      little.
      Instead
      of
      what
      I
      would
      usually
      do
      (laugh
      it
      off
      too,
      say
      it #8217;s
      a
      joke,
      etc.)
      I
      didn #8217;t
      hide
      from
      myself
      and
      my
      fears
      and
      just
      blurted
      out
      that
      I
      listen
      to
      it
      when
      I
      go
      through
      a
      really
      tough
      or
      low
      period
      of
      depression.
      I #8217;m
      not
      sure
      if
      it
      was
      the
      alcohol
      or
      what
      but
      I #8217;m
      *never*
      that
      candid
      with
      people
      I
      know
      about
      this.
      Regardless
      of
      how
      many
      times
      they
      say
      the
      stereotypical
      caring
      responses
      you
      usually
      get,
      in
      my
      experience
      I #8217;m
      treated
      differently
      and
      they
      slowly
      distance
      themselves
      from
      me.
      I
      now
      follow
      the
      rule
      that
      I
      must
      hide
      what
      I #8217;m
      going
      through
      from
      everyone
      at
      all
      costs
      to
      avoid
      losing
      whatever
      friends
      I
      have
      left.
      This
      time
      was
      different
      though.
      She
      just
      sat
      there
      and
      listened
      while
      I
      talked.
      She
      didn #8217;t
      try
      and
      comfort
      me,
      she
      just
      let
      me
      vent.
      We
      ended
      up
      going
      through
      most
      of
      my
      entire
      music
      library
      and
      continued
      drinking
      and
      talking
      about
      how
      certain
      songs
      made
      us
      feel
      or
      whatever.
      It
      was
      nice.
      It
      was
      really
      nice.
      We
      spent
      about
      three
      hours
      just
      talking
      about
      life
      and
      stuff,
      and
      ended
      up
      going
      into
      the
      show
      a
      little
      later
      than
      we
      originally
      wanted
      as
      a
      result.
      I #8217;ve
      honestly
      never
      had
      that
      experience
      before.
      Even
      when
      I
      first
      told
      my
      wife
      (then
      girlfriend)
      how
      I
      feel,
      she
      didn #8217;t
      kind
      of
      handle
      it
      the
      best
      and
      honestly
      hurt
      me
      a
      little
      by
      trying
      to
      tell
      me
      my
      life
      is
      generally
      pretty
      good
      and
      I
      have
      no
      reason
      not
      to
      be
      happy.
      I #8217;m
      sorry,
      it
      doesn #8217;t
      work
      like
      that.
      My
      wife
      is
      much
      better
      now
      and
      just
      lets
      me
      be
      when
      I #8217;m
      in
      a
      really
      low
      place,
      with
      the
      exception
      of
      making
      sure
      I #8217;m
      not
      a
      serious
      danger
      to
      myself.
      Long
      story
      short,
      I
      just
      wanted
      to
      say
      to
      those
      who
      are
      afraid
      to
      open
      up
      to
      others:
      don #8217;t
      stop
      trying.
      My
      experience
      last
      night
      proved
      that
      not
      everyone
      is
      judgmental
      and
      hurtful.
      There
      are
      people
      that
      legitimately
      care
      out
      there.

      Exhausting.
      Both
      physically
      and
      mentally.
      Sometimes
      I
      don #8217;t
      know
      if
      I #8217;ll
      be
      able
      to
      keep
      going
      at
      this
      pace,
      and
      it
      feels
      time
      just
      passes
      me
      by
      as
      I
      idly
      do
      nothing
      to
      make
      the
      most
      of
      it
      and
      I
      end
      up
      just
      existing.
      But,
      I
      wake
      up
      every
      day,
      so
      I
      have
      that
      going
      for
      me
      I
      guess.

      it
      was
      easier
      than
      deleting
      calendar
      entries
      and
      adding
      new
      classes.
      To
      each
      their
      own
      I
      guess
      but
      it
      worked
      for
      me.

      For
      what
      it #8217;s
      worth,
      my
      timing
      belt
      replacement
      for
      my
      2010
      Outback
      was
      around
      $600.
      I
      can #8217;t
      imagine
      a
      2009
      Outback
      costing
      significantly
      less
      or
      more
      than
      that.
      This
      was
      around
      done
      a
      few
      months
      ago.

      No,

      was

      Three

      Man
      that #8217;s
      when
      I
      went
      to
      bed.
      It
      was
      a
      blowout
      in
      the
      last
      preseason
      game
      of
      the
      summer
      and
      I
      was
      tired.
      If
      it
      were
      regular
      season
      I
      would #8217;ve
      watched
      the
      whole
      thing
      but
      I
      regret
      choosing
      sleep
      last
      night
      because
      it
      looked
      like
      one
      hell
      of
      a
      game.

      To
      be
      fair,
      changing
      a
      flat
      isn #8217;t
      as
      easy
      as
      it
      appears.
      Most
      mechanics
      think
      they #8217;re
      a
      pit
      crew
      member
      on
      a
      NASCAR
      team,
      and
      at
      least
      in
      my
      experience
      it #8217;s
      borderline
      impossible
      to
      loosen
      the
      lug
      nuts
      anymore.
      Thankfully
      I
      have
      access
      to
      an
      air
      impact
      wrench
      and
      torque
      wrench
      so
      I
      can
      loosen
      the
      lug
      nuts
      and
      then
      tighten/torque
      them
      properly,
      but
      not
      everyone
      has
      that
      luxury.
      YMMV,
      but
      just
      wanted
      to
      share
      a
      bit
      on
      that.

      I
      always
      have
      to
      retighten
      to
      the
      torque
      specs.
      The
      lug
      nuts
      are
      almost
      always
      over
      torqued.
      It #8217;s
      the
      same
      reason
      they
      tend
      to
      over
      inflate
      the
      tires
      -
      they #8217;d
      rather
      be
      safe
      than
      sorry
      (i.e.,
      loose
      lug
      nut,
      under
      inflated
      tire,
      etc.).
      Maybe
      in
      your
      area
      that
      isn #8217;t
      the
      case

      in
      upstate
      NY
      the
      mechanics
      are
      pretty
      shitty
      when
      it

      You #8217;re
      lucky.
      Worst
      experience
      I #8217;ve
      had
      was
      that
      a
      dedicated
      tire
      shop
      rotated
      my
      tires
      (free
      because
      that #8217;s
      where
      I
      bought
      the
      tires)
      only
      to
      strip
      a
      lug
      nut
      when
      retightenting
      it
      after.
      Claimed
      it
      was
      my
      dealer
      that
      did
      the
      inspection
      (impossible
      because
      it
      was
      a
      rear
      wheel
      with
      a
      drum
      brake
      when
      the
      inspection
      stated
      they
      pulled
      the
      front
      wheel),
      but
      whatever.
      Paid
      the
      $9
      they
      charged
      and
      moved
      on.
      Went
      back
      to
      rotate
      the
      tires
      again
      before
      I
      needed
      to
      service
      my
      car
      again,
      turns
      out
      they
      used
      the
      wrong
      thread
      lug
      nut
      last
      time.
      Had
      to
      replace
      the
      whole
      lug
      assembly
      to
      fix
      it.

      I
      actually
      learned
      this
      the
      hard
      way,
      I
      scratched
      my
      hybrid
      up
      fairly
      good
      last
      weekend.
      Took
      a
      swing
      and
      hit
      the
      ball,
      but
      didn #8217;t
      know
      there
      were
      rocks
      underneath
      the
      ground
      where
      my
      tee
      shot
      went
      (missed
      the
      fairway
      right
      and
      landed
      by
      some
      trees).
      That
      was
      super
      depressing,
      but
      it
      could #8217;ve
      been
      worse.
      The
      damage
      isn #8217;t
      terrible,
      but
      if
      it
      was
      an
      iron
      instead
      of
      a
      hybrid
      I #8217;d
      probably
      have
      to
      get
      a
      new
      club.

      Not
      great.
      I
      cut
      for
      the
      first
      time
      in
      8
      years.
      I
      have
      self
      harmed
      in
      between
      that
      time
      period,
      but
      it
      was
      pretty
      few
      and
      far
      between
      and
      mostly
      just
      scratching.
      On
      August
      30th
      I
      added
      two
      new
      scars
      to
      my
      left
      thigh.
      I
      hate
      myself
      for
      it
      and
      I
      am
      praying
      my
      wife
      doesn #8217;t
      find
      out
      because
      she #8217;d
      be
      so
      disappointed/angry
      with
      me.
      And
      yet
      I
      want
      to
      do
      add
      more.
