      This
      is
      my
      first
      attempt
      at
      making
      a
      csgo
      map,
      so
      as
      a
      warning,
      it
      will
      probably
      suck.
      I
      tried
      to
      go
      for
      something
      that's
      different
      from
      most
      other
      maps,
      and
      thinking
      back,
      that
      was
      probably
      not
      the
      best
      idea
      for
      a
      first
      map.
      but
      who
      knows,
      maybe
      it
      will
      actually
      be
      ok.
      Story
      and
      Theme:
      Terrorist
      are
      planning
      to
      bomb
      a
      historic
      castle
      somewhere
      in
      Europe.
      A
      group
      of
      Counter-Terrorists
      arrive
      on
      the
      scene
      to
      try
      and
      stop
      them.

      a

      I've
      already
      posted
      this
      here
      before,
      but
      it
      was
      in
      a
      very
      early
      stage,
      and
      I
      didn't
      get
      that
      much
      feedback
      on
      it.
      De_Soul
      takes
      place
      in
      a
      castle
      that
      is
      under
      construction
      to
      become
      a
      tourist
      destination.
      It
      has
      a
      rather
      unique
      layout
      with
      a
      good
      amount
      of
      vertical
      height.
      I
      don't
      really
      think
      it's
      that
      promising
      and
      I
      may
      move
      on
      soon.
      But
      who
      knows?

      Glass

      In
      my
      map,
      I
      have
      a
      1
      unit
      thick
      func_breakable
      with
      a
      glass
      material
      type.
      All
      the
      settings
      are
      default,
      I
      didn't
      change
      anything.
      But
      for
      some
      reason,
      it
      blocks
      tons
      of
      damage
      when
      I
      try
      to
      shoot
      through
      it.
      A
      body
      shot
      with
      an
      awp
      does
      only
      99
      damage.
      Once
      I
      break
      it,
      I
      can
      obviously
      shoot
      through
      the
      window
      like
      normal.
      But
      at
      the
      moment,
      the
      first
      shot
      can't
      kill,
      which
      needs
      to
      be
      fixed.
      Edit:
      I
      went
      and
      tested
      on
      Office,
      and
      apparently
      glass
      blocks
      tons
      of
      damage.
      I
      think
      that's
      pretty
      stupid
      and
      annoying,
      but
      I'll
      just
      have
      to
      deal
      with
      it.
      I'm
      just
      going
      to
      remove
      the
      glass
      in
      the
      windows
      and
      figure
      out
      a
      way
      to
      make
      the
      window
      look
      right
      even
      without
      glass.

      Why
      isn't
      Valve
      doing
      anything
      to
      Canals?

      Valve
      has
      kept
      Canals
      in
      the
      competitive
      map
      pool,
      so
      it
      seems
      they
      want
      people
      to
      play
      it.
      But
      in
      order
      to
      actually
      make
      more
      people
      want
      to
      play
      it,
      they
      need
      to
      make
      some
      actual
      updates
      to
      the
      map.
      Other
      Valve
      maps
      like
      Cobblestone
      and
      Overpass
      have
      had
      huge
      changes
      to
      their
      layouts,
      even
      just
      in
      their
      first
      few
      months.
      With
      Canals,
      if
      you
      ignore
      all
      the
      changes
      that
      are
      just
      decluttering
      or
      fixing
      exploits,
      Valve
      has
      only
      made
      3
      actual
      changes
      I
      can
      think
      of,
      and
      they
      weren't
      very
      big
      changes
      either.
      Canals
      has
      some
      big
      problems,
      but
      many
      of
      them
      can
      be
      fixed,
      Valve
      just
      needs
      to
      actually
      do
      something
      about
      it.

      De_Tiki
      is
      a
      defusal
      map
      set
      in
      a
      coastal
      american
      city,
      probably
      in
      Florida.
      I
      have
      made
      tons
      of
      changes
      since
      I
      last
      got
      feedback
      from
      a
      playtest,
      and
      I
      am
      pretty
      satisfied
      with
      the
      layout
      now.
      So
      I
      think
      it
      would
      be
      a
      good
      time
      to
      get
      some
      feedback
      before
      I
      move
      onto
      detailing.

      is

      map
      set
      in
      a
      coastal
      American
      city.
      I
      had
      a
      playtest
      of
      the
      map
      about
      a

      have

      lots

      changes
      to
      the
      map.
      B
      Site
      has
      had
      lots
      of
      major
      changes
      and
      will
      play
      very
      differently,
      while
      A
      Site
      has
      only
      had
      minor
      changes
      so
      far,
      mainly
      because
      most
      of
      the
      feedback
      I
      got
      was
      focused
      on
      Mid

      B
      Site.

      ##Requesting
      feedback
      on:
      Pretty
      much
      the
      whole
      layout,
      but
      I
      guess
      mainly:
      -B
      Site
      as
      there
      have
      been
      major
      changes
      and
      I'm
      not
      fully
      sure
      if
      they'll
      play
      well
      -Timings
      as
      those
      have
      been
      changed
      -If
      A
      Site
      needs
      bigger
      changes
      as
      well.
      I'm
      a
      bit
      worried
      A
      Site
      could
      potentially
      now
      be
      too
      hard
      for
      Ts
      compared
      to
      B
      Site.
      ##Known
      issues:
      -
      The
      radar
      isn't
      that
      great,
      doesn't
      show
      spawns
      and
      missing
      some
      details.
      I
      was
      just
      trying
      to
      get
      a
      working
      radar
      as
      there
      are
      many
      large
      experimental
      changes
      that
      could
      very
      likely
      be
      changed.

      Well,
      it #8217;s
      pretty
      quick
      and
      easy
      to
      do,
      I
      just
      kept
      forgetting
      about
      it
      before.
      I #8217;ll
      just
      try
      setting
      a
      daily
      reminder
      this
      time,
      so
      it
      shouldn #8217;t
      be
      hard.
      The
      only
      reason
      I
      should
      miss
      one
      is
      if
      I
      don #8217;t
      have
      internet.
      So
      if
      I
      go
      on
      a
      camping
      trip
      or
      something
      then
      I
      guess
      I
      could
      pm
      you
      beforehand,
      but
      that
      won #8217;t
      happen
      often.

      It's
      better
      designed
      and
      looks
      nicer
      than
      most
      State
      flags.
      The
      reason
      why
      some
      people
      wouldn't
      like
      it
      is
      because
      they
      think
      that,
      for
      whoever
      designed
      the
      flag,
      the
      best
      thing
      they
      could
      think
      of
      to
      represent
      the
      state
      was
      the
      fact
      that
      it's
      name
      started
      with
      a
      c.
      In
      my
      opinion,
      it's
      fine,
      because
      the
      colors
      actually
      have
      reasons
      behind
      them.
      Just
      like
      many
      flags
      (France,
      Germany,
      Russia,
      Mali,
      etc.),
      it
      uses
      the
      colors
      to
      represent
      the
      state
      and
      not
      the
      layout.
      If
      they
      were
      just
      random
      colors
      with
      no
      reason,
      though,
      I
      would
      absolutely
      hate
      that
      flag
      because
      of
      how
      it
      would
      not
      represent
      the
      state
      at
      all.

      After

      research,
      I

      /u/Hexidian

      in

      correct.

      I'm
      not
      the
      best
      at
      analyzing
      a
      layout
      as
      a
      whole,
      but
      I
      can
      definitely
      mention
      some
      more
      technical
      problems
      as
      well
      as
      smaller
      layout
      problems.
      First
      of
      all,
      the
      doors.
      You
      have
      a
      couple
      of
      openable
      doors
      in
      your
      map,
      but
      it's
      really
      hard
      for
      a
      new
      player
      to
      tell
      which
      ones
      are
      openable.
      I
      see
      that
      you
      made
      your
      openable
      doors
      grey,
      but
      that
      is
      literally
      the
      worst
      color
      to
      choose
      for
      that.
      I
      always
      recommend
      making
      openable
      doors
      a
      bright
      color,
      like
      Orange,
      Green,
      or
      Red,
      while
      your
      non-openable
      doors
      are
      grey
      or
      black.
      The
      train
      car
      at
      B
      makes
      lots
      of
      awkward
      narrow
      angles,
      I'd
      recommend
      closing
      some
      of
      them
      up.
      I
      also
      kind
      of
      feel
      like
      I
      should
      be
      able
      to
      walk
      into
      the
      train
      car
      without
      having
      to
      jump.
      The
      plant
      zone
      should
      be
      clearly
      marked
      on
      B
      Site,
      it's
      marked
      well
      on
      A
      Site,
      although
      you
      can
      plant
      outside
      the
      site.
      You
      simply
      need
      to
      move
      the
      trigger
      16
      units
      from
      the
      edge
      of
      the
      site
      to
      fix
      this
      problem.
      T
      Spawn
      is
      boring,
      I
      know
      it's
      pretty
      much
      the
      least
      important
      part
      of
      the
      map,
      and
      you
      probably
      just
      haven't
      worked
      on
      it
      much
      yet,
      but
      come
      on,
      it's
      just
      a
      large
      rectangle,
      spice
      it
      up!
      I
      do
      agree
      with
      some
      stuff
      other
      people
      said
      such
      as
      the
      fountain
      being
      bad.
      I
      personally
      wouldn't
      move
      away
      from
      a
      renovation
      theme,
      unless
      you
      can
      think
      of
      a
      better
      way
      to
      realistically
      block
      off
      an
      entire
      half
      of
      the
      station,
      and
      I
      do
      think
      the
      scaffolding
      is
      kind
      of
      cool
      too.
      But
      I
      definitely
      agree
      that
      there
      should
      be
      minimal
      boxes.
      I
      personally
      can't
      give
      much
      feedback
      without
      playing
      a
      game
      on
      it
      first,
      but
      it
      seems
      like
      it
      could
      be
      a
      good
      map,
      and
      you
      had
      great
      brushwork
      in
      a
      lot
      of
      areas.
      I
      would
      recommend,
      after
      making
      some
      changes,
      trying
      to
      submit
      this
      map
      for
      a
      playtest.
      You'd
      get
      much
      more
      useful
      feedback
      from
      a
      playtest.
      Good
      luck
      mapping!

      But
      instead
      of
      transporting
      them
      to
      a
      lava
      pit
      out
      of

      you
      made

      you

      they
      burn,
      relishing
      in
      their
      suffering.

      Yep,
      that #8217;s
      exactly
      why.
      /u/ibvar
      linked
      the
      video
      with
      sound,
      and
      /u/crissthefrog
      provided
      a
      translation
      as
      they
      spoke
      French.
      Before
      the
      lightning
      strikes
      they
      are
      talking
      about
      how
      cool
      the
      lightning
      was,
      so
      it #8217;s
      pretty
      clear
      they
      set
      up
      the
      camera
      to
      try
      to
      get

      But
      then
      the

      gets

      to
      see
      if

      crocodile

      reporting
      the
      death

      And
      so
      on,
      and
      so

      Basically,
      if

      the
      media,
      get

      at
      full
      price,
      $60
      just
      feels
      like
      too
      much
      for
      me.
      Yes,
      I
      know
      that
      due
      to
      inflation
      and
      other
      factors,
      AAA
      games
      should
      be
      selling
      at
      $90
      now,
      and
      that #8217;s
      why
      we
      get
      all
      those
      controversial
      microtransactions
      and
      launch
      day
      dlcs
      because
      they #8217;re
      often
      needed
      to
      make
      a
      profit.
      But
      even
      $60
      is
      too
      much
      for
      me.

      I
      wouldn #8217;t
      recommend
      it.
      It #8217;s
      fun
      at
      first
      but
      then
      it
      just
      gets
      tedious
      and
      frustrating.
      It #8217;s
      main
      problem:
      nothing
      ever
      changes.
      There
      are
      so
      many
      better
       #8216;rage
      games #8217;
      out
      there
      that
      actually
      have
      interesting
      challenges
      that
      change
      it
      up
      every
      once
      in
      a
      while,
      or
      at
      least
      have
      more
      charm.
      In
      Getting
      Over
      It,
      you
      spend
      the
      whole
      time
      climbing
      a
      pile
      of
      random
      objects
      and
      no
      interesting
      changes
      to
      the
      formula
      ever
      come
      up.
      I
      understand
      the
      point
      is
      the
      player #8217;s
      determination
      to
      keep
      pushing
      on
      to
      the
      end,
      even
      if
      it
      gets
      tedious
      and
      frustrating.
      But
      if
      you
      want
      that,
      why
      not
      just
      spend
      the
      time
      doing
      something
      that #8217;ll
      actually
      have
      an
      impact
      on
      your
      life
      when
      your
      finished,
      like
      making
      a
      project
      you #8217;ve
      always
      wanted
      to
      do
      but
      you
      never
      did
      because
      you
      thought
      it
      would
      be
      too
      hard.
      That
      would
      be
      a
      tough
      challenge,
      and
      it
      would
      honestly
      be
      much
      more
      fulfilling
      if
      you
      succeed
      at
      that
      then
      if
      you
      just
      finished
      the
      game.
      And
      if
      you
      really
      just
      want
      a
      difficult
      game
      that
      is
      an
      accomplishment
      to
      be
      able
      to
      say
      you
      beat,
      there
      are
      so
      many
      better
      ones
      out
      there.

      This
      looks
      really
      cool
      except
      it
      has
      lots
      of
      problems.
      For
      one,
      the
      windows
      should
      be
      breakable.
      Not
      a
      single
      window
      in
      the
      entire
      map
      breaks
      when
      you
      shoot
      it.
      They
      all
      should.
      wallbanging
      at
      enemies
      through
      glass
      is
      never
      fun.
      There
      is
      also
      a
      lot
      of
      areas
      where
      it
      feels
      like
      props
      just
      get
      in
      the
      way
      of
      gameplay.
      You
      should
      declutter
      some
      areas
      and
      fix
      up
      some
      awkward
      angles.
      Finally,
      the
      fence
      behind
      the
      chimney
      has
      tons
      of
      gaps
      in
      it
      and
      I
      hate
      when
      people
      do
      that
      sort
      of
      stuff
      in
      maps.
      Close
      up
      all
      those
      gaps.
      Those
      were
      the
      mains
      things
      I
      initially
      felt
      when
      I
      looked
      at
      the
      map.
      The
      map
      does
      look
      really
      cool
      though.
      I
      appreciate
      how
      you
      took
      the
      time
      to
      make
      some
      of
      your
      own
      custom
      stuff.

      I'd
      say,
      give
      the
      windows
      crossbars.
      This
      way
      you
      can
      break
      the
      glass
      but
      you
      wouldn't
      be
      able
      to
      jump
      through.
      And
      also
      make
      sure
      to
      make
      the
      crossbars
      non-solid
      so
      they
      don't
      block
      bullets,
      and
      then
      add
      clip
      brush
      so
      players
      can't
      jump
      through.

      the

      out

      I'm
      pretty
      sure
      it's
      just
      comparing
      0
      and
      0
      right
      now
      as
      it
      always
      picks
      randomly.

      I
      know
      it #8217;s
      probably
      a
      mistake,
      and
      other
      people
      in
      the
      comments
      are
      saying
      it
      would
      be
      better
      without
      her
      too.
      But
      I
      actually
      really
      like
      the
      red-haired
      girl
      on
      the
      top.
      It
      looks
      as
      if
      she
      is
      waiting
      for
      your
      friend
      on
      the
      right.
      It
      really
      adds
      to
      the
      picture
      imo.

      This
      is
      a
      great
      example
      of
      how
      most
      crashes
      are
      both
      driver #8217;s
      faults.
      In
      most
      cases
      of
      crashes,
      there
      is
      one
      driver
      who
      is
      drunk,
      tired,
      texting,
      etc.
      and
      they
      are
      obviously
      the
      one
      more
      at
      fault,
      but
      then
      there #8217;s
      another
      driver
      who
      wasn #8217;t
      paying
      enough
      attention,
      and
      wasn #8217;t
      aware
      enough
      to
      notice
      the
      other
      car
      and
      react
      in
      time.
      In
      almost
      every
      case,
      that
      second
      driver
      could
      have
      avoided
      it
      or
      at
      least
      lessened
      the
      impact
      if
      they
      had
      been
      more
      aware.
      The
      silver
      truck
      here
      is
      a
      driver
      that
      was
      aware
      enough
      to
      avoid
      the
      crash.
      Of
      course,
      I
      understand
      it #8217;s
      hard
      to
      be
      constantly
      aware
      when
      you #8217;re
      driving,
      as
      it
      can
      get
      tiring
      to
      keep
      that
      up
      for
      such
      a
      common
      task.
      But,
      if
      you
      want
      to
      be
      able
      to
      avoid
      those
       #8220;they
      came
      from
      nowhere #8221;
      crashes,
      that #8217;s
      what
      you
      do.

      I
      just
      looked
      at
      the
      Canals
      changes
      in
      game,
      and
      they
      all
      look
      pretty
      good,
      except
      [this](https://i.imgur.com/LYQIszp.jpg)
      cover
      they
      added
      at
      A
      seems

      it
      would
      be
      so
      awkward
      to
      play
      around.
      they
      need
      to
      at
      least
      remove
      the
      plants
      poking
      out
      of
      the
      top
      of
      the
      vases,
      and
      I'd
      honestly
      recommend
      just
      using
      a
      totally
      different
      model
      than
      those
      vases
      if
      they
      want
      to
      put
      cover
      there.

      Nah,
      I #8217;ll
      never
      be

      I #8217;m

      I

      much

      to

      I

      know
      the

      Could
      someone
      explain
      to
      me
      why
      BIG
      is
      eliminated
      and
      Fnatic
      moves
      on,
      if
      they
      both
      won
      1
      game
      out
      of
      2?
      Is
      it
      because
      BIG
      lost
      by
      more
      or
      something?

      Yeah,
      I
      probably
      should
      have
      written
       #8220;some
      Americans #8221;
      and
      not
      just
       #8220;Americans. #8221;
      Obviously
      not
      everyone
      did
      it.
      But
      a
      good
      few
      restaurants
      did
      actually
      change
      their
      menus
      to
      say
      that,

      I
      thought

      was

      Yeah,
      it's
      actually
      just
      a
      huge
      coincidence
      too.
      I
      didn't
      set
      a
      reminder
      or
      anything.
      I
      was
      checking
      what
      my
      top
      comments
      were,
      which
      isn't
      even
      something
      I
      do
      very
      often,
      and
      since
      I
      don't
      have
      that
      many
      comments
      with
      high
      karma
      that
      Colorado
      flag
      one
      was
      number
      10
      or
      something.
      Then
      I
      saw
      your
      reply
      saying
      happy
      cake
      day,
      and
      low
      and
      behold,
      there
      was
      a
      little
      cake
      right
      next
      to
      your
      username.
      It
      was
      perfect
      timing.

      There

      of

      Dr.
      Wu

      Harding
      get
      less

      and
      Ed
      Regis
      is
      completely

      Survivors
      towards
      the
      end
      are
      also
      very
      different.
      Gennaro
      and
      Muldoon
      survive
      in
      the
      book,
      but
      die
      in
      the
      movie.

      but
      survive
      in
      the
      movie.
      Lots
      of
      sequences
      in
      the
      book
      were
      also
      largely
      changed
      or
      completely
      removed.
      A
      major
      one
      that
      was
      removed
      was
      the
      river
      raft
      sequence
      in
      which
      the
      kids
      and
      Grant
      went
      into
      the
      pterosaur
      enclosure,
      and
      when
      they
      got
      chased
      by
      the
      T-Rex
      to
      a
      waterfall.
      These
      are
      just
      some
      of
      the
      changes,
      there
      are
      a
      good
      bit
      more.
      Personally,
      I
      like
      that
      they #8217;re
      so
      different.
      I #8217;d
      rather
      have
      2
      different,
      unique
      stories
      to
      see,
      rather
      than
      to
      just
      see
      the
      same
      story
      but
      in
      a
      new
      medium.

      Well
      I #8217;ve
      thoroughly
      researched
      it
      and
      can
      confirm
      that
      it
      is
      correct,
      but
      I

      Biggest
      release?
      I
      mean,
      I #8217;ll
      believe
      it,
      but
      for
      me
      I
      literally
      never
      heard
      anything
      about
      FC5
      until
      about
      a
      week
      after
      it
      came
      out.
      I
      mean,
      I #8217;ll
      believe
      other
      people #8217;s
      experiences
      were
      different,
      so
      that #8217;s
      why
      it
      did
      so
      well,
      but
      I #8217;m
      just
      surprised
      that
      I
      never
      heard
      about
      it.

      I
      mean,
      it
      literally
      takes
      10-20

      De_Tiki
      is
      a
      bomb
      defusal
      map
      set
      in
      a
      coastal
      American
      city,
      probably
      in
      Florida,
      but
      I
      haven't
      completely
      decided
      yet.
      Bomb
      Site
      A
      is
      set
      in
      a
      tiki
      bar
      restaurant,
      and
      Bomb
      Site
      B
      is
      set
      in
      a
      hotel
      lobby.
      After
      some
      feedback
      I
      got
      about
      a
      month
      ago,
      I
      have
      updated
      the
      map
      significantly,
      so
      I
      thought
      I'd
      get
      some
      feedback
      from
      Reddit.

      teams.
      are
      there
      not
      enough
      options,
      or
      are
      there
      too
      many
      that
      grenades
      could
      be

      ##Known
      Issues:
      -
      The
      overview
      isn't
      that
      great,
      I
      mainly
      just
      wanted
      to
      quickly
      get
      one
      that
      would
      work
      -
      There
      are
      no
      callouts
      as
      I
      had
      to
      redo
      the
      navmesh
      and
      didn't
      read
      callouts
      yet
      -
      In
      the
      overview
      in-game,
      A
      and
      B
      Site
      are
      switched,
      that'll
      be
      fixed
      when
      I
      add
      callouts.

      Thanks
      for
      the
      feedback!
      I
      can
      definitely
      implement
      some
      of
      that
      stuff.
      I
      did
      experiment
      with
      adding
      a
      faster
      way
      to
      get
      through
      the
      underpass
      route.
      However,
      I
      didn #8217;t
      like
      what
      I
      made,
      so
      I
      reverted
      it,
      but
      I
      can
      definitely
      try
      to
      experiment
      again.
      I
      added
      the
      window
      in
      A
      Connector
      mainly
      because,
      in
      a
      retake
      situation,
      the
      area
      underneath
      the
      ledge
      felt
      extremely
      annoying
      to
      deal
      with,
      and
      the
      window
      gives
      a
      simpler,
      clearer
      view
      in.
      I
      know
      extending
      the
      ledge
      straight
      down
      to
      the
      floor
      would
      remove
      the
      area
      directly
      underneath
      the
      ledge,
      but
      that
      wasn #8217;t
      the
      most
      annoying
      spot
      so
      it
      wouldn #8217;t
      fix
      that
      problem.
      The
      window
      was
      the
      best
      way
      I
      found
      to
      fix
      that
      problem
      after
      experimenting
      for
      a
      while,
      but
      maybe
      there #8217;s
      still
      a
      better
      choice,
      I #8217;ll
      see.
      Thanks
      for
      the
      feedback,
      it #8217;s
      always
      helpful.

      I
      really
      don't
      like
      the
      whole
      thing
      how
      Doctor
      Strange
      saw
      14
      million
      outcomes
      and
      only
      1
      where
      they
      win.
      First
      of
      all,
      that's
      really
      cliche,
      I've
      seen
      lots
      of
      books
      and
      movies
      with
      the
      whole
      "somebody
      can
      see
      into
      the
      future
      and
      there's
      only
      one
      chance
      to
      win"
      thing.
      It's
      a
      pretty
      lame
      way
      to
      show
      how
      hard
      the
      fight
      will
      be.
      The
      main
      thing
      I
      don't
      like
      is
      how
      they're
      obviously
      in
      the
      one
      winning
      timeline,
      and
      what
      that
      implies
      is
      that
      every
      little
      time
      they
      get
      close
      to
      beating
      Thanos
      but
      then
      just
      barely
      fail,
      they
      didn't
      actually
      get
      close
      at
      all,
      as
      that
      would
      be
      a
      losing
      timeline.
      This
      means
      that
      say,
      when
      Star-Lord
      punched
      Thanos,
      there
      was
      probably
      an
      alternate
      universe
      where
      he
      controlled
      his
      anger
      or
      someone
      held
      him
      back
      or
      something,
      but
      that
      would
      have
      been
      a
      losing
      timeline.
      So
      Star-Lord
      technically
      saved
      the
      universe
      by
      not
      controlling
      his
      anger
      and
      completely
      fucking
      up
      the
      fight.
      That's
      just
      stupid.
      Edit:
      Thought
      I
      should
      clarify,
      this
      isn #8217;t
      ruining
      the
      movie
      for
      me.
      I
      still
      thought
      it
      was
      great.
      I
      just
      personally
      didn #8217;t
      like
      this
      one
      bit.
      I
      always
      find
      more
      interesting
      discussions
      come
      up
      when
      I
      bring
      up
      something
      I
      don #8217;t
      like
      rather
      than
      all
      the
      things
      I
      do
      like,
      so
      I
      thought
      I
      would
      mention
      this.

      Yeah,
      he
      didn #8217;t
      come
      out
      of
      it
      acting
      as
      if
      he
      had
      lived
      through
      14
      million
      different
      lifetimes.
      I
      definitely
      wasn #8217;t
      disputing
      that.
      I #8217;ve
      just
      never
      liked
      the
      idea
      of
      there
      only
      being
      one
      possible
      winning
      future.
      And
      not
      just
      with
      this
      movie,
      I #8217;ve
      seen
      similar
      things
      in
      a
      surprising
      amount
      of
      other
      books
      and
      movies.
      Don #8217;t
      get
      me
      wrong,
      I
      still
      really
      enjoyed
      the
      movie
      though.

      Well
      I
      suppose
      it #8217;s
      technically
      not
      a
      reward,
      as
      it #8217;s
      more
      of
       #8220;not
      getting
      punished #8221;
      rather
      than
      a
      reward.
      But
      I
      would
      definitely
      say
      that
      by
      making
      the
      wrong
      choice
      and
      being
      put
      into
      a
      losing
      timeline,
      they,
      along
      the
      rest
      of
      the
      universe,
      would
      be
      getting
      punished.
      So
      if
      Star-Lord
      had
      done
      the
      seemingly
      better
      thing
      of
      controlling
      his
      anger,
      he #8217;d
      get
      punished
      for
      making
      the
      right
      choice.
      I
      know
      that #8217;s
      kind
      of
      what
      life
      can
      be
      like
      sometimes,
      but
      it #8217;s
      not
      like
      it #8217;s
      portrayed
      as
      having
      to
      make
      a
      tough
      choice.
      It #8217;s
      portrayed
      more
      as
      Star-Lord
      just
      fucking
      up.
      Again,
      I
      still
      really
      enjoyed
      the
      movie,
      I
      just
      like
      talking
      about
      stuff
      I
      didn #8217;t
      like
      as
      that
      causes
      more
      interesting
      conversations.

      Aw
      man,
      I
      own
      this
      map!
      It #8217;s
      really
      a
      really
      cool

      to

      stuff.

      other
      maps
      for
      that
      sort
      of
      stuff.
      I #8217;ll
      admit,
      it #8217;s
      a
      bit
      Western
      focused
      and
      I
      wish
      there
      had
      been
      more
      put
      into
      other
      parts
      of
      the
      world,
      I
      was
      especially
      dismayed
      by
      Oceania,
      but
      I
      still
      think
      that
      it #8217;s
      still
      a
      pretty
      fun
      and
      well
      made
      map.

      I
      have
      not
      read
      the
      infinity
      war
      comics,
      but
      I
      assume
      you #8217;re
      saying
      this
      was
      in
      them.
      Well,
      I
      guess
      that
      means
      that #8217;s
      one
      thing
      I
      don #8217;t
      like
      about
      the
      comics.
      I #8217;ve
      seen
      this
      sort
      of
       #8220;only
      1
      possible
      future
      where
      we
      win #8221;
      thing
      in
      multiple
      books
      and
      movies,
      and
      I #8217;ve
      just
      never
      liked
      the
      whole
      idea.
      I
      still
      really
      enjoyed
      the
      movie
      though,
      don #8217;t
      get
      me
      wrong.
      I
      just
      find
      interesting
      discussions
      come
      with
      mentioning
      something
      I
      didn #8217;t
      like
      rather
      than
      all
      the
      things
      I
      did
      like.

      I #8217;m
      pretty
      sure
      it #8217;s
      actually
      a
      somewhat
      old
      map
      that
      just
      gets
      republished
      with
      little
      to
      no
      changes.
      I
      own
      a
      copy
      of
      this
      map
      that
      has
      a
      much
      more
      recent

      however
      there

      It

      actually
      that

      I #8217;m
      awkward
      and
      shy
      and
      rarely
      ever
      talk
      to
      people,
      and
      when
      I
      do
      want
      to
      talk
      to
      someone,
      even
      if
      it #8217;s
      a
      friend,
      I
      spend
      such
      a
      long
      time
      thinking
      of
      what
      to
      say
      so
      that
      it
      doesn #8217;t
      sound
      stupid,
      that
      90%
      of
      the
      time,
      they #8217;re
      gone
      by
      the
      time
      I #8217;m
      ready
      to
      say
      something.
      Because
      of
      this,
      I
      often
      see
      people,
      awkwardly
      hover
      around
      them
      for
      a
      minute
      without
      saying
      anything,
      and
      then
      we
      leave.
      It
      really
      doesn #8217;t
      help
      the
      relationships
      between
      any
      of
      my
      friends
      and
      me.

      The
      thing
      is,
      Australia
      is
      not
      a
      member
      of
      the
      EBU.
      It
      is
      an
      associative
      member,
      which
      means
      it #8217;s
      not
      part
      of
      the
      European
      Broadcasting
      Area
      (Europe,
      the
      Caucuses,
      and
      every
      country
      on
      the
      coast
      of
      the
      Mediterranean).
      The
      logic
      as
      to
      why
      Australia
      is
      allowed
      in
      Eurovision
      is
      because
      it #8217;s
      been
      an
      associative
      member
      for
      a
      long
      time,
      over
      30
      years.
      This
      logic
      seems
      flimsy
      to
      me,
      and
      I
      worry
      that
      many
      other
      associative
      members
      will
      be
      invited
      in
      the
      future.
      I #8217;m
      perfectly
      fine
      with
      the
      countries
      around
      the
      Mediterranean
      to
      compete,
      but
      it
      doesn #8217;t
      really
      feel
      like
      EUROvision
      to
      me
      if
      countries
      like
      China,
      the
      USA,
      Brazil,
      or
      South
      Africa
      compete.
      I
      hope
      they
      stop
      with
      Australia.
      Now
      I
      do
      think
      a
      worldwide
      song
      contest
      sounds
      awesome,
      it
      just
      can #8217;t
      be
      called

      I
      looked

      the
      top
      5
      posts
      on
      that

      it
      seems
      some
      posts
      are
      legit
      and
      some
      are
      just
      jokes.
      Top
      post
      is
      a
      seemingly
      legit
      post
      about
      how
      to
      falsely
      accuse
      someone
      of
      being
      a
      sex
      offender
      to
      fuck
      with
      their
      life.
      It #8217;s
      kind
      of
      fucked
      up
      Second
      post
      is
      a
      not
      as
      extensive
      but
      still
      legit
      post
      about
      how
      if
      you
      get
      someone #8217;s
      password
      for
      one
      thing
      (such
      as
      Netflix)
      there #8217;s
      a
      good
      chance
      you
      can
      use
      that
      for
      bank
      accounts
      and
      other
      things
      Third
      post
      is
      essentially
      an
      SLPT
      about
      stabbing
      yourself
      to
      get
      away
      with
      drunk
      driving
      Fourth
      is
      a
      questionably
      legit
      post
      about
      how
      to
      hide
      from
      a
      police
      helicopter.
      And
      5th
      is
      another
      SLPT
      about
      starving
      your
      children.

      However,
      the
      gay
      parent
      would
      need
      100
      gay
      points
      to
      be
      gay,
      not
      just
      0.000...01.
      This
      would
      still
      result
      in
      a
      bisexual,
      50
      gay
      points
      child.
      Still
      the
      same
      result,
      but
      I
      believe
      it
      works
      somewhat
      differently.
      I
      believe
      that,
      like
      other
      genetic
      traits,
      sexuality
      is
      represented
      by
      2
      alleles,
      only
      one
      being
      passed
      to
      the
      child.
      These
      are
      co-dominant
      traits.
      The
      2
      alleles
      average
      out
      to
      result
      in
      the
      Gay
      Points
      of
      the
      person.
      I
      will
      use
      these
      letter
      to
      represent
      the
      alleles:
      G
      -
      100
      Gay
      Points
      S
      -
      0
      Gay
      Points
      B
      -
      50
      Gay
      Points
      These
      represent
      forms
      of
      sexualities:
      GG
      -
      100
      GP
      (gay)
      GB
      -
      75
      GP
      (Bisexual,
      leans
      to
      same
      sex)
      BB/GS
      -
      50
      GP
      (Bisexual,
      perfectly
      equal)
      SB
      -
      25
      GP
      (Bisexual,
      leans
      to
      other
      sex)
      SS
      -
      0
      GP
      (Straight)
      So
      this
      means
      some
      bisexual
      people
      with
      GB,
      GS,
      or
      SB
      still
      carry
      the
      gay
      or
      straight
      alleles,
      and
      can
      pass
      them
      on
      to
      offspring,
      so
      gay
      or
      straight
      people
      can
      come
      from
      2
      bisexual
      parents.
      However,
      they
      can
      also
      occur
      in
      a
      mutation.
      So
      to
      answer
      the
      original
      question,
      with
      a
      gay
      GG
      and
      a
      straight
      SS,
      one
      allele
      would
      be
      passed
      on
      from
      each,
      resulting
      in
      GS
      offspring,
      creating
      a
      perfectly
      bisexual
      child
      with
      50
      Gay
      Points.
      (Although
      a
      straight
      or
      gay
      child
      could
      come
      if
      a
      mutation
      occurs)

      Ok
      I #8217;d
      like
      to
      chime
      in
      on
      this
      stupid
      argument
      and
      just
      say
      that
      it #8217;s
      fine
      to
      call
      the
      Rex
      either
      a
      he
      or
      a
      she.
      The
      Rex
      is
      biologically
      female,
      so
      calling
      it
      she
      is
      justified.
      However,
      some
      of
      the
      dinosaurs,
      including
      the
      T
      Rexes,
      are
      referred
      to
      as
      males
      by
      the
      staff
      of
      the
      park,
      so
      I
      think
      saying
       #8220;his, #8221;
      like
      most
      of
      the
      characters
      in
      Jurassic
      Park
      would
      say,
      is
      justified.
      I
      do
      not
      agree
      with
      op
      though.
      That
      Rex
      is
      not
      biologically
      male.

      You
      should
      definitely
      join
      some
      sort
      of
      afterschool
      sport
      or
      club.
      They #8217;re
      great
      for
      making
      friends,
      and
      there
      should
      be
      at
      least
      one
      club
      you #8217;re
      interested
      in.
      Also,
      I #8217;m
      not
      sure
      how
      hard
      school
      is
      in
      India,
      but
      I #8217;ve
      heard
      from
      foreign
      students
      from
      Europe
      and
      China
      that
      classes
      are
      much
      easier
      here
      in
      the
      US.

      Not

      I

      paid

      Since
      you
      want
      people
      to
      sit
      with
      for
      lunch
      the
      first
      day,
      you #8217;re
      just
      going
      to
      need
      to
      introduce
      yourself
      and
      talk
      to
      some
      people
      in
      your
      classes.
      It
      should
      go
      fine.
      A
      great
      way
      to
      make
      more
      friends
      though,
      is
      to
      join
      an
      afterschool
      club/sport.
      During
      classes
      there
      might
      be
      work
      to
      do
      and
      you
      might
      have
      to
      be
      quiet.
      But
      in
      a
      club/sport
      people
      are
      more
      free
      to
      talk.
      Plus,
      everyone
      in
      the
      club
      should
      have
      a
      common
      interest
      with
      you
      (as
      long
      as
      you
      join
      something
      you #8217;re
      interested
      in).

      Last
      year
      my
      History
      teacher
      operated
      like
      this.
      I
      still
      sometimes
      worked
      on
      bigger
      assignments
      at
      home
      because
      I
      wanted
      to
      finish
      them
      faster,
      but
      there
      was
      always
      enough
      time
      given
      in
      class
      for
      everything.
      School
      for
      me
      is
      starting
      in
      about
      a
      week
      and
      I
      really
      hope
      I
      have
      some
      teachers
      with
      that
      same
      mindset.

      If
      it #8217;s
      someone
      you #8217;re
      close
      friends
      with,
      they
      likely
      know
      enough
      about
      you
      to
      know
      if
      they #8217;d
      want
      to
      go
      on
      a
      date,
      and
      what
      exactly
      you
      say
      wouldn #8217;t
      matter
      as
      much.
      The
      above
      would
      work
      fine.
      If
      it #8217;s
      somebody
      you
      don #8217;t
      know
      as
      well,
      I #8217;d
      say
      one
      of
      the
      most
      important
      things
      is
      confidence.
      Also
      I #8217;d
      drop
      the
       #8220;I
      really
      like
      you #8221;
      part
      for
      them.
      When
      it #8217;s
      a
      close
      friend
      that
      part
      helps
      establish
      that
      it #8217;s
      a
      date
      and
      you #8217;re
      not
      just
      asking
      them
      to
      hang
      out
      as
      friends,
      but
      with
      somebody
      you
      don #8217;t
      know
      as
      well,
      they
      can
      tell
      it #8217;s
      supposed
      to
      be
      a
      date
      without
      it,
      and
       #8220;I
      really
      like
      you #8221;
      could
      also
      come
      off
      as
      weird
      to
      them.

      I
      ran
      into
      a

      when
      my

      and
      it
      split

      There

      That
      sucks
      man.
      Same
      thing
      happened
      to
      me
      before.
      I
      asked
      one
      of
      my
      good
      friends
      out,
      she
      said
      yes,
      and
      later
      texted
      me
      saying
      she
      changed
      her
      mind.
      It
      sucks
      to
      receive
      a
      rejection
      when
      your
      not
      prepared
      for
      it
      and
      thought
      you
      succeeded
      already.
      Don #8217;t
      worry
      though,
      it
      will
      get
      better.
      I #8217;m
      completely
      over
      her
      now,
      and
      we #8217;re
      still
      really
      good
      friends
      too.
      It
      sounds
      like
      this
      Jess
      girl
      is
      probably
      going
      to
      want
      to
      continue
      being
      friends
      with
      you,
      so
      it
      should
      be
      fine.

      Yeah,
      I #8217;m
      not
      a
      big
      fan
      of
      social

      too.
      I
      don #8217;t
      use
      Snapchat,
      although
      I
      do
      still
      have
      it
      downloaded.
      And
      I
      limit
      my
      instagram
      to
      just
      being
      the
      few
      people
      that
      I
      care
      about
      enough
      to
      actually
      want
      to

      I

      my

      at
      school
      with
      the

      performance
      at

      It

      Aw
      man,
      canals
      was
      my
      favorite
      map.
      I
      tend
      to
      like
      maps
      with
      weirder,
      more
      unique
      layouts,
      and
      Valve
      had
      actually
      been
      making
      some
      good
      changes
      to
      canals
      as
      well.
      If
      they
      kept
      going,
      it
      could
      have
      potentially
      been
      turned
      into
      a
      pretty
      good
      map.

      remember
      anyone
      saying
      we
      had
      to
      use
      the
      Gregorian
      calendar.
      I
      vote
      we
      all
      switch
      to
      the
      [Julian
      calendar](https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/monthly.html?year=2018 amp;month=10 amp;country=23)
      just
      for
      today.

      Can
      confirm
      for
      the
      Gregorian
      calendar.
      It
      is
      actually
      Friday
      the
      13th
      on
      the
      Julian
      calendar
      though.
      So
      I
      guess
      it #8217;s
      kind
      of
      wrong?

      I'm
      fine
      with
      them
      not
      being
      able
      to
      buy
      them,
      as
      bots
      aren't
      supposed
      to
      be
      good.
      If
      they
      were
      good
      then
      people
      would
      kick
      players
      just
      to
      have
      bots.
      However,
      I
      do
      wish
      there
      was
      a
      way
      to
      change
      it
      for
      offline
      and
      private
      servers.
      I
      love
      editing
      the
      botprofile.db
      so
      I
      can
      play
      with
      bots
      that
      have
      good
      aim
      and
      actually
      buy
      good
      weapons,
      but
      I
      can
      never
      get
      them
      to
      buy
      defusers.
      Even
      setting
      their
      favorite
      weapon
      to
      the
      defuse
      kit
      doesn't
      work.
      It's
      really
      annoying,
      especially
      since
      with
      the
      way
      bots
      are
      programmed,
      they're
      already
      very
      t
      sided.
      Not
      being
      able
      to
      buy
      defuse
      kits
      doesn't
      help
      that
      balance.

      Well,
      first
      I
      looked
      at
      my
      own
      calendar
      to
      check
      the
      date,
      then
      I
      double
      checked
      using
      the
      calendar
      on
      my
      phone.
      After
      that,
      I
      searched
       #8220;what
      is
      the
      date? #8221;
      and
      saw
      that
      it
      was
      not
      Friday
      the
      13th,
      but
      Friday
      the
      21st.
      I
      also
      thought
      back
      to
      the
      day
      before
      and
      realized
      that
      it
      was
      not
      Thursday
      the
      12th
      then.
      Considering
      all
      of
      these
      sources,
      and
      the
      fact
      that
      both
      /u/GangControl
      and
      /u/Hexidian
      agreed
      with
      me,
      I
      concluded
      that
      I
      could
      confirm
      their
      assumptions.
      Although,
      somebody
      could
      quadruple
      check
      if
      they
      wanted,
      just
      to
      be
      sure.

      They
      were
      hilarious
      on

      and
      I
      think
      this
      new

      will
      be
      great
      too.
      They

      I
      believe
      are

      Well
      both
      our
      orchestra
      and
      band
      are
      really
      good
      and
      play
      great
      music,
      I #8217;m
      mainly
      just
      talking
      about
      how
      much
      more
      fun
      band
      is
      compared
      to
      orchestra.
      All
      the
      orchestra
      really
      gets
      to
      do
      is
      2
      concerts
      throughout
      the
      year
      that
      the
      band
      also
      gets
      to
      do.
      The
      band
      has
      pep
      band,
      marching,
      school
      trips
      every
      few
      years
      where
      they
      can
      play
      in
      places
      like
      Florida
      or
      California
      (orchestra
      can
      come
      but
      won #8217;t
      be
      playing),
      and
      then
      there #8217;s
      the
      Jazz
      Band,
      which
      most
      orchestra
      players
      wouldn #8217;t
      be
      able
      to
      participate
      in
      (Maybe
      a
      bass
      player,
      but
      we #8217;ve
      always
      used
      bass
      guitar).
      Also,
      the
      orchestra
      doesn #8217;t
      get
      any
      percussion,
      which
      is
      a
      real
      shame
      in
      my
      opinion.

      Yeah,
      the
      only
      way
      it
      could
      potentially
      work
      is
      if
      they
      waited
      a
      month
      or
      more
      after
      the
      break
      up
      to
      get
      together.
      But
      honestly,
      I
      still
      wouldn #8217;t
      do
      it
      unless
      it #8217;s
      super
      serious,
      and
      it
      doesn #8217;t
      really
      sound
      like
      that.
      Especially
      considering
      they
      haven #8217;t
      known
      each
      other
      for
      long.

      Our
      Spanish
      teacher
      graded
      us
      on
      the
      Spanish
      9
      rubric
      for
      our
      final
      (we #8217;re
      Spanish
      3).
      To
      get
      an
      A,
      you #8217;d
      have
      to
      be
      fluent
      in
      Spanish.
      The
      best
      students
      got
      Ds.
      Luckily
      it
      wasn #8217;t
      as
      many
      points
      as
      our
      other
      summatives,
      so
      I
      still
      managed
      an
      A
      overall,
      but
      I #8217;m
      sure
      it
      screwed
      some
      other
      people
      over.

      I
      had
      a
      big
      jazz
      band
      thing
      to
      play
      at
      today,
      which
      I
      played
      really
      well
      on,
      but
      I
      also
      had
      to
      sight
      read
      a
      bunch
      of
      music
      because
      the
      middle
      school
      jazz
      band's
      drummer
      was
      gone,
      so
      that
      was
      fun.
      However,
      school
      is
      cancelled
      tomorrow,
      so
      I
      am
      pretty
      happy
      about
      that.

      to
      use
      caps
      lock.
      It
      makes
      me
      very
      sad
      to
      have
      to
      do
      that
      though.

      Of
      course.
      I
      use
      right
      shift
      when
      I #8217;m
      capitalizing
      any

      on
      the
      left
      side
      of
      the
      keyboard.
      But
      it #8217;s
      kind
      of
      awkward
      to
      press
      both
      the

      shift
      and
      a
      key
      on
      the

      side,
      so
      I

      Good
      job
      getting
      the
      position!
      and
      good
      luck
      asking
      her
      out!
      I'm
      actually
      a
      percussionist
      too,
      so
      it's
      nice
      to
      see
      a
      fellow
      hitting
      things
      with
      stick
      guy
      do
      well.
      What
      specifically
      do
      you
      play
      in
      the
      marching
      band?

      Cool.
      My
      school
      doesn't
      have
      much
      of
      a
      marching
      band,
      so
      we
      sadly
      don't
      have
      a
      pit.
      I
      play
      the
      quad
      toms
      in
      the
      marching
      band,
      but
      I
      do
      more
      with
      the
      jazz
      and
      concert
      band.

      For
      multiple
      weeks,
      my
      voice
      has
      been
      terrible
      and
      I
      have
      not
      been
      able
      to
      sing
      very
      well
      at
      all.
      It
      started
      after
      recording
      clips
      for
      a
      school
      project
      in
      which
      I
      had
      to
      do
      some
      yelling.
      The
      next
      day
      I
      wasn #8217;t
      really
      able
      to
      sing
      well.
      It
      wasn #8217;t
      really
      a
      surprise
      to
      me
      and
      I
      thought
      that
      after
      a
      few
      days
      of
      rest
      it
      would
      all
      be
      better.
      It
      has
      been
      about
      2.5
      weeks
      now,
      and
      I
      still
      can #8217;t
      sing.
      Yesterday,
      I
      thought
      that
      I
      was
      maybe
      feeling
      better
      and
      tried
      to
      sing
      in
      choir.
      I
      was
      not
      yet
      ready
      to
      sing
      and
      I #8217;m
      really
      feeling
      like
      I #8217;ve
      set
      back
      most
      of
      the
      progress
      I #8217;ve
      made
      to
      heal
      my
      voice.
      I
      am
      attempting
      to
      not
      sing
      at
      all
      for
      this
      weekend,
      (and
      probably
      longer)
      and
      to
      limit
      talking
      but
      I #8217;m
      scared
      that
      won #8217;t
      be
      enough.
      I
      have
      a
      play
      coming
      up
      this
      next
      weekend.
      I
      don #8217;t
      sing
      in
      it
      but
      I
      will
      be
      required
      to
      use
      my
      voice
      in
      it
      and
      the
      rehearsal
      leading
      up
      to
      it,
      so
      I #8217;m
      not
      sure
      if
      I #8217;ll
      be
      able
      to
      rest
      my
      voice
      enough
      for
      the
      school
      musical
      auditions
      coming
      the
      week
      after
      in
      which
      I
      will
      have
      to
      sing.
      I #8217;m
      sure
      my
      choir
      teacher
      also
      will
      expect
      me
      to
      be
      able
      to
      sing
      soon.
      He
      will
      probably
      understand
      if
      I
      explain,
      but
      it #8217;s
      a
      serious
      problem
      if
      this
      persists
      for
      much
      longer.
      Is
      there
      anything
      that
      you
      would
      recommend
      to
      help
      me
      try
      to
      get
      my
      voice
      back?

      As
      a
      guy
      with
      female
      friends
      who
      I
      hug,
      I
      can
      say
      it #8217;s
      just
      that
      we #8217;re
      friends.
      We #8217;re
      comfortable
      with
      each
      other
      and
      I #8217;ve
      known
      them
      long
      enough
      to
      figure
      out
      if
      they
      enjoy
      hugs
      or
      not.
      The
      people
      you #8217;re
      seeing
      are
      probably
      like
      that.
      I
      doubt
      all
      these
      people
      are
      going
      around
      hugging
      strangers
      without
      permission.
      I
      would
      never
      do
      that.

      I

      know

      wasn #8217;t
      very
      popular,

      I
      found
      it
      incredibly

      and
      I
      think
      it
      can
      also
      make
      a
      rather
      competitive
      map
      as
      well.

      Winstrike
      bought

      they

      Oh
      come
      on
      that
      wasn #8217;t
      about
      sexism.
      If
      it
      was,
      then
      even
      once
      she
      started

      different,
      she #8217;d
      still
      be

      because
      she

      a
      woman.
      But
      she #8217;s
      actually
      accepted
      as
      soon
      as
      she
      starts
      acting
      like
      them.
      I
      think
      it #8217;s
      more
      just
      about
      accepting
      different
      types
      of
      personalities
      and
      that
      you
      shouldn #8217;t
      change
      who
      you
      are
      to
      try
      to
      fit
      in.
      Still
      think
      it #8217;s
      kind
      of
      dumb
      they
      were
      all
      white
      men
      though.

      It's
      literally
      just
      their
      name.
      The
      only
      slightly
      interesting
      thing
      is
      that
      the
      m
      and
      i
      are
      connected.
       #8203;
      The
      best
      logos
      would
      be
      able
      to
      represent
      the
      team
      without
      simply
      spelling
      out
      the
      name
      for
      everyone.
      And
      unlike
      all
      the
      other
      logos
      that
      have
      the
      names,
      like
      BIG,
      Winstrike,
      and
      NRG,
      nothing
      interesting
      is
      going
      on
      with
      MIBR's
      logo.

      I
      do
      know
      of
      that
      logo.
      It's
      a
      significant
      improvement.
      However,
      it
      is
      just
      the
      sticker
      design
      that
      MIBR
      submitted,
      and
      not
      their
      official
      logo.
      The
      MIBR
      logo
      is
      still
      just
      the
      plain
      text
      by
      itself,
      not
      the
      shield
      design
      that
      you
      see
      in
      game.
      However,
      I
      suppose
      in
      the
      context
      we're
      talking
      about,
      the
      guy
      playing
      pickems
      would
      see
      the
      sticker
      logo,
      not
      the
      official
      one.
      MIBR
      may
      have
      the
      worst
      logo
      in
      the
      whole
      major,
      but
      they
      don't
      have
      the
      worst
      sticker.

      people.
      Many

      told

      Man
      BIG
      sure
      got
      screwed
      with
      getting
      ENCE.
      I
      bet
      they

      could
      have
      beaten
      either
      NRG
      or
      complexity.
      I
      mean
      it #8217;s
      still
      kind
      of
      their
      fault
      for

      I #8217;m
      fine
      with
      it.

      Hey
      this
      is
      the
      second
      post
      in
      24
      hours.
      Maybe
      it
      can
      be
      undeadified.

      Wow,
      that
      is
      completely
      disgusting.
      I
      assume
      we #8217;re
      rooting
      for
      Astralis
      because
      Denmark
      has
      a
      higher
      percentage.
      9.15%
      is
      just
      way
      too
      low
      for
      the
      glory
      that
      is
      pineapple
      on
      pizza.

      Second
      Lucid
      Dream
      Had
      So
      Much
      Control

      My
      second
      lucid
      dream
      I #8217;ve
      had
      was
      really
      odd.
      My
      first
      lucid
      dream
      was
      a
      few
      months
      ago
      and
      it
      wasn #8217;t
      really
      much.
      I
      was
      in
      a
      regular
      dream
      then
      realized
      it
      might
      be
      a
      dream
      and
      looked
      at
      my
      hands
      to
      realize,
      yes
      it
      was.
      It
      lasted
      for
      about
      10
      seconds
      and
      I
      wasn #8217;t
      really
      able
      to
      do
      anything.
      Since
      then,
      I
      kind
      of
      stopped
      caring
      as
      much
      and
      stopped
      doing
      reality
      checks
      throughout
      the
      day.
      I
      thought
      that
      I #8217;d
      never
      have
      another
      lucid
      dream,
      but
      then
      last
      night,
      I
      did.
      This
      2nd
      one
      was
      very
      different
      from
      the
      first.
      It
      still
      only
      lasted
      a
      few
      minutes,
      which
      is
      longer,
      but
      still
      kind
      of
      short.
      However,
      I
      never
      needed
      to
      do
      any
      sort
      of
      reality
      check,
      I
      just
      instantaneously
      knew
      I
      was
      in
      a
      dream.
      And
      it
      wasn #8217;t
      even
      anything
      weird,
      I
      was
      just
      walking
      down
      some
      stairs
      into
      someone #8217;s
      basement,
      but
      I
      just
      knew
      it
      wasn #8217;t
      real.
      On
      top
      of
      that,
      I
      seemed
      to
      all
      of
      a
      sudden
      be
      a
      complete
      lucid
      dream
      pro.
      I
      could
      look
      at
      an
      object
      and
      just
      make
      it
      disappear,
      I
      could
      snap
      my
      fingers
      and
      the
      entire
      scenery
      would
      change
      to
      somewhere
      else.
      I
      hear
      a
      lot
      of
      people
      talk
      about
      not
      exactly
      having
      absolute
      control
      and
      having
      to
      use
      workarounds,
      but
      I
      seemed
      to
      be
      able
      to
      do
      whatever
      I
      wanted.
      I
      don #8217;t
      understand
      how
      exactly
      this
      happened,
      on
      only
      my
      second
      time,
      when
      I
      wasn #8217;t
      even
      trying
      to
      have
      one.
      It
      was
      just
      a
      really
      interesting
      experience,
      and
      I
      wanted
      to
      share.

      Who
      should
      you
      choose?
      I
      don #8217;t
      know,
      I
      can #8217;t
      answer
      that
      for
      you.
      I
      don #8217;t
      know
      these
      people,
      you
      have
      to
      make
      that
      decision.
      How
      long
      should
      you
      keep
      doing
      it?
      As
      short
      as
      possible.
      The
      longer
      you
      keep
      going
      through
      with
      this
      the
      worse
      it
      will
      end
      up.
      As
      hard
      as
      it
      may
      be,
      you #8217;re
      going
      to
      have
      to
      end
      it
      with
      at
      least
      1
      of
      them.
      I #8217;d
      say
      that
      you
      should
      think
      about
      them
      a
      lot,
      and
      figure
      out
      which
      one
      is
      a
      better
      person,
      and
      would
      be
      better
      for
      you.
      And
      don #8217;t
      just
      think
      about
      their
      good
      parts,
      think
      about
      their
      flaws,
      which
      you
      might
      be
      overlooking.
      And
      when
      you
      do
      choose,
      I #8217;d
      recommend
      explaining
      it
      all
      to
      them
      as
      there #8217;s
      a
      good
      chance
      they
      still
      might
      find
      out
      about
      it
      even
      if
      you
      don #8217;t
      tell
      them,
      which
      would
      be
      worse
      than
      if
      you
      just
      tell
      them.
      They
      might
      be
      kind
      of
      pissed
      off
      about
      it,
      and
      they #8217;d
      be
      completely
      justified
      in
      that.
      You
      made
      a
      really
      bad
      mistake.
      However,
      I
      think
      it
      will
      be
      better
      in
      the
      long
      run
      to
      tell
      the
      truth.
      You #8217;re
      in
      a
      bad
      situation,
      and
      you
      need
      to
      fix
      it
      as
      soon
      as
      possible.

      Also
      with
      counterstrike,
      there #8217;s
      a
      lot
      of
      systems
      in
      place
      which
      make
      sure
      that
      hackers
      are
      more
      likely
      to
      be
      put

      and

      players
      get
      put
      in
      separate
      servers.
      The

      is
      that
      a

      I
      wish
      I
      could
      get
      to
      a
      rank
      like
      that
      someday.
      My
      internet
      is
      really
      inconsistent,.
      So
      half
      of
      the
      time,
      it #8217;s
      below
      100
      ping
      and
      I
      can
      actually
      play,
      but
      the
      other
      half
      of
      the
      time,
      it #8217;s
      much
      higher
      and
      it #8217;s
      really
      hard
      to
      win
      any
      duels.
      I #8217;m
      currently
      gnm.
      I
      don #8217;t
      consider
      myself
      super
      amazing,
      but
      I
      do
      wonder
      if
      I
      would
      have
      a
      higher
      rank
      if
      my
      connection
      was
      better.

      I'll

      I
      watched
      the
      full
      video,
      it
      looked
      a
      lot
      better
      than
      that.
      You
      could
      actually
      make
      out
      the
      s
      on
      the
      second
      time.
      Also,
      if
      they
      were
      only
      Yale
      students
      holding
      the
      signs,
      then
      why
      would
      anyone
      not
      hold
      up
      their
      signs?
      The
      only
      Yale
      students
      seem
      to
      be
      the
      ones
      handing
      out
      the
      signs.
      It
      seems
      pretty
      legit
      to
      me.

      Hey
      I #8217;m
      gold
      nova,
      but
      my
      ping
      is
      about
      160
      on
      average,
      so
      I
      think
      that
      can
      balance
      it
      out.

      That #8217;s
      the
      thing
      though.
      Very
      few
      people
      will

      a
      book
      on

      access
      to
      all
      those
      other
      things.
      If
      you
      have
      a
      book
      with
      useful
      information,
      and
      no
      phone,
      you #8217;re
      stuck
      to
      reading
      that
      information
      and
      can #8217;t
      just
      close
      it
      and
      look
      at
      memes
      like
      you
      can
      with
      a

      Final
      Space
      is
      an
      animated
      show
      about
      a
      spaceman
      named
      Gary
      who
      befriends
      an
      alien
      he
      names
      Mooncake.
      It's
      a
      really
      good
      story
      and
      I
      also
      consider
      it
      really
      funny
      too.
       #8203;
      Hilda
      is
      a
      cute,
      animated
      tv
      show
      about
      a
      girl
      who
      lives
      in
      a
      world
      with
      many
      fantastic
      creatures.
      It's
      honestly
      just
      a
      pretty
      feel
      good
      time.
       #8203;
      Galavant
      is
      a
      musical
      comedy
      that
      follows
      a
      man
      named
      Galavant
      who
      is
      a
      run
      down
      hero
      that
      is
      called
      for
      one
      final
      mission.
      It
      has
      some
      really
      good
      music
      and
      is
      some
      fine
      humor
      as
      well.
       #8203;
      Daredevil
      is
      a
      really
      dark
      and
      serious
      show,
      and
      follows
      a
      blind
      lawyer
      named
      Tom
      Murdock
      who
      is
      also
      a
      masked
      vigilante,
      fighting
      crime.
      It
      has
      fantastic
      characters
      and
      the
      best
      fight
      scenes
      I
      have
      scene
      in
      any
      show
      or
      movie.
      However,
      it's
      not
      a
      comedy
      like
      the
      other
      shows.
       #8203;
      None
      of
      these
      shows
      are
      for
      everyone,
      which
      is
      why
      I
      gave
      multiple
      recommendations
      for
      you.

      Honestly
      though,
      Cache
      is
      being
      remade
      at
      the
      moment,
      so
      it
      being
      removed
      should
      have
      definitely
      been
      expected.
      Maybe
      not
      Vertigo
      replacing
      it,
      but
      definitely
      Cache
      being
      removed.

      I
      think
      the
      problem
      is
      that
      Valve
      doesn #8217;t
      own
      those
      maps,
      but
      they
      do
      own
      Vertigo.
      Valve
      probably
      wants
      to
      be
      able
      to
      keep
      the
      rights
      to
      the
      maps
      to
      themselves.
      This
      way,
      they
      have
      control
      over
      updates
      to
      the
      map,
      and
      the
      updates
      also
      won #8217;t
      take
      as
      long
      to
      happen.

      I

      it
      would
      be

      that
      that
      is
      where
      the
      bomb
      is

      the

      doesn #8217;t
      start
      there,
      you
      have
      to
      shoot
      it
      onto
      the
      site.
      I #8217;d
      see
      the
      cone
      and
      instantly
      decide
      to
      check
      there.

      It
      is
      really
      sad
      seeing
      all
      these
      arguments
      on
      twitter
      about
      cs
      vs
      cod.
      Can #8217;t
      we
      just
      be
      kind
      and
      welcoming
      to
      other
      esports
      and
      communities?
      It #8217;s
      especially
      a
      problem
      with
      our
      CS:GO
      community.
      I
      see
      people
      attacking
      all
      sorts
      of
      different
      esports
      all
      the
      time.
      Just
      think,
      if
      you
      believe
      that
      counter
      strike
      is
      the
      best
      esport,
      then
      why
      are
      you
      so
      insecure
      about
      it
      that
      you
      need
      to
      defend
      it
      so
      harshly?

      Thought
      that
      was
      dumb
      at
      first,
      but
      honestly
      he
      probably
      just
      has
      daughters
      and
      doesn #8217;t
      have
      sons,
      and
      he #8217;s
      mainly
      talking
      about
      himself.
      Still
      probably
      should
      have
      just
      said
      children,
      but
      it #8217;s
      excusable.
      The
      other
      stuff
      he
      said
      is
      dumb
      though.

      it
      all
      of
      the
      time
      when
      I
      was
      in

      since
      I #8217;ve
      ranked
      up
      higher
      I #8217;ve
      stopped
      seeing
      it,
      probably
      because
      nobody
      really
      falls
      for
      it
      higher
      than
      silver.
      Still
      see
      it
      in
      casual
      a
      lot
      though.

      But
      he
      does
      cameo
      in
      Endgame.
      It #8217;s
      his
      final
      one.
      Edit:
      nvm,
      reread
      your
      comment.
      I
      first
      read
      it
      as
      you
      have
      seen
      more
      marvel
      movies
      than
      times
      you
      have
      seen
      Stan
      Lee,
      but
      I
      understand
      what
      you
      mean
      now.
      :(

      I

      it #8217;s
      never

      I #8217;ve
      dropped

      Really?
      I
      have
      a
      much
      bigger
      problem
      with
      the
      game
      than
      the
      community.
      I
      remember
      years
      before
      Fortnite
      even
      came
      out,
      in
      2012,
      I
      read
      about
      it
      in
      a
      magazine
      and
      I
      was
      really
      intrigued.
      I
      loved
      the
      art
      style,
      the
      monsters
      were
      all
      incredibly
      cool,
      and
      the
      building
      mechanic
      looked
      awesome.
      They
      described
      it
      as
      some
      sort
      of
      weird
      combination
      of
      Minecraft,
      Gears
      of
      War,
      and
      TF2.
      Naturally,
      I
      was
      excited
      for
      it.
      Nothing
      much
      happened
      for
      a
      few
      years
      and
      I
      somewhat
      forgot
      about
      it,
      but
      then
      I
      found
      a
      video
      about
      it
      and
      I
      remembered.
      It
      looked
      amazing
      and
      then
      I
      began
      following
      it #8217;s
      development.
      Every
      new
      thing
      they
      added
      seemed
      amazing.
      Eventually,
      it
      came
      out
      in
      a
      closed
      beta.
      I
      got
      my
      hands
      on
      a
      key
      and
      I
      started
      playing.
      I
      had
      a
      lot
      of
      fun
      playing
      single
      player
      but
      I
      knew
      it
      would
      be
      better
      with
      friends,
      so
      I
      was
      excited
      for
      it
      to
      actually
      come
      out.
      When
      the
      closed
      beta
      ended,
      however,
      I
      no
      longer
      could
      play
      the
      game
      and
      would
      have
      to
      pay
      for
      it.
      This
      somewhat
      irked
      me
      as
      the
      game
      was
      supposed
      to
      end
      up
      being
      free.
      But
      eventually
      just
      accepted
      it
      and
      decided
      I #8217;d
      wait
      till
      they
      actually
      make
      it
      free.
      Then,
      PUBG
      came
      around,
      showing
      the
      success
      of
      Battle
      Royale,
      so
      a
      Battle
      Royale
      mode
      was
      added
      to
      Fortnite.
      Since
      this
      mode
      was
      free
      I
      obviously
      downloaded
      it
      and
      checked
      it
      out.
      Thought
      it
      was
      cool,
      at
      least
      better
      than
      PUBG,
      but
      didn #8217;t
      keep
      playing
      it
      as
      Battle
      Royale
      didn #8217;t
      interest
      me
      that
      much.
      I
      hoped
      it
      would
      get
      more
      popular
      than
      PUBG,
      as
      I
      didn #8217;t
      like
      that
      game,
      and
      Fortnite
      seemed
      like
      a
      pretty
      good
      game.
      Now
      that
      was
      true
      then,
      but
      after
      what
      Epic
      has
      done
      to
      it,
      it #8217;s
      hard
      to
      still
      call
      it
      a
      good
      game.
      The
      first
      thing
      they
      did
      was
      completely
      screw
      over
      the
      PvE
      community
      by
      making
      updates
      that
      benefited
      Battle
      Royale
      but
      made
      PvE
      absolutely
      terrible.
      They
      added
      dances
      which
      didn #8217;t
      give
      credit
      to
      any
      of
      the
      people
      they
      stole
      them
      from.
      They
      then
      screwed
      over
      anybody
      that
      wanted
      to
      play
      the
      game
      any
      bit
      competitively,
      by
      constantly
      adding
      crazy
      stuff
      that
      made
      games
      more
      luck
      than
      skill.
      Many
      of
      my
      friends
      who
      loved
      it
      before,
      I
      hear
      aren #8217;t
      even
      playing
      the
      game
      anymore,
      it #8217;s
      become
      that
      bad.
      And
      the
      PvE,
      the
      actually
      good
      part
      of
      the
      game
      that
      got
      me
      so
      into
      it
      in
      the
      first
      place,
      has
      been
      completely
      ignored
      by
      the
      developers,
      and
      still
      costs
      money,
      even
      though
      it
      was
      supposed
      to
      be
      free
      since
      the
      beginning,
      and
      they
      gain
      enough
      revenue
      just
      from
      the
      Battle
      Royale
      to
      allow
      it
      to
      be
      free
      too.
      I
      don #8217;t
      have
      a
      problem
      with
      the
      community,
      it #8217;s
      the
      developers
      who
      ruined
      their
      game
      I
      don #8217;t
      like.
      I
      should
      not
      have
      wasted
      my
      time
      typing
      this.
      TL;DR:
      Fortnite
      used
      to
      be
      a
      good
      game,
      but
      Epic
      ruined
      it

      Jennifer.
      She

      to

      In

      things
      don #8217;t

      I

      the

      from
      my
      iPhone.

      I
      mean
      Tetris
      was
      pretty
      much
      cheating
      anyways,
      so
      Minecraft
      was
      always
      #1
      to
      me.
      They
      lumped
      so
      many
      versions
      together,
      even
      ones
      that
      are
      far
      different
      games.
      Sure,
      Minecraft
      combined
      multiple
      versions
      together
      too,
      but
      I #8217;d
      argue
      that
      they #8217;re
      close
      enough
      to
      be
      called
      the
      same
      game,
      while
      the
      games
      like
      the
      original
      Tetris,
      and
      Tetris
      Effect
      definitely
      can #8217;t
      be
      called
      the
      same
      game.

      Do
      you
      have
      malwarebytes?
      [This](https://reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/brgvlw/i_finally_fixed_my_csgo_game_freezes_fps_drops_it/)
      was
      posted
      somewhat
      recently
      as
      a
      solution
      to
      lag
      in
      csgo,
      but
      when
      I
      tried
      it
      out
      it
      actually
      also
      fixed
      the
      pure
      server
      errors
      I
      had
      been
      having.
      Of
      course,
      this
      may
      not
      be
      your
      problem.
      It
      could
      be
      caused
      by
      anything
      that
      could
      possibly
      be
      messing
      with
      your
      files.
      But
      it #8217;s
      worth
      a
      try
      if
      you
      have
      malwarebytes.

      Due
      to
      the
      various
      incidents
      on
      Tuesday,
      we
      have
      decided
      to
      change
      some
      rules
      for
      the
      2020
      annual
      egg
      fight.
      1.
      You
      may
      no
      longer
      eat
      a
      raw
      egg
      to
      rejoin
      the
      fight
      after
      being
      eliminated.
      2.
      The
      grocery
      store
      on
      7th
      street
      is
      no
      longer
      in
      the
      playable
      area
      (sorry
      Susan).
      3.
      All
      eggs
      must
      be
      unfertilized.
      These
      are
      all
      of
      the
      rule
      changes
      that
      have
      been
      decided
      on
      so
      far.
      Everything
      not
      mentioned
      will
      still
      be
      the
      same.
      Thank
      you!

      Possibly.
      These
      were
      the
      obvious
      changes
      after
      recent
      events.
      More
      changes
      will
      take
      a
      bit
      more
      thought
      to
      decide
      if
      they
      should
      be
      made
      or
      not.
      Of
      course,
      if
      you
      have
      an
      idea,
      just
      tell
      us!
      If
      you
      remember
      last
      year,
      Derek
      had
      some
      of

      best
      ideas.

      They
      are
      actually
      trying
      to
      switch
      to
      plant
      based
      plastic
      rather
      than

      Still
      not
      biodegradable
      as
      they
      want

      2010s
      people
      too.
      If
      we
      want
      something
      that
      will
      always
      have
      people
      we
      grew
      up
      with,
      then
      something
      like
      r/teenagers2000
      will
      be
      better.

      Yeah
      I
      know.
      I #8217;d
      honestly
      be
      interested
      in
      what
      future
      generations
      are
      like
      anyways.

      The
      wording
      on
      the
      question
      should
      be
      changed
      though.
      It
      should
      ask
      something
      along
      the
      lines
      of
       #8220;What
      is
      your
      biological
      sex? #8221;
      It #8217;s
      completely
      understandable
      that
      say,
      a
      trans
      man,
      would
      select
      male
      even
      though
      they #8217;re
      biologically
      female.
      It
      might
      not
      immediately
      pop
      into
      their
      head
      that
      they
      should
      select
      what
      they
      were
      born
      as.

      **DE\_SLAM**
       #8203;
      **Theming/Story**:
      de\_slam
      is
      a
      5v5
      competitive
      defusal
      map
      that
      takes
      place
      in
      a
      fun
      zone
      that
      contains
      an
      arcade,
      mini
      golf,
      bumper
      cars,
      laser
      tag,
      and
      more.
      The
      Terrorists,
      passionate
      mini
      golf
      players,
      are
      angry
      that
      one
      of
      the
      holes
      in
      the
      mini
      golf
      course
      is
      largely
      based
      on
      luck,
      so
      naturally,
      they
      want
      to
      blow
      it
      up.
      However,
      they
      also
      remembered
      how
      the
      laser
      tag
      arena
      isn't
      symmetrical,
      which
      gave
      them
      a
      significant
      disadvantage
      the
      last
      time
      they
      played,
      so
      they
      want
      to
      blow
      that
      up
      too.
      Naturally,
      they
      plan
      their
      attack
      after
      work
      hours
      as
      to
      not
      hurt
      anyone,
      but
      of
      course,
      the
      Counter-Terrorists
      come
      in
      to
      ruin
      that.
      The
      Counter-Terrorists
      played
      on
      the
      other
      team
      of
      laser
      tag,
      and
      had
      a
      huge
      advantage,
      making
      them
      want
      to
      save
      it.
      While
      they're
      at
      it,
      they
      might
      as
      well
      protect
      the
      mini
      golf
      course
      as
      well.
      Now
      the
      Terrorists
      only
      have
      time
      to
      blow
      up
      one
      of
      the
      2
      sites.
      Which
      will
      they
      choose?
      Can
      they
      succeed?
      Who
      will
      still
      be
      alive
      to
      play
      in
      the
      arcade
      afterwards?
      Find
      out
      by
      playing
      de\_slam
      today.
       #8203;
      I've
      worked
      on
      this
      map
      for
      about
      a
      month
      now,
      and
      I
      think
      it
      is
      ready
      to
      receive
      some
      feedback.
       #8203;
      **Feedback
      Requested:**
      \-
      Layout
      \-
      Balance
      \-
      Timings
      \-
      Grenade
      options.
      I'm
      planning
      on
      maybe
      adding
      skylights
      in
      A
      Site
      and
      CT
      Spawn
      to
      allow
      nades
      to
      and
      from
      those
      areas.
      However,
      Mid
      and
      B
      Site
      wouldn't
      make
      thematic
      sense
      in
      my
      opinion
      to
      add
      skylights,
      and
      I'm
      having
      trouble
      thinking
      of
      a
      better
      way
      to
      add
      nade
      paths.
      I
      think
      those
      areas
      may
      work
      fine
      without
      many
      grenade
      options
      (e.g.
      Dust2
      B
      Site),
      but
      I
      would
      like
      feedback
      as
      to
      if
      that
      is
      really
      the
      case.

      **Known
      Issues:**
      \-
      You
      can
      boost
      out
      of
      the
      map
      in
      T
      Spawn.
      It's
      an
      easy
      fix,
      just
      noticed
      it
      too
      recently
      to
      have
      gotten
      around
      to
      it
      yet.
      \-
      There
      are
      a
      couple
      awkward
      angles
      that
      I
      already
      know
      about.
      One
      at
      the
      drop
      down
      vent
      into
      Mid
      and
      one
      from
      the
      window
      with
      the
      crates
      looking
      into
      mid.
      I'm
      trying
      my
      best
      to
      figure
      out
      how
      to
      fix
      them.

      Now
      that
      I #8217;m
      thinking
      about
      it,
      A
      Site
      and
      CT
      Spawn
      could
      thematically
      make
      sense
      being
      entirely
      outdoors.
      I
      very
      well
      might
      do
      that.
      The
      lack
      of
      open
      area
      for
      nades
      has
      definitely
      been
      one
      of
      my
      biggest
      worries
      for
      this
      map.

      Are
      you
      into
      making
      custom
      models,
      or
      just
      detailing
      with
      the
      stuff
      you
      have
      in
      the
      game?
      I #8217;ve
      been
      having
      basically
      the
      opposite
      problem
      as
      you,
      where
      I
      love
      making
      layouts
      but
      am
      terrible
      at
      detailing.
      However,
      some
      of
      my
      maps
      would
      likely
      require
      custom
      models
      for
      detailing.
      If
      not,
      that #8217;s
      ok.
      Detailing
      just
      the
      stuff
      that
      wouldn #8217;t
      require
      custom
      models
      would
      be
      absolutely
      awesome.

      Yeah,
      I
      had
      a
      little
      bit
      of
      fun
      with
      the
      backstory
      on
      this
      one.
      I #8217;m
      glad
      you
      like
      it.
      Maybe
      I
      should
      email
      Valve
      about
      this
      problem
      and
      ask
      them
      to
      add
      golf
      clubs
      to
      the
      game.

      Aw,
      I
      would
      have
      loved
      to
      see
      him
      on
      ATK.
      But
      if
      he
      does
      actually
      join
      a
      team
      soon,
      I #8217;ll
      be
      really
      excited
      to
      see
      him
      back
      anyways.

      Mousesports,
      FaZe,
      G2,
      Astralis,
      NRG,
      Team
      Liquid,
      Luminosity,
      and
      DETONA
      all
      finished
      #1
      in
      each
      of
      their
      EU,
      or
      NA/SA
      groups.
      Each
      NA/SA
      #1
      is
      matched
      against
      an
      EU
      #2
      or
      #3,
      while
      each
      EU
      #1
      is
      matched
      against
      an
      NA/SA
      #2
      or
      one
      of
      the
      2
      Oceania
      or
      Asia
      teams.
      Yes,
      DETONA
      probably
      doesn #8217;t
      deserve
      this,
      as
      their
      Latin
      American
      group
      was
      far
      less
      skilled
      than
      any
      other
      group.
      Both
      Asia
      and
      Oceania
      groups
      were
      higher
      skilled
      but
      got
      bottom
      seeds.
      I
      personally
      would
      have
      rather
      had
      TYLOO
      or
      Grayhound
      get
      a
      top
      seed.
      Luminosity
      is
      the
      other
      one
      people
      don #8217;t
      seem
      to
      like
      getting
      a
      high
      seed
      but
      I
      think
      it #8217;s
      justified,
      since
      they
      had
      both
      MIBR
      and
      Cloud9
      in
      their
      group,
      which
      ended
      up
      taking
      the
      final
      2
      NA/SA
      spots.

      Teams
      actually
      have
      gone
      to
      a
      major
      without
      an
      org.
      However
      these
      are
      teams
      who
      were
      released
      by
      their
      org,
      such
      as
      ex-Space
      Soldiers.
      But
      that #8217;s
      not
      too
      important
      as
      they
      still
      didn #8217;t
      choose
      their
      sticker,
      just
      got
      a
      sticker
      of
      the
      Space
      Soldiers
      logo.
      The
      real
      reason
      you
      don #8217;t
      see
      many
      teams
      at
      the
      majors
      without
      orgs
      is
      because
      good
      teams
      get
      signed
      by
      orgs.
      The
      teams
      without
      orgs
      are
      generally
      teams
      that
      aren #8217;t
      good
      enough
      to
      qualify
      for
      majors.
      But
      they
      absolutely
      do
      have
      the
      chance
      to
      qualify.
      Many
      teams
      with
      absolutely
      no
      organization
      compete
      in
      major
      qualifiers,
      and
      if
      they
      successfully
      make
      it
      all
      the
      way
      through
      the
      minor,
      they
      would
      be
      allowed
      at
      the
      major,
      it #8217;s
      just
      unlikely
      to
      happen.
      It #8217;s
      possible
      that
      this
      year,
      FFAmix,
      a
      team
      without
      an
      org,
      could
      qualify
      for
      the
      major
      through
      the
      Asia
      Minor.
      If
      Valve
      wouldn #8217;t
      allow
      a
      team
      without
      an
      org
      at
      a
      major,
      then
      don #8217;t
      you
      think
      they #8217;d
      bar
      FFAmix
      from
      being
      at
      the
      minor
      too?
      Edit:
      I
      was
      wrong
      about
      Space
      Soldiers,
      but
      that
      doesn #8217;t
      change
      my
      point
      that
      orgless
      teams
      are
      allowed
      at
      the
      major.

      My
      mistake,
      I
      was
      thinking
      of
      ESL
      Pro
      League.
      I
      remembered
      seeing
      ex-Space
      Soldiers
      play
      and
      I
      thought
      it
      must
      have
      been
      from
      the
      major
      because
      I
      couldn #8217;t
      think
      of
      what
      other
      tournaments
      they
      were
      in
      around
      that
      time.
      Still
      doesn #8217;t
      change
      my
      point
      that
      orgless
      absolutely
      CAN
      be
      at
      a
      major,
      it #8217;s
      just
      unlikely
      since,
      as
      you
      said,
      those
      teams
      would
      likely
      get
      signed.

      I
      think
      it #8217;s
      something
      where

      barely

      and
      6.
      If
      you
      look

      you
      can
      see
      the

      It #8217;s
      most
      likely
      because
      they
      think
      there
      isn #8217;t
      enough
      of
      a
      reason
      to
      boost
      there
      that
      it
      outweighs
      the
      risk
      of
      someone
      throwing
      the
      bomb
      up
      there
      and
      getting
      it
      stuck.
      Personally,
      I
      would
      just
      put
      those
      clips
      that
      are
      used
      on
      Vertigo
      to
      return
      the
      bomb
      on
      top
      of
      the
      box.
      I
      make
      maps
      sometimes
      and
      that #8217;s
      generally
      what
      I
      do
      when
      I
      want
      a
      boost
      area
      without
      having
      to
      worry
      about
      the
      bomb
      getting
      thrown
      there.

      To

      it

      Are
      you
      saying
      you
      don #8217;t
      know
      how
      to
      use
      the

      editor
      and
      need
      someone
      else
      to
      do
      it
      for
      you?
      There
      are
      a
      lot
      of
      tutorials
      online.
      It
      might
      be
      confusing
      at
      first,
      but
      I
      think
      you
      could
      definitely
      learn
      enough
      to
      make
      the
      map
      yourself.
      I #8217;d
      honestly
      be
      willing
      to
      help
      you
      create
      a
      greybox,
      but
      I
      think
      it
      could
      be
      more
      rewarding
      for
      you
      if
      you

      Yeah,
      that #8217;s
      exactly
      what
      I
      was
      thinking.
      You

      someone
      else
      to
      put
      a
      box
      somewhere
      or
      a
      doorway
      somewhere
      but
      it #8217;s
      never
      going
      to
      be
      exactly
      as
      you
      envisioned
      it
      unless
      you
      do
      it
      yourself.

      Doesn #8217;t

      great
      to
      me,

      I #8217;m
      fine
      with
      it
      being
      used
      on
      completely
      terrible
      levels,
      and
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      good
      levels
      will
      be
      too
      heavily
      booed,
      but
      I #8217;m
      definitely
      worried
      new
      players
      will
      get
      discouraged
      with
      making
      levels
      and
      quit
      entirely.
      If
      someone
      gets
      the
      game
      and
      has
      no
      experience
      on
      how
      to
      make
      a
      level,
      they #8217;ll
      probably
      make
      a
      pretty
      mediocre
      level
      even
      if
      they
      try
      really
      hard.
      In
      MM1,
      there #8217;s
      little
      negative
      feedback,
      so
      they
      might
      latch
      on
      to
      a
      single
      lone
      star
      or
      even
      just
      the
      fact
      they
      got
      20
      plays
      and
      so
      they #8217;ll
      be
      motivated
      to
      make
      more
      levels
      and
      improve
      at
      their
      level
      design.
      In
      MM2,
      that
      person
      might
      get
      tons
      of
      boos,
      and
      now
      they
      might
      even
      just
      completely
      quit
      the
      game,
      and
      I
      don #8217;t
      want
      that
      to
      happen.
      I
      understand
      it
      helps
      for
      giving
      feedback,
      but
      personally
      I
      hope
      the
      level
      creator
      can #8217;t
      see
      how
      many
      boos
      they
      get.

      BIG
      made
      it
      to
      the
      finals
      at
      Cologne
      last
      year,
      making
      them
      obvious
      choice
      for
      an
      invitation.
      At
      the
      time
      they
      were
      invited,
      they
      were
      actually
      relatively
      good
      team,
      ranked
      in
      the
      top
      15.
      And
      of
      course,
      being
      held
      in
      Germany,
      having
      a
      German
      team
      would
      be
      a
      good
      move.
      If
      they
      were
      figuring
      out
      the
      invitations
      today,
      instead
      of
      6
      months
      ago,
      then
      I
      doubt
      BIG
      would
      be
      invited,
      considering
      their
      recent
      performance.
      But
      at
      the
      time,
      it
      made
      sense.

      invited
      for
      this
      tournament,
      they
      were
      actually
      a
      rather
      good
      team.
      In
      addition,
      the
      tournament
      takes
      place
      in
      Germany,
      and
      BIG
      is
      a
      German
      team,
      which
      could
      have
      influenced
      the
      decision.
      Considering
      their
      recent
      performances,
      if
      the
      invites
      were
      being
      decided
      today
      instead
      of
      6
      months
      ago,
      I
      doubt
      BIG
      would
      be
      invited.
      However,
      it
      is
      too
      late
      for
      them
      to
      change
      that
      decision,
      so
      BIG
      will
      be
      playing.

      According
      to
      my
      research,
      it
      is
      in
      fact
      Friday
      the
      28th,
      and
      not
      Friday
      the

      This
      is
      the
      same
      conclusion
      that
      /u/GangControl
      came
      with.
      Thus,
      I

      /u/Hexidian #8217;s
      claim
      that

      You #8217;re
      right.
      Fat
      as
      a
      whole
      isn #8217;t
      a
      problem.
      There
      are
      4
      main
      types
      of
      fat,
      and
      2
      of
      them
      are
      actually
      good
      for
      you.
      However,
      there
      are
      definitely
      certain
      types
      of
      fat
      that
      are
      extremely
      unhealthy.
      Generally,
      fats
      that
      are
      liquid
      at
      room
      temperature
      are
      good,
      while
      fats
      that
      are
      solid
      at
      room
      temperature
      are
      unhealthy.
      Saturated
      Fats
      have
      been
      eaten
      for
      a
      long
      time.
      They
      are
      unhealthy,
      but
      are
      generally
      considered
      ok
      to
      eat
      in
      smaller
      amounts.
      The
      real
      problem
      that
      we
      are
      facing
      now,
      is
      an
      overuse
      of
      industrially
      manufactured
      hydrogenated,
      or
      trans
      fat.
      Trans
      fat
      both
      raises
      your
      LDL
      (bad)
      cholesterol
      AND
      lowers
      your
      HDL
      (good)
      cholesterol,
      making
      it
      one
      of
      the
      worst
      things
      you
      can
      eat
      that
      is
      still
      found
      commonly
      in
      foods.
      Trans
      fat
      should
      be
      completely
      avoided.
      Check
      food
      labels,
      if
      it
      contains
      trans
      fat,
      or
      lists
      some
      sort
      of
      hydrogenated
      fat
      in
      the
      ingredients
      list
      (because
      for
      some
      reason
      companies
      are
      allowed
      to
      say
      0g
      trans
      fat
      even
      if
      there
      is
      some
      in
      the
      food),
      then
      you
      should
      see
      if
      you
      can
      eat
      something
      else.

      No,
      it #8217;s
      not
      at
      all.
      I
      assume
      you
      mean
      calling
      someone
      from
      the
      western
      part
      of
      Russia
      Asian,
      because
      people
      from
      the
      eastern
      part
      certainly
      are
      Asian.
      But,
      the
      western
      part
      of
      Russia
      is
      NOT
      a
      part
      of
      Asia.
      However,
      Iraq
      IS
      a
      part
      of
      Asia.
      So
      the
      2
      things
      are
      literally
      not
      comparable
      at
      all.

      Would
      it
      be

      to
      compare
      it

      This

      in
      places
      like
      the
      USA
      and
      Russia.
      However,
      I
      think
      even
      if
      the
      USA
      had
      10
      players
      in
      the
      top
      20,
      I #8217;d
      be
      more
      impressed
      if
      a
      country
      like
      Estonia
      or
      Denmark
      had
      5,
      considering
      how
      much
      smaller
      those
      countries
      are.
      The
      main
      problem,
      I
      think,
      would
      be
      in
      cases
      where
      there #8217;s
      only
      1
      player.
      One
      player
      happens
      to
      come
      from
      Luxembourg
      and
      all
      of
      a
      sudden
      it #8217;s
      the
      best
      country
      in
      the
      world
      at
      putting
      out
      Counterstrike
      talent.
      So,
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      it #8217;s
      the
      best
      way
      to
      measure
      it,
      but
      I
      think
      it
      would
      be
      a
      fair
      thing
      to
      include
      as
      one
      of
      your
      measurements.

      I
      completely
      understand
      the
      argument
      that
      it #8217;s
      cruel
      to
      the
      animals.
      I
      think
      there #8217;s
      a
      point
      to
      be
      made
      with
      that.
      The
      meat
      and
      dairy
      industry
      definitely
      has
      many
      problems
      regarding
      animal
      cruelty.
      However,
      I
      think
      the
      argument
      that
      humans
      drinking
      milk
      is
       #8220;unnatural, #8221;
      or
       #8220;weird, #8221;
      as
      you
      say,
      is
      pretty
      dumb.
      You
      say
      that
      it #8217;s
       #8220;designed #8221;
      to
      be
      for
      the
      calf,
      and
      not
      for
      us,
      so
      we
      have
      no
      business
      drinking
      it.
      But
      that
      could
      be
      said
      about
      pretty
      much
      anything.
      Take
      a
      bird #8217;s
      egg,
      for
      example.
      A
      bird
      could
      lay
      an
      egg,
      and
      then
      it
      hatches
      and
      a
      baby
      bird
      comes
      out.
      That #8217;s
      natural,
      right?
      Now
      let #8217;s
      say
      that
      instead,
      a
      snake
      finds
      the
      nest,
      and
      eats
      the
      egg
      for
      itself.
      I
      think
      most
      people
      would
      say
      that
      is
      a
      perfectly
      natural
      situation
      as
      well.
      But
      wait!
      The
      egg
      sure
      wasn #8217;t
       #8220;designed #8221;
      to
      be
      eaten
      by
      a
      snake;
      if
      it
      was
      designed
      to
      do
      anything,
      it
      would
      be
      to
      hatch
      a
      bird.
      So,
      by
      your
      reasoning,
      the
      snake
      is
      doing
      a
      completely
      unnatural
      thing.
      Yet,
      most
      people
      would
      say
      that
      it #8217;s
      a
      natural
      occurrence.
      So,
      if
      a
      cow #8217;s
      milk,
      like
      that
      egg,
      is
      found
      to
      have
      nutrients
      that
      are
      benificial
      to
      humans,
      who #8217;s
      to
      say
      it #8217;s
      weird
      for
      us
      to
      drink
      it?
      Who #8217;s
      to
      say
      it #8217;s
      any
      different
      from
      a
      snake
      eating
      a
      bird #8217;s
      egg,
      or
      the
      many
      other
      things
      that
      happen
      in
      nature?
      I
      would
      say
      that
      it #8217;s
      not
      different
      at
      all.

      5
      or
      6

      being

      at

      Everything

      have
      some
      sort

      I #8217;m
      gonna
      do
      something
      crazy:
      defend
      the
      US
      date
      format.
      In
      my
      opinion,
      YYYY/MM/DD
      is
      the
      best
      date
      format
      because
      it #8217;s
      in
      the
      order
      of
      importance.
      Imagine
      you
      walk
      into
      a
      room
      full
      of
      calendars
      and
      you
      need
      to
      find
      a
      specific
      date,
      first
      you
      find
      the
      calendar
      for
      the
      year
      you
      want,
      then
      you
      flip
      to
      the
      right
      month,
      and
      then
      find
      the
      right
      day.
      So
      it
      just
      makes
      sense
      for
      it
      to
      go
      YYYY/MM/DD
      to
      me.
      I
      also
      find
      DD/MM/YYYY
      to
      be
      a
      pretty
      wack
      since
      I
      have
      to
      look
      at
      it
      backwards
      to
      do
      the
      same
      thing.
      This
      is
      why
      MM/DD/YYYY
      makes
      sense
      to
      me.
      Think
      about
      it:
      how
      often
      do
      you
      need
      the
      year
      when
      writing
      a
      date
      down.
      Month
      and
      day
      are
      rather
      important,
      but
      year?
      It #8217;s
      often
      completely
      omitted.
      So,
      you
      keep
      month
      and
      day
      in
      the
      same
      order:
      the
      order
      that
      you
      would
      use
      to
      find
      the
      date,
      but
      you
      put
      the
      year
      at
      the
      end.
      Makes
      sense,
      since
      the
      year
      is
      often
      added
      as
      an
      after
      thought
      when
      you
      realize
      that
      you
      actually
      did
      need
      to
      write
      it
      down,
      and
      you
      probably
      no
      longer
      have
      space
      in
      front,
      so
      it
      goes
      in
      the
      back.
      TL;DR
      MM/DD/YYYY
      is
      a
      helpful
      variation
      of
      YYYY/MM/DD
      (the
      best
      format)
      and
      is
      really
      not
      as
      dumb
      as
      people
      say
      it
      is.

      I
      believe
      it
      has
      to
      do
      with
      where
      the
      team
      is
      operating
      from.
      I
      think
      qualifiers
      prioritize
      where
      the
      team
      is
      currently
      living
      rather
      than
      where
      the
      team
      is
      from.
      A
      lot
      of
      teams
      from
      South
      America
      move
      to
      North
      America
      in
      order
      to
      play
      against
      better
      competition,
      and
      hopefully
      get
      better
      themselves.
      However,
      this
      means
      they #8217;ll
      have
      to
      play
      through
      NA
      qualifiers,
      which
      are
      harder
      than
      SA
      qualifiers.
      Now
      I
      don #8217;t
      know
      for
      sure
      where
      the
      3
      teams
      you
      mentioned
      live,
      but
      I
      know
      this
      is
      why
      ATK
      played
      through
      the
      NA
      qualifier
      instead
      of
      Africa,
      and
      Renegades
      are
      in
      NA
      ESL
      Pro
      League
      instead
      of
      Oceania,
      so
      I
      assume
      those
      3
      Brazilian
      teams
      are
      in
      the
      same
      situation.

      two

      I #8217;m
      pretty
      sure
      it
      just
      means
      big
      parties
      and
      doing
      drugs
      and
      stuff
      like
      that.
      If
      you
      go
      out
      with
      just
      one
      person
      or
      a
      small
      group
      of
      friends
      and
      just
      do
      regular
      stuff
      than
      you
      should
      be
      allowed
      on
      this
      sub.
      Otherwise
      this
      sub
      would
      just
      be
      for
      people
      with
      absolutely
      no
      social
      life
      whatsoever.
      I
      mean
      it #8217;s
      a
      completely
      dead
      sub
      so
      I
      guess
      it
      doesn #8217;t
      really
      matter
      but
      eh.

      That
      is
      definitely
      oversimplifying.
      We
      gain
      a
      lot
      more
      from
      food
      than
      just
      calories.
      There
      are
      many
      different
      vitamins,
      minerals,
      fats,
      carbs,
      proteins,
      etc.
      and
      they
      all
      have
      effects
      on
      your
      body,
      including
      weight
      gain
      and
      loss.
      You
      need
      a
      good
      balance
      of
      these
      things.
      Calories
      do
      not
      reflect
      this
      balance.
      The
      idea
      of
      simply
      keeping
      a
      low
      amount
      of
      calories
      implies
      that
      you
      could
      only
      eat
      one
      type
      of
      food
      and
      be
      fine,
      or
      that
      100
      calories
      of
      cake
      is
      just
      as
      healthy
      as
      100
      calories
      of
      vegetables,
      even
      though
      that
      is
      not
      true.
      I
      agree
      with
      you
      that
      all
      of
      those
       #8220;miracle
      products #8221;
      sold
      to
      help
      with
      diet
      and
      fitness
      are
      bullcrap,
      but
      the
      whole
      advice
      of
       #8220;eat
      less,
      move
      more #8221;
      is
      extremely
      unhelpful
      as
      well.

      Yes,
      you
      can
      lose
      weight
      by
      eating
      just
      1
      type
      of
      food.
      That
      is
      quite
      obvious.
      But
      it
      is
      most
      certainly
      not
      healthy.

      Wtf?
      Yeah,
      we #8217;re
      talking
      about
      losing
      weight,
      but
      why
      the
      fuck
      would
      someone
      decide
      to
      lose
      weight
      unhealthily
      when
      there #8217;s
      an
      option
      to
      do
      so
      in
      a
      healthy
      way?
      The
      only
      reason
      I
      can
      think
      of
      for
      doing
      that
      is
      if
      you
      literally
      only
      care
      about
      what
      other
      people
      see,
      and
      not
      your
      own
      health,
      which
      is
      not
      a
      lifestyle
      I
      would
      want
      to
      promote.
      So
      when
      someone
      wants
      advice
      on
      losing
      weight,
      I
      give
      them
      the
      healthy
      advice,
      as
      I
      want
      them
      to
      actually
      be
      happy
      and
      live
      a
      long
      life.
      I
      would
      not
      tell
      them
      to
      lose
      weight
      through
      methods
      such
      as
      fasting
      or
      binge
      eating,
      as
      those
      would
      just
      result
      in
      a
      shorter
      and
      unhappier
      life.
      Your
      comment
      shows
      complete
      disregard
      for
      other
      people #8217;s
      health,
      which
      just
      further
      proves
      that
      you
      are
      not
      someone
      that
      advice
      should
      be
      taken
      from.
      The
      only
      reason
      people
      like
      the
      advice
      you
      gave
      is
      because
      they
      don #8217;t
      realize
      it #8217;s
      unhealthy.
      Try
      telling
      people
      to
      get
      cancer
      to
      lose
      weight.
      It #8217;s
      proven
      to
      do
      so
      quite
      well,
      but
      I
      guarantee
      you
      won #8217;t
      get
      the
      same
      reaction.

      Yeah,
      I
      agree.
      Moderate
      portions
      and
      exercise
      are
      very
      important.
      I

      That #8217;s
      true
      for
      any
      language
      spread
      over
      large

      English,

      these
      regional
      differences
      in
      language
      is
      incredibly
      cool.
      They
      all
      started
      with
      the
      same
      thing,
      but
      separation

      made
      them
      evolve
      differently.

      I #8217;m
      a
      bit
      annoyed
      with
      this
      minor #8217;s
      seeding.
      When
      I
      saw
      all
      of
      the
      teams,
      I
      thought
      that
      Grayhound,
      TyLoo,
      MVP
      PK,
      and
      Alpha
      Red
      were
      the
      top
      4
      that
      would
      likely
      go
      through
      to
      the
      playoffs.
      Avant
      and
      5Power
      had
      upset
      potential,
      while
      FFAmix
      and
      Energy
      stood
      pretty
      much
      no
      chance.
      Naturally,
      3
      out
      of
      those
      top
      4
      teams
      were
      put
      into
      the
      same
      group,
      giving
      an
      easy
      road
      for
      Grayhound,
      and
      screwing
      over
      one
      of
      the
      other
      3.
      Avant
      and
      MVP
      PK
      should
      have
      definitely
      been
      switched
      IMO.

      Yeah,
      it #8217;s
      kind
      of
      obvious
      that #8217;s
      the
      intention
      of
      the
      title.
      I #8217;m
      just
      nitpicking
      the
      symbol
      they
      used.
      I
      tried
      looking
      for
      alternate
      uses
      of
       #8220; gt; #8221;
      to
      see
      if
      I #8217;m
      wrong,
      but
      it
      seems
      that
      it
      can
      only
      mean
       #8220;greater
      than #8221;.
      A
      better
      symbol
      for
       #8220;associated
      with #8221;
      would
      be
       #8220;~ #8221;.
      I
      didn #8217;t
      look
      too
      long,
      so
      I
      could
      be
      proven
      wrong.

      Important
      to
      note
      that
      Russia
      is
      also
      where
      the
      majority
      of
      players
      in
      the
      CIS
      minor
      come
      from.
      65%
      of
      players
      in
      the
      CIS
      minor
      are
      Russian.
      However,
      76.2%
      of
      players
      with
      over
      1.00
      rating
      are
      also
      Russian.
      So,
      it #8217;s
      still
      impressive,
      but
      not
      by
      quite
      as
      much
      as
      your
      comment
      makes
      it
      sound.

      I
      mean
      they
      could
      easily
      be
      behind.
      The
      girl
      could
      have
      asked
      and
      the
      dad
      could
      have
      said
      no
      long
      before
      they
      even
      made
      it
      to
      the
      counter.
      Also,
      there #8217;s
      often
      chocolate
      bars
      at
      the
      counter,
      so
      they
      wouldn #8217;t
      have
      to
      get
      out
      of
      the
      line
      to
      buy
      it.

      I
      prefer
      shaved
      legs,
      on
      both
      guys
      and
      girls.
      The
      main
      reason
      guys
      don #8217;t
      do
      it
      much
      is
      just
      that
      our
      hair
      grows
      so
      fast.
      I #8217;ve
      tried
      shaving
      my
      legs,
      but
      by
      the
      next
      morning
      it
      already
      needed
      another
      shave.
      You
      will
      be
      fine
      if
      you
      don #8217;t
      shave.
      It #8217;s
      not
      like
      you #8217;ll
      drive
      people
      away
      from
      you.
      If
      a
      guy
      is
      willing
      to
      date
      you
      only
      if
      you
      have
      shaved
      legs,
      then
      they #8217;re
      kind
      of
      a
      dick
      and
      you
      wouldn #8217;t
      want
      to
      be
      with
      them
      anyways.
      However,
      most
      people
      will
      still
      prefer
      it
      shaved.

      The
      main
      reason
      for
      this
      is
      that
      people
      crossed
      to
      the
      Americas
      from
      Asia
      using
      the
      Bering
      Land
      Bridge.
      This
      means
      that
      Native
      Americans,
      Canadian
      First
      Nations,
      Latinos
      with
      indigenous
      ancestry,
      etc.
      are
      all
      descendants
      of
      Asians.
      Edit:
      specified
      what
      I
      meant
      by
       #8220;Latinos #8221;

      I

      isn #8217;t

      specify,
      which
      was
      admittedly
      a
      mistake
      on
      my
      part.
      I
      was
      mainly
      referring

      the
      indigenous

      European

      Latinos,

      indigenous
      blood,
      are
      descended
      from

      This
      sounds
      like
      a
      great
      way
      to
      essentially
      shorten
      people #8217;s
      life
      spans.
      Eventually,
      everybody
      would
      figure
      out
      they
      could
      go
      to
      sleep
      at
      any
      time
      and
      still
      be
      rested,
      so
      they
      would
      just
      stay
      up
      all
      night.
      However,
      if
      you #8217;re
      able
      to
      get
      sleep,
      then
      you
      must
      also
      be
      aging
      during
      the
      time
      freeze.
      So
      they #8217;d
      essentially
      be
      having
      8-9
      hours
      added
      to
      each
      day.
      They #8217;d
      still
      technically
      be
      living
      the
      same
      amount,
      but
      I
      feel
      people
      still
      wouldn #8217;t
      be
      very
      happy
      when
      they
      start
      dying
      of
      old
      age
      in
      their
      50s.

      It #8217;s
      just
      that
      our
      whole
      society
      tries
      to
      enforce
      a
      lot
      of
      gender
      roles.
      For
      men,
      the
      biggest
      one
      is
      probably
      that
      they
      aren #8217;t
      allowed
      to
      show
      emotions,
      and
      it #8217;s
      going
      to
      be
      very
      hard
      to
      change
      our
      society #8217;s
      view
      on
      this,
      as
      the
      pressure
      on
      boys
      to
      be
      like
      this
      don #8217;t
      just
      come
      from
      one
      person,
      it
      comes
      from
      everyone.
      Parents
      are
      probably
      the
      most
      influential
      people
      to
      their
      children,
      but
      even
      if
      parents
      know
      to
      not
      teach
      this
      stuff
      to
      their
      son,
      he
      will
      likely
      still
      encounter
      other
      people
      that
      do.
      Once
      he
      goes
      to
      school,
      his
      peers
      will
      make
      fun
      of
      him
      for
      crying,
      and
      often
      teachers
      and
      coaches
      will
      encourage
      him
      to
       #8220;be
      a
      man #8221;
      as
      well.
      I #8217;ve
      definitely
      seen
      coaches
      say
      things
      like
       #8220;football
      players
      don #8217;t
      cry. #8221;
      Our
      generation
      is
      probably
      the
      one
      that
      has
      realized
      this
      problem
      the
      most,
      so
      hopefully
      we
      can
      help
      the
      next
      generation
      of
      boys
      to
      be
      emotionally
      open,
      unlike
      many
      of
      us.

      I

      sounds

      still

      I
      really
      love
      snakes

      my

      would
      want
      a

      Maybe
      I #8217;ll
      get
      one
      in
      the
      future
      but
      I #8217;m
      honestly
      pretty
      50/50
      on
      wanting
      a
      snake
      or
      a
      bird.

      I'm
      guessing
      that
      it
      is
      probably
      because
      online
      tournaments
      do
      not
      provide
      as
      many
      points
      as
      LAN
      tournaments,
      and
      the
      qualifier
      was
      online.

      I #8217;ve
      had
      this
      error
      many
      times,
      although
      I #8217;ve
      never
      seen
      it
      happen
      to
      every
      single
      person
      in
      a
      server
      at
      the
      same
      time,
      so
      that #8217;s
      odd
      to
      me.
      I #8217;m
      not
      an
      expert
      or
      anything,
      but
      from
      my
      knowledge,
      this
      is
      what #8217;s
      happening.
      Basically,
      the
      server
      is
      trying
      to
      check
      the
      game
      files
      on
      your
      pc
      to
      see
      if
      they
      match
      up
      to
      the
      ones
      that
      you #8217;re
      supposed
      to
      have.
      They #8217;re
      checking
      to
      see
      if
      you #8217;ve
      altered
      any
      game
      files
      or
      if
      any
      of
      them
      are
      corrupted.
      So,
      if
      you
      get
      kicked
      and
      have
      this
      error
      saying
      your
      files
      don #8217;t
      match
      the
      server #8217;s
      files,
      then
      there
      are
      2
      main
      possible
      issues.
      1.
      Your
      files
      are
      corrupted
      or
      have
      been
      altered.
      This
      is
      unlikely
      in
      this
      case
      as
      it
      happened
      to
      everyone
      in
      the
      server.
      2.
      The
      server
      failed
      to
      make
      a
      good
      connection
      to
      your
      pc
      in
      order
      to
      check
      your
      files.
      In
      your
      case,
      it #8217;s
      probably
      the
      latter
      problem.
      I
      have
      spotty
      internet,
      so
      I
      usually
      get
      this
      error
      at
      times
      when
      my
      internet
      is
      not
      doing
      well.
      However,
      if
      it #8217;s
      happened
      to
      everybody
      in
      a
      Match,
      multiple
      times,
      I
      bet
      it #8217;s
      a
      problem
      on
      the
      server #8217;s
      side,
      rather
      than
      everybody
      on
      the
      server
      happening
      to
      have
      really
      bad
      internet.
      OR
      it
      could
      be
      some
      other
      cause
      that
      I
      didn #8217;t
      know
      about.
      I #8217;m
      not
      exactly
      an
      expert
      on
      this.

      Never
      dispute
      it?
      Believe
      me,
      pistol
      balance
      has
      been
      a
      huge
      source
      of
      contention
      in
      the
      CS
      community
      for
      a
      long
      time.
      They #8217;ve
      complained
      about
      why
      p250
      can
      headshot
      and
      M4
      can #8217;t
      for
      ages.
      In
      fact,
      they
      complained
      enough
      that
      Valve
      did
      something
      about
      it,
      and
      the
      p250
      has
      not
      been
      able
      to
      oneshot
      headshot
      for
      almost
      2
      years
      now,
      so
      your
      information
      is
      a
      little
      outdated.

      Pros
      don #8217;t
      use
      them
      then
      because
      most
      other
      guns
      are
      more
      useful
      than
      both
      of
      them.
      P90
      is
      too
      expensive
      and
      has
      too
      small
      of
      a
      kill
      reward,
      and
      the
      autosniper
      is
      both
      expensive,
      and
      even
      though
      it
      shoots
      faster,
      the
      fact
      it
      can #8217;t
      one
      shot
      in
      the
      body
      makes
      it
      worse
      than
      the
      AWP
      because
      taking
      one
      shot
      to
      kill
      is
      always
      better
      than
      2.
      There #8217;s
      pretty
      much
      no
      good
      use
      for
      the
      P90
      at
      this
      level,
      and
      the
      auto
      sniper
      is
      good
      at
      wallbanging,
      but
      not
      much
      else.
      To
      a
      new
      player,
      these
      guns
      are
      extremely
      easy
      to
      pick
      up
      and
      learn
      compared
      to
      other
      guns.
      So
      even
      though
      P90
      and
      autosnipers
      aren #8217;t
      very
      useful
      when
      you #8217;re
      good
      at
      the
      game,
      if
      you
      literally
      don #8217;t
      know
      how
      to
      use
      any
      of
      the
      other
      guns,
      then
      you #8217;ll
      obviously
      do
      a
      lot
      better
      with
      one
      of
      those
      2.

      My
      main
      problem
      with
      it
      is
      that
      it #8217;s
      overly
      complex
      and
      just
      does
      not
      work
      at
      a
      small
      size.
      CS:GO
      teams
      are
      often
      going
      to
      have
      their
      logos
      at
      very
      small
      sizes,
      and
      you
      want
      them
      to
      always
      be
      easily
      recognizable,
      and
      NRG #8217;s
      new
      logo
      just
      doesn #8217;t
      do
      that.
      The
      one
      that #8217;s
      just
      the
      text
      does
      work
      better
      at
      a
      small
      size,
      but
      it #8217;s
      also
      extremely
      bland
      so
      I
      don #8217;t
      particularly
      like
      that
      one
      either.

      Tbf,
      some
      animals
      can
      have
      no
      gender
      or
      be
      both
      genders
      at
      the
      same
      time,
      because
      the
      animal
      kingdom
      is
      freaking
      weird
      and
      cool.
      However,
      pigeons
      are
      certainly
      not
      one
      of
      those
      animals.

      Huh,
      you #8217;re
      right,
      I
      just
      checked.
      I
      looked
      up
      the
      dates
      of
      the
      stages
      a
      few
      days
      ago
      and
      for
      some
      reason
      it
      had
      everything
      3
      days
      earlier,
      but
      now
      it #8217;s
      fixed.
      I
      edited
      the
      comment.

      I #8217;d
      reconsider
      DreamEaters
      0-3.
      DreamEaters
      beat
      NRG,
      Vitality,
      forZe,
      and
      took
      a
      map
      off
      of
      CR4ZY.
      The
      other
      team
      they
      played
      against
      was
      G2.
      All
      relatively
      good
      teams.
      AVANGAR
      beat
      Complexity,
      HellRaisers,
      and
      Syman
      to
      qualify.
      None
      of
      these
      are
      T1
      teams
      I #8217;d
      say
      that
      DreamEaters
      have
      a
      very
      solid
      chance
      to
      beat
      Renegades,
      NiP,
      and
      MIBR.
      AVANGAR
      could
      also
      pull
      out
      wins
      against
      those
      3,
      but
      I #8217;d
      consider
      it
      much
      less
      likely.

      The
      beginning
      was
      a
      bit
      enemy
      spam,
      and
      the
      lower
      left
      key
      coin
      challenge
      felt
      a
      bit
      too
      hard,
      with
      not
      being
      able
      to
      see
      easily
      where
      you
      have
      to
      jump.
      Especially
      annoying
      when
      you
      have
      to
      get
      all
      4
      key
      coins
      in
      one
      run.
      Otherwise,
      it
      was
      a
      really
      fun
      level!
      I
      really
      like
      the
      surprise
      at
      the
      end,
      although
      I
      suppose
      if
      I
      had
      died
      to
      it
      I #8217;d
      probably
      have
      liked
      it
      a
      lot
      less.
      But
      I
      did
      really
      enjoy
      playing
      it.
      Thanks
      for
      the
      level!

      Yep!
      She
      was
      the
      one
      who
      noticed
      it
      first,
      and
      although
      I
      usually
      hate
      these
      sort
      of
      photo
      spot
      things,
      I
      just
      had
      to
      get
      a
      picture
      of
      this
      one.

      Teams

      will
      come
      in
      after

      I
      really
      doubt
      they'd
      remove
      vertigo
      at
      all.
      There's
      no
      way
      they
      would
      give
      up
      on
      it
      that
      quickly,
      and
      honestly,
      I'd
      be
      fine
      with
      train
      gone.
      It's
      definitely
      the
      worst
      map
      besides
      vertigo,
      especially
      with
      the
      B
      site
      being
      such
      a
      mess.
      I
      think
      it's
      they're
      either
      going
      to
      remove
      train
      or
      remove
      mirage
      to
      do
      a
      rework.

      Me
      too.
      I
      was
      thinking,
      "there's
      no
      way
      it's
      that
      common,"
      and
      then
      I
      realized
      that
      I
      was
      dumb.

      Yeah,
      a
      lot
      of
      times,
      the
      top
      8
      of
      the
      major
      ends
      up
      being
      the
      top
      8
      in
      the
      rankings
      immediately
      afterwards,
      so
      I'd
      honestly
      be
      surprised
      if
      they
      weren't
      at
      least
      all
      in
      the
      top
      10.

      Likely
      due
      to
      teams
      above
      them
      losing
      points
      rather
      than
      BIG
      gaining
      points.
      They
      did
      gain
      11
      points,
      but
      that
      might
      just
      be
      because
      Liquid
      has
      dropped
      below
      1000
      points,
      meaning
      the
      other
      teams
      points
      aren #8217;t
      scaled
      anymore.

      When
      a
      team
      gets
      over
      1000
      points,
      HLTV
      scales
      it
      down
      to
      1000.
      In
      order
      to
      compensate,
      everyone
      else #8217;s
      points
      are
      also
      scaled
      down.
      Liquid
      had
      1000
      points
      last
      week,
      meaning
      every
      team #8217;s
      points
      were
      scaled
      down.
      Now
      that
      Liquid
      no
      longer
      has
      1000
      points,
      the
      teams
      points
      are
      no
      longer
      scaled
      down,
      and
      thus,
      it
      looks
      like
      they #8217;ve
      gained
      points
      when
      in
      reality
      they
      really
      haven #8217;t.
      This
      is
      most
      likely
      why
      it
      looks
      like
      BIG
      gained
      points
      rather
      than
      losing
      them.
      This
      is
      just
      a
      guess
      though.
      I #8217;m
      not
      an
      expert
      on
      how
      the
      HLTV
      rating
      system
      works.
      It #8217;s
      possible
      they
      gained
      points
      through
      some
      other
      way.

      I
      did
      look
      it
      up
      as
      I
      was
      curious
      too.
      I
      thought
      maybe
      Bahrain
      was
      actually
      a
      nice
      place.
      However,
      from
      what
      I
      found,
      it
      seems
      like
      Bahrain
      is
      extremely
      lacking
      in
      human
      rights
      and
      freedom.
      Torture,
      lack
      of
      basic
      freedoms,
      little
      women #8217;s
      rights,
      dissolving
      opposing
      political
      parties,
      etc.
      It
      really
      doesn #8217;t
      seem
      like
      that
      great
      of
      a
      place.

      Likely
      will
      get
      deleted
      if
      someone
      tries
      to
      make
      them.
      Liquipedia
      has
      a
      policy
      against
      making
      pages
      on
      relatively
      unknown
      players/teams,
      as
      they
      often
      end
      up
      getting
      neglected
      and
      become
      really
      out
      of
      date
      and
      unprofessional.
      This
      might
      be
      enough
      for
      them
      to
      have
      proved
      themselves,
      but
      I
      think
      you #8217;d
      probably
      have
      to
      wait
      until
      they
      qualify.
      If
      they
      do
      that,
      then
      the
      pages
      definitely
      won #8217;t
      get
      deleted.

      I
      can
      think
      of
      a
      few
      crazy
      plays
      from
      majors,
      but
      not
      really
      any
      from
      important
      enough
      games
      to
      really
      feel
      like
      they
      deserve
      a
      graffiti.
      Like,
      if
      BIG
      had
      an
      amazing
      run
      and
      tiziaN
      got
      his
      90 #176;
      flick
      in
      the
      grand
      final,
      that
      could
      be
      worthy.
      But
      obviously,
      that
      didn #8217;t
      happen.
      It #8217;s
      not
      exactly
      a
      tournament
      defining
      moment
      since
      it
      was
      in
      a
      not
      very
      important
      match.
      Although
      I
      do
      feel
      like
      there
      could
      be
      something
      from
      FaZe
      vs
      Cloud9,
      I
      just
      don #8217;t
      know
      what
      exactly.

      Pretty
      sure
      it #8217;s
      faster
      to
      use
      left
      click.
      When
      I
      started
      playing
      I
      used
      e
      since
      that #8217;s
      the
      button
      that
      the
      game
      tells
      you
      to
      use,
      but
      I
      ended
      up
      switching
      to
      using
      left
      click
      once
      I
      found
      out
      you
      could
      do
      that,
      as
      it
      seemed
      a
      lot
      faster.

      They
      accepted
      that
      you #8217;re

      Trying
      to
      censor
      porn
      is
      extremely
      difficult.
      You
      may

      able
      to
      get
      some
      of
      the
      top
      porn
      sites
      to
      comply

      demands,
      but
      in
      the
      end,
      there
      will
      always
      be
      too
      many
      sites
      to
      regulate.
      The
      ones
      that
      escape
      regulation
      are
      also
      more
      likely
      to
      be
      niche
      sites
      that
      have
      more
      hardcore
      and
      damaging
      content
      to
      children
      that
      view
      it.

      That

      Eh,
      kind
      of,
      but
      not
      really.
      Those
      studies
      are
      misleading
      and
      not
      really
      conclusive.
      We
      don #8217;t
      have
      enough
      good
      research
      to
      say
      if
      masturbation
      is
      healthy
      or
      not.
      Porn
      is
      certainly
      not
      healthy
      though.

      I
      literally
      have
      ear
      plugs
      in
      my
      backpack
      every
      day
      at
      school
      so
      I
      can
      wear
      them
      in
      situations
      like
      that.
      I
      am
      also
      a
      percussionist
      in
      the
      band
      so
      that
      gets
      really
      loud
      too.
      I #8217;m
      sure
      some
      people
      think
      I
      look
      stupid,
      but
      fuck
      them;
      want
      to
      be
      able
      to
      hear
      later
      in
      life.

      They
      made
      this
      post
      saying
      that
      this
      is
      the
      most
      viewed
      match
      of
      all
      the
      group
      matches,
      which
      is
      true
      now.
      But,
      at
      the
      time
      they
      posted,
      the
      group
      matches
      weren #8217;t
      even
      all
      done
      yet.
      There #8217;s
      no
      way
      you
      can
      know
      for
      sure
      what
      the
      most
      popular
      match
      is
      until
      after
      they #8217;re
      all
      done,
      OP
      just
      assumed
      that
      EG
      vs
      Astralis
      would
      be
      the
      most
      popular
      one,
      so
      they
      posted
      before
      all
      the
      matches
      were
      done
      in
      order
      in
      order
      to
      beat
      anyone
      to
      making
      this
      post.

      Obviously
      a

      it

      to

      Oh
      god
      now
      I
      feel
      really
      bad
      for
      all
      the
      times
      I #8217;ve
      mentioned
      something
      gross
      while
      people
      were
      eating.
      It #8217;s
      never
      affected
      me
      when
      other
      people
      have
      done
      it
      to
      me
      so
      I
      kind
      of
      assumed
      they
      were
      just
      overreacting
      or
      something.
      Whoops.
      But
      yeah
      I
      think
      there
      are
      some
      positives
      to
      aphantasia.
      I
      spent
      a
      couple
      weeks
      after
      I
      found
      out
      I
      had
      aphantasia
      trying
      to
       #8220;cure #8221;
      it.
      After
      a
      while
      though,
      I
      realized
      that
      it #8217;s
      not
      necessarily
      a
      bad
      thing,
      and
      decided
      that
      I #8217;m
      happy
      with
      how
      I
      am
      right
      now.
      I
      know
      that
      I
      may
      struggle
      to
      be
      a
      good
      painter
      or
      architect,
      but
      there
      are
      lots
      of
      things
      I
      can
      also
      do
      better
      because
      of
      the
      way
      my
      mind
      works,
      such
      as
      programming,
      math,
      and
      more.
      Also,
      I
      don #8217;t
      have
      to
      completely
      give
      up
      on
      art,
      as
      there
      are
      non-visual
      things,
      such
      as
      music,
      that
      I
      can
      participate
      in
      just
      as
      competently
      as
      people
      without
      aphantasia.
      I
      do
      think
      it
      would
      still
      be
      better
      to
      not
      have
      aphantasia.
      However,
      it
      hasn #8217;t
      affected
      my
      life
      enough
      that
      it #8217;s
      a
      serious
      problem,
      and
      I #8217;ve
      become
      content
      with
      it.

      I
      feel
      it #8217;s
      a
      bit
      unfair
      that
      Sharks
      gets

      spot
      rather
      than
      ATK

      2
      weren #8217;t

      weeks.
      I
      understand
      that
      they #8217;re
      ranked
      by
      prize
      money,
      but
      IMO,
      losing
      these
      matches
      shows
      that
      there
      are
      at
      least
      2
      teams
      that
      are
      better

      Everybody
      gives
      this
      advice
      but
      I
      honestly
      feel
      that
      it #8217;s
      not
      the
      most
      helpful.
      It
      could
      work
      for
      people
      who
      are
      friends
      with
      their
      crush,
      but
      I
      see
      it
      given
      to
      people
      who
      barely
      know
      the
      person
      they
      have
      a
      crush
      on.
      Some
      people
      haven #8217;t
      even
      ever
      talked
      to
      them
      for
      Christ #8217;s
      sake!
      These
      people
      get
      this
      advice
      to
       #8220;just
      ask
      them
      out, #8221;
      and
      a
      lot
      of
      the
      time
      they
      get
      turned
      down,
      because
      guess
      what?
      A
      lot
      of
      people
      aren #8217;t
      going
      to
      say
      yes
      to
      someone
      they
      don #8217;t
      know.
      Perhaps
      if
      they
      had
      simply
      started
      talking
      to
      them
      and
      getting
      to
      know
      them
      before
      asking
      them
      out,
      they
      actually
      would
      have
      gotten
      a
      yes.
       #8220;Just
      talk
      to
      them #8221;
      isn #8217;t
      bad
      advice.
      You #8217;re
      not
      going
      to
      get
      anywhere
      if
      you
      never
      talk
      to
      them.
      But
       #8220;just
      ask
      them
      out #8221;
      is
      unlikely
      to
      get
      you
      anywhere.

      I
      agree
      that
      it #8217;s
      better
      for
      the
      players,
      but
      for
      viewers,
      more
      matches
      means
      more
      people
      are
      going
      to
      be
      too
      burned
      out
      to
      watch
      more
      by
      the
      time
      the
      finals
      comes
      around.
      I #8217;m
      not
      one
      of
      those
      people,
      and
      since
      you
      are
      asking
      for
      more
      matches
      I #8217;m
      sure
      you
      aren #8217;t
      either.
      However,
      it
      is
      undeniable
      that
      viewer
      rates
      at
      the
      major
      have
      been
      going
      down
      recently
      now
      that
      more
      and
      more
      matches
      are
      being
      played.
      I
      do
      think
      that
      fairness
      for
      the
      players
      should
      be
      prioritized
      over
      viewer
      experience,
      and
      I
      personally
      would
      be
      fine
      with
      double
      elimination
      playoffs,
      but
      when
      the
      people
      who
      aren #8217;t
      like
      us
      end
      up
      not
      watching,
      there
      may
      not
      be
      enough
      money
      made
      to
      justify
      the
      expenses
      of
      more
      matches.

      I
      think
      a
      chest
      containing
      iron
      and
      flint
      would
      be
      good,
      or
      maybe
      just
      straight
      up
      a
      flint
      and
      steel
      to
      make
      it
      a
      little
      simpler
      to
      figure
      out.

      Well
      it
      is
      far
      easier
      to
      find
      3
      obsidian
      in
      a
      chest
      than
      it
      is
      to
      find
      10.
      But
      I
      still
      think
      it
      would
      be
      fine
      if
      you
      needed
      less
      than
      10.

      I
      know
      I #8217;ll
      be
      downvoted
      for
      this
      but
      I
      actually
      think
      the
      imperial
      measurement
      system
      is
      pretty
      useful.
      The
      metric
      system #8217;s
      main
      benefit
      is
      easy
      conversions.
      This
      makes
      it
      great
      for
      things
      like
      science
      and
      math,
      and
      the
      US
      already
      uses
      it
      in
      those
      situations.
      But
      for
      simple
      day
      to
      day
      things
      such
      as
      comparing
      differences
      between
      people #8217;s
      height/weight,
      knowing
      how
      long
      it
      will
      take
      to
      travel
      a
      certain
      distance,
      and
      deciding
      what
      clothes
      to
      wear
      based
      on
      the
      temperature,
      I
      find
      the
      imperial
      system
      to
      scale
      much
      better.
      A
      lot
      of
      people
      look
      at
      it
      and
      think
      it #8217;s
      a
      complete
      mess,
      but
      these
      units
      aren #8217;t
      completely
      arbitrary.
      They
      were
      specifically
      chosen
      for
      a
      reason.

      I
      had
      to
      memorize
      the
      elements
      for
      chemistry
      class.
      But
      that
      crap
      was
      nothing
      compared
      to
      memorizing
       gt;150
      Latin
      and
      Greek
      prefixes
      and
      suffixes
      for

      that
      if
      we
      came
      across
      a
      word
      we
      didn #8217;t
      know,
      we
      could
      make
      a
      guess
      because
      we
      know
      the
      prefixes/suffixes
      translate
      to
       #8220;state
      of
      electric
      water #8221;
      or
      some
      crap.
      Cause,
      y #8217;know,
      we
      couldn #8217;t
      just
      look
      up
      the
      definition.
      That
      would
      be
      dumb.
