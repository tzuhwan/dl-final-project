      That
      sounds
      like
      an
      amazing
      idea
      for
      water
      themed
      house
      or
      any
      house
      in
      general!
      Maybe
      also
      add
      other
      underwatwr
      plants
      e.g.
      coral?

      YTA
      dude...
      That
      was
      harsh...
      Its
      the
      the
      child's
      fault
      that
      he
      has
      special
      needs...
      Think
      about
      how
      the
      parents
      felt.
      If
      you
      could
      only
      go
      one
      or
      twice
      a
      year
      the
      parents
      are
      probably
      in
      the
      same
      situation.
      Then
      their
      money
      got
      wasted,
      they
      probably
      didn't
      even
      get
      a
      refund...

      NTA.
      Definitely.
      Yes
      a
      polite
      no
      would
      have
      been
      ok
      but
      that
      was
      an
      awful
      thing
      to
      say!
      I
      think
      it
      was
      sensible
      to
      rationalize
      your
      answer
      as
      she
      had
      no
      idea
      what
      your
      life
      was
      like,
      but
      the
      way
      she
      reacted
      to
      even
      that
      is
      awful.
      But
      the
      way
      you
      wrote
      it...
      I
      can
      sort
      of
      see
      her
      point
      of
      view.
      The
      way
      you
      wrote
      it,
      I
      think
      to
      her
      it
      seems
      like
      she
      told
      you
      that
      she
      won
      the
      raffle,
      you
      said
      congrats
      and
      then
      immediately
      you
      saw
      this
      as
      an
      opportunity
      to
      get
      rid
      of
      your
      debt.
      But
      you
      are
      DEFINITELY
      NOT
      THE
      A
      HOLE

      Actually
      marriage
      is
      unnatural...
      In
      primal
      eras
      mammals
      were
      not
      tied
      to
      one
      other
      mammal.
      Thats
      the
      only
      problem
      i
      have
      with
      your

      Also
      marriage
      is
      expensive

      you
      were
      concerned
      about
      a

      possibly
      mistreating
      a

      wanted
      to
      report
      it.

      anything

      then
      he
      was
      probably
      not

      don't
      get

      don't
      usually
      get

      at

      apart

      just
      did
      AGAIN
      is
      just
      boring,
      so
      instead
      I
      just
      quit
      the
      game
      and
      not
      only
      the
      game,
      I
      do
      something
      else
      because
      I
      just
      CBA.
      Anyone

      When
      a
      classmate
      claimed
      she
      had
      got
      a
      sunburn
      WHILST
      UNDER
      THE
      COVERS
      AT
      FUCKING
      NIGHT
      TIME.
      She
      then
      insisted
      that
      she
      gets
      sun
      burnt
      easily
      so
      we
      should
      draw
      the
      curtains
      in
      the
      form
      room
      (homeroom
      for
      you
      Americans)
      EVEN
      THOUGH
      GLASS
      BLOCKS
      97%
      OF
      UV
      LIGHT
      FROM
      THE
      SUN
      SO
      IT
      IS
      VIRTUALLY
      IMPOSSIBLE
      TO
      GET
      SUN
      S
      BURNT.
      The
      whole
      class
      and
      I
      gave
      up
      with
      arguing
      at
      that
      point.
      EVEN
      OUR
      FUCKING
      FORM
      TEACHER
      (WHO
      IS
      A
      SCIENCE
      TEACHER)
      SAID
      THAT
      IT
      IS
      IMPOSSIBLE.
      But
      nooooo
      So
      we
      gave
      up.

      Love
      and
      Thunder??
      (Lots
      of

      spoilers
      for
      Ragnarok
      and

      Okay
      so
      questions:
      1)
      WTF
      is
      the
      thought
      behind
      this
      movie??
      Is
      there
      a
      comic
      with
      a
      Goddess
      of
      Thunder?
      2)
      When
      you
      such
      up
      'Thor:
      Love
      and
      Thunder'
      and
      look
      at
      the
      casting,
      Natalie
      Portman
      is
      listed
      as
      playing
      Jane
      Foster,
      Thor's
      ex.
      a)
      HOW
      THE
      TF
      CAN
      A
      MORTAL
      HUMAN
      BE
      THE
      GOD/GODDESS
      OF
      THUNDER??
      Does
      Thor
      Somehow
      transmit
      the
      power
      to
      her,
      because
      she
      never
      had
      any
      power
      before.
      b)
      3)
      What's
      the
      situation
      with
      the
      hammer?
      Mj #246;lnir
      was
      destroyed
      in
      Ragnarok,
      so
      that's
      out
      of
      the
      question
      and
      Stormbreaker
      is
      Thor's
      hammer,
      and
      I
      doubt
      he's
      gonna
      give
      that
      up.
      So
      is
      Foster
      gonna
      get
      a
      new
      hammer
      or
      not?
      4)
      Does
      this
      mean
      the
      Chris
      Hemsworth
      will
      not
      be
      doing
      anymore
      solo
      Thor
      movies,
      because
      he's
      travelling
      with
      the
      Guardians
      of
      the
      Galaxy.

      channeling/focusing

      Spring
      is
      the
      Best
      Season.

      Spring
      is
      not
      too
      hot,
      nor
      too
      cold.
      This
      means
      that
      you
      can
      go
      out,
      without
      being
      frozen
      like
      a
      block
      of
      ice,
      but
      it
      also
      means
      that
      you
      can
      go
      out
      with
      out
      coming
      back,
      drowned
      in
      a
      pool
      of
      sweat.
      This
      also
      means
      it's
      easy
      to
      sleep
      as
      it's
      not
      too
      uncomfortable.
      Also,
      you
      save
      electricity
      as
      you
      don't
      have
      to
      use
      fans
      or
      heaters
      (Maybe
      you
      have
      to
      occasionally).
      Spring
      is
      not
      too
      bright
      in
      the
      night
      (So
      you
      can
      sleep
      easily)
      and
      it's
      not
      too
      dark
      in
      the
      morning
      (So
      it's
      easy
      to
      get
      up
      (I'm
      a
      morning
      person)).
      SUMMER
      IS
      SO
      FUCKING
      UNCOMFORTABLE
      BECAUSE
      IT'S
      TOO
      HOT
      AND
      HUMID
      AND
      I
      CAN'T
      FUCKING
      SLEEP
      AND
      I'M
      SO
      FUCKING
      SLEEP
      DEPRIVED.

      Before
      I
      start,
      I'd
      just
      like
      to
      point
      out
      that
      I
      am
      not
      trying
      to
      be
      offensive,
      just
      trying
      to
      understand
      (sorry
      if
      I
      am).
      --------------------------
      The
      term
      "Binary"
      means
      2.
      If
      you
      identify
      as
      non
      binary
      then
      surely
      that
      means
      that
      you're
      not
      male
      or
      female?
      But
      there
      are
      only
      two
      genders,
      even
      if
      you
      transgender
      it
      means
      your
      sex
      and
      gender
      dont
      match,
      but
      there
      are
      still
      two
      genders.
      So
      how
      can
      one
      person
      be
      neither
      male,
      nor
      female
      (non
      binary)???
      I've
      also
      just
      looked
      up
      non
      binary,
      and
      it
      says
      that
      its
      a
      spectrum.
      But
      a
      spectrum
      indicates
      more
      than
      2
      options.
      But
      if
      they
      ARE
      more
      than
      2
      then
      using
      binary
      doesnt
      make
      sense
      because
      the
      can
      ONLY
      BE
      2
      in
      binary.
      So
      Non
      binary
      people
      are
      basically
      admitting
      that
      there
      are
      only
      2
      genders...
      Pls
      help
      Again
      not
      tryna
      be
      offensive.

      How

      Basically
      title.
      I
      am
      trying
      to
      make
      an
      "anti
      normie/emoji"
      feature
      in
      my
      bot.
      So
      far
      I
      have
      got
      a
      working
      command
      called
      " amp;normie\_sited
      
      user
        and
        it
        "kills"
        the
        user
        by
        picking
        a
        random
        death
        message
        from
        an
        array.
        I
        want
        to
        automate
        it
        so
        that
        it
        detects
        when
        certain
        emojis
        are
        sent
        in
        any
        channel,
        like
        the
        MEE6
        and
        Dyno
        anti
        nsfw/emoji
        bots.
        I
        have
        tried
        looking
        it
        up,
        but
        have
        been
        unsuccessful.
        Any
        help
        would
        be
        much
        appreciated.

            Thanks.
            Sorry
            to
            be
            a
            pain,
            but
            I
            have
            a
            few
            questions:
            1.
            what
            is
            msg.some?
            2.
            what
            is
            r
            and
            why
            is
            it
            greater
            or
            equal
            to
            the
            array?
            3.
            what
            is
            .indexOf(r)
             gt;=0
            4.
            When
            I
            run
            this
            in
            my
            bot,
            this
            error
            appears:
