      I
      had
      this
      problem
      too
      and
      it
      was
      because
      I
      fell
      in
      the
      trap
      of
      thinking
      I
      had
      curly
      hair
      thanks
      to
      those
      money
      hungry
      curl
      products
      promoters.
      Just
      treat
      your
      hair
      like
      it's
      wavy/or
      a
      bit
      straight
      and
      it
      will
      be
      fine.
      My
      hair
      is
      finally
      bouncy
      and
      thiccc.
      I
      don't
      know
      what
      your
      hair
      looks
      like
      of
      course
      so
      I
      don't
      know
      how
      to
      give
      you
      tips
      but
      I'm
      reassuring
      you
      that
      there's
      a
      way
      out
      of
      it
      without
      an
      expensive
      treatment.

      know
      how
      to
      use
      photoshop,
      the
      desktop
      version?
      woah
      i'm
      amazed
      esp
      considering
      their
      ancestors
      on
      myspace
      really
      sucked
      at
      the
      "complicated"
      program
      photoshop
      the
      video
      is
      still
      interesting
      regardless

      the
      ideal
      femcel
      if
      she
      were
      drawn
      would
      be
      fat
      or
      chubbt
      at
      least
      almost
      at
      all
      times,
      though.
      but
      i
      agree
      that
      this
      woman
      looked
      normie
      and
      stacy
      ish

      I
      completely
      understand
      you,
      the
      feeling
      will
      pass
      by
      and
      I
      hope
      you'll
      feel
      better
      as
      soon
      as
      possible.
      Try
      to
      curb
      the
      future
      urges
      by
      doing
      something
      else.
      Heck
      even
      just
      shitposting
      online
      to
      kill
      boredom
      will
      do
      but
      productive
      hobby's
      are
      better.
      This
      includes
      watching
      a
      movie.
      Anything
      better
      than
      wasting
      your
      time
      with
      male
      loser
      you
      don't
      even
      know.
      If
      you
      wanna
      date
      online
      do
      it
      with
      someone
      who
      has
      already
      seen
      your
      profile
      picture.
      Take
      care!
      This
      is
      for
      everyone
      who
      is
      reading
      this:
      Don't
      ever
      ever
      ever
      ever
      send
      a
      selfie
      in
      DMs
      to
      a
      random
      guy

      even
      if
      you

      you
      look

      Better
      safe

      sorry.
      Impulsivity
      online
      is
      even
      greater
      than
      irl
      since
      it's
      just
      a
      matter
      of

      I
      just
      tried
      that
      yesterday
      and
      I
      woke
      up
      with
      pimples,
      everyone's
      skin
      is
      different
      but
      just
      putting
      this
      out
      there.
      This
      chart
      looks
      like
      a
      good
      basic
      routine
      for
      oily
      skin,
      though.
      For
      those
      who
      wear
      makeup,
      an
      oil
      cleanser
      and
      then
      a
      small
      rinse
      with
      a
      mild
      face
      wash
      to
      get
      rid
      of
      the
      oil
      is
      all
      you
      need.
      And
      use
      a
      sheetmask
      every
      night
      after
      you
      put
      on
      your
      creams
      for
      as
      long
      as
      the
      packaging
      says
      It
      made
      my
      skin
      on
      the
      way
      to
      near
      perfection.

      I
      use
      malie
      korean
      essence
      masks
      now
      since
      that's
      all
      I
      have
      since
      I
      got
      them
      in
      bulk,
      oh
      and
      I
      still
      have
      2
      really
      European
      (?)
      pharmacy
      brand
      sheet
      masks
      lol.
      I
      don't
      know
      if
      the
      more
      expensive
      brands
      truly
      work
      better
      but
      eh
      I
      can
      confirm
      that
      cheap
      sheetmasks
      do
      work
      fine
      as
      my
      skin
      glows.

      I'm
      so
      jealous
      ngl
      since
      I
      am
      going
      through
      this,
      but
      I'm
      also
      really
      happy
      of
      course
      since
      I
      noticed
      a
      lot
      of
      dads
      ditch
      financing
      their
      children
      they
      didn't
      raise!
      This
      is
      good!
      I
      wish
      I
      could
      see
      money
      from
      my
      WHO-"dad".

      Oh
      man...this
      is
      so
      depressing
      especially
      considering
      you're
      a
      very
      cute
      girl.
      Is
      it
      rude
      to
      ask
      you
      about
      that
      something
      that
      you
      say
      girls/boys
      don't
      like?
      Because
      you're
      coherent
      unlike
      me,
      wholesome
      and
      just
      so
      sweet.
      I
      hope
      I'll
      be
      just
      as
      cool
      as
      you
      at
      your
      age
      actually.
      Btw,
      there's
      also
      the
      kind
      of
      online
      dating
      where
      you'll
      meet
      on
      the
      same
      day/the
      next
      day.
      It's
      actually
      a
      bit
      better
      than
      gay
      bars
      but
      both
      are
      shit
      tbf.
      At
      a
      bar
      nobody's
      gonna
      want
      to
      marry
      anyone,
      you
      know
      that
      yourself.
      You
      just
      need
      to
      find
      gay
      women
      somewhere
      else
      other
      than
      bars.
      Also,
      I
      am
      so
      sorry
      for
      your
      losses.

      No
      need
      to
      say
      thanks,
      I
      enjoy
      reading
      your
      posts
      because
      I
      can
      relate
      to
      some
      of
      the
      things
      even
      though
      I'm
      23
      and
      you
      must
      think
      that's
      a
      pathetic
      thing
      to
      do
      considering
      my
      age,
      but
      really
      I
      am
      not
      just
      saying
      it.
      I
      suspect
      there's
      some
      other
      women
      here
      who
      go
      through
      the
      same
      stuff
      as
      you.
      Sorry
      for
      clicking
      on
      your
      profile
      btw,
      I
      don't
      like
      reddit
      so
      I
      don't
      usually
      click
      on
      profiles
      I
      just
      only
      did
      it
      this
      time
      out
      of
      curiosity.
      Anyways,
      maybe
      it's
      the
      photo
      but
      you
      don't
      look
      unapproachable
      at
      all
      to
      me!
      Your
      grandma
      was
      very
      wrong!
      And
      you
      can
      keep
      both
      lotsa
      cats
      and
      1
      girlfriend
      if
      you
      want
      to
      :3
      I
      think
      you
      should
      definitely
      try
      lurking
      the
      online
      realms
      to
      build
      up
      a
      lesbian
      network
      dating
      game.
      You're
      a
      decent
      person,
      pls
      don't
      think
      of
      yourself
      anything
      less
      because
      you're
      definitely
      decent
      -
      with
      and
      without
      a
      gf.
      I
      am
      pretty
      honest
      on
      this
      shithole
      of
      a
      website
      so
      I'm
      not
      just
      saying
      it.
      And
      to
      hear
      about
      the
      bullying
      in
      public
      is
      heartbreaking.
      You'd
      think
      they
      know
      better
      than
      to
      mess
      with
      someone
      who
      is
      both
      beautiful
      and
      tall.
      But
      people
      are
      stupid.
      Trust
      me,
      they
      are.
      It's
      fine
      to
      cry,
      btw!

      yes,
      it
      was
      more
      a
      passing
      thought
      if
      anything.
      i
      didn't
      want
      to
      offend
      anyone,
      i
      was
      just
      getting
      sick
      of
      the
      obvious
      male
      larpers
      that
      are
      still
      not

      was

      supposed
      to
      delete
      this

      but
      i
      forgot
      to

      I
      am
      23
      years
      old
      and
      went
      through
      the
      same
      as
      you,
      but
      I'm
      a
      loser
      now
      and
      you
      aren't
      and
      never
      were,
      you're
      attending
      uni
      right
      and
      you
      graduated
      highschool
      right?
      You're
      the
      smart
      girl
      with
      a
      career
      and
      the
      others
      are
      clueless,
      what's
      wrong
      with
      that?
      Oh
      but
      they
      wear
      a
      mini
      skirt
      and
      have
      1k
      likes
      from
      randoms
      they
      don't
      know
      so
      I
      guess
      that
      will
      bring
      them
      far.
      I
      wish
      I
      turned
      out
      to
      be
      like
      you,
      it
      would
      have
      made
      me
      have
      the
      last
      laugh.
      I
      get
      your
      pain
      though,
      but
      even
      though
      I'm
      now
      still
      a
      loser,
      I
      don't
      want
      to
      waste
      my
      time
      wishing
      for
      things
      that
      didn't
      happen,
      but
      instead
      I
      l'll
      waste
      my
      time
      working
      towards
      a
      better
      life
      even
      if
      it
      just
      means
      petty
      small
      things
      like
      how
      you
      view
      your
      social
      status
      daily
      (since
      I'm
      a
      loser
      and
      a
      poorfag
      almost
      on
      the
      streets
      that's
      not
      a
      thing
      I'm
      allowed
      to
      care
      about
      currently
      since
      I
      need
      to
      fix
      a
      lot
      of
      other
      things
      first...but
      you
      got
      your
      shit
      and
      definitely
      can
      -
      and
      it
      will
      be
      possible).
      Highschool
      for
      most
      of
      us
      if
      not
      all
      (what
      are
      you
      doing
      here
      if
      it
      wasn't?!
      jk)
      was
      painful,
      but
      we
      shouldn't
      dwell
      on
      the
      past
      even
      if
      it's
      tempting
      to
      do
      so.
      I'm
      not
      ashamed
      anymore
      of
      myself
      anymore
      either.
      Also
      fuck
      instagram
      and
      fashionova
      lmfao,
      I
      detest
      it
      and
      I
      would
      only
      like
      it
      if
      they'd
      pay
      me.
       #128580;
      I
      think
      if
      you're
      not
      already
      doing
      it
      that
      you
      should
      attend
      psychology
      sessions
      and
      make
      the
      best
      out
      of
      this
      year,
      both
      in
      grades
      and
      your
      daily
      happiness
      like
      making
      friends.
      And
      try
      to
      be
      confident
      so
      you
      are
      comfortable
      in
      your
      skin.
      Be
      you,
      forever.
      Don't
      be
      someone
      you're
      not.
      It's
      no
      longer
      high
      school
      so
      you
      got
      a
      fresh
      new
      chance.
      Also
      I
      hope
      you
      don't
      live
      with
      your
      parents
      or
      (shit)
      room
      mates
      since
      it
      definitely
      could
      hinder
      your
      grades
      if
      they
      interact
      with
      you
      still.
      If
      you
      want
      to
      attend
      a
      party,
      just
      do
      so.
      I
      rather
      go
      to
      a
      concert
      or
      nicely
      organized
      event
      though.
      Most
      parties
      are
      organized
      by
      literal
      WHOs
      and
      you
      could
      always
      attend
      them
      with
      a
      drunk
      acquintance
      and
      pretend
      you're
      besties
      on
      snapchat
      like
      they
      all
      do.
      You're
      young
      though
      and
      it's
      completely
      normal
      to
      feel
      like
      this.
      But
      try
      not
      to
      hate
      yourself
      for
      real
      or
      for
      too
      long,
      ok?

      It's

      I'm

      I'm

      the
      same
      ethnicity
      groups
      as
      me
      and
      there's
      not
      a
      single
      guy
      who
      was
      OK
      with
      it.
      (no
      I
      never
      dated
      someone,
      but
      I
      did
      talk
      as
      acquintances
      to
      them
      or
      a
      bit
      online.)
      Funny
      right?
      Yes
      it's
      so
      bad
      to
      care
      in
      2k19
      but
      they're
      forcing
      me
      to
      feel
      embarassed
      about
      it,
      but
      then
      I
      think
      "fuck
      off".
      So
      I
      will
      tell
      him
      to
      his
      face
      that
      later
      when
      I
      see
      him
      and
      also
      that
      he's
      gross.
      I'm
      saying
      this
      because
      in
      my
      life
      when
      I
      tried
      approaching
      guys
      of
      ALL
      ethnicities
      they
      all
      hated
      my
      culture(s),
      and
      they
      all
      flatout
      laughed
      and
      me
      and
      disrespected
      it,
      and
      my
      stomach
      honestly
      gets
      sick.
      Back
      then
      I
      hated
      my
      ethnicity
      now
      I
      just
      hate
      the
      ones
      who
      hate
      my
      ethnicity
      lol.
      Anyways
      that
      guy
      was
      gross
      anyways
      but
      I'm
      still
      wishing
      lowkey
      one
      day
      for
      a
      guy
      who
      doesn't
      care
      where
      I'm
      from.
      Or
      perhaps
      I'll
      find
      a
      guy
      who
      is
      like
      me
      and
      is
      happy
      to
      finally
      find
      the
      same
      mix
      as
      me
      :p.
      I
      just
      want
      my
      hours
      back
      because
      I
      wasted
      so
      much
      time.
      He's
      the
      first
      guy
      in
      a
      year
      I've
      been
      talking
      to
      (only
      for
      a
      few
      hours,
      mind
      you).
      I
      was
      impulsive
      and
      weak
      I
      guess
      to
      not
      straight
      up
      tell
      him
      off,
      but
      at
      the
      same
      time
      I'm
      glad
      the
      moment
      he
      started
      to
      disrespect
      me
      I
      was
      being
      obvious
      with
      friendzoning
      him.
      But
      my
      do
      I
      wish
      I
      insulted
      him
      instead
      of
      giving
      boys
      a
      chance
      to
      again
      humiliate
      me.
      Can
      anyone
      relate
      with
      this
      specific
      kind
      of
      belittling?

      down.

      is
      but
      still,
      CHILLE.
      It's
      just
      the
      internet.
      Take
      a
      break.
      Breathe
      some
      air.
      Anyways

      the
      equivalent
      of
      where
      i
      live
      of
      this
      is
      what
      I
      drink
      all
      the
      time.
      btw,
      "better"
      brands
      (aka
      the
      brands
      people
      consider
      to
      be
      better)
      can
      have
      sales
      where
      those
      shelf
      stable
      milk
      boxes
      are
      a
      better
      investment
      usually
      because
      they're
      a
      lot
      cheaper
      than
      the
      cheap
      dollar
      store
      brands,
      trust
      me.
      Get
      it
      in
      bulk,
      both
      the
      fresh
      ones
      (not
      too
      many
      of
      course)
      and
      the
      shelf
      stable
      ones,
      your
      tastebuds
      (fresh
      milk
      is
      HNNNGG)
      and
      wallet
      will
      thank
      you.
      I'd
      say
      you
      should
      lurk
      sales
      from
      near
      supermarkets.

      Hey,
      I'm
      just
      bantering
      you.
      Your
      gimmick
      is
      kinda
      funny
      troll
      or
      not.
      I'm
      ngl
      though
      I'm
      sad
      about
      you
      posting
      this
      ethnic
      lady
      considering
      she
      makes
      herself
      look
      more
      western
      and
      she's
      cool

      I
      don't
      want
      any
      moid/foid
      who's
      reading
      along
      to
      even
      gniffle,
      and
      for
      anonymity
      I
      think
      it
      might
      be
      better
      to
      keep
      this
      one
      a
      mystery.

      It
      does
      happen
      to
      mixed
      people
      often?
      That
      gives
      me
      some
      solace
      actually!
      And
      what
      you
      said
      made
      me
      smile,
      haha.
      It's
      true
      but
      I
      don't
      wanna
      be
      ridiculed
      or
      memed.
      Idk,
      I
      guess
      I
      need
      to
      become
      even
      more
      tactical
      who
      I
      approach.

      Yeah
      but
      those
      ones
      are
      legit
      creepy,
      the
      asiaboos
      of
      all
      kinds
      take
      it
      to
      the
      whole
      next
      level
      for
      some
      fucking
      reason
      and
      it's
      really
      weird,
      but
      sometimes
      it's
      cute
      when
      it's
      at
      a
      tame
      and/or
      genuine
      level
      despite
      the
      big
      cringe
      ones
      ruining
      it.
      I
      have
      yet
      to
      meet
      someone
      who
      respects
      my
      culture(s)
      but
      I
      know
      that
      if
      I
      do
      find
      someone
      irl
      or
      even
      online
      who
      genuinely
      loves
      my
      culture(s),
      I'd
      just
      be
      like
      "awww"
      even
      if
      they'd
      be
      so
      cringe.
