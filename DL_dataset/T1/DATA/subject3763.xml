      say
      peak

      1-4
      and
      it
      went
      downhill
      after
      5.
      Did
      last

      feel

      season
      5-7
      or
      back
      to
      its
      prime?
      Obviously
      the
      story
      was
      more
      5-7,
      but
      I #8217;m
      talking

      acting,
      directing

      I
      was
      thinking
      about
      a
      food
      truck
      business
      but
      I
      think
      a
      beer
      bar
      bike
      makes
      more
      sense.
      It
      would
      be
      a
      much
      cheaper
      price
      in
      almost
      all
      aspects;
      vehicle,
      number
      of
      employees,
      product
      (beer
      is
      long
      lasting
      as
      opposed
      to
      food
      that
      constantly
      needs
      to
      be
      changed)
      I
      was
      curious
      to
      get
      some
      insight
      why
      this
      would
      be
      a
      good
      and
      also
      bad
      idea.
      Basically
      the
      pros
      and
      cons.
      Compared
      to
      a
      food
      truck
      does
      this
      seem
      like
      a
      better
      financial
      investment?

      So
      what
      would
      happen
      if
      you
      couldn #8217;t
      find
      evidence
      that
      it
      was
      hacked?
      At
      this
      point
      would
      the
      defendant
      be
      found
      not
      guilty
      because
      the
      burden
      of
      proof
      is
      on
      the
      prosecutor?
      Or
      would
      the
      defendant
      be
      found
      guilty
      because
      it
      is
      beyond
      reasonable
      thinking
      to
      think
      he
      was
      hacked
      without
      evidence
      left
      behind?

      the
      only
      one
      who
      thought
      this
      was
      classic
      game
      of
      thrones?
      Game
      of
      thrones
      has
      always
      been
      depressingly
      realistic
      in
      how
      people
      behave.
      Jaime
      did
      change
      for
      the
      better,
      he
      became
      more
      caring
      and
      legit
      felt
      bad
      for
      the
      things
      he
      had
      done.
      But
      he #8217;s
      not
      going
      to
      just
      stop
      loving
      the
      woman
      he #8217;s
      been
      with
      for
      over
      30
      years.
      It #8217;s
      psychology.
      Love
      is
      a
      drug.
      How
      many
      people
      do
      you
      know
      who
      stay
      in
      toxic
      relationships
      all

      A

      Everybody
      agreed
      that
      she
      wasn #8217;t
      an
      asshole.
      I
      decided
      to
      do
      the
      same
      exact
      thing
      except
      I #8217;m
      a

      wanted
      my

      to

      Everybody
      said
      the
      man
      was
      an
      asshole
      in

      change
      I
      would
      make
       #8212;
      Instead
      of
      the
      government
      exiling
      Jon,
      he
      exiles
      himself.
      As
      the
      last
      Targaryen
      the
      throne
      is
      his,
      and
      Tyrion,
      Sansa,
      and
      all
      the
      other
      lords
      want
      him
      to
      have
      it.
      However,
      he
      refuses.
      He
      swore
      an
      oath
      to
      Daenerys
      and
      he
      broke
      it.
      He
      is
      an
      oath
      breaker.
      Everybody
      tries
      to
      convince
      him
      that
      he
      did
      the
      right
      thing,
      Tyrion
      tells
      him
      he
      should
      focus
      more
      on
      the
      big
      picture
      and
      that
      the
      realm
      will
      be
      a
      better
      place
      for
      everybody
      with
      him
      in
      charge.
      Tyrion
      tries
      to
      tell
      him
      it #8217;s
      selfish
      in
      a
      way
      for
      him
      to
      value
      his
      honor
      over
      the
      good
      of
      others.
      It
      doesn #8217;t
      matter
      to
      Jon.
      Like
      Ned,
      he
      thinks
      very
      black
      and
      white
      and
      can #8217;t
      see
      any
      type
      of
      bigger
      picture.
      Jon
      refuses
      the
      throne
      because
      of
      his
      sense
      of
      honor
      and
      exiles
      himself
      to
      a
      life
      of
      hardship
      because
      he
      believes
      his
      punishment
      for
      oath
      breaking
      shouldn #8217;t
      be
      less
      than
      that
      of
      a
      commoner.
      This
      wouldn #8217;t
      change
      much.
      But
      I
      believe
      it
      will
      add
      some
      character
      back
      to
      the
      characters.
      Obviously
      Grey
      Worm
      would
      have
      had
      to
      surrender
      to
      all
      the
      northern
      forces
      for
      this
      to
      work.

      This
      happened
      to
      a
      friend
      of
      mine.
      Say
      a
      young
      man,
      age
      21,
      drove
      his
      car
      into
      a
      tree
      while
      drunk.
      When
      the
      police
      tell
      him
      to
      walk
      in
      a
      straight
      line
      ,
      he
      struggles.
      He
      gives
      his
      name
      and
      address
      but
      refuses
      to
      answer
      any
      other
      questions.
      When
      he
      is
      given
      a
      breathalyzer,
      he
      refuses
      and
      is
      taken
      to
      jail.
      At
      the
      station
      he
      is
      given
      a
      breathalyzer,
      he
      pretends
      to
      blow
      in
      it
      by
      making
      a
      face
      but
      is
      not
      actually
      blowing.
      Results
      are
      n/a.
      The
      test
      is
      given
      again.
      Again,
      n/a.
      A
      separate
      device
      is
      used
      this
      time,
      but
      again
      n/a.
      The
      prosecutors
      main
      arguments
      according
      to
      the
      lawyer
      are:
      1.)
      He
      was
      acting
      disoriented.
      2.)
      He
      was
      struggling
      to
      walk.
      3.)
      He
      smelled
      strongly
      of
      alcohol.
      4.)
      He
      was
      slurring
      words
      No
      objective
      measurement
      of
      his
      BAC
      being
      .08
      or
      higher
      has
      been
      recorded.
      Does
      he
      have
      a
      chance?

      Sorry
      I
      should
      have
      been
      more
      specific,
      a

      at

      guilty
      of
      a
      DUI.
      There #8217;s
      no
      proof
      he
      was
      deliberately
      screwing
      up
      the
      tests
      though.

      But
      why?
      He
      is
      legally
      allowed
      to
      refuse
      a
      field
      sobriety
      test
      (in
      Virginia).
      1.
      He
      was
      acting
      disoriented
      -He
      just
      got
      into
      a
      car
      accident.
      It #8217;s
      not
      unreasonable
      to
      assume
      that
      someone
      who
      just
      got
      into
      a
      car
      accident
      has
      suffered
      head
      trauma.
      2.
      He
      was
      struggling
      to
      walk.
      -Again,
      he
      got
      into
      a
      car
      accident,
      it #8217;s
      not
      unreasonable
      to
      think
      that
      someone
      who
      just
      got
      into
      a
      car
      accident
      has
      injured
      their
      leg.
      3.
      He
      smells
      of
      alcohol.
      -Smelling
      like
      alcohol
      doesn #8217;t
      mean
      you #8217;re
      drunk,
      it
      means
      you
      smell
      like
      alcohol.
      4.
      He
      was
      slurring
      words
      -Nobody
      on
      the
      prosecuting
      team
      has
      heard
      him
      speak
      before.
      How
      do
      they
      know
      he
      doesn #8217;t
      always
      talk
      like
      that?

      1)
      Wealthy
      people
      are
      more
      likely
      to
      rape
      because
      they #8217;ve
      become
      so
      bored
      with
      their
      lives
      that
      they

      seek
      out
      what
      is

      2)
      Wealthy
      people
      are
      less
      likely
      to
      rape
      because
      being
      rich
      makes
      them
      more
      attractive
      to
      women,
      therefore
      reducing
      the
      need
      to
      rape.
      Both
      of
      these
      statements
      sound
      true
      even
      though
      theyre
      complete
      opposites.
      You
      need
      evidence
      to
      back
      up
      your
      claims.

      I
      went
      to
      r/pics
      thinking
      it
      would
      mainly
      be
      about
      aesthetically
      pleasing

      Not

      but
      actual
      good
      pictures
      that
      amateur
      photographers
      took.
      Like
      this:
      https://images.app.goo.gl/DUmzMvjfr3JAhWiJA
      But
      all
      it
      is,
      is
      just
      people
      taking
      selfies
      of
      themselves
      with
      the
      caption
       #8220;1
      year
      sober! #8221;
      Or
      some
      dude
      picking
      up
      trash.
      Good
      for
      you
      for
      helping
      our
      planet
      and
      good

      doesn #8217;t
      mean

      Thank
      for

      responding.
      No
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      you #8217;re
      being
      condescending
      either.
      1.)
      Scientific
      theories/facts
      and
      the
      innocence/guilt
      of
      a
      person,

      should

      with
      the
      same
      logic.
      If
      we
      have
      a
      theory
      in
      science
      and
      it

      nobody

      therefore,
      it #8217;s
      ok
      to
      believe
      in
      a
      theory
      even
      though
      it
      can #8217;t
      be
      proven

      reasonable
      doubt.
      Sending
      people
      to
      prison
      is
      completely
      different.
      People
      suffer
      because
      of
      it.
      If
      we
      lived
      in
      a
      world
      where
      proof
      beyond
      reasonable
      doubt
      was
      not
      needed
      to
      prove
      guilt,
      the
      world
      would
      be
      chaos.
       #8220;How
      do
      you
      know
      the
      earth
      is
      round #8221;
      is
      a
      false
      equivalence
      to

      you
      know

      2.)
      Moderately.
      I
      defiantly
      have
      not
      been
      paying
      as
      much
      attention
      as
      people
      on
      this
      sub.
      I #8217;d
      say
      most
      of
      my
      news
      come
      from
      primarily
      conservative
      sources,
      which
      is
      why
      I
      want
      to
      hear
      opinions
      from
      liberals
      atm.

      I
      don #8217;t
      condone
      driving
      drunk
      and
      I
      gave
      him
      a
      lot
      of
      shit
      for
      it,
      this
      however
      is
      an
      interesting
      story
      and
      display
      of
      the
      law.
      A
      friend
      of
      mine
      was
      being
      an
      idiot
      and
      drove
      a
      car
      into
      a
      residents
      tree
      while
      drunk.
      The
      homeowner
      called
      911.
      My
      friend
      refused
      to
      take
      the
      field
      breathalyzer
      and
      was
      handcuffed
      and
      taken
      to
      jail.
      In
      jail
      he
      blew
      into
      three
      different
      breathalyzers
      but
      he
      was
      only
      pretending
      to
      blow,
      all
      three
      results
      came
      out
      as
      an
      error.
      He
      was
      still
      of
      course
      given
      a
      trial
      date.
      He
      smelled
      of
      alcohol,
      was
      slurring
      his
      words,
      couldn #8217;t
      walk
      in
      a
      straight
      line,
      was
      vomiting,
      and
      was
      acting
      disoriented.
      I
      thought
      he
      was
      done.
      His
      lawyer
      had
      amazing
      arguments
      though.
      He
      was
      struggling
      to
      walk.
       #8220;He
      just
      got
      into
      a
      big
      car
      accident,
      is
      it
      not
      reasonable
      to
      think
      he
      is
      struggling
      to
      walk
      because
      he
      simply
      injured
      his
      leg? #8221;
      He
      was
      acting
      disoriented.
       #8220;Again,
      he
      just
      got
      into
      a
      big
      car
      accident,
      is
      it
      not
      reasonable
      to
      think
      is
      suffered
      head
      trauma
      and
      could
      have
      had
      a
      concussion? #8221;
      He
      was
      slurring
      his
      words.
       #8220;Have
      you
      ever
      heard
      him
      talk
      before?
      How
      do
      you
      know
      he
      doesn #8217;t
      always
      talk
      like
      that?
      How
      do
      you
      know
      he
      doesn #8217;t
      have
      a
      speech
      problem?
      How
      do
      you
      know
      he
      wasn #8217;t
      just
      nervous
      or
      having
      a
      reaction? #8221;
      He
      smelled
      like
      alcohol.
       #8220;This
      doesn #8217;t
      prove
      his
      BAC
      level,
      it
      proves
      he
      smells
      like
      alcohol. #8221;
      The
      judge
      looked
      at
      my
      friend
      and
      said
       #8220;I
      think
      you
      were
      drinking
      that
      night,
      but
      because
      of
      the
      failed
      breathalyzers
      and
      your
      great
      lawyer
      I #8217;m
      going
      to
      have
      to
      find
      you
      not
      guilty.
      This
      is
      your
      wake
      up
      call,
      the
      universe
      is
      telling
      you
      to
      change #8221;
      I
      was
      blown
      away,
      I #8217;ve
      never
      heard
      such
      amazing
      arguments
      and
      debate
      skills
      before.
      Lawyers
      are
      incredible.

      I
      have
      anxiety
      problems
      when
      it
      comes
      to
      women,
      not
      sure
      if
      I #8217;m
      overthinking
      anything
      here.
      So
      I
      met
      a
      girl
      from
      tinder
      about
      two
      weeks
      ago.
      We
      went
      mini
      golfing
      then
      for
      drinks
      later.
      Teasing,
      flirting,
      serious
      debates,
      it
      was
      alot
      of
      fun.
      She
      even
      paid
      for
      my
      dinner
      and
      drinks
      because
      of
      a
      bet
      we
      made
      in
      mini
      golf
      lol.
      End
      of
      the
      night
      we
      make
      out.
      Second
      date,
      we
      go
      to
      an
      expensive
      restaurant
      that
      she
      recommend.
      Good
      time
      and
      I
      got
      the
      bill
      that
      time.
      $90.
      After
      that
      we
      went
      to
      bar
      and
      had
      some
      drinks,
      she
      paid
      for
      me
      even
      though
      I
      told
      her
      not
      too.
      About
      $15.
      She
      showed
      me
      a
      text
      she
      sent
      her
      friend
      because
      it
      was
      relevant
      to
      what
      we
      were
      talking
      about,
      I
      scrolled
      up
      to
      read
      the
      rest
      and
      I
      saw
      her
      friend
      send
      the
      message
       #8220;yeah
      make
      him
      pay
      haha #8221;
      and
      she
      snatched
      the
      phone
      away.
      After
      the
      date
      we
      went
      to
      her
      car,
      I
      fingered
      her
      a
      bit
      and
      was
      trying
      to
      unzip
      my
      pants.
      I
      put
      a
      stop
      to
      it
      as
      I #8217;m
      applying
      for
      a
      government
      job.
      An
      arrest
      for
      public
      sex
      would

      career
      goals.
      I
      say
      let #8217;s
      go
      back
      to
      her
      house
      but
      she
      says
      no
      so
      I
      went
      home.
      After
      that
      we
      texted
      a
      bit
      as
      we
      normally
      would.
      One
      night
      I
      ask
      her
      for
      drinks
      and
      she
      said
      she
      can #8217;t
      because
      she
      was
      with
      her
      friends
      but
      could
      tomorrow.
      Next
      day
      I
      texted
      her
      around
      10pm
      for
      drinks
      and
      she
      said
       #8220;now?
      I #8217;m
      cooking
      dude #8221;.
      I
      didn #8217;t
      reply.
      5
      days
      went
      by.
      I
      didn #8217;t
      message
      her
      and
      she
      didn #8217;t
      message
      me.
      She
      sent
      me
      one
      message
      yesterday
      on
      Snapchat
      because
      my
      story
      showed
      I
      was
      at
      the
      restaurant
      we
      went
      to.
      She
      just
      said
       #8220;glad
      I
      made
      you
      like
      that
      place #8221;
      I
      don #8217;t
      know
      if
      I #8217;m
      right
      to
      want
      to
      next
      her
      or
      if
      I #8217;m
      being
      autistic
      about
      this.
      Her
      friend
      and
      her
      were
      maybe
      joking
      about
      me
      paying
      for
      her
      expensive
      dinner,
      but
      she
      paid
      for
      my
      dinner
      earlier
      and
      bought
      me
      drinks
      just
      an
      hour
      later.
      Is
      it
      really
      beta
      bux
      in
      that
      situation?
      She
      did
      want
      to
      fuck
      or
      at
      the
      very
      least
      give
      me
      a
      hand
      job
      in
      her
      car
      so
      it
      shows
      she
      actually
      did
      want
      me
      sexually.
      But
      then
      why
      would
      she
      go
      silent
      after
      she
      said
      she
      was
      busy
      for
      a
      date?

      I #8217;m
      comparing
      being
      bullied
      to
      being
      bullied.
      Your

      was
      that
      because
      he
      is
       #8220;45 #8221;
      he
      is
      past
      the
      age
      of
      being
      bullied.
      A
      black
      man
      can
      still
      be
      bullied
      for
      being
      black
      at
      age
      45
      as
      can
      a
      short
      man.
      Unless
      you #8217;re
      a
      5
      foot
      tall
      45
      year

      man
      how

      you

      So
      no
      matter
      what
      happens
      poor
      people
      should
      always
      be
      miserable?
      No
      matter
      how
      far
      we
      advance,
      no
      matter
      how
      much
      better
      we
      become
      as
      a
      society,
      there
      will
      always
      be
      people
      below
      the
      average.
      It #8217;s
      just
      mathematics.
      It #8217;s
      called
      the
      hedonic
      treadmill.
      50
      years
      from
      now,
      We
      could
      raise
      minimum
      wage,
      find
      the
      cure
      for
      cancer,
      get
      more
      affordable
      healthcare,
      invent
      a
      teleportation
      device,
      and
      still,
      poor
      people
      will
      be
      miserable
      even
      though
      their
      lives
      would
      be
      what
      we
      dream
      of.
      Being
      upset
      because
      you #8217;re
      in
      the
      97th
      percentile
      of
      humanity
      instead
      of
      the
      99th
      percentile
      is
      a
      miserable
      mind
      set
      to
      have.

      I
      was
      disappointed
      with
      this
      episode.
      A
      part
      of
      me
      thinks
      trumps
      a
      bit
      racist
      and
      I
      really
      wanted
      to
      see
      crowder
      make
      intelligent
      arguments
      as
      to
      why
      he #8217;s
      not.
      Instead
      it
      was
      just
      a
      video
      of
      him
      debating
      someone
      with
      legitimate
      mental
      issues.

      I

      he
      was

      until
      his

      home #8221;
      comments.
      Every

      thing
      he
      said
      prior
      I

      I #8217;m
      sure
      you #8217;ve
      heard
      the
      saying.
      Be
      kind

      shit
      talk
      you

      you.
      I
      thought
      it
      was
      sappy
      and
      weak

      I #8217;m
      a
      25
      y/o
      Male.
      A
      few
      days
      ago
      I
      went
      to
      a
      bar
      with
      a
      tinder
      date.
      I
      texted
      a
      friend
      of
      mine
      what
      she
      was
      doing
      that
      night
      and
      she
      said
      she
      was
      going
      clubbing
      with
      our
      group
      of
      friends.
      About
      an
      hour
      later
      she
      texts
      me
      asking
      me
      if
      I
      was
      still
      going
      to
      the
      bar
      and
      what
      time
      I #8217;d
      be
      there.
      She
      made
      it
      seem
      as
      if
      she
      wanted
      to
      come.
      The
      convo
      went
      like
      this:
      Her:
      Are
      you
      there
      yet?
      Me:
      Yeah
      Her:
      Do
      you
      have
      to
      pay
      to
      get
      in?
      Me:
      Yeah
      but
      don #8217;t
      come
      if
      it #8217;s
      just
      you
      though.
      (She
      replied
      before
      I
      could
      explain)
      Her:
      Wow
      Me:
      I #8217;m
      on
      a
      date
      and
      that
      might
      make
      it
      awkward
      lol
      Me:
      It #8217;s
      not
      personal
      it
      would
      just
      be
      weird
      if
      I
      went
      on
      a
      date
      with
      her
      and
      brought
      a
      female
      coworker
      you
      know.
      A
      group
      would
      be
      fine
      but
      just
      us
      three
      would
      be
      weird.
      She
      didn #8217;t
      reply.
      Was
      I
      an
      asshole?

      so
      I #8217;m

      she
      did.
      This
      was
      2

      ago,
      she #8217;s
      had

      She

      News
      came
      out
      recently
      that
      she
      only
      made
      $12,000
      from
      her
      3
      months
      of
      porn
      and
      many
      Reddit
      users
      were
      talking
      about
      how
      wrong
      that
      is.
      It
      isn #8217;t.
      It #8217;s
      completely
      fair.
      She
      signed
      her
      porn
      contracts
      before
      she
      was
      a
      big
      name,
      when
      she
      was
      a
      nobody.
      Why
      would
      a
      company
      pay
      big
      bucks
      to
      a
      nobody
      to
      do
      a
      job
      that
      requires
      virtually
      no
      talent.
      If
      she
      signed
      today
      she #8217;d
      make
      huge
      bucks
      due
      to
      her
      name.
      People
      were
      complaining
      that
      she
      didn #8217;t
      even
      make
      as
      much
      as
      a
      normal
      office
      worker
      would.
      Ok?
      Good.
      Most
      office
      jobs
      require
      degrees
      and
      real
      skills,
      I #8217;m
      sorry
      that
      sucking
      a
      cock
      doesn #8217;t
      make
      you
      6
      figures.

      much
      viewed

      a

      Islam
      is

      is

      even

      Because

      I

      make

      I
      don #8217;t
      agree

      what
      I #8217;m

      is
      that
      this
      is
      how
      society
      (wrongly)
      views
      race
      and
      religion.
      It #8217;s
      ok

      the

      on

      not

      What
      I
      mean
      by
      that
      is
      that
      Christianity
      is
      viewed
      in
      the
      west
      the
      same
      way,
      being
      a
      man
      is
      viewed,
      the
      same
      way
      being
      straight
      is
      viewed,
      and
      the
      same
      way
      being
      white
      is
      viewed.
      They
      are
      viewed
      as
      the
      group
      who
      has
      power,
      so
      it #8217;s
      viewed
      (incorrectly
      in
      my
      opinion)
      ok
      to
      make
      fun
      of
      them.

      All
      ideas
      should
      be
      criticized.
      Religion
      is
      just
      that,
      an
      idea.
      It #8217;s
      not
      your
      skin
      color,
      it #8217;s
      not
      your
      dna,
      it #8217;s
      not
      your
      genetics,
      it #8217;s
      a
      subjective
      belief
      that
      you
      choose
      to
      believe
      in.
      If
      someone
      says
      the
      earth
      is
      flat,
      people
      would
      have
      no
      problem
      telling
      him
      he #8217;s
      wrong
      to
      his
      face.
      It
      would
      he
      viewed
      as
      justified
      to
      unfriend
      him
      or
      walk
      out
      on
      him
      on
      a
      first
      date.
      But
      if
      he
      said
       #8220;I
      believe
      everytime
      a
      rooster
      crows
      it #8217;s
      because
      it
      saw
      an
      angel #8221;
      we
      all
      have
      to
      be
      tolerant
      and
      accepting
      of
      that
      idiotic
      belief.
      Why?
      He #8217;s
      not
      being
      unfriended
      on
      Facebook
      due
      to
      his
      skin
      color,
      his
      tinder
      date
      is
      walking
      out
      on
      him
      due
      to
      his
      genetics.
      It #8217;s
      due
      to
      his
      ridiculous
      backwards
      beliefs,
      no
      different
      that
      believing
      the
      earth
      is
      flat
      or
      believing
      frogs
      are
      the
      souls
      of
      our
      dead
      relatives.
      (And
      yes,
      the
      rooster
      crowing
      is
      from
      a
      mainstream
      religion.
      But
      if
      I
      type
      the
      name
      of
      that
      religion
      my
      post
      gets
      removed
      for
      racism...proving
      my

      The

      say
      that
      men
      should
      hit

      homosexuality
      is
      immoral,
      and
      apostates
      should
      be
      killed.
      Does
      it

      me
      an

      Ask
      yourself
      why
      nothing
      good
      would
      come
      from
      it.
      It #8217;s
      because
      the
      general
      public
      is
      still
      very
      much
      against
      criticizing
      religion,
      as
      religion
      is
      still
      viewed
      similarly
      to
      race.
      Your
      ceo,
      your
      coworkers,
      the
      public,
      would
      not
      care
      if
      you
      openly
      criticized
      nazis
      and
      white
      nationalists
      at
      work.
      Even
      as
      a
      representation
      of
      the
      company
      your
      company
      would
      not
      be
      upset
      at
      you
      for
      bashing
      those
      groups
      on
      company
      time.
      My
      argument
      is
      that
      society
      as
      a
      whole
      need
      to
      stop
      treating
      religion
      as
      something
      that
      can #8217;t
      be
      evil
      and
      can #8217;t
      be
      attacked.
      Islam
      has
      just
      as
      many
      terrible
      beliefs
      as
      Nazism
      and
      should
      be
      treated
      equally
      as
      such.

      My

      gone

      I
      drove
      a
      couple
      hours
      to
      see
      her.
      She #8217;s
      living
      at
      home
      with
      her
      parents
      and
      this
      was
      my
      first
      time
      meeting
      them.
      She #8217;s
      Indian.
      Her
      dad
      is
      cool.
      Her
      mom,
      right
      in
      front
      of
      me
      says

      her,
       #8220;is
      this
      the
      one
      who
      isn #8217;t
      a

       #8220;all
      the
      doctors
      and
      you
      pick
      one
      who
      isn #8217;t #8221;
      I
      was
      like
      wtf.
      We
      left
      the
      house
      and
      I
      tried
      not
      to
      care.
      But
      she
      kept
      talking
      and
      I
      snapped.
      I
      yell
      at
      her
       #8220;are
      YOU
      a
      doctor? #8221;
      She
      says
      no
      and
      I
      reply
       #8220;so
      your
      husband
      shouldn #8217;t
      have
      married
      you
      right? #8221;
      she
      gets
      pissed
      and
      starts
      yelling
      at
      me.
      My
      girlfriend
      starts
      getting
      teary
      eyed
      and
      tells
      me
      to
      please
      stop
      so
      I
      did.
      As
      we
      walk
      to
      the
      car
      the
      mom
      is
      still
      yelling,
      my
      girlfriend
      runs
      to
      her
      mom,
      still
      crying,
      and
      hugs
      her
      goodbye.

      media
      I
      read
      things
      like,
       #8220;you
      deserve
      someone
      who
      will
      love
      you
      for
      you. #8221;
      I #8217;ll
      go
      onto
      subreddits
      and
      read
      threads
      titled
       #8220;I
      don #8217;t
      deserve
      love #8221;
      with
      reply #8217;s
      saying
       #8220;yes
      you
      do,
      everybody
      deserves
      love #8221;
      No
      you
      don #8217;t.
      You
      do
      not
      DESERVE
      love.
      Do
      I
      deserve
      a
      girlfriend?
      No.
      If
      I
      want
      a
      girlfriend
      I
      have
      to
      make
      the
      effort
      of
      finding
      someone
      I #8217;m
      compatible
      with
      and
      I
      have
      to
      work
      at
      making
      our
      relationship
      successful.
      But
      no,
      I
      do
      not
      DESERVE
      one.
      Same
      with
      friends.
      Same
      with
      a
      close
      relationship
      with
      my
      family.
      I
      do
      not
      DESERVE
      these
      things,
      if
      I
      want
      them
      I
      have
      to
      make
      them
      happen.
      If
      you
      can #8217;t
      find
      love
      you
      have
      to
      be
      pragmatic
      about
      it
      ,
      understand
      what
      your
      flaws
      are,
      understand
      why
      your
      relationships
      are
      failing,
      and
      fix
      the
      problem.
      You
      don #8217;t
      deserve
      love
      just
      because
      you
      exist.
