      It
      was
      raining
      hard,
      I
      was
      in
      the
      middle
      of
      a
      hurricane
      that
      was
      just
      starting.
      I #8217;m
      driving
      on
      a
      long
      dark
      road,
      I
      thought
      to
      myself
      I
      need
      to
      slow
      down
      a
      little
      more.
      Right
      after
      I
      slowed
      down
      a
      driver
      who
      was
      speeding
      had
      his
      car
      flip
      right
      over
      the
      hood
      of
      mine
      and
      hit
      a
      light
      pole.
      If
      I
      was
      going
      just
      a
      mile
      or
      two
      more
      over
      the
      speed
      I
      was
      going
      it
      would
      of
      been
      a
      bad
      wreck
      for
      me.

      I

      war

      have

      big
      sudden
      historical
      events
      are
      true
      to
      this.
      Also
      think
      it #8217;s
      interesting
      durning

      If
      you #8217;re
      wondering
      how
      I #8217;m
      replying
      fast
      it #8217;s
      simply
      because
      I #8217;m
      on
      a
      24
      hour
      shift
      and
      sitting
      at
      a
      desk
      currently.
      Anyways
      I #8217;m
      aware.
      We
      found
      killed
      and
      slaughtered
      them
      in
      a
      fair
      fight.
      We
      won
      the
      land.
      These
      were
       #8220;innocent
      little
      Indians #8221;
      these
      were
      savages.
      There
      are
      good
      and
      bad
      parts
      of
      history.
      They
      put
      up
      a
      good
      fight.
      Still
      wondering
      how
      this
      correlates
      to
      us
      now
      being
      a
      predominately
      white
      nation
      and
      how
      being
      white
      inside
      of
      it
      is
      some
      sort
      of
      privilege?

      They

      put
      above
      citizens
      and
      veterans
      of

      They
      are
      here
      illegally.
      That #8217;s
      what
      I
      dislike.
      I #8217;m
      aware
      we
      were
      not
      a
      white
      nation
      when
      we
      invaded
      killed
      and
      slaughtered
      Indians
      in
      a
      good
      fight.
      But
      it #8217;s
      how
      we
      came
      to
      be.

      Interesting
      read.
      Personally
      I
      have
      no
      problem
      with
      invading
      and
      taking
      over
      a
      nation
      or
      tribe
      in
      this
      case
      if
      it
      means
      the
      betterment
      of
      our
      nation.
      As
      a
      citizen
      of
      another
      nation
      should
      be
      with
      their
      own
      nation.

      I
      was
      in
      a
      little
      conference
      room
      at
      a
      blood
      bank
      (cooldown
      room
      -
      I #8217;m
      a
      medic
      and
      was
      just
      giving
      blood
      because
      that
      shits
      expensive
      and
      a
      lot
      of
      blood
      can
      be
      used
      to
      save
      one
      life).
      I
      was
      fine
      and
      talking
      with
      some
      other
      people
      when
      I
      seen
      this
      girl
      who
      seemed
      off,
      I
      go
      over
      and
      try
      to
      talk
      to
      her
      but
      it #8217;s
      clear
      they
      took
      way
      to
      much
      blood
      for
      her
      body
      weight
      and
      height.
      She
      stood
      up
      immediately
      went
      out.
      She
      had
      a
      corroded
      pulse
      but
      no
      radial
      pulses,
      so
      luckily
      for
      her
      she
      went
      down
      at
      a
      blood
      bank,
      hooked
      her
      up
      and
      immediately
      started
      pushing
      blood.
      Edit:
      not
      my
      last
      but
      my
      first.

      I
      have
      a
      similar
      experience.
      This
      was
      basic
      training.
      We
      were
      told
      we
      were
      doing
       #8220;100%
      random
      drug
      test #8221;.
      I
      drank
      6
      camelbacks,
      was
      the
      3rd
      in
      line
      to
      pee
      but
      somehow
      talked
      the
      drill
      sergeants
      into
      letting
      me
      go
      first
      because
      I
      was
      in
      so
      much
      pain.
      I
      go,
      I
      pee
      so
      much
      I
      could
      fill
      20
      of
      their
      cups.
      I
      go
      back
      to

      Interesting.
      Almost
      took
      a
      life
      today.
      I
      was
      taking
      a
      shower
      when
      I
      heard
      my
      front
      door
      open
      with
      a
      bang,
      I
      grab
      some
      underwear
      on,
      and
      grabed
      my
      glock
      and
      went
      out.
      Confronted
      him
      and
      he
      ran
      off
      and
      left.
      Turns
      out
      it
      was
      the
      Maintenance
      man
      who
      took
      it
      upon
      himself
      to
      not
      even
      call
      me
      before
      just
      coming
      over
      and
      opening
      the
      door.
      Edit:
      sentence
      structure.

      Well
      you
      see,
      it
      all
      started
      when
      I
      joined
      the
      army.
      I
      went
      to
      a
      recruiting
      office
      and
      said
      I
      wanna
      join
      the
      army.
      They
      gave
      me
      a
      test
      that
      I
      passed.
      They
      sent
      me
      to
      a
      place
      that
      I
      had
      to
      spread
      my
      cheeks
      for
      a
      doctor
      and
      duck
      walk
      in
      a
      room
      with
      other
      men
      all
      in
      our
      skivvies.
      I
      really
      don #8217;t
      know
      where
      I
      am
      going
      with
      this
      story.
      Oh

      and
      there
      was
      no

      I
      just
      thought
      it
      was

      I
      could

      One
      that
      I
      can
      answer,
      I #8217;ll
      make
      it
      nice
      and
      short,
      we
      just
      rucked
      a
      few
      miles
      up
      to
      a
      place
      called
      Eagle
      Tower.
      Eagle
      tower
      is
      this
      tower
      where
      there
      are
      some
      obstacles
      and
      a
      40
      foot
      rappel
      wall.
      You
      rappel
      off
      this
      wall
      your
      first
      week
      there
      to
       #8220;build
      confidence
      In
      your
      equipment
      and
      training #8221;.
      For
      most
      of
      us
      this
      was
      no
      problem
      we
      went
      down
      the
      wall
      with
      no
      problems.
      But
      this
      one
      guy
      we
      called
      Shrek
      (if
      you
      looked
      at
      him
      he
      looked
      like
      shrek
      especially
      the
      ears)
      was
      afraid
      of
      heights.
      The
      drills
      caught
      on
      pretty
      quick
      based
      off
      his
      face.
      They
      were
      messing
      with
      him
      a
      bit
      and
      right
      when
      it
      was
      his
      time
      to
      go
      down
      he
      went
      over
      the
      edge,
      released
      his
      break
      hand,
      grabbed
      the
      rope
      and
      went
      upside
      down.
      He
      looked
      just
      like
      Spider-Man
      going
      down
      for
      a
      kiss.
      He
      went
      the
      entire
      way
      down
      like
      that.
      They
      made
      him
      do
      it
      over
      and
      over
      and
      he
      went
      down
      like
      that
      2
      more
      times.

      most
      people
      commenting
      here
      about

      is
      because
      it #8217;s
      forced
      down
      our
      throats.
      We
      don #8217;t
      give
      a
      fuck
      about
      you
      or
      who
      you
      want
      to
      fuck
      as
      long
      as
      it #8217;s
      not
      affecting
      our
      lives.
      But
      shoving
      it
      into
      people #8217;s
      faces
      is
      what
      makes
      little
      pussies
      like
      you
      get
      the
      hate

      Good
      guesses

      both
      are

      Your
      pathetic.
      I
      added
      the
      military
      part
      to
      trigger
      you
      and
      it
      worked.
      You
      decided
      to
      conjure
      up
      in
      your
      mind
      that
      I
      went
      because
      of
      the
      military.
      The
      only
      place
      I
      have
      went
      other
      than
      the
      states
      for
      the
      military
      is
      to
      the
      border
      to
      kick
      some
      illegals
      out
      lmao.

      It #8217;s
      not
      a

      at
      all.
      We

      done.
      The
      percentage
      of

      is
      ridiculously
      small

      the
      fact
      they
      are
      going
      after
      rifles
      when
      handguns
      are
      the
      cause
      of
      most
      firearm
      deaths
      is
      retarded.
      You #8217;d
      think
      they #8217;d
      go
      after
      it
      instead
      they
      go
      after
      something
      that
       #8220;looks

      Yeah

      I #8217;m
      a
      medic
      in
      the
      army.
      I
      can
      deploy
      my
      TQ #8217;s
      like
      this
      within
      about
      10

      20

      it

      to
      applying
      it

      Because

      The

      they

      So

      Went

      get
      them
      issued
      from

      CIF
      wouldn #8217;t
      issued
      them
      to

      because
      they

      I
      have
      heard
      from

      Considering

      know
      so
      many
      people
      who
      got
      issued

      This
      is
      a
      fairly
      short
      one,
      not
      sure
      if
      it
      belongs
      here
      or
      not
      if
      it
      doesn #8217;t
      just
      tell
      me. #8221;
      So
      once
      in
      my
      younger
      days
      when
      I
      worked
      a
      conventional
      job
      I
      was
      making
      food
      at
      a
      lovely
      place
      called
      Quebec
      tango
      (QT).
      It
      was
      nearing
      the
      end
      of
      my
      shift
      but
      as
      what
      typically
      happens
      when
      your
      working
      in
      the
      kitchen,
      you
      get
      an
      order
      right
      after
      you
      have
      cleaned
      down
      all
      your
      equipment
      and
      stocked
      everything.
      Incomes
      a
      delightful
      lady
      named
      Karen.
      Karen
      ordered
      a
      very
      simple
      order,
      a
      pretzel
      with
      cheese
      dip.
      No
      problem.
      I
      quickly
      make
      the
      order
      as
      it
      is
      a
      simple
      one
      and
      hand
      it
      to
      her
      with
      a
      smile
      and
      tell
      her
      to
      have
      a
      good
      night.
      End
      of
      story
      right?
      Wrong.
      Karen
      opened
      the
      box
      and
      clearly
      was
      just
      baffled
      by
      what
      she
      sees.
      She
      tells
      me
      the
      pretzel
      is
      all
      wrong
      and
      how
      I
      ruined
      night.
      I
      ask
      her
      what
      was
      wrong
      with
      it
      and
      she
      doesn #8217;t
      tell
      me.
      I
      offer
      to
      make
      her
      a
      new
      one
      and
      she
      accepts.
      I
      make
      a
      new
      one
      completely
      normal
      just
      like
      her
      order
      says
      and
      hand
      her
      a
      coupon
      for
      a
      free
      ice
      cream
      for
      her
      next
      visit.
      All
      is
      well.
      Nope.
      This
      time
      she
      screams
      at
      me
      and
      pulls
      a
      typical
      Karen
      and
      ask
      for
      my
      manager.
      I
      said
      sure
      and
      went
      to
      get
      her.
      Karen
      is
      now
      yelling
      at
      the
      manager
      and
      when
      she
      finally
      tells
      us
      what #8217;s
      wrong
      with
      the
      pretzel
      she
      said
       #8220;the
      salt
      grains
      are
      to
      big!
      I
      you
      will
      remake
      this
      pretzel
      correctly! #8221;.
      That #8217;s
      right
      Karen
      got
      mad
      because
      the
      salt
      grain
      size
      was
      too
      large
      for
      her
      liking.
      My
      manager
      smiles
      and
      says
      sure
      we #8217;ll
      make
      you
      a
      new
      one.
      So
      we
      make
      the
      new
      one
      and
      my
      manager
      crushed
      up
      the
      salt
      and
      put
      it
      on
      there
      and
      handed
      it
      to
      her,
      that #8217;s
      when
      Karen
      complained
      that
      they
      were
      too
      small.
      At
      this
      point
      we
      have
      clearly
      figured
      out
      she
      wants
      free
      food
      and
      to
      complain
      so
      we
      stop
      giving
      her
      what
      she
      wants
      and
      when
      she
      goes
      to
      pay
      she #8217;s
      charged
      for
      all
      3
      pretzels.
      She #8217;s
      mad
      about
      this
      thinking
      we
      were
      going
      to
      give
      her
      the
      pretzels
      for
      free
      but
      even
      though
      we
      typically
      only
      charge
      you
      for
      a
      remade
      one
      a
      shitty
      attitude
      can
      get
      you
      things
      you
      don #8217;t
      want.
      TLDR;
      Karen
      complains
      about
      salt
      grain
      size.

      Exactly,
      they
      normally
      have
      large
      grain
      size.
