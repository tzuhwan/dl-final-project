      I
      remember
      Mr.
      Jefferson
      acting
      all
      strange
      right
      before
      the
      suicide
      incident
      and
      then
      the
      option
      came
      up
      to
      blame
      him
      in
      the
      principle's
      office.
      I
      even
      chose
      that
      option
      at
      first
      but
      at
      that
      point
      I
      really
      had
      no
      real
      evidence
      he
      was
      up
      to
      anything.

      So
      this
      is
      like
      a
      normal
      Oreo
      except
      they've
      put
      more

      the

      Thanks
      for
      the

      Well
      I

      the

      While
      I
      found
      the
      movie
      more
      palatable
      I
      have
      to
      say
      that
      I
      was
      surprised
      by
      how
      well
      received
      this
      movie
      was.
      There
      were
      great
      moments
      but
      somehow
      I
      didn't
      get
      the
      same
      chills
      as
      I
      did
      watching
      the
      trailers.
      All
      of
      the
      pivotal
      ideas
      and
      emotions
      were
      communicated
      more
      succinctly
      in
      the
      trailers
      while
      the
      rest
      of
      the
      movie
      felt
      like
      filler
      that
      didn't
      elevate
      the
      story.
      The
      new
      Disney
      Star
      Wars
      franchise
      in
      generally
      is
      just
      a
      better
      made
      version
      of
      the
      Pirate
      of
      the
      Caribbean
      franchise.
      It's
      inoffensive,
      safe
      and
      also
      forgetable.

      Art
      is
      such
      a
      broad
      term

      it
      really

      extend

      This
      is
      good
      advise.
      You
      should
      block
      out
      the
      object
      but
      don't
      just
      focus
      on
      the
      contours.
      Try
      to
      understand
      the
      structures
      that
      make
      up
      that
      shape.
      Try
      drawing
      the
      bones,
      muscles
      and
      tendons
      that
      make
      up
      the
      hand
      as
      practise.

      he
      said
      about
      commitment

      for

      It

      I

      confused
      by
      how
      obtuse
      everyone
      here
      is
      being.
      If
      you
      simply
      dislike
      this
      fellow
      maybe
      you
      can
      refrain
      from
      watching
      his
      videos?
      It's
      obvious
      the
      title
      is
      implying
      that
      if
      you
      want
      to
      learn
      how
      to
      animate
      light
      you
      should
      learn
      from
      watching
      Akira
      and
      not
      here's
      an
      animation
      tutorial.
      I
      know
      this
      has
      been
      said
      in
      one
      form
      or
      another
      but
      it
      can't
      be
      stressed
      enough
      since
      everyone's
      acting
      so
      dim.

      many

      of
      the
      biggest
      movies
      this
      years
      were
      Disney
      movies
      and
      were
      fun
      to
      watch
      but
      ultimately
      forgettable
      and
      unoriginal.
      When
      you
      want
      to
      appeal
      to
      as
      many
      people
      as
      you
      can
      you
      have
      to
      give
      the
      audience
      what
      they
      expect.
      Great
      movies
      that
      go
      beyond
      the
      status
      quo
      are
      often
      divisive
      or
      controversial.

      Looks
      like
      you've
      set
      this
      with
      a
      generic
      script
      font.
      It's
      a
      pet
      peeve
      that
      a
      lot
      of
      designers
      have.
      Script
      fonts
      can
      be
      passable
      in
      certain
      applications
      but
      not
      in
      a
      professional
      logo.
      First
      of
      all
      the
      letters
      don't
      flow
      into
      each
      other
      very
      well.
      Where
      the
      "R"
      starts
      and
      how
      it
      connects
      into
      "E"
      feels
      broken.
      Now
      for
      the
      "SS"
      that's
      one
      of
      the
      biggest
      issues
      with
      script
      or
      hand-lettered
      fonts
      you
      get
      the
      exact
      same
      characters
      duplicated
      which
      breaks
      the
      illusion
      it's
      handwritten.
      Bottom
      line
      is
      there
      are
      only
      five
      letters
      so
      spend
      some
      time
      and
      draw
      it
      out
      or
      at
      lease
      tweak
      the
      areas
      I
      mentioned.
      imtehshadowz
      also
      makes
      a
      good
      point
      about
      the
      shadow.
      There
      are
      too
      many
      small
      bits
      that
      create
      visual
      noise
      and
      will
      disappear
      in
      small
      sizes
      anyways.

      I
      know
      this
      is
      a
      blatant
      ad
      but
      I
      have
      to
      point
      out
      that
      some
      if

      an
      example
      of
      one:

      You
      need
      to
      work
      on
      your
      typography
      that's
      a
      big
      indicator
      of
      your
      skill
      level.
      That
      Gen-Ex
      style
      guide
      looks
      like
      it
      wasn't
      kerned
      at
      all.
      Those
      rags
      are
      looking
      harsh
      and
      you
      even
      have
      a
      widow
      in
      there.

      I
      think
      the
      simpler
      the
      logo
      the
      better.
      The
      planet
      and
      the
      buildings
      are
      not
      going
      to
      work
      once
      the
      logo
      shrinks
      down.
      Also
      those
      images
      are
      just
      as
      generic,
      meaningless,
      and
      predictable.
      So
      my
      vote
      is
      the
      last
      set.
      i
      would
      get
      rid
      of
      the
      gradient
      and
      consider
      removing
      the
      star
      as
      well
      I
      mean
      what's
      the
      point?
      You
      now
      have
      two
      icons
      fighting
      for
      attention.

      If
      you
      want
      to
      take
      this
      to
      the
      next

      you
      should
      print
      some

      these
      out
      and
      photograph
      them
      like
      the
      playing
      cards.
      Digital
      mock-ups
      are
      useful
      but
      since
      so
      many
      people
      use
      similar
      style
      mock-ups
      it
      can
      feel
      redundant
      and
      detract
      from
      the
      work.

      Maybe
      I
      am
      slow
      but
      it
      seems
      kind
      of
      ambiguous.
      Knowing
      what
      it's
      for
      I
      can
      see
      how
      it
      relates
      but
      it
      can
      be
      more
      obvious.
      The
      first
      thing
      that
      comes
      to
      mind
      when
      I
      think
      of
      audio
      is
      a
      speaker
      icon
      with
      sound
      waves
      like
      the
      button
      you
      click
      on
      most
      dictionary
      sites
      to
      play
      the
      pronunciation
      of
      the
      word
      the
      play
      icon
      isn't
      as
      direct.
      Also
      you're
      only
      depicting
      one
      language
      in
      the
      icon
      if
      you're
      going
      to
      visually
      depict
      the
      process
      of
      translating
      maybe
      you
      need
      to
      represent
      that
      change?

      Why
      here
      of
      all
      places?
      Just
      google
      "illustrations"

      you'll

      That
      is
      interesting
      I
      didn't

      they
      had
      a
      minimum
      earning

      for

      If

      If
      you
      have
      such
      a
      problem
      with
      self
      motivation
      I
      don't
      think
      this
      career
      is
      right
      for
      you
      especially
      at
      your
      age.
      If
      you
      want
      to
      get
      an
      agency
      job
      you'd
      have
      to
      be
      more
      creative
      and
      "trendy"
      than
      other
      juniors.
      If
      you
      want
      to
      freelance
      you'd
      need
      tremendous
      discipline
      to
      learn
      all
      the
      skills
      you
      need
      quickly
      and
      to
      manage
      yourself,
      your
      business,
      and
      your
      clients.
      With
      that
      said
      when
      I
      was
      in
      school
      I
      had
      people
      in
      my
      classes
      your
      age
      and
      older.
      So
      age
      doesn't
      necessarily
      mean
      anything.
      Those
      people
      with
      the
      benefit
      of
      age
      though
      were
      usually
      the
      better
      students.
      Again
      I
      am
      stressing
      the
      ambition
      and
      drive
      that
      if
      you
      don't
      have
      than
      don't
      go
      down
      this
      path.

      It's
      good
      to
      hear
      that
      those
      are
      essentially
      your
      designs.
      The
      intuitive
      part
      comes
      from
      developing
      your
      own
      process.
      Anyways
      check

      these
      videos
      by
      Aaron
      Draplin
      who
      I
      think
      has
      a
      nice
      simple
      approach
      to
      using
      illustrator
      and
      logo
      design
      thinking.

      it

      a

      I
      am
      guessing
      you
      chose
      to
      use
      Wix
      because
      you
      have
      minimal
      web
      experience?
      You
      seem
      technically
      savvy
      so
      if
      you're
      a
      quick
      learner
      maybe
      you
      should
      give
      wordpress
      a
      go.
      There
      are
      free
      portfolio
      themes
      out
      there
      that
      you
      can
      install
      and
      tweak.
      I
      built
      one
      of
      my
      first
      portfolio
      sites
      on
      wordpress
      with
      almost
      no
      web
      experience
      just
      reading
      tutorials
      online.

      I
      think
      the
      first
      version
      with
      the
      tagline
      flowing
      directly
      out
      of
      the
      title
      is
      a
      bit
      more
      cohesive.
      The
      second
      version
      with
      the
      text
      at
      the
      bottom
      feels
      broken.
      With
      that
      said
      I
      think
      you
      need
      to
      work
      on
      hierarchy.
      That
      middle
      section
      is
      so
      busy
      my
      eye
      doesn't
      want
      to
      stay
      there.
      You
      should
      play
      around
      with
      the
      lines
      and
      circles
      more.
      Some
      areas
      feel
      very
      tight
      and
      noisy
      especially
      around
      the
      R
      and
      on
      top
      of
      the
      star.
      While
      we're
      on
      the
      star
      I
      think
      it's
      a
      messing
      with
      the
      kerning
      there
      it's
      not
      sitting
      comfortably
      between
      the
      L
      and
      the
      V.
      Well
      that's
      my
      two
      cents.

      Its
      well
      put
      together
      but
      based
      on
      the
      info
      you've
      given
      and
      the
      name
      it's
      bound
      to
      be
      generic
      and
      forgettable.
      Visually
      it
      falls
      right
      into
      start-up
      territory.
      I
      am
      not
      quite
      getting
      healthcare
      here
      it
      feels
      a
      bit
      too
      playful
      and
      maybe
      it's
      the
      font?
      I
      would
      agree
      with
      everyone
      else
      that
      two
      is
      your
      best
      bet.
      Just
      out
      of
      my
      own
      personal
      curiosity
      I
      was
      wondering
      why
      have
      the
      breaks
      in
      the
      letters?

      It's
      kind
      of
      late
      here
      so
      maybe
      it's
      just
      my
      fatigue
      speaking
      but
      this
      lacks
      cohesion.
      I
      know
      you're
      not
      done
      yet
      but
      it's
      all
      just
      bits
      and
      pieces.
      What's
      the
      objective
      here
      you're
      trying
      to
      achieve?
      If
      you're
      aiming
      to
      get
      people
      educated
      about
      improving
      their
      EQ
      I
      don't
      see
      anything
      insightful
      here.
      Outside
      of
      where
      you're
      posting
      these
      on
      social
      media
      is
      there
      a
      place
      where
      people
      can
      go
      and
      look
      at
      them
      in
      a
      organized
      manner?
      I
      see
      you
      have
      a
      tumbler
      but
      again
      I
      don't
      have
      a
      clear
      idea
      of
      what
      I
      am
      looking
      at
      when
      I
      land
      there.
      Maybe
      you
      can
      create
      a
      website
      to
      outline
      your
      thesis
      and
      have
      a
      page
      for
      each
      emotion?
      I
      am
      sure
      you're
      logging
      all
      your
      research
      and
      will
      present
      everything
      to
      your
      prof
      in
      a
      more
      structured
      way
      but
      it
      would
      be
      great
      to
      also
      have
      that
      somewhere
      online
      so
      people
      who
      see
      the
      campaign
      can
      get
      more
      info?
      I
      am
      just
      spit
      balling
      ideas
      now...
      Anyways
      I
      think
      your
      art
      style
      is
      pretty
      amazing
      and
      has
      a
      whimsical
      tone
      that
      draws
      me
      in
      and
      really
      kind
      of
      disarms
      me
      in
      a
      way
      that
      opens
      me
      up
      to
      what
      you
      have
      to
      say
      but
      I
      am
      just
      not
      sure
      what
      I
      am
      getting
      out
      of
      this.
      Your
      animations
      are
      also
      very
      charming
      reminds
      me
      of
      this
      channel
      on
      youtube:
      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q57MLYpWJmQ.
      They
      have
      a
      lot
      of
      videos
      talking
      about
      dealing
      with
      emotions
      and
      all
      of
      them
      have
      these
      unique
      animations.
      I
      am
      not
      sure
      if
      that's
      the
      kind
      of
      info
      you're
      going
      though.

      The
      whole
      notion
      of
      design
      being
      transparent
      is
      about
      how
      effortless
      you're
      able
      to
      use
      something
      to
      the
      point
      where
      you
      don't
      have
      to
      think
      about.
      I
      think
      that's
      what
      makes
      design
      different
      from
      art
      it's
      not
      suppose
      to
      call
      attention
      to
      itself
      in
      a
      way
      that
      promotes
      admiration.
      Design
      is
      problem
      solving
      and
      it
      can
      be
      beautiful
      but
      that's
      just
      the
      byproduct.

      This
      is
      going
      to
      make
      me
      seem
      like
      a
      dirty
      slob
      or
      something
      but
      what
      are
      those
      two
      cleaning
      implements
      in
      the
      icon?
      Are
      those
      suppose
      to
      be
      plungers
      or
      squeegees?
      Anyways
      if
      you're
      aiming
      for
      high-end
      clients
      why
      show
      them
      plungers
      or
      whatever?
      Visually
      they
      aren't
      that
      interesting
      to
      begin
      with
      but
      also
      it
      doesn't
      sit
      well
      in
      the
      circle.
      It's
      top
      heavy
      I
      feel
      like
      it's
      going
      to
      fall
      out.
      I
      see
      that
      you're
      pivoting
      your
      positioning
      to
      appeal
      to
      moms
      and
      maybe
      that's
      introducing
      a
      new
      set
      of
      problems.
      Some
      elements
      are
      soft
      and
      cute
      while
      others
      are
      heavy
      and
      bold.
      The
      icon
      is
      fighting
      with
      the
      wordmark
      both
      in
      style
      and
      size.
      The
      fonts
      are
      also
      fighting
      with
      each
      other.
      Contrast
      is
      good
      but
      I
      think
      there
      may
      be
      too
      much
      there.
      Also
      you've
      tracked
      out
      the
      letters
      too
      much
      in
      "cleaners"
      it's
      messing
      with
      the
      legibility.

      Do
      you
      normally
      do
      another

      This
      looks
      like
      it
      could
      be
      some
      weird
      viral
      marketing
      campaign.
      I
      can
      see
      that
      little
      icon
      at
      the
      bottom
      as
      a
      sticker
      just
      plastered
      everywhere
      with
      no
      explanation.
      It's
      got
      that
      creepy
      occult
      tone
      too.

      I've
      heard
      people
      discuss
      that
      and
      similar
      statements
      about
      design
      being
      essentially
      invisible.
      That
      was
      just
      my
      interpretation
      of
      the
      idea.
      I
      certainly
      do
      think
      that
      transparency
      is
      a
      characteristic
      of
      great
      design
      but
      it's
      hard
      to
      qualify
      what
      "great"
      even
      means.
      Good
      to
      me
      is
      something
      you
      admire
      it's
      effective
      but
      you're
      aware
      of
      its
      effectiveness
      and
      you
      may
      think,
      "Wow
      that's
      pretty
      clever!".
      Something
      that's
      truly
      "great"
      gives
      you
      the
      feeling
      that
      it
      was
      never
      designed
      at
      all
      it's
      either
      so
      simple
      that
      when
      you
      see
      it
      you
      just
      think,
      "Obviously
      it
      works
      like
      this
      there's
      no
      other
      way
      it
      could
      have
      been
      done!".
      I
      am
      splitting
      hairs
      here
      I
      guess.

      Maybe
      then

      represents
      the

      of
      the

      sweeping?

      maybe
      even

      You've
      definitely
      got
      the
      style
      down.
      I
      like
      your
      approach
      to
      faces
      it's
      very
      expressive.
      So
      here
      are
      some
      random
      nit
      picks
      at
      no
      particular
      order.
      Your
      colour
      scheme
      can
      use
      a
      bit
      more
      contrast
      especially
      her
      arm
      where
      the
      inner
      edge
      is
      getting
      lost
      and
      her
      cuff
      blends
      into
      her
      apron.
      Generally
      everything
      is
      very
      smooth
      but
      the
      hat
      needs
      a
      bit
      more
      work.
      Another
      thing
      that
      will
      make
      this
      pop
      more
      is
      having
      better
      defined
      shadows.
      Right
      now
      they're
      not
      very
      consistent.
      You've
      put
      hard
      shadows
      under
      the
      head,
      the
      sash
      and
      the
      apron
      but
      there
      should
      be
      a
      shadow
      under
      her
      arm
      right?
      Also
      what's
      happening
      with
      her
      right
      ear
      and
      tail?
      The
      edge
      is
      fuzzy
      there
      like
      it's
      casting
      a
      shadow
      when
      it
      shouldn't?
      Anyways
      I
      like
      your
      design
      of
      the
      character
      as
      well.

      I
      am
      seeing
      that
      a
      lot
      of
      these
      requests
      for
      critiques
      are
      often
      missing
      info.
      Design
      is
      not
      the
      concept
      in
      isolation
      but
      meant
      to
      achieve
      a
      goal.
      What
      kind
      of
      work
      or
      clients
      are
      you
      looking
      to
      attract?
      With
      that
      said
      this
      is
      a
      very
      cutesy
      and
      borderline
      gimmicky
      idea.
      I
      think
      it
      would
      benefit
      from
      some
      refinement.
      Maybe
      you
      should
      abstract
      the
      icon
      more
      and
      reduce
      the
      size
      dramatically.
      Now
      for
      the
      this
      logo
      itself
      I
      would
      say
      you
      should
      balance
      the
      width
      of
      the
      horizontal
      strokes
      and
      the
      pencils
      more.
      There's
      a
      bit
      too
      much
      contrast
      in
      the
      thicknesses.
      Also
      the
      curved
      stroke
      at
      the
      bottom
      needs
      tinkering.
      It
      doesn't
      feel
      smooth
      it's
      like
      it
      was
      squished
      down.
      Also
      something
      feels
      disjointed
      about
      those
      three
      horizontal
      lines
      I
      understand
      they
      represent
      different
      objects
      but
      they
      don't
      right
      together.
      Maybe
      it's
      thickness
      and
      the
      way
      the
      fence
      lines
      end
      versus
      how
      the
      ground
      tapers
      off.

      I

      The

      Perhaps
      you

      make

      The

      meaning
      to
      be
      more
      unique
      to
      the
      company.
      Also
      as
      it
      stands
      I
      feel
      like
      this
      is
      a
      logo
      for
      a
      hacker
      or
      a
      virus
      and
      not
      a
      company
      that
      guards
      against
      them.
      It's
      like
      the
      ghostbusters
      logo
      with
      just
      the
      ghost
      and
      no
      circle.
      I
      am
      not
      advocating
      that
      you
      add
      a
      circle
      like
      a
      no
      smoking
      sign
      that
      would
      be
      too
      obvious.
      Now
      if
      your
      backstory
      was
      that
      the
      company
      hired
      ex-hackers
      that
      would
      be
      pretty
      interesting
      like
      the
      suicide
      squad
      of
      cyber
      security
      which
      is
      plausible.
      This
      also
      isn't
      complete
      without
      a
      wordmark.

      It's
      simple
      and
      the
      over
      all
      tone
      is
      on
      target.
      Maybe
      other
      people
      can
      chime
      in
      on
      this
      but
      I
      see
      Black

      Export
      as
      a
      possible
      reading
      of
      this
      logo.
      I
      am
      also
      getting
      a
      huge
      X
      Games
      feel
      from
      this.
      What
      was
      your
      idea
      for
      the
      design
      of
      the
      X?
      I
      see
      it
      as
      "we
      only
      export
      we
      don't
      import".

      I
      too
      did
      notice
      that.
      It's

      subtle

      That's
      an
      interesting
      180
      you
      pulled
      there.
      What
      were
      the
      reasons
      you
      chose
      the
      original
      look?
      You're

      anywhere
      if
      you
      don't
      have
      a
      goal.
      First
      thing
      you
      need
      to
      do
      is
      to
      determine
      what
      you're
      communicating
      and
      to
      who.

      I
      am

      everyone
      here
      when
      it
      comes
      to
      the
      illustrations.
      I
      can
      see
      it
      used
      with
      just
      flat
      colors
      as
      well.
      You

      on
      that
      wordmark
      a
      little
      more
      though.
      You
      have

      mostly
      noticeably
      between

      you've
      tracked
      out
      Tulsa
      either.
      The
      white
      space
      is
      kind
      of
      distracting
      and
      combined
      with
      that
      condensed
      font
      it's
      not
      as
      readable
      as
      it
      should
      be.

      just
      with

      I
      think
      it
      would
      work
      though.
      It
      requires

      not

      I
      guess
      I
      should
      say
      what
      the
      plugin
      is.
      It's
      called
      Texturino
      which
      was
      actually
      recommended
      to
      me
      here
      by
      u/jezreeljay.
      I
      am
      still
      learning
      how
      to
      incorporate
      it
      into
      my
      workflow.
      Essentially
      you
      can
      add
      textures
      like
      swatches
      directly
      to
      a
      shape
      with
      one
      click.

      creativity
      and
      poor
      type
      choice
      it's
      basically
      a
      clean
      and
      functional
      logo.
      It
      works
      better
      than
      one
      of
      those
      over
      baked
      or
      overly
      detailed
      logos
      that
      won't
      even
      print
      or
      work
      in
      a
      website
      header.
      Also
      the
      service
      seems
      boring
      and
      generic
      so
      the
      tone
      of
      the
      logo
      matches
      the
      dull
      nature
      of
      the
      service.
      If
      nothing
      else
      we
      can
      say
      that
      this
      treatment
      required
      little
      effort
      and
      was
      probably
      a
      very
      profitable
      project.

      There's
      a
      disconnect
      between
      your
      brand
      and
      your
      content.
      I
      have
      no
      sense
      of
      your
      personality
      or
      the
      idea

      your
      name.
      What
      your
      competitive
      edge
      or
      unique
      offering?
      Your
      logo
      needs
      more
      work
      too
      it
      doesn't
      read
      well
      especially
      when
      it
      shrinks
      down
      in
      the
      sticky
      header.

      You
      need
      more
      practice
      just
      drawing
      from
      real
      life.
      Illustrator
      is
      not
      a
      good
      place
      to
      learn
      how
      to
      draw
      it's
      really
      the
      final
      step.
      You
      don't
      understand
      how
      shadow
      and
      lighting
      works
      and
      illustrator
      is
      only
      to
      make
      your
      process
      of
      learning
      it
      harder.
      Get
      some
      photo
      references
      and
      start
      sketching
      with
      pencil
      and
      paper.

      Not
      your
      best
      work.
      This
      is
      a
      fun
      image
      but
      it's
      not
      really
      an
      effective
      logo.
      A
      good
      challenge
      would
      have
      been
      to
      try
      and
      represent
      meat
      in
      a
      more
      abstract
      way
      that
      could
      work
      as
      a
      one
      or
      two
      color
      icon.

      I
      found
      this
      tutorial
      (http://vectorboom.com/load/tutorials/effects/create_texture_shading_in_adobe_illustrator/3-1-0-554)
      around
      here
      somewhere
      but
      I
      can't
      remember
      now
      who
      posted
      it.
      Anyways
      something's
      really
      off
      about
      that
      texture
      effect.
      It
      feels
      too
      uniform
      maybe?
      I
      appreciate
      any
      tips.

      This
      whole
      open
      design
      experiment
      was
      a
      shit
      show
      from
      the
      very
      start.
      This
      was
      a
      front
      runner
      from
      the
      very
      beginning
      and
      I
      have
      to
      say
      a
      lot
      of
      the
      other
      concepts
      were
      much
      worse.
      How
      do
      you
      even
      get
      a
      designer
      to
      go
      along
      with
      having
      their
      concepts
      judged
      by
      the
      internet?!

      Lots
      of
      good
      advice
      here
      already
      so
      not
      too
      much
      more
      to
      add
      but
      here
      goes.
      This
      is
      pretty
      decent
      for
      someone
      who's
      just
      learning
      but
      the
      problems
      here
      aren't
      solely
      your
      illustrator
      skills
      but
      your
      overall
      composition
      problems.
      Work
      your
      piece
      out
      on
      paper
      or
      sketch
      it
      out
      in
      photoshop
      do
      thumbnails.
      Before
      you
      jump
      into
      illustrator
      you
      should
      have
      your
      idea
      mapped
      out
      as
      much
      as
      possible.

      Pretty
      nice.
      I
      like
      your
      character
      designs
      they're
      very
      fluid
      and
      dynamic.
      Now
      I
      am
      itching
      to
      try
      something
      like
      this
      too.

      One
      major
      issue
      I
      have
      is
      the
      sloppiness
      and
      lack
      of
      flow
      in
      lines.
      Be
      careful
      with
      the
      corners
      and
      how
      the
      strokes
      overlap.
      Right
      now
      your
      style
      sits
      uncomfortably
      between
      precise
      and
      free
      flowing.
      The
      good
      thing
      about
      illustrator
      though
      is
      you
      can
      constantly
      iterate
      and
      push
      your
      work
      so
      keep
      going.

      How
      did
      you
      create
      that
      transition
      between
      the
      red
      and
      blue?
      It
      looks
      very
      organic
      and
      has
      a
      nice
      blended
      effected.

      I

      am
      talking
      about
      the
      intent
      of
      the

      There's
      a

      Coupled

      a

      dot
      matrix
      printer
      for

      I
      want
      to
      copy
      the
      contents
      of
      one
      cell
      and
      paste
      it
      into
      multiple
      cells
      that
      I
      have
      selected
      let's
      say
      it's
      the
      entire
      column.
      When
      I
      paste
      it
      that
      content
      only
      appears
      in
      the
      top
      cell
      and
      all
      the
      other
      ones
      remain
      empty.
      The
      more
      I
      explain
      it
      the
      more
      dumb
      I
      feel
      the
      question
      is
      lol.
      I
      am
      probably
      missing
      something
      very
      fundamental.

      judge
      a
      logo
      by
      itself
      in
      a
      vacuum
      you're
      not
      going
      to
      get
      very
      good
      feedback.
      Based
      on
      the
      visuals
      alone
      I'd
      say
      it's
      very
      weak
      and
      doesn't
      feel
      complete.

      Maybe
      you
      can
      try
      pushing
      the
      idea
      a
      bit
      further?
      Unless
      I
      am
      missing
      something
      which
      is
      highly
      possible
      I
      am
      thinking
      it's
      too
      straight
      forward.
      I
      mean
      it
      is
      just
      a
      bell
      right?
      What's
      something
      unique
      about
      the
      service
      that
      you
      can
      incorporate?
      While
      a
      logo
      can't
      speak
      to
      every
      aspect
      of
      a
      businesses
      this
      just
      feels
      empty.

      I
      love
      that
      you're
      sketching
      I
      would
      take
      these
      ideas
      further
      though.
      There
      are
      too
      many
      pixels.
      That
      level
      of
      detail
      will
      be
      problematic
      in
      small
      sizes
      and
      isn't
      necessary
      to
      express
      the
      idea
      that
      the
      letter
      is
      made
      up
      of
      pixel.
      Keep
      the
      letter
      mostly
      solid
      with
      just
      a
      few
      pixel
      breaking
      off.
      I
      would
      also
      explore
      different
      type
      styles
      that
      reflect
      the
      feeling
      of
      a
      mutant.
      Same
      general
      feedback
      for
      the
      DNA
      icon.
      The
      double
      helix
      is
      kind
      of
      overused
      in
      my
      opinion
      so
      maybe
      take
      a
      more
      experimental
      interpretation
      of
      it?
      I
      mean
      you
      can
      bend
      the
      double
      helix
      into
      an
      M
      that
      can
      represent
      the
      idea
      of
      mutation?

      Very

      Those

      are

      it's

      The
      only
      issue
      I
      have
      is
      with
      the
      flowers.
      I
      think
      the
      pedals
      can
      be
      more
      consistent
      and
      evenly
      arranged.
      Also
      since
      you're
      showing
      them
      together
      I
      can
      see
      that
      all
      the
      flowers
      are
      just
      duplicates
      which
      kind
      of
      takes
      away
      from
      the
      overall
      impression.
      Would
      be
      cool
      to
      see
      unique
      flowers
      for
      each
      design.
      Pretty
      sweet
      stuff!

      I
      think
      you
      should
      either
      commit
      to
      having
      cast
      shadows
      or
      not
      have
      the
      one
      under
      the
      ear.
      Also
      I
      would
      be
      careful
      with
      placing
      shapes
      edge
      to
      edge
      like
      the
      eye
      brows
      just
      barely
      touching
      the
      eye
      and
      the
      nick
      just
      touching
      the
      bottom
      where
      it's
      cropped.
      For
      me
      it's
      creating
      some
      visual
      tension.
      Either
      overlap
      them
      or
      give
      them
      some
      space.

      Those

      drop
      shadows
      just
      don't

      Just

      Don't
      just
      jump
      in

      and

      Looks
      nice
      and
      clean.
      It's
      simple
      and
      functional.
      I
      am
      not
      a
      fan
      of
      the
      j,
      i,
      and
      t
      combo
      thought.
      It
      may
      just
      be
      the
      straight
      tail
      on
      the
      j
      or
      it
      could
      be
      the
      fact
      that
      you
      have
      three
      uneven
      strokes
      spaced
      so
      close
      together.
      If
      you
      can
      I
      would
      try
      spacing
      the
      two
      words
      out
      or
      somehow
      make
      the
      vertical
      strokes
      appear
      more
      even.

      Sometimes
      I
      get
      hung
      up
      thinking
      what
      if
      our
      timeline/reality
      is
      constantly
      changing
      but
      since
      our
      memories
      change
      with
      it
      we
      can't
      ever
      know
      anything
      is
      changing
      at
      all.
      I
      like
      to
      imagine
      simple
      things
      like
      what
      if
      this
      blue
      shirt
      I've
      owned
      for
      years
      was
      actually
      purple
      yesterday
      but
      since
      it's
      become
      blue
      all
      my
      memories
      of
      it
      are
      of
      a
      blue
      shirt
      now.
      Not
      sure
      if
      that
      even
      makes
      sense
      now...

      Nice
      idea
      but
      each
      individual
      element
      needs
      more
      refinement.
      The
      cigar
      label
      is
      causing
      some
      issues
      for
      me
      especially
      in
      the
      thumbnail.
      The
      size
      relationships
      between
      the
      Q,
      Quincy's
      and
      Cigar
      Club
      feels
      unbalanced.
      The
      Q
      is
      too
      heavy,
      Cigar
      Club
      is
      too
      small?
      Look
      at
      your
      negative
      space
      too
      those
      three
      forms
      don't
      fit
      nicely
      into
      each
      other
      so
      I
      would
      give
      them
      more
      breathing
      room.

      I
      am
      not
      a
      fan
      of
      bugs
      in
      real
      life
      and
      I
      am
      glad
      to
      say
      I've
      been
      able
      to
      keep
      my
      distance
      from
      them.
      It's
      kind
      of
      a
      generic
      dream
      so
      I
      wasn't
      expecting
      anything
      that
      unique
      and
      it
      seems
      to
      make
      good
      sense.

      This
      is
      one
      of
      the
      more
      interesting
      conversations
      I've
      seen
      on
      here
      and
      I
      can't
      help
      but
      want
      to
      put
      in
      my
      2
      cents.
      I
      don't
      want
      to
      retread
      old
      territory
      so
      I'll
      mention
      that
      presentation
      is
      everything
      and
      this
      way
      to
      showing
      a
      logo
      is
      severely
      lacking
      because
      it
      doesn't
      show
      context.
      Logo
      critiques
      on
      here
      tend
      to
      limited
      by
      the
      lack
      of
      proper
      presentation.
      This
      could
      just
      be
      one
      variation
      of
      logo
      I
      can
      easily
      see
      it
      being
      worked
      out
      in
      one
      colour.
      As
      far
      as
      the
      idea
      goes
      I
      am
      on
      the
      side
      that
      believes
      a
      mark
      isn't
      inherently
      meaningful
      and
      needs
      to
      be
      supported
      by
      the
      brand
      as
      a
      whole.

      I
      can
      relate
      to
      the
      suffocation
      aspect.
      While
      I
      am
      experiencing
      sleep
      paralysis
      it
      feels
      like
      I
      can't
      control
      my
      breathing
      and
      if
      I
      don't
      wake
      up
      I'll
      just
      stop
      breathing
      completely.
      Now
      that
      I
      am
      more
      experienced
      I
      just
      tell
      myself
      to
      breath
      and
      I
      just
      focus
      on
      taking
      deep
      breaths
      until
      I
      finally
      wake
      up.

      This
      just
      made
      me
      imagine
      a
      parody
      of
      StarFox
      where
      some
      delusional
      person
      just
      dresses
      up
      a
      bunch
      of
      animals
      and
      forces
      them
      to
      act
      out
      scenes
      from
      the
      game.
      Fox
      is
      just
      trying
      to
      eat
      everyone
      and
      Falco
      is
      flying
      around
      cawing
      hysterically.

      throw

      a

      I
      know

      can't
      work
      for
      more
      reasons

      but
      my
      brain
      just
      won't
      comply.
      When

      I
      tell
      myself
      I
      need

      at
      work
      it
      all
      goes
      out

      Maybe
      I
      just
      want
      a
      friend
      maybe
      it's
      more
      I
      don't
      fucking
      know.

      Personally
      I
      would
      forgive
      her
      because
      I
      have
      zero
      things
      to
      contribute
      to
      the

      so
      if
      she
      wants
      to
      stay
      with
      me
      it
      has
      to
      mean
      something.
      I'd
      even
      be

      with
      an
      open
      relationship

      she
      likes
      to
      spends
      most
      of
      her
      time
      with
      me
      then
      why
      does
      it
      matter?

      I
      thought
      I
      had
      accepted
      my
      lonesome
      state
      but
      things
      can
      happen
      that
      reawaken
      those
      feelings
      and
      when
      you
      suddenly
      have
      a
      need
      for
      some
      companionship
      and
      you're
      old
      and
      worthless
      that
      sense
      of
      dread
      is
      just
      insane.

      I
      know
      my
      perspective
      is
      skewed
      because
      of
      my
      lack
      of
      experience
      but
      it's
      hard
      meeting
      someone
      who's
      friendly
      and
      you
      just
      automatically
      make
      too
      much
      out
      of
      it.
      I
      keep
      telling
      myself
      that
      they're
      just
      nice
      to
      everyone
      and
      that
      there's
      nothing
      special
      happening
      but
      the
      truth
      is
      that
      it
      feels
      special
      to
      me.

      Ya
      I
      feel
      like
      I
      am
      in
      the
      same
      spot.
      I
      never
      truly
      felt
      alone
      until
      I
      met
      someone
      I
      had
      no
      chance
      with
      but
      we
      got
      along
      in
      other
      ways.
      We
      laugh
      and
      joke
      around
      then
      after
      awhile
      I
      started
      to
      feel
      this
      deep
      emptiness
      when
      they
      weren't
      around.
      I
      couldn't
      sleep
      and
      I
      kept
      thinking
      and
      analyzing
      our
      interactions
      it's
      kind
      of
      a
      nightmare.
      I
      really
      wish
      I
      never
      met
      them
      and
      that
      I
      could
      just
      go
      back
      to
      being
      numb.

      I
      use
      to
      be
      an
      extrovert
      a
      real
      attention
      seeker
      but
      then
      I
      realized
      it
      was
      all
      pointless.
      I
      just
      want
      to
      live
      under
      a
      rock
      now.

      Personally
      I
      would
      say
      yes
      just
      because
      I
      haven't
      progressed
      on
      par
      with
      my
      peers.
      The
      only
      friends
      I
      have
      now
      are
      the
      ones
      I've
      grown
      up
      with
      and
      I
      find
      it
      very
      intimidating
      to
      meet
      new
      people
      my
      age
      because
      generally
      they're
      well
      put
      together.

      This
      is
      so
      true
      but
      the

      are
      so

      you

      Thanks
      for
      sharing!
      I
      am
      in
      the
      same
      position
      pretty
      much
      and
      I've
      been
      feeling
      alone
      and
      isolated
      since
      everyone
      around
      me
      seems
      to
      have
      everything
      figured
      out.
      I
      feel
      like
      there's
      so
      many
      things
      I
      need
      to
      fix
      I
      am
      not
      sure
      where
      to
      start.
      Sometimes
      it's
      like
      I
      am
      waiting
      for
      something
      to
      break.
      I
      am
      waiting
      for
      something
      inside
      me
      to
      snap.
       #8203;
      I've
      been
      focusing
      my
      anxiety
      and
      pent
      up
      energy
      into
      exercise.
      It's
      actually
      been
      pretty
      helpful
      in
      occupying
      my
      mind
      in
      dark
      times.
      When
      I
      am
      completely
      exhausted
      I
      am
      at
      least
      not
      thinking
      about
      live.

      I
      am

      I
      am
      not

      I
      don't
      even
      want
      to
      be
      the
      centre
      of
      attention
      but
      I
      constantly
      need
      validation
      or
      it
      feels
      like
      they
      all
      secretly
      hate
      or
      just
      endure
      my
      presence.

      I
      think
      I
      understand
      how
      you
      feel.
      For

      it
      feels
      like
      I've
      lost
      even
      my
      ability
      to
      feel
      bad.
      It's
      as
      if
      I
      no
      longer
      qualify
      because
      here's
      someone
      who's
      way
      worse.
      In
      the
      end
      it's
      even
      more
      pathetic.

      That's
      me
      alright.
      I
      got
      stuck
      in
      this
      one
      job
      and
      its
      comfortable
      and
      in
      many
      ways
      what
      I
      want
      but
      it's
      shit
      for
      pay
      so
      my
      whole
      life
      is
      in
      limbo.
      It's
      fucked
      up
      my
      career
      path
      now
      I
      don't
      even
      know
      if
      there
      anything
      beyond
      this
      for
      me.
      Feels
      like
      I
      need
      to
      hit
      the
      reset
      button
      but
      I
      am
      too
      old.

      like
      I
      want

      jump
      out

      I

      I

      but
      I
      can't

      the
      feelings
      to
      just
      die.

      This
      is
      why
      I
      fantasize
      about
      having
      a
      terminal
      illness.
      It
      serves
      my
      purpose
      without
      the
      judgement
      and
      at
      least
      the
      suffering
      your
      loved
      ones
      will
      endure
      will
      not
      be
      the
      result
      of
      your
      direct
      actions.
      I
      often
      wonder
      though
      if
      I
      drink
      myself
      to
      death
      would
      that
      be
      ok
      as
      well
      or
      may
      be
      if
      I
      o.d
      at
      a
      party
      if
      that'll
      be
      viewed
      as
      an
      accident.

      While
      initially
      seeing
      someone
      enjoy
      my
      company
      was
      amazing
      but
      my
      self
      destructive
      thoughts,
      jealously,
      and
      neediness
      ruined
      it
      for
      me.
      When
      I
      was
      alone
      again
      I
      felt
      worst
      than
      I
      ever
      did.
      A
      part
      of
      me
      wishes
      that
      we
      never
      met
      in
      the
      first
      place.

      I
      felt
      the
      same
      way
      as
      you
      I
      never
      thought
      I'd
      make
      it
      past
      my
      twenties
      and
      now
      here
      I
      am
      still
      waiting
      for
      something
      to
      break...

      For
      people
      like
      us
      there's
      always
      going
      to
      be
      someone
      "better"
      if
      it's
      not
      your
      friend
      it
      would
      have
      been
      someone
      else.

      Sounds
      alot
      like
      what
      happened
      to
      me
      in
      school.
      People
      have
      come
      out
      and
      said
      that
      I
      act
      friendly
      one
      day
      and
      just
      like
      a
      stranger
      the
      next.
      Even
      now
      as
      an
      adult
      I
      still
      feel
      like
      I
      haven't
      moved
      past
      it.
      I
      just
      have
      a
      hard
      time
      believing
      that
      someone
      is
      my
      friend
      unless
      they're
      super
      aggressive.
      Knowing
      this
      I
      do
      my
      best
      to
      act
      nice
      and
      to
      be
      out
      going
      but
      I
      have
      a
      lot
      of
      blind
      spots
      still.

      At
      least
      you
      had
      the
      courage
      to
      ask
      I.
      I
      always
      feel
      like
      people
      at
      work
      put
      on
      a
      front
      to
      make
      the
      situation
      more
      pleasant
      so
      I
      always
      seem
      to
      distrust
      friendships
      developed
      in
      that
      environment.
      It
      seems
      overly
      pessimistic
      but
      I
      can't
      help
      it.

      I
      wear
      long
      sleeve
      shirts
      even
      when
      it's
      record
      high
      temps
      outside.
