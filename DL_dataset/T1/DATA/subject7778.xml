      Hi
      men
      same
      age
      than
      you
      you
      don't
      have
      pity
      i
      can
      understand.i
      don't
      deserve
      any
      too
      i
      mean
      most
      of
      my
      days
      (if
      i'm
      not
      faking
      a
      silly
      face
      with
      a
      happy
      smile)
      i
      really
      want
      to
      kill
      myself
      but
      hey!
      I'm
      just
      a
      pussy!
      I
      don't
      have
      the
      courage.
      When
      i
      look
      at
      my
      friend
      who
      tried...
      Well
      i
      think
      he
      is
      brave
      (even
      if
      now
      he
      is
      a
      special
      school
      for
      "people
      like
      him".
      Anyway
      it's
      exams
      now
      and
      i
      feel
      like
      shit.
      I
      don't
      work
      at
      all.
      I
      try
      but
      what's
      the
      point?
      I'll
      finish
      by
      killing
      myself
      someday
      so
      why
      live
      ?
      I
      don't
      even
      know
      if
      i'm
      really
      depressed.
      But
      i'm
      sad
      for
      2
      years
      now
      and
      i
      never
      talked
      about
      it
      to
      anyone.
      I'm
      alone
      in
      my
      sorrow.
      I
      think
      a
      lot
      of
      people
      just
      think
      i'm
      someone
      who
      don't
      worry
      too
      much
      and
      i
      can't
      blame
      them
      i
      never
      said
      i
      was
      sad.
      So
      just
      to
      say
      you're
      not
      alone
      and
      if
      you
      wanna
      talk
      i'm
      ready
      i
      have
      all
      the
      night!
      (
      Sorry
      for
      the
      faults
      my
      english
      is
      bad)

      Yeah
      i
      feel
      so
      too
      but
      most
      of
      the
      time
      i
      say
      myself:
      "come
      on
      men
      !
      You're
      not
      that
      sad!
      Look
      at
      the
      people
      on
      this
      forum
      !they
      are
      all
      sadder
      than
      you!
      Stop
      being
      a
      pussy
      you
      little
      piece
      of
      shit!!
      Stop
      being
      depressed
      !
      Do
      like
      everybody
      !!!!"
      Actually
      it's
      more
      the
      "part"
      inside
      me
      who
      tell
      me
      that.
      You
      know
      this
      part
      who
      tell
      when
      you're
      alone
      that
      it
      could
      better
      for
      everyone
      if
      you
      killed
      yourself.
      I'm
      trying
      to
      get
      better
      but
      currently
      everything
      is
      worse
      than
      before...
      Sorry
      if
      you
      wanted
      someone
      for
      saying
      you"
      Be
      happy
      !
      Life
      is
      good
      just
      trust
      yourself!"
      and
      these
      kind
      of
      things
      i
      really
      wanna
      believe
      in.
      But
      today
      i
      can't
      help
      you
      i
      just
      needed
      to
      write
      how
      bad
      i
      felt
      but
      i
      know
      that
      talking
      always
      help
      so
      i
      can
      do
      this
      with
      you
      it
      would
      help
      me
      either.
      Sooo...

      did
      you
      get
      here?
      what's
      your
      story

      (Sorry

      Yeah
      i
      never
      thought
      about
      it.
      Still
      there
      are
      things
      in
      my
      life
      i
      know
      caused
      my
      depression.
      All
      my
      childhood
      i
      was
      alone(i
      didn't
      had
      friends)
      with
      my
      dreams,
      my
      stories
      i
      created,...
      Now
      i'm
      depressed
      i
      don't
      really
      know
      either
      when
      did
      it
      start
      but
      i
      know
      that
      i'm
      still
      sad
      because
      i
      don't
      speak
      about
      it
      to
      my
      rare
      friends.
      I'd
      like
      to
      do
      it
      but
      how
      to
      begin?
      I
      just
      can't
      do
      it
      and
      i
      just
      pray
      that
      some
      day
      i'll
      have
      the
      motivation
      to
      work
      again,
      to
      wake
      me
      up,...
      Currently
      i
      make
      fake
      smile
      and
      a
      lot
      of
      people
      think
      i'm
      never
      worried
      about
      anything.
      I'm
      here
      today
      because
      if
      i
      didn't
      maybay
      i
      would
      have
      the
      courage
      to
      kill
      myself
      (It
      was
      a
      difficult
      day).
      I
      never
      did
      because
      i'm
      not
      brave
      enough
      (and
      what
      would
      happen
      if
      i
      fail?
      That's
      the
      case
      of
      one
      of
      my
      friend).
      I
      think
      it's
      great
      you
      won't
      kill
      yourself
      because
      i'm
      sure
      it's
      not
      solution
      even
      if
      sometimes
      we
      think
      there
      are
      not
      other
      choices.

      you
      men
      i
      have
      some

      now
      but
      it's
      only
      because
      i
      make
      fake
      smile
      i'm
      faking
      happiness
      and
      i'm
      sure
      it's
      not

      yet
      i
      have
      some
      great
      friends

      i
      just
      can't
      it's

      I
      play
      undertale
      to
      stay
      alive
      dunno
      if
      it's
      better
      i
      told
      myself
      "don't
      kill
      yourself
      until
      the
      next
      game
      of
      the
      creator
      arrive"
      That
      sounds
      stupid
      but
      it
      works.
      I
      never
      had
      a
      gf
      but
      i
      'd
      like
      to
      have
      sombody
      with
      me.
      Just
      someone
      i
      could
      tell
      how
      i
      feel
      but
      i'm
      alone
      (i
      mean
      i
      have
      friends
      but
      talk
      with
      them
      about
      my
      depression
      looks
      impossible.)
      It's
      great
      you
      write
      how
      you
      feel
      i
      often
      do
      it
      on
      other
      forum
      (
      it's
      my
      first
      day
      on
      this
      forum)
      and
      it
      really
      helps
      me
      i
      hope
      you're
      feeling
      better
      and
      it's
      not
      a
      judgment
      but
      hate
      humanity
      doesn't
      help
      (i
      mean
      a
      part
      of
      me
      hate
      every
      human
      on
      this
      earth
      but
      i
      know
      it's
      stupid
      when
      i
      just
      read
      the
      posts
      of
      this
      forum)
      you'd
      better
      start
      to
      like
      people
      (
      at
      least
      just
      a
      little
      bit)
      because
      i'm
      sure
      that
      be
      alone
      is
      useless
      to
      find
      happiness
      (if
      it
      exists)

      Sleep
      is
      the
      only
      moment
      of
      the
      day
      where
      i'm
      happy
      too.
      You
      know
      i
      live
      the
      exact
      same
      situation
      than
      you
      and
      i'm
      sure
      i'll
      fail
      at
      these
      f******
      exams
      and
      i'm
      such
      a
      pussy
      i'm
      not
      even
      enough
      brave
      to
      killmyself
      because
      i
      know
      it
      would
      hurt
      my
      family.
      So
      i

      Me
      too
      men
      when
      i
      read
      stuff
      like
      "life
      make
      you
      happy!
      You
      JUST
      have
      to
      smile
      at
      the
      life
      and
      life'll
      smile
      you
      in
      retourne!"
      That's
      sounds
      easy
      !
      ....
      Well
      not
      for
      me
      i
      always
      fake
      happiness
      to
      my
      family
      and
      friends
      until
      i
      crack
      (there
      if
      i'm
      not
      alone
      in
      30
      sec
      i
      really
      could
      collapse
      and
      cry
      like
      a
      baby).
      STILL
      i
      don't
      lose
      Hope
      i
      believe
      someday
      i'll
      be
      brave
      enough
      to
      talk
      (to
      real
      people)
      about
      my
      depression
      and
      i
      hope
      THERE
      it'll
      be
      ok.
      Just
      to
      say
      i'm
      sure
      there
      is
      a
      way
      to
      pass
      trough
      depression.

      Men
      i
      understand
      you
      if
      i
      found
      a
      way
      to
      kill
      myself
      without
      pain
      or
      without
      hurt
      my
      family
      i
      would
      do
      it.
      But
      i
      think
      asking
      the
      question
      at
      someone
      who
      tried
      to
      know
      how
      to
      feel
      better
      is
      not
      very
      nice.
      Anyway
      give
      advice
      like:
      "Tuto
      :
      how
      to
      kill
      yourself
      !"is
      illegal
      and
      it's
      normal.
      So
      even
      if
      i
      understand
      how
      you
      feel
      just
      don't
      ask
      men....
      We
      all
      wanna
      find
      a
      way
      to
      pass
      trough
      depression.

      Yeah
      i
      often
      feel
      bad
      when
      i
      start
      to
      think
      about
      all
      the
      things
      i
      could
      do
      to
      stop
      an
      arguments
      with
      a
      friend
      and
      there
      i
      need
      to
      be
      alone
      or
      i'm
      getting
      sadder
      and
      sadder....
      But
      what's
      done
      is
      done
      so
      i
      guess
      we
      shouldn't
      blame
      ourselves
      so
      much
      but
      still
      it's
      hard....

      Yeah
      i
      understand
      it
      looks
      an
      easy
      to
      stop
      being
      sad
      i
      mean
      i
      wanna
      kill
      myself
      too
      but
      i'm
      not
      brave
      enough.
      So
      i'm
      not
      here
      to
      tell
      you
      that
      suicide
      is
      bad
      just
      that
      even
      if
      it
      would
      stop
      our
      suffering
      you
      really
      have
      to
      be
      sure
      you
      have
      no
      regrets.
      And
      that's
      my
      problems...
      I
      do
      have
      some
      regrets.
      I
      don't
      wanna
      hurt
      my
      family
      or
      the
      1or
      2
      guys
      who
      care
      about
      me
      just
      a
      little
      bit.
      So
      i
      stay
      alive
      knowing
      that
      one
      day
      i'll
      crack

      i'll

      it

      Listen
      i
      have
      the
      same
      problem.
      When
      i
      read
      the
      posts
      on
      this
      forum
      it
      looks
      like
      i'm
      the
      happiest
      here
      but
      it's
      actually
      not
      true.
      It's
      hard
      to
      convince
      yourself
      you're
      depressed.
      When
      it's
      done
      (and
      it's
      easy)
      (
      and
      when
      i
      read
      what
      you
      write
      you
      look
      depressed
      men!
      think
      about
      the
      people
      around
      you
      who
      are
      really
      happy.
      They
      are
      not
      like
      us
      you
      can
      feel
      it)
      so
      when
      it's
      done
      you
      have
      to
      say
      it
      to
      others
      (i'm
      stuck
      here)
      i'm
      sure
      this
      the
      way
      to
      finally
      stop
      being
      depressed.

      Hmmm...
      Yeah
      but
      sometimes
      it's
      really
      helpfull
      (for
      me)
      i
      know
      i
      shouldn't
      mutilate
      myself
      but
      when
      things
      are
      too
      hard
      if
      i
      don't
      do
      it
      then
      i
      could
      collapse.
      It
      calms
      me.

      Yeah
      but
      it
      might
      be
      because
      he
      doesn't
      know
      you
      depressed.
      I
      have
      this
      problem
      with
      my
      parents
      they
      are
      always
      angry
      because
      i'm
      too
      lazy
      to
      work.
      That
      it's
      stupid
      to
      do
      nothing
      because
      i'm
      not
      a
      dummy.
      There
      they
      say
      me
      start
      working
      start
      working
      start
      working...
      And
      there
      i'm
      always
      like
      "
      shut
      up
      i
      know
      you
      wanna
      help
      me
      but
      please
      just
      understand
      i'm
      not
      happy
      and
      start
      to
      worry
      about
      THIS.
      But
      i'm
      sure
      that
      if
      i
      had
      the
      courage
      to
      tell
      them
      what's
      wrong
      with
      me
      i'm
      sure
      everything
      could
      be
      better.
      So
      if
      you
      never
      talked
      with
      him
      about
      it
      i'm
      i'm
      sure
      it's
      the
      Key
      to
      happiness.

      actually
      felt
      bad
      today
      (maybay
      more
      than
      usual)
      and
      a
      friend
      at
      school
      asked
      me
      if
      i
      was
      ok
      There
      i
      totally
      changed
      my
      face
      to
      a
      fake
      big
      smile
      and
      said
      something
      like
      :
      "
      yeah
      of
      course
      as
      always
      !
      :D"
      .........
      And
      yes
      even
      if
      i'm
      stupid
      because
      i
      didn't
      say
      :"
      no,
      nothing's
      ok
      i
      hate
      myself
      so
      much
      i'm
      a
      little
      pussy
      who
      can't
      even
      kill
      himself
      because
      i
      think
      that
      my
      mother
      would
      care.
      I'm
      just
      a
      depressed
      guy
      who
      pray
      for
      that
      every
      day
      would
      be
      the
      last
      one."
      So
      even
      if
      i
      didn't
      do
      it
      i
      felt
      good
      that
      someone
      really
      Ask
      you
      are
      ok
      men
      ?
      It
      gives
      me
      hope
      and
      i
      don't
      know
      your
      friends
      so
      i
      can't
      tell
      if
      they're
      unfriendly
      or
      that
      they
      just
      didn't
      notice
      it
      i
      hope
      you'll
      be
      brave
      enough
      (not
      like
      me)
      to
      talk
      to
      one
      of
      your
      friends
      about
      your
      problems.
      (And
      sorry
      for
      the
      faults
      i'm
      french
      and
      my
      english
      is
      bad)

      (first
      sorry
      for
      the
      faults
      my
      english
      is
      bad)
      Nobody
      really
      wanna
      die
      i
      mean
      instict
      will
      often
      stop
      you
      so
      you
      need
      to
      be
      with
      her
      and
      she
      needs
      to
      know
      that
      you'll
      always
      be
      there
      for
      her
      not
      to
      judge
      her
      she
      just
      needs
      someone
      to
      hug
      someone
      listening
      and
      to
      help
      her
      with
      stuff
      like
      do
      her
      shopping,...
      Only
      if
      she
      asks
      you.
      When
      you're
      depressed
      you
      don't
      need
      someone
      that
      tell
      What
      can
      i
      do
      ??
      Are
      you
      alright???
      I'll
      call
      you
      when
      i
      arrive
      Home
      alright
      !!???
      I
      mean
      it's
      nice
      but
      you'll
      be
      rejected
      now
      if
      she
      is
      about
      to
      kill
      herself
      then.....
      Well
      i
      hate
      it
      but
      you
      need
      to
      do
      something
      !
      I
      really
      wouldn't
      like
      it
      if
      one
      of
      my
      friend
      tell
      everybody
      that
      i'm
      planning
      to
      kill
      myself
      but
      if
      you
      do
      nothing
      you'll
      always
      have
      regrets
      and
      it
      seems
      a
      bit
      selfish
      but
      it
      is
      a
      too
      big
      responsibility
      you
      can't
      handle.
      Then
      if
      you
      talk
      together
      and
      that
      she
      says
      she
      really
      wanna
      do
      it
      and
      that
      she
      has
      no
      regrets
      then
      you
      need
      to
      be
      there
      for
      here
      so
      you
      can
      help
      her
      if
      she
      changes
      her
      mind.
      But
      remember
      :
      don't
      judge
      her
      it
      is
      the
      worst
      thing
      you
      can
      do!
      I
      hope
      it
      helped
      let
      us
      now
      if
      she
      gets
      better
      :)

      Talk
      about
      your
      problems
      at
      your
      friends
      is
      not
      selfish.
      It's
      actually
      pretty
      brave
      you
      know
      ?
      I
      don't
      have
      the
      courage
      to
      talk
      to
      anybody
      about
      it
      and
      i'm
      16
      too.
      If
      your
      friends
      leave
      then
      it
      means
      there
      aren't
      ready
      to
      face
      people
      with
      depression
      that's
      all
      perhaps
      they'll
      come
      back
      later.
      If
      you
      need
      to
      talk
      do
      it
      don't
      doubt
      so
      much
      and
      you
      look
      to
      be
      an
      amazing
      girl
      when
      i
      read
      you'
      Please
      stop
      thinking
      about
      suicide
      (i
      know
      it
      is
      hard
      i
      don't
      always
      succeed
      i
      often
      spend
      days
      with
      dark
      ideas)
      Finally
      being
      yourself
      with
      your
      friends
      is
      much
      better
      than
      fake
      happiness
      like
      i
      do
      it's
      horrible
      because
      sometimes
      people
      are
      angry
      because
      i'm
      lazy
      and
      these
      kind
      of
      stuff.
      That
      s****.
      So
      i
      hope
      my
      comment
      was
      usefull
      and
      sorry
      for
      the
      faults
      my
      english
      is
      bad.

      You
      know
      i
      disagree
      with
      him
      too
      but
      i
      think
      he
      wanted
      to
      be
      nice.
      If
      he's
      here
      i
      suppose
      he
      has
      some
      problems
      too.
      And
      if
      his
      tips
      is
      "
      you
      need
      to
      find
      friends"
      then
      i
      take
      the
      advice
      i
      mean
      i'm
      hopeless
      (And
      i
      find
      sad
      you
      guys
      look
      angry.
      Who
      know
      maybay
      he
      really
      wanted
      to
      help......
      Even
      if
      i
      agree
      it's
      not
      easy
      and
      when
      he
      says
      it
      looks
      like
      that's
      stupid
      we
      didn't
      do
      it
      before)

      First
      (i
      think
      it's
      the
      most
      important)
      never
      judge
      her
      for
      anything
      for
      example
      if
      one
      day
      she
      woke
      up
      at
      1
      pm
      and
      that
      you
      planned
      to
      see
      her
      at
      10am.
      Don't
      be
      angry.
      Then
      she
      just
      have
      to
      know
      that
      you'll
      always
      listen
      to
      her
      (again
      don't
      judge
      just
      listen)
      also
      you
      can
      hug
      her
      or
      stuff
      like
      this
      because
      physical
      contacts
      is
      very
      usefull
      and
      finally
      you
      can
      help
      her
      with
      stuff
      do
      her
      shopping,...
      But
      you
      shouldn't
      ask
      her
      to
      do
      it
      let
      your
      friend
      say
      she
      needs
      your
      help
      (exept
      if
      you
      see
      she
      needs
      something
      of
      course)
      But
      when
      you're
      depressed
      you
      don't
      like
      that
      people
      worry
      to
      much
      about
      you
      so
      don't
      always
      say
      Are
      you
      alright
      ??
      How
      can
      i
      help?
      I'll
      call
      you
      when
      i
      arrive
      home
      ok
      ???!
      She
      could
      reject
      you
      Hope
      that
      helped
      (And
      sorry
      my
      english

      Mmmhhh
      ..
      well
      suicide
      looks
      the
      best
      way
      to
      end
      our
      suffering
      but
      be
      sure
      you
      don't
      have
      any
      regrets
      before
      you
      leave
      (i
      have
      one
      or
      two
      regrets
      so
      i
      won't
      kill
      myself
      right
      now
      but
      who
      know
      maybay
      later
      ?or
      i'll
      find
      happiness
      if
      it
      exists...)
      Anyway
      if
      you'll
      do
      it
      then...

      Well
      you
      took
      the
      right
      decision
      i'm
      sure
      i
      would
      feel
      better
      to
      if
      i
      told
      them
      everything
      but
      i
      just
      can't
      it's
      too
      hard...
      Maybay
      someday....
      Still
      isn't
      it
      strange
      your
      psychiatrist
      send
      a
      mail
      to
      your
      parents
      ?
      I
      mean
      finally
      everything's
      ok
      and
      better
      than
      before
      but
      if
      they
      had
      reject
      you...
      It
      wouldn't
      be
      professionel
      from
      your
      doctor.

      I

      I

      you'll
      stop
      and
      you'll
      find
      happiness.

      I'd
      like
      to
      say
      you
      need
      to
      do
      both
      but
      yesterday
      the
      guy
      I
      told
      I
      was
      depressed
      Friday
      texted
      me
      to
      say
      he
      never
      wants
      to
      talk
      about
      it.
      Yeah
      it's
      a
      real
      push
      in
      the
      gut.
      So
      do
      it
      if
      trust
      him
      100%
      else
      i
      think
      it's
      a
      bad
      idea
      At
      least
      IMO

      That's
      rude
      :(
      yesterday
      I've
      been
      rejected
      by
      the
      first
      guy
      I
      told
      I'm
      depressed
      so
      it's
      not
      really
      encouraging
      for
      saying
      it
      to
      other
      people...
      I
      guess
      I
      should
      keep
      faking
      happiness
      until
      it's
      not
      more
      possible...
      I'll

      I
      actually
      don't
      dare
      to
      talk
      about
      it

      the

      I
      tried

      it's
      not

      much
      encouraging
      for
      saying
      it
      to
      anyone
      else.
      So
      now
      I
      just
      want
      to
      keep
      faking
      happiness

      I

      This
      looks
      hard
      men.
      I
      feel
      a
      bit
      the
      same
      way
      :
      gaming
      is
      today
      the
      last
      thing
      that
      make
      me
      happy.
      I
      lost
      motivation
      in
      everything
      but
      that.
      My
      mum
      wants
      me
      to
      study,
      unfortunately
      I
      even
      lost
      motivation
      in
      that
      and
      I'm
      failing
      more
      and
      more.
      So
      she's
      always
      angry
      and
      always
      take
      my
      PlayStation
      my
      phone,...
      Yet
      she
      doesn't
      know
      I'm
      fucking
      bad
      in
      my
      skin,
      that
      I
      hate
      myself,
      that
      if
      I
      don't
      kill
      myself
      it's
      only
      because
      I'm
      coward.
      So
      I
      think
      I
      can
      understand
      how
      feel
      and
      all
      I
      can
      do
      is
      to
      wish
      you
      some
      more
      courage.
      Hang
      in
      there
      men
      I
      really
      hope
      you'll
      be
      happy
      later.
      In
      fact
      in
      a
      few
      years
      I
      guess
      you
      will
      be
      adult
      so
      you'll
      be
      able
      to
      live
      as
      you
      want.

      I
      have
      the
      exact
      same
      thing,
      the
      tips
      you
      give
      work
      most
      of
      the
      time
      for
      me
      too
      but
      unfortunately
      I
      sometimes
      let
      this
      part
      of
      me
      thinks
      for
      me
      and
      there
      I
      only
      negative
      thought
      and
      I
      just
      start
      cutting
      myself.
      I'm
      not
      so
      sure
      I'm
      depressed
      too
      and
      even
      if
      I
      have
      a
      lot
      of
      symptoms
      I
      feel
      like
      I
      shouldn't
      say
      I'm
      depressed
      because
      after
      all
      when
      I
      read
      stuff
      on
      this
      forum
      I
      see
      that
      there
      are
      people
      with
      better
      or
      bigger)
      reason
      to
      be
      sad
      and
      that
      stupid
      voice
      always
      tell
      me
      that
      I'm
      just
      faking
      depression.
      That's
      why
      I
      never
      talked
      about
      it
      and
      that
      nobody
      knows
      I'm
      sad
      :
      I
      don't
      dare
      talking
      about
      it.
      (And
      my
      English
      is
      bad

      Thanks
      for
      answering
      so
      quickly
      :)
      Ok
      so
      I
      guess
      I
      should
      first
      see
      a
      psychiatrist
      ?
      I
      mean
      I
      understand
      they
      do
      a
      different
      job
      but
      it's
      better
      to
      start
      with
      a
      psychiatrist
      ?
      And
      of
      course
      later
      I'd
      see
      both
      if
      I
      see
      I
      need
      it.

      I
      also
      cut
      myself
      (for
      three
      years
      now)
      The
      physical
      pain
      make
      me
      "forget"
      about
      the
      sorrow
      for
      a
      few
      seconds
      so
      I
      truly
      enjoy
      it.
      But
      after
      doing
      it
      I
      always
      feel
      worse
      than
      before
      doing
      it
      so
      I'm
      currently
      trying
      to
      stop
      which
      is
      difficult
      when
      you
      did
      it
      during
      3
      years...
      So
      my
      friend,
      stop
      right
      now
      ok
      ?
      It
      sucks
      to
      cut
      yourself.
      I
      know
      it
      because
      I'm
      still
      doing
      it.
      You
      have
      to
      stop
      before
      you'll
      get
      addicted.
      I
      truly
      thought
      I
      would
      never
      be
      addicted
      to,
      that
      I
      totally
      controlled
      it,
      but
      it's
      not
      true....
      There
      will
      be
      some
      days
      where,
      even
      if
      you
      don't
      want
      to,
      you'll
      finally
      cut
      yourself.
      So
      try
      to
      stop
      now
      while
      it's
      not
      too
      difficult.
      Try
      to
      do
      something
      else
      when
      you
      truly
      want
      to
      cut
      yourself
      like
      playing
      with
      something
      (a
      spinning
      top
      or
      something....).
      It
      really
      can
      be
      a
      silly
      thing
      but
      It'll
      always
      be
      better
      than
      cuttting
      yourself.
      Hang
      in
      there
      men.
      I
      truly
      hope
      you'll
      get
      out
      of
      this
      shit.
      (Sorry
      for
      the
      faults
      my
      English
      is
      bad)

      Just
      the
      thoughtful
      don't
      worry.
      Whatever
      I'm
      a
      coward
      so
      I
      could
      never
      kill
      myself.

      Ok
      I
      guess
      I'll
      do
      that.(
      Just
      need
      to
      find
      the
      courage
      to
      talk
      about
      it
      with
      real
      people...)
      Thanks
      for
      helping
      me
      :)

      No
      you
      didn't
      fail
      bro.
      If
      she
      did
      this
      it
      only
      means
      she
      thought
      it
      was
      the
      better
      way
      to
      forget
      the
      mental
      pain
      (actually
      that's
      why
      I
      do
      it
      so
      I
      think
      that's
      it
      but
      I
      can
      be
      wrong).
      Now
      as
      a
      partner
      you
      need
      to
      be
      there
      for
      her
      and
      to
      let
      her
      know
      that
      she
      can
      count
      on
      you.
      So
      you'll
      be
      able
      to
      make
      her
      understand
      it's
      useless
      to
      cut
      herself.
      I
      mean
      it's
      a
      lot
      easier
      to
      stop
      at
      the
      beginning
      than
      stop
      after
      3
      years
      (which
      is
      my
      case).
      So
      yeah
      good
      luck
      bro
      I
      know
      you
      can
      help
      (Just
      final
      thing
      don't
      judge
      her
      for
      what
      she
      did
      :
      she
      would
      only
      feel
      guilty
      and
      want
      to
      do
      it
      more)
      (And
      sorry
      for
      the
      faults
      my
      English
      is
      bad)

      Indeed
      I
      am
      a
      bit
      scared
      of
      talking
      of
      my
      thoughts
      of
      suicide
      and
      that's
      why
      I
      didn't
      want
      to
      talk
      about
      this
      specific
      point
      with
      my
      parents
      (and
      also
      mutilation).
      But
      yeah
      I'd
      better
      find
      the
      correct
      words
      with
      the
      doctor
      too.

      Coffee,
      but

      then
      go
      back
      to
      bed
      for
      10

      I
      need

      And
      yes
      I
      guess
      it's
      a
      good
      point
      that
      I
      ate

      single
      thing.

      it
      doesn't
      mean

      garbage
      ya

      I

      Well
      tbh
      of
      course
      I
      won't
      be
      sad
      forever
      if
      you
      killed
      yourself
      because
      I
      don't
      know
      you.
      But
      it
      doesn't
      mean
      that
      we
      don't
      care
      about
      you.
      Everyone
      here
      share
      their
      problem
      so
      they
      can
      vent
      or
      get
      help,
      get
      some
      hope,
      help
      others,...
      Now
      if
      you
      tell
      me
      why
      you
      feel
      that
      way
      of
      course
      I
      would
      be
      sad
      bro.
      However
      I
      totally
      understand
      how
      you
      feel.
      I
      am
      also
      sure
      that
      this
      world
      would
      be
      god
      damn
      better
      without
      me.
      And
      that
      nobody
      is
      truly
      my
      friend.
      Don't
      worry
      dude
      you
      are
      not
      alone
      here
      :)
      Nobody
      don't
      care
      of
      the
      others
      on
      this
      sub.
      I
      hope
      you'll
      be
      better
      because
      this
      is
      what
      everyone
      here
      want
      to
      have
      and
      want
      to
      bring
      to
      the
      others
      (There
      are
      surely
      a
      lot
      of
      faults
      I'm
      sorry
      my

      Mmhhh
      all
      I
      can
      say
      is
      that
      you
      need
      help.
      I
      know
      easier
      said
      than
      done
      but
      it's
      really
      helpful.
      Depression,
      anxiety,
      lack
      of
      self
      esteem
      ruin
      our
      life.
      This
      is
      something
      nobody
      can
      live
      with
      and
      have
      a
      happy
      life.
      Now
      I
      guess
      the
      best
      thing
      to
      do
      is
      to
      have
      a
      therapist.
      If
      you
      already
      have
      one
      then
      I
      dunno
      what
      to
      say
      :/
      all
      I
      can
      ask
      you
      is
      to
      hang
      in
      there
      because
      happiness
      has
      to
      exist....
      somewhere.....I
      hope.....
      If
      you
      hurt
      yourself
      then
      I
      know
      it's
      really
      good
      (I
      also
      do)
      but
      I
      also
      know
      it
      sucks.
      So
      I
      hope
      you'll
      find
      the
      strength
      to
      stop.
      I
      wish
      you
      all
      the
      best
      :)

      bro,
      I

      luck
      because
      we
      truly
      need
      some
      :)

      Yeah
      loneliness
      is
      one
      of
      the
      worst
      thing
      ever
      but
      we
      have
      to
      live
      with
      it
      I
      guess
      :/
      God
      damnit
      I
      feel
      like
      I
      have
      nothing
      to
      do
      in
      this
      world.
      (I'm
      listening
      to
      Linkin
      Park
      for
      now
      it
      works
      too)

      Well
      because
      when
      I
      feel
      too
      bad,
      cutting
      myself
      is
      relaxing
      and
      make
      me
      stop
      crying.
      And
      it
      works
      pretty
      well.
      But
      after
      a
      few
      minutes
      I
      start
      feeling
      even
      worse
      because
      of
      it
      so
      I
      guess
      it's
      not
      a
      good
      solution.

      Same
      here
      bro.
      Well
      I
      guess
      we
      are
      sick
      or
      something
      like
      that.
      I
      think
      I'm
      in
      a
      bad
      depression
      but
      I
      never
      really
      talk
      about
      it.
      A
      psychiatrist
      shall
      be
      a
      good
      start
      if
      we
      wanna
      feel
      better.

      Yeah
      tbh
      for
      now
      I
      feel
      like
      life
      is
      too
      long.
      In
      fact
      I'm
      not
      really
      searching
      for
      a
      happy
      life
      I
      know
      I
      will
      never
      have
      one
      and
      it's
      ok.
      I
      just
      don't
      wanna
      say
      to
      others
      that
      I
      cut
      myself
      ya
      know
      ?
      I
      truly
      don't
      want
      to
      look
      more
      different
      than
      the
      others.
      I
      try
      to
      be
      a
      normal
      guy
      so
      it's
      better
      to
      be
      alone
      for
      that.
      And
      it's
      not
      like
      I
      deserve
      any
      help.
      So
      I
      just
      to
      know
      how
      to
      stop
      cutting
      myself,
      there
      must
      be
      a
      way
      to
      do
      it
      without
      help
      right
      ?

      I
      do
      it
      every
      day
      I
      think.
      Not
      because
      I
      plan
      to
      kill
      myself
      or
      anything.
      I
      do
      it
      that's
      it.
      It's
      not
      relaxing
      or
      something
      like
      that.
      I
      don't
      know
      why
      I
      do
      it.
      Do
      you
      also
      do
      it
      ?

      what

      mean.
      Indeed
      maybe
      it
      helps
      me
      too
      in
      a
      certain
      way.
      I
      don't

      I
      don't
      understand
      myself

      Yeah
      I

      we
      are
      a

      of
      weirdo

      something
      like

      :p
      But
      seriously
      there
      must
      be
      something.
      Maybe
      it's
      just
      because
      we
      are
      sick
      ?

      Yeah
      I
      know
      how
      you
      feel
      :
      this
      feels
      good
      for
      a
      moment,
      then
      you
      feel
      bad,
      then
      you
      are
      scared
      of
      being
      addicted
      because
      you
      did
      that
      3
      times
      this
      week.
      Self
      harm
      feels
      good
      even
      if
      it's
      little
      and
      that
      it
      doesn't
      bleed
      and
      that
      there
      are
      no
      scars
      after
      it.
      But
      it's
      still
      something
      bad
      and
      it
      needs
      to
      be
      cured
      before
      the
      addiction
      get
      too
      strong
      :/
      You
      truly
      have
      to
      get
      help
      quickly
      even
      if
      you
      think
      it's
      not
      that
      bad.
      Do
      not
      like
      me
      :
      don't
      think
      it
      will
      pass.
      It
      will
      not.
      So
      talk
      about
      it
      with
      a
      friend,
      with
      someone
      of
      your
      family,
      your
      psychiatrist
      (if
      you
      have
      one)
      or
      with
      people
      on
      forums.
      You
      need
      help
      bro.
      I'm
      here
      if
      you
      need.
      Sorry
      my
      English
      sucks
      :/

      Yeah
      I
      totally
      get
      that,
      to
      be
      honest,
      I
      never
      told
      it
      to
      anyone
      in
      real
      life.
      I'm
      really
      scared
      of
      their
      reaction.
      However
      I
      know
      this
      is
      not
      a
      good
      option.
      I
      am
      just
      a
      pussy
      so
      I
      can't
      do
      it
      but...
      hey
      man,
      you
      have
      to
      think
      about
      it.
      Nobody
      can
      pass
      through
      this
      shit
      alone.
      We
      shouldn't
      stay
      in
      shit
      because
      of
      that.
      It's
      ok
      if
      you
      don't
      want
      to
      talk
      about
      it
      with
      real
      people.
      It's
      normal
      don't
      worry
      :)
      now
      we
      can
      talk
      about
      it
      here
      if
      you
      are
      ok
      with
      that.
