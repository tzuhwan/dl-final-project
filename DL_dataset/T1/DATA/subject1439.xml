      Hey
      there!
      First
      off,
      I #8217;d
      like
      to
      put
      out
      there
      I #8217;m
      not
      a
      creep
      or
      socially
      inept
      and
      won #8217;t
      do
      or
      request
      you
      to
      do
      anything
      you #8217;re
      uncomfortable
      with.
      I #8217;m
      also
      attractive
      and
      in
      shape!
      I
      hope
      you
      help
      open
      this
      new
      door
      for
      me
      as
      I #8217;ve
      never
      been
      intimate
      with
      someone
      who
      is
      transgender.
      If
      you #8217;re
      interested
      just
      say
      hi
      :)

      First
      off
      I
      would
      like
      to
      apologize
      if
      this
      has
      been
      posted
      already;
      I
      am
      new
      to
      reddit.
      Anyways,
      is
      it
      me
      or
      does
      it
      seem
      that
      the
      grenades
      are
      much
      weaker
      than
      previous
      games?
      Example:
      Enemy
      was
      in
      a
      small
      quarters
      room
      with
      my
      presence
      unknown
      with
      a
      successful
      grenade
      tossed
      into
      said
      room.
      This
      resulted
      in
      only
      doing
      damage
      to
      the
      enemy
      but
      not
      killing
      them.
      I
      have
      had
      several
      incidences
      similar
      to
      this
      where
      I've
      tossed
      a
      grenade
      into
      a
      kumbaya
      circle
      of
      enemies
      with
      the
      same
      negative
      results
      I
      expected.
      Honestly,
      I
      don't
      think
      I've
      had
      one
      successful
      grenade
      kill
      in
      BFV....If
      I
      am
      not
      mistaken
      there
      is
      a
      reason
      for
      the
      saying
      "close
      only
      counts
      in
      horseshoes
      and
      hand
      grenades."
      On
      to
      the
      next,
      Light
      Machine
      Guns:
      Before
      I
      start
      my
      complaints
      about
      this
      particular
      class
      of
      weapons
      I
      would
      like
      to
      state
      that
      I
      am
      traditionally
      a
      Hardcore
      mode
      player,
      therefore
      I
      am
      used
      to
      firing
      less
      rounds
      at
      center
      mass
      for
      a
      successful
      kill.
      I
      have
      noticed
      most
      of
      the
      LMG
      weapons
      damage
      ratings
      are
      surprisingly
      low
      and
      corresponds
      with
      the
      damage
      one
      would
      assume
      it
      would
      do
      to
      your
      target.
      I
      know
      Hardcore
      has
      not
      been
      implemented
      yet
      (patience
      IS
      a
      virtue)
      but
      I
      do
      think
      this
      is
      a
      better
      Core
      version
      than
      some
      of
      its
      predecessors.
      Maybe
      it's
      just
      me,
      but
      I
      feel
      like
      it
      takes
      away
      some
      of
      the
      enjoyment
      of
      the
      game
      but
      robbing
      players
      of
      legitimate
      should
      be
      kills.
      \-
      Snark.

      sorry
      accidentally
      deleted
      that
      thread
      and
      re
      posted.
      I
      agree
      -
      It's
      my
      favorite
      class
      of
      weapon
      in
      the
      game
      I
      just
      feel
      they
      are
      underpowered.
      Maybe
      it
      is
      just
      because
      I
      am
      used
      to
      hardcore
      mode
      where
      less
      rounds
      neutralize
      the
      target.

      I
      agree,
      grenades
      are
      multifaceted
      and
      have
      different
      purposes
      than
      solely
      blowing
      shit
      to
      pieces.
      BUT,
      I
      don't
      think
      it's
      unreasonable
      to
      expect
      if
      you
      toss
      a
      nade
      into
      a
      closed
      room
      for
      it
      to
      neutralize
      the
      enemy.
      It's
      been
      soooooo
      long
      since
      I've
      played
      bf3
      or
      4
      but
      I
      do
      agree
      that
      they
      were
      similar.
      Although,
      I
      feel
      that
      the
      standard
      weapon
      in
      those
      games
      compensated
      for
      a
      lesser
      powered
      grenade.
      Just
      my
      thoughts
      :)

      I
      would
      agree
      with
      this
      statement,
      LMGs
      are
      more
      practical
      in
      one
      setting
      compared
      to
      the
      next
      and
      the
      recoil
      and
      small
      ammo
      capacity
      make
      it
      something
      to
      take
      into
      consideration
      when
      in
      combat.
      As
      far
      as
      the
      assault
      class
      goes
      I
      would
      say
      is
      the
      most
      well
      rounded
      class
      in
      the
      game
      that
      offers
      the
      most
      user
      friendly
      weapons.

      I
      love
      laying
      down
      suppressing
      fire
      for
      the
      sake
      of

      purpose!
      I
      wish
      the

      capacity
      was
      larger
      for
      proper

      though.

      I
      agree.
      This
      has
      been
      something
      infuriating
      me,
      when
      you #8217;re

      and
      shoot
      them
      in
      the

      with
      the
      Gewehr
      and
      it
      doesn #8217;t
      kill
      them.
      What
      the
      fuck
      is
      up
      with
      that?
      I
      hope
      so
      much
      that
      they
      make
      a
      hardcore

      I
      can #8217;t

      I
      have
      seen
      a
      couple
      older
      threads
      proposing
      this
      concept.
      However,I
      couldn't
      help
      but
      start
      a
      new
      thread.
      I
      think
      a
      small
      team
      based
      dog-fight
      mode
      would
      be
      oodles
      of
      fun,especially
      with
      the
      old
      WWII
      airplanes.
      Teams
      could
      be
      something
      like
      from
      1v1
      to
      5v5.
      I
      am
      kind
      of
      surprised
      that
      this
      isn't
      a

      More
      or
      less.
      I
      was
      thinking
      with
      less
      objectives
      other
      than
      to
      shoot
      down
      enemy
      planes,
      so
      deathmatch
      in
      the
      skies.
      I
      haven't
      played
      BF1
      in
      forever
      and
      I
      guess
      I
      was
      unaware
      those
      modes
      were
      available
      VIA
      DLC.

      I
      agree,
      my
      patience
      with
      EA/dice
      is
      being
      stretched
      thinner

      strategy
      was.

      I
      couldn't
      agree
      more.
      I
      have
      just
      started
      upgrading
      some
      of
      my
      planes
      too
      so
      I
      don't
      have
      the
      best
      weapons
      yet
      and
      I
      find
      myself
      behind
      enemy
      planes
      doing
      little
      damage
      OR
      almost
      disabling
      their
      plane
      but
      either
      they
      bank
      sharply
      and
      momentarily
      lose
      my
      tail
      enough
      to
      repair
      or
      I
      get
      caught
      by
      back
      up
      and
      get
      destroyed.
      I
      am
      getting
      better
      at
      staying
      in
      the
      air
      longer
      but
      still
      struggle
      with
      finishing
      off
      enemy
      planes.

      That

      my

      I
      believe
      it #8217;s
      a
      Mel
      Pardue
      model.
      The
      reason
      for
      the
      curved
      blade
      and
      raw
      metal
      look
      is
      because
      I
      bought
      it
      from
      a
      seller
      on
      eBay
      who
      purchased
      the
      knife
      originally
      with
      a
      serrated
      blade
      and
      a
      broken
      tip.
      So
      he
      grinded
      down
      the
      serration
      and
      put
      a
      new
      tip
      on
      it
      and
      did
      some
      acid
      like
      washing
      on
      the
      metal
      clip
      and
      blade
      to
      give
      it
      the
      cool
      raw
      color.
      When
      I
      first
      got
      it
      about
      4
      years
      ago
      I
      got
      a
      lot
      of
      shit
      from
      knife
      enthusiast
      on
      different
      forums
      but
      I #8217;ve
      honestly
      never
      regretted
      the
      purchase.
      Hoes
      will
      be
      hoes
      I
      suppose.

      That's
      kind
      of
      what
      I
      was
      thinking.
      I've
      had
      my
      benchmade
      folding
      knife
      for
      over
      3
      years
      -
      it's
      black
      and
      losing
      it
      is
      honestly
      my
      biggest
      concern.
      Luckily,
      for
      me
      I
      am
      pretty
      good
      at
      keeping
      tabs
      on
      my
      tools
      like
      that.
      Other
      things...not
      so
      much.

      If
      they
      only
      knew
      the
      atrocious
      things
      I
      scream
      about
      them
      into
      my
      microphone
      and
      how
      I
      sincerely
      mean
      it.
      I
      get
      it,
      if
      you #8217;re
      like
      4
      years
      old.
      But
      if
      you #8217;re
      just
      prancing
      around
      as
      a
      medic
      not
      reviving
      people
      YOU
      are
      part
      of
      what #8217;s
      wrong.
      It #8217;s
      easy,
      throw
      some
      god
      damn
      smoke
      and
      heal
      your
      mates.

      It

      the

      a

      That
      seems
      about
      right.
      Yeah
      it #8217;s
      easy
      to
      shit
      all
      over
      the
      developers
      and
      call
      out
      the
      flaws
      of
      the
      game.
      I
      still
      find
      it
      fun
      even
      when
      I
      get
      frustrated.
      However,
      I
      understand
      that
      this
      game
      among
      others
      is
      a
      cut
      above
      the
      rest.
      It
      offers
      things
      that
      most
      games
      don #8217;t.
      Also,
      people
      forget
      how
      hard
      developers
      work
      at
      making
      these
      games
      for
      us
      -
      I
      have
      zero
      experience
      in
      the
      field
      but
      from
      my
      understanding
      they
      work
      relentlessly.
      Give
      these
      guys
      a
      break
      and
      enjoy
      the
      game.

      and
      nail'em

      understand
      how
      this

      the

      because
      it's
      a

      I
      am
      talking

      pretty
      much
      any
      weapon
      -
      including
      the
      Gewehr
      should
      result
      in
      a
      kill
      with
      one
      shot

      Sure,
      and
      that
      makes
      sense
      however
      -
      shouldn't
      distance
      also
      be
      a
      factor?
      It
      just
      really
      irks
      me
      that
      you
      can
      literally
      be
      point
      blank
      and
      you
      have
      to
      double
      tap.
      I
      am
      traditionally
      not
      a
      CORE
      player
      and
      it
      has
      been
      awhile
      since
      I
      have
      played
      any
      other
      battlefield
      because
      I
      got
      hooked
      on
      Wildlands
      for
      hot
      minute.
      Has
      this
      always
      been
      the
      case?
      I
      don't
      remember
      this
      in
      the
      older
      BF's,

      They
      are
      a
      dime
      a
      dozen.
      I've
      heard
      suicides,
      domestics,
      shots
      fired.
      But
      more
      specifically
      a
      female
      caller
      advised
      us
      of
      an
      elderly
      male
      trapped
      under
      a
      car
      that
      was
      on
      fire.
      Mind
      you
      the
      car
      was
      upright.
      The
      female
      caller
      was
      upset
      because
      her
      car
      was
      parked
      next
      his.
      He
      survived
      with
      over
      50%
      3rd
      degree
      burns
      to
      his
      lower
      extremities.
      Otherwise
      a
      funnier
      call
      was
      a
      goose
      flew
      into
      some
      powerlines,
      died,
      started
      on
      fire,
      started
      the
      grass
      on
      fire,
      the
      grass
      then
      started
      a
      shed
      on
      fire.
      By
      the
      end
      of
      each
      day
      I
      try
      to
      think
      of
      the
      craziest
      call
      but
      they
      all
      just
      kind
      of
      blur
      together.

      One
      that
      scared
      me
      though
      was
      an
      active
      shooter
      at
      a
      funeral
      for
      a
      prominent
      member
      of
      BLM's
      son.
      I
      have
      never
      seen
      our
      phones
      and
      system/interface
      lit
      up
      like
      that
      -
      it
      looked
      like
      milton
      bradleys
      simon
      (which
      probably
      means
      nothing)
      But
      every
      call
      was
      a
      911
      open
      line
      -
      meaning
      people
      were
      calling
      911
      but
      when
      we
      answered
      no
      one
      was
      talking,
      all
      that
      was
      heard
      were
      the
      fire
      alarms,
      screaming
      and
      people
      hysterically
      stating
      they
      were
      shooting
      people.
      The
      suspect
      got
      away
      initially
      but
      enough
      eyewitnesses
      were
      able
      to
      provide
      credible
      enough
      information
      to
      eventually
      make
      an
      arrest.
      Also,
      on
      one
      of
      my
      darkest
      days
      here
      I
      remember
      seeing
      a
      welfare
      check
      go
      into
      our
      incident
      queue
      for
      my
      address
      to
      do
      a
      welfare
      check
      on
      my
      roommate
      whom
      I
      spoke
      with
      just
      a
      moment
      beforehand.
      It
      was
      incredibly
      hard
      for
      me
      to
      not
      advise
      him
      that
      officers
      were
      coming
      over
      to
      speak
      with
      him.

      It
      really
      depends.
      I #8217;ve
      been
      training
      in
      a
      new
      area
      at
      night
      so
      it #8217;s
      actually
      a
      lot
      more
      quiet
      than
      you
      would
      think.
      But
      domestics
      are
      really
      common,
      vehicle
      accidents
      are
      also
      really
      common.
      Our
      agency
      is
      metro
      so
      we
      get
      a
      fair
      amount
      of
      shots
      fired
      calls.
      Now
      that
      winter
      is
      here
      and
      people
      leave
      their
      cars
      running
      to
      warm
      up
      motor
      vehicle
      thefts
      are
      non
      stop.
      Otherwise
      it #8217;s
      non
      police/fire/medic
      issues
      and
      are
      considered
      civil
      issues
      or
      people
      who
      need
      direction
      and
      guidance.
      When
      I
      work
      days
      it #8217;s
      a
      lot
      of
      admin
      tasks
      mixed
      with
      emergency
      calls.
      One
      minute
      I
      may
      be
      generating
      a
      case
      number
      for
      an
      officer
      next
      minute
      it
      could
      be
      a
      matter
      of
      life
      or
      death.

      All
      the
      time!
      That #8217;s
      one
      thing
      that #8217;s
      hard
      to
      talk
      yourself
      down
      from
      but
      there
      are
      only
      so
      many
      officers
      to
      assist
      and
      they
      can #8217;t
      always
      respond
      by
      themselves
      with
      the
      info
      given
      necessarily.
      Everything
      is
      based
      off
      of
      priority
      and
      sometimes
      high
      priority
      calls
      wait
      sometimes
      until
      and
      officer
      can
      be
      reassigned
      or
      break
      from
      a
      call.
      But
      yes
      it
      can
      get
      really
      frustrating
      when
      you
      are
      waiting
      to
      see
      a
      squad
      be
      assigned.
      I
      will
      do
      things
      like
      stay
      on
      the
      phone
      with
      them
      until
      they
      arrive
      or
      advise
      if
      they
      need
      to
      set
      the
      phone
      down
      they
      can
      as
      long
      as
      they
      don #8217;t
      hang
      up.

      reiterate
      -
      I
      was
      at
      work
      and
      saw
      my
      address
      come
      up
      which
      naturally
      sparked
      my
      curiosity
      and
      it
      was
      my
      roommates
      manager
      calling
      in
      a
      welfare
      check.
      Due
      to
      laws/policy
      I
      wanted
      to
      advise
      him
      cops
      were
      coming
      but
      I
      couldn #8217;t.

      Of
      course!
      I #8217;m
      training
      in
      our
      Data
      channel
      now
      so
      I #8217;m
      dealing
      with
      officers
      more
      directly
      than
      the
      callers.
      right
      now
      I
      run
      or
      enter
      stolen
      guns,
      vehicles,
      articles.
      Run
      criminal
      history
      on
      traffic
      stops,
      read
      back
      warrants
      or
      cautions
      or
      enter
      BOLOS
      (be
      on
      the
      look
      out)
      etc.
      it #8217;s
      less
      stressful
      in
      ways
      but
      easy
      to
      get
      busy
      and
      behind.
      So
      if
      my
      grammar
      is
      horrendous
      I
      apologize.

      I
      was
      a
      smoker
      at
      the
      time
      (haven #8217;t
      had
      a
      cigarette
      since
      thanksgiving!)
      I
      remember
      asking
      a
      supervisor
      if
      I
      could
      take
      a
      break
      out
      of
      turn
      to
      go
      chain
      smoke.
      It #8217;s
      a
      small
      world
      -
      I #8217;ve
      taken
      calls
      from
      people
      I
      know.
      I #8217;ve
      had
      calls
      in
      regards
      to
      people
      I
      know,
      doing
      things
      you
      didn #8217;t
      think
      they
      would
      do.
      It #8217;s
      a
      strange
      way
      to
      find
      out
      your
      acquaintances
      in
      life
      are
      in
      a
      crisis,
      have
      been
      arrested
      or
      injured.
      Ever
      since
      that
      day
      I
      fear
      taking
      a
      regrettable
      call
      because
      I
      know
      it #8217;s
      happened
      to
      other
      911
      operators.

      I
      had
      a
      long
      stay
      at
      the
      Stanley
      Hotel
      in
      Colorado
      where
      I
      was
      working
      on
      a
      novel.
      It
      was
      just
      my
      wife
      Wendy
      and
      my
      son
      Danny.
      Eventually
      all
      work
      and
      no
      play
      made
      me
      a
      dull
      boy
      causing

      hallucinations
      which
      in

      caused

      my
      family.
      It
      took
      some
      time
      for
      it
      all
      to
      blow
      over
      but
      after
      a
      brief
      walk
      in
      the
      gorgeous
      hedge
      maze
      I
      was
      able
      to
      chill
      out.

      Yes!
      The
      address
      is
      important
      or
      location,
      rather.
      We
      can #8217;t
      send
      help
      if
      we
      don #8217;t
      know
      where
      you
      are.
      From
      that
      point
      on
      it #8217;s
      best
      to
      just
      let
      the
      operator
      ask
      questions
      and
      they
      may
      seem
      redundant,
      arbitrary
      or
      irrelevant
      but
      there
      is
      a
      reason
      they
      ask.
      People
      like
      to
      ask
      why
      I
      need
      to

      that
      or
      refuse
      to

      I
      know
      this
      will
      be
      a
      big
      reveal
      but...(I
      shouldn #8217;t
      have
      to
      spell
      this
      out
      but
      I
      do)
      the
      quicker
      you
      answer
      the
      questions
      the
      quicker
      we
      can
      get
      help
      en
      route,
      the
      quicker
      we
      can
      catch
      the
      suspect,
      the
      quicker
      we
      can
      perform
      chest
      compressions.
      I
      know
      it
      can
      be
      hard
      to
      focus
      and
      keep
      composure
      during
      a
      crisis
      but
      it
      is
      paramount
      for
      everyone
      safety
      involved.

      My
      agency
      has
      implemented
      a
      text
      to
      911
      feature
      if
      someone
      is
      unable
      to
      call.
      Otherwise
      we
      do
      use
      programs
      that
      ping
      from
      cel
      phone
      towers
      to
      give
      us
      a
      certain
      radius
      from
      where
      they
      are
      calling
      from.
      The
      pinging
      can
      be
      very
      accurate
      or
      it
      is
      unable
      to
      update
      to
      a
      viable
      radius
      or
      update
      before
      the
      line
      disconnects.
      I
      the
      911
      operator
      takes
      the
      call
      and
      obtain
      an
      address
      or
      location
      that
      has
      to
      be
      geoverified
      so
      that
      when
      our
      dispatchers
      send
      out
      officers,
      fire
      or
      medics
      the
      location
      is
      sent
      to
      their
      Squad
      CAD
      (Computer
      Aided
      Dispatch)
      which
      will
      also
      provide
      them
      with
      the
      caller
      info
      and
      any
      updates
      to
      the
      call.
      Sometimes
      people
      call
      on
      911
      only
      cell
      phones
      -
      where
      they
      can
      ONLY
      call
      911
      on
      their
      cell
      if
      the
      call
      is
      disconnected
      or
      they
      hang
      up
      before
      we
      call
      them
      back
      we
      are
      unable
      to
      call
      them
      and
      certain
      exigent
      criteria
      and
      legal
      paperwork
      must
      be
      met
      to
      ping
      a
      subscribers
      cellular
      device
      by
      the
      cell
      phone
      companies.
      Also
      we
      keep
      pretty
      good
      history
      of
      phone
      logs
      so
      sometimes
      we
      can
      search
      a
      phone
      number
      to
      see
      if
      they
      have
      called
      us
      before
      and
      requested
      service
      which
      might
      provide
      us
      of
      at
      least
      an
      idea
      of
      an
      address.
      I
      hope
      I
      answered
      your
      question!

      I
      went
      on
      a
      hunting
      trip
      to
      South
      Dakota
      this
      last
      October.
      My
      dad
      has
      been
      going
      for
      many
      many
      years
      and
      this
      was
      my
      first
      time
      out
      there
      with
      the
      family
      and
      it
      was
      over
      my
      29th
      birthday.
      We
      were
      hunting
      pheasants
      and
      on
      my
      birthday
      the
      hunt
      was
      slow
      and
      it
      was
      really
      windy
      and
      all
      the
      birds
      were
      getting
      up
      too
      far
      ahead
      to
      get
      a
      shot
      off.
      At
      this
      point
      being
      my
      birthday
      and
      all
      I
      decided
      to
      get
      my
      day
      pass
      for
      fishing.
      My
      first
      spot
      it
      was
      white
      caps
      and
      high
      gust
      winds
      so
      I
      promptly
      left
      and
      found
      a
      spot
      on
      the
      same
      lake
      less
      than
      a
      quarter
      mile
      away.
      Within
      5
      minutes
      of
      casting
      with
      a
      spin
      bait
      a
      monster
      northern
      pike
      nailed
      my
      lure
      right
      at
      the
      shore
      line.
      Ended
      up
      being
      43"
      long
      and
      about
      20
      pounds.
      From
      there
      on
      I
      caught
      a
      34"
      pike
      and
      36"
      and
      a
      24"
      pike
      and
      a
      nice
      fat
      walleye.
      All
      on
      my
      birthday.
      Largest
      fish
      I
      ever
      caught
      though,
      20lber!!!

      Kid's
      sometimes
      can
      be
      better
      than
      adults
      when
      they
      are
      dealing
      with
      emergencies.
      They
      are
      surprisingly
      and
      sometimes
      brutally
      honest.
      However,
      often
      times
      they
      may
      not
      know
      their
      address
      or
      phone
      number
      or
      information
      that
      could
      provide
      a
      location
      for
      first
      responders.
      Therefore
      it
      is
      important
      for
      the
      parents
      to
      coach
      their
      children
      on
      what
      to
      do
      in
      case
      of
      an
      emergency.
      Most
      important
      details
      for
      a
      child
      to
      know
      would
      be
      address
      and
      phone
      number.
      Second
      would
      be
      to
      not
      hang
      up
      the
      phone,
      they
      may
      set
      down
      the
      phone
      so
      the
      call
      can
      keep
      recording
      and
      the
      operator
      can
      report
      what
      they
      are
      hearing
      in
      the
      background
      but
      this
      can
      be
      dangerous
      to
      both
      the
      caller
      and
      the
      first
      responders
      if
      the
      situation
      escalates
      and
      we
      are
      unable
      to
      advise
      the
      caller
      or
      update
      with
      pertinent
      information.
      In
      addition,
      coaching
      the
      child
      to
      if
      they
      feel
      something
      isn't
      right
      and
      they
      call
      911
      that
      they
      aren't
      going
      to
      be
      in
      trouble
      (as
      long
      as
      they
      aren't
      misusing
      a
      911
      emergency
      line
      which
      happens
      all
      the
      time).
      Kid's
      often
      times
      can't
      be
      as
      descriptive
      as
      adults
      so
      on
      our
      end
      it's
      important
      to
      ask
      close
      ended
      questions
      so
      that
      they
      can
      give
      simple
      answers.
      And
      last,
      but
      not
      least
      if
      you
      don't
      know
      just
      say
      so.
      It's
      better
      than
      making
      something
      up
      or
      providing
      false
      or
      inaccurate
      information.
      It's
      okay
      to
      not
      know
      -
      most
      people
      aren't
      expecting
      their
      crisis
      making
      it
      easy
      to
      not
      remember
      or
      forget
      little
      details.
      The
      kids
      one
      is
      really
      tricky
      though
      because
      I've
      personally
      experienced
      a
      call
      from
      a
      child
      where
      he
      specifically
      said
      someone
      had
      a
      gun
      and
      hurt
      someone
      and
      once
      the
      cellular
      tower
      updated
      a
      close
      enough
      ping
      to
      an
      exact
      address
      I
      told
      him
      that
      officers
      were
      coming
      out
      there
      and
      he
      immediately
      regretted
      the
      call
      because
      he
      knew
      he
      was
      in
      trouble
      for
      lying.
      I
      had
      no
      choice
      but
      to
      treat
      it
      like
      anything
      other
      than
      someone
      with
      a
      gun
      at
      that
      address.
      I've
      also
      spoke
      with
      children
      who
      were
      more
      levelheaded
      and
      calm
      compared
      to
      their
      guardian
      counterparts
      which
      to
      me
      is
      a
      good
      sign
      and
      a
      scary
      one
      because
      they've
      probably
      been
      exposed
      to
      these
      incidents
      so
      often
      that
      it
      becomes
      normal
      behavior
      to
      them.
      The
      bad
      apples
      don't
      always
      last
      very
      long
      however
      bad
      habits
      can
      be
      overlooked
      or
      even
      missed.
      Some
      examples
      of
      bad
      operators
      would
      be
      being
      rude
      to
      the
      callers
      or
      unsympathetic,
      or
      maybe
      not
      prioritizing
      the
      call
      exactly
      right,
      some
      can't
      wait
      to
      pass
      the
      buck.
      However
      there
      is
      a
      lot
      of
      grey
      area
      with
      this
      job
      that
      makes
      a
      lot
      of
      the
      calls
      difficult
      to
      know
      what
      exactly
      to
      do
      with
      it,
      i.e
      whether
      or
      not
      it
      is
      a
      police
      matter,
      even
      if
      it
      isn't
      a
      police
      matter
      the
      police
      can
      still
      go,
      if
      they
      can,
      should
      they?
      Can
      other
      resources
      be
      offered?
      Some
      might
      underestimate
      the
      seriousness
      and
      generate
      a
      call
      with
      a
      lower
      priority
      than
      it
      should/could
      be.
      Almost
      anything
      can
      be
      justified
      as
      long
      as
      you
      make
      a
      solid
      argument
      for
      what
      you
      did.
      Really
      the
      "bad"
      apples
      and
      the
      traits
      most
      noticeable
      are
      internal
      like
      the
      dispatchers
      asking
      in
      a
      condescending
      manner
      why
      you
      put
      the
      call
      in
      the
      way
      you
      did
      or
      just
      general
      attitude
      towards
      others.
      But
      all
      in
      all
      the
      complacency
      is
      probably
      the
      worst
      and
      most
      noticeable
      trait.
      This
      job
      nationally
      has
      an
      extremely
      low
      retention
      rate
      so
      other
      agencies
      may
      keep
      incredibly
      bad
      employees
      simply
      because
      they
      have
      to
      due
      to
      federal
      regulations
      in
      regards
      to
      minimum
      staffing
      requirements
      at
      Public
      Safety
      Answering
      Points.
      On
      the
      other
      hand
      the
      people
      who
      excel
      may
      also
      be
      the
      same
      who
      possess
      bad
      traits
      or
      bad
      habits.
      There
      are
      so
      many
      different
      personalty
      types
      and
      backgrounds
      of
      people
      here
      it
      is
      hard
      to
      say
      what
      traits
      they
      have
      that
      can
      be
      correlated
      to
      success
      because
      everyone
      kind
      of
      has
      there
      own
      style
      on
      the
      phones.
      I
      purposely
      sit
      by
      people
      that
      when
      I
      hear
      them
      on
      a
      call
      and
      listen
      to
      some
      of
      the
      things
      they
      say
      to
      the
      callers
      it
      makes
      me
      laugh
      out
      loud.
      However,
      there
      are
      a
      lot
      of
      kind,
      caring
      and
      compassionate
      people
      that
      I
      work
      with.
      Some
      are
      strictly
      business
      that
      are
      cold
      to
      the
      touch
      and
      some
      are
      the
      kindest
      most
      caring
      people
      you
      could
      ask
      to
      be
      doing
      a
      job
      like
      this.
      For
      the
      most
      part
      people
      who
      are
      good
      at
      building
      rapport,
      taking
      shit,
      being
      an
      effective
      communicator
      and
      not
      afraid
      to
      ask
      questions
      or
      inquire
      details
      you
      normally
      wouldn't
      ask
      people.
      The
      people
      who
      aren't
      designated
      to
      their
      comfort
      zone
      I
      went
      to
      school
      for
      law
      enforcement
      to
      pursuit
      a
      career
      as
      a
      police
      officer
      which
      I
      still
      intend
      to
      do.
      A
      position
      has
      just
      opened
      up
      with
      one
      of
      our
      agencies
      I
      intend
      to
      apply
      for.
      I
      briefly
      redirected
      because
      initially
      I
      was
      offered
      this
      job
      LITERALLY
      the
      day
      after
      I
      graduated
      and
      I
      mean,
      c'mon
      how
      often
      does
      that
      happen?
      Nonetheless
      this
      has
      been
      great
      experience
      for
      me
      and
      a
      great
      segue
      into
      my
      desired
      career
      but
      honestly
      requirement
      wise
      -
      high
      school
      diploma,
      good
      background
      and

      Initially
      training
      is
      hard
      because
      you
      can't
      control
      the
      calls
      you
      get
      and
      some
      people
      are
      like
      magnets
      to
      suicides
      or
      domestics
      while
      others
      get
      boring
      administrative
      calls.
      It
      is
      most
      certainly
      a
      stressful
      job
      and
      we
      are
      provided
      with
      a
      licensed
      counselor
      if
      we
      take
      a
      traumatizing
      call
      or
      if
      we
      feel
      as
      if
      we
      need
      to
      speak
      with
      one
      and
      we
      are
      encouraged
      to
      use
      it.
      In
      fact
      we
      are
      encouraged
      to
      use
      all
      the
      resources
      we
      can
      that
      are
      provided.
      We
      are
      only
      human
      and
      you
      never
      know
      how
      your
      calls
      are
      going
      to
      effect
      you.
      Luckily
      for
      me
      I
      am
      capable
      of
      leaving
      work
      at
      work
      when
      I
      am
      relieved
      of
      my
      shifts
      but
      doesn't
      mean
      that
      it
      isn't
      stressful
      or
      that
      I
      don't
      have
      times
      of
      mental
      anguish.
      We
      all
      have
      bad
      days.
      On
      my
      breaks
      I
      used
      to
      skip
      lunch
      just
      to
      chain
      smoke,
      now
      that
      I
      am
      smoke
      free
      since
      Thanksgiving
      I
      stay
      inside
      and
      read
      instead
      -
      it
      honestly
      was
      a
      great
      stress
      reliever
      but
      my
      health
      is
      more
      important
      and
      when
      you
      really
      want
      a
      cigarette
      and
      can't
      have
      one
      it
      only
      stresses
      you
      out
      more.
      One
      thing
      I
      find
      to
      be
      helpful
      for
      recovery
      is
      that
      we
      work
      3
      days
      on
      and
      then
      have
      3
      days
      off
      and
      then
      the
      following
      week
      we
      work
      4
      days
      on
      and
      have
      4
      days
      off,
      giving
      me
      a
      lot
      of
      free
      time
      to
      pursuit
      all
      of
      my
      hobbies
      or
      to
      travel
      or
      to
      literally
      just
      do
      nothing
      if
      decide
      to
      do
      so.
      It
      isn't
      uncommon
      to
      find
      morbid
      curiosity
      or
      dark
      humor
      when
      your
      business
      is
      that
      of
      plight
      and
      let
      me
      tell
      you
      business
      is
      good.
      Among
      the
      coworkers
      we
      often
      support
      each
      other
      and
      form
      a
      bond
      unique
      to
      most
      other
      workplaces.
      Thank
      you
      for
      your
      interest
      in
      my
      profession,
      a
      particular
      sector
      that
      is
      often
      forgotten
      about
      or
      with
      little
      acknowledgement,
      we
      are
      the
      first
      people
      you
      come
      in
      contact
      with
      during
      an
      emergency.
      Mind
      you
      that
      I
      am
      trying
      my
      best
      to
      provide
      as
      much
      detail
      and
      information
      on
      my
      sporadic
      downtime
      while
      trying
      to
      make
      sense.
      If
      you
      need
      any
      clarity
      or
      further
      explanation
      or
      if
      you
      feel
      that
      I
      did
      not
      fully
      answer
      your
      questions
      it
      would
      be
      my
      pleasure
      to
      go
      into
      more
      depth
      and
      try
      again!

      Thanks!!
      Yeah
      for
      the
      most
      part
      every
      one
      of
      my
      coworkers
      are
      professional
      and
      great
      at
      what
      they
      do.
      And
      yes,
      I #8217;ve
      been
      subpoenaed
      twice
      for
      court
      but
      never
      have
      gone
      as
      they
      usually
      settle
      before
      the
      court
      date.
      It #8217;s
      actually
      not
      bad
      if
      you
      get
      subpoenaed
      because
      regardless
      you
      get
      paid
      minimum
      of
      4
      hours
      overtime
      and
      most
      often
      you
      are
      only
      there
      for
      30
      minutes
      or
      so.

      I
      was

      But

      I
      was

      sick
      yesterday,
      was
      throwing
      up
      every

      -
      thirty
      minutes
      and
      my
      blood
      sugar
      wasn #8217;t
      that
      high
      honestly
      the
      first
      time
      I
      had
      medics
      come
      up
      but
      all
      my
      symptoms
      were
      not
      letting
      up
      whatsoever
      and
      I
      called
      work
      which
      is
      in
      the
      911
      capacity
      to
      tel
      them
      I
      wasn #8217;t
      going
      to
      be
      in
      today
      and
      because
      of
      liability
      reasons
      they
      called
      an
      ambulance
      for
      me
      haha.
      Also
      have
      to
      ask
      is
      your
      name
      In
      reference
      to
      the

      Yeah
      the
      roof
      of
      my
      mouth
      is
      raw
      and
      the
      back
      of
      my
      tongue.
      The
      meds
      they
      gave
      me
      in
      thr
      ambulance
      seriously
      mitigated
      the
      throwing
      up
      but
      I
      did
      a
      few
      more
      times
      at
      the
      ER
      and
      there
      was
      blood
      in
      it
      or
      something.
      It
      was
      dark
      and
      I
      haven #8217;t
      consumed
      anything
      but
      water
      the
      last
      couple
      days.

      Lol
      thanks
      that
      actually
      made
      me
      laugh.
      But
      I
      have
      a
      tendency
      to
      joke
      around
      about
      this
      stuff
      with
      the
      nurses
      and
      doctors.
      I
      had
      a
      nurse
      who
      was
      pregnant
      and
      made
      a
      joke
      about
      not
      ever
      knowing
      what
      being
      pregnant
      would
      be

      i

      morning
      sickness
      feels

      Oh
      wow
      that
      is
      unfortunate.
      I
      was
      supposed
      to
      order
      airline
      tickets
      to
      Colorado
      to
      visit
      a
      friend
      from
      school
      yesterday
      and
      this
      is
      how
      I
      had
      to
      break
      it
      to
      them
      that
      I #8217;d
      have
      to
      wait
      a
      day
      at
      least.
      Yeah
      I #8217;m
      a
      911
      operator
      for
      my
      county
      and
      I
      see
      this
      stuff
      all
      the
      time

      The

      was
      my
      initial
      diagnosis
      6
      years
      ago
      when
      I
      was
      23.
      I #8217;m
      kind
      of
      surprised
      I

      I #8217;m
      not
      sure
      what
      hypokalemia
      is
      but
      I #8217;m
      always
      interested
      in
      the
      medical
      world
      especially
      with
      my
      own
      condition
      so
      I #8217;ll
      have
      to
      check
      it
      out.
      My
      initial
      diagnosis
      I
      thought
      the
      worst
      was
      not
      being
      able
      to
      breathe.
      Everything
      I
      did
      i
      was
      out
      of
      breath
      and
      felt
      like
      I
      had
      he
      worst
      heartburn
      ever.
      I
      was
      doing
      a
      project
      for
      my
      college
      Spanish

      Because
      my
      hand
      is
      near
      the
      muzzle
      of
      an
      unloaded
      firearm?
      That
      is
      quite
      an
      inaccurate
      statement
      -
      I
      understand
      that
      it
      appears
      that
      I
      am
      ignoring
      safety
      but
      I
      take
      gun
      safety
      very
      seriously.
      But
      I
      would
      be
      quick
      to
      say
      that
      I
      find
      it
      next
      to
      impossible
      that
      a
      unloaded
      -
      decocked
      pistol
      would
      discharge
      whilst
      I
      am
      simply
      using
      it
      my
      hand
      for
      scale
      reference.
      Not
      attacking
      you
      or
      anything
      just
      can
      come
      off
      as
      insulting
      when
      you
      assume
      I
      would
      place
      my
      hand
      near
      the
      muzzle
      of
      a
      loaded
      firearm.
      Anywho
      -
      lets
      just
      admire
      how
      beautiful
      they
      are!

      as

      and
      pattern
      as
      shown
      in
      the
      picture.
      I
      am
      baffled
      and
      I
      hope
      it #8217;s
      a
      interface
      flaw
      on
      the
      website.
      Either
      way,
      I
      find
      like
      one
      SET
      and
      then
      it #8217;s
      literally
      impossible
      to
      find
      another
      one.
      The
      set
      of
      cards
      I
      do
      find
      remain
      on
      the
       #8220;table #8221;
      or
      screen
      rather
      and
      the
      cards
      I
      made
      a
      set
      out
      of
      do
      not
      become
      replaced.
      Anyone
      familiar
      with
      this
      game?
      Am
      I
      missing
      something
      here?
      Does
      this
      make
      sense??

      I
      just
      got
      that
      one
      however
      -
      from
      reading
      the
      instructions
      I
      believe
      those
      cards
      are
      supposed
      to
      be
      replaced
      once
      it #8217;s
      confirmed
      it #8217;s
      a
      set
      but
      they
      remain
      on
      my
      screen.
      So
      after
      finding
      two
      sets
      it
      feels
      impossible
      to
      make
      anymore

      up

      I
      bought

      Thanks!
      I
      was
      looking
      for
      a
      good
      size
      double/single
      to
      carry
      because
      overall
      it #8217;s
      what
      I
      prefer
      and
      my
      buddy
      found
      this
      for
      me
      and
      there
      went
      my
      savings.
      Hell
      of
      a
      deal
      though
      $650
      for
      two
      holsters,
      two
      mags,
      three
      grips,
      one
      shown

      the

      a

      grip
      handle
      and
      a

      I
      absolutely
      love

      Yeah
      I
      knew
      that

      I
      was
      diagnosed
      T1
      at
      age
      23
      I #8217;m
      now
      29
      and
      I
      quit
      drinking
      soda
      a
      couple
      years
      before
      I
      was
      diagnosed.
      I
      was
      boxing
      everyday
      for
      several
      years
      and
      then
      had
      a
      even
      bigger
      lifestyle
      change
      when
      I
      was
      diagnosed.
      Even
      though
      I
      hate
      when
      my
      blood
      sugar
      goes
      low
      I
      do
      love
      Dr.Pepper
      and
      it #8217;s
      incredibly
      rare
      that
      I
      have
      one.

      too
      many
      of

      Hey
      thanks
      for
      the
      post!
      I
      find
      it
      harder
      to
      not
      over
      indulge
      and
      go
      high.
      I
      don #8217;t
      have
      frequent
      lows
      thankfully.
      So
      unfortunately
      now
      that
      I #8217;m
      feeling
      less
      shakey
      I #8217;ll
      probs
      toss
      the
      rest
      of
      it.
      My
      last
      trip
      to
      ICU
      change
      my
      whole
      perspective
      on
      T1
      I
      was
      complaining
      about
      my
      bias
      against
      every
      endo
      I #8217;ve
      met
      and
      I
      was
      speaking
      with
      the
      diabetic
      educators
      who
      all
      were
      diabetic.
      They
      didn #8217;t
      shame
      me
      for
      not
      taking
      care
      of
      myself
      or
      shame
      me
      for
      not
      following
      their
      guidelines.
      They
      made
      me
      feel
      like
      more
      of
      a
      human.
      I #8217;ve
      been
      so
      strict
      yet
      so
      care
      free
      about
      being
      diabetic
      I
      just
      sometimes
      forget
      that
      I
      need
      to
      live
      too.
      So
      I
      do
      deserve
      it

      it #8217;s
      usually
      DP
      but
      I #8217;ve
      found
      somethings
      to
      be
      comparable
      ginger
      ale
      is
      okay
      if
      you #8217;re
      sick
      or
      sprite.
      Diet
      Coke
      is
      actually
      the
      one
      I
      kinda
      like
      too
      haha.
      For
      all
      the
      pop
      I
      used
      to
      drink
      growing
      up
      I #8217;d
      never
      thought
      it
      would
      be
      something
      that
      is
      a
      toxic
      necessity

      Hahahaha
      that
      made
      me
      lol.
      Of
      course
      it
      was
      a
      CrossFit
      too!
      Yeah
      it #8217;s
      sometimes
      entertaining
      and
      sometimes
      frustrating
      trying
      to
      explain
      T1
      to
      people.
      Yes
      I
      can
      have
      sugar,
      yes
      I
      can
      eat
      this,
      yes
      I
      have
      to
      take
      shots.
      No
      there
      aren #8217;t
      things
      I
      can #8217;t
      have
      -
      it #8217;s
      whether
      it #8217;s
      worth
      the
      shot
      or
      not.
      And
      then
      you
      blow
      their
      mind
      when
      you
      tell
      them
      that
       #8220;yes
      sugar
      has
      saved
      my
      life. #8221;

      Sorry

      that,
      I
      hope
      it #8217;s
      not

      to
      ask

      on

      I
      apologize

      sorry

      hear
      about
      being
      advised
      of
      the

      something
      other
      than
      sorry

      meaningful
      and
      could
      provide
      some
      words
      of
      comfort.
      If
      I
      were
      a
      religious
      man
      I
      would
      pray
      for

      and
      if
      I
      were
      a
      spiritual
      man
      I
      would
      expend
      energy
      for
      you
      but
      alas
      I
      am
      nothing
      more

      just
      a

      Uhh
      ok,
      I
      still
      disagree
      I
      have
      a
      lot
      of
      friends
      who
      play
      and
      disagree
      as
      well
      -
      it #8217;s
      the
      3rd
      period
      just
      wait
      it
      out.
      It #8217;s
      super
      frustrating
      and
      annoying
      because
      it
      happens
      even
      when
      they
      aren #8217;t
      getting
      spanked.
      I
      like
      the
      idea
      of
      a
      time
      penalty

      they

      another
      match

      wildlands
      or

      Just
      my
      opinion.

      I #8217;m

      nothing

      I
      think
      they
      are
      a
      fantastic
      brand
      however,
      this
      is
      a

      and
      I

      that

      I

      the

      cheerful

      It
      makes
      you
      wonder

      he
      is
      in

      you
      discover
      he

      murdered
      a

      no

      Met
      a
      girl
      I
      matched
      with
      on
      tinder
      and
      had
      a
      tab
      going
      at
      this
      cool
      bar
      with
      a
      mini
      golf
      course
      and
      a
      Ferris
      wheel.
      the
      tab
      with
      drinks
      and
      food
      you
      name
      it
      on
      my
      card.
      Seemed
      like
      we
      were
      having
      a
      great
      time
      until
      she
      said
      she
      had
      to
      go
      to
      the
      bathroom
      and
      bailed
      and
      stuck
      me
      with
      the
      full
      tab.
      Fast
      forward
      a
      few
      months
       gt; gt; gt; gt;Lo
      and
      behold
      I
      saw
      her
      on
      bumble
      and
      swiped
      for
      shits
      and
      gigs
      and
      her
      ice
      breaker
      was
       #8220;you
      seem
      familiar #8221;.
      In
      hindsight
      I
      wished
      I
      would
      have
      pursued
      it
      again
      and
      best
      her
      at
      own
      game,
      but
      I #8217;m
      a
      honorable
      and
      honest
      man
      so
      I
      let
      it
      be
      and
      learned
      a
      valuable
      life
      lesson;
      if
      you
      get
      married,
      sign
      a
      prenup.

      Thank
      you
      for
      not
      lambasting
      my
      post
      and
      providing
      actual
      insight,
      however
      if
      I
      am
      playing
      with
      people
      other
      than
      friends
      we
      could
      be
      having
      a
      close
      game
      and
      be
      down
      by
      say
      1
      goal
      and
      someone
      from
      my
      team
      will
      quit
      causing
      me
      to
      quit
      which
      is
      also
      frustrating
      because
      we
      still
      have
      a
      chance
      at
      winning.
      I #8217;ve
      lost
      a
      handful
      of
      games
      that
      my
      team
      has
      been
      up
      3-0
      and
      I #8217;ll
      stay
      in
      until
      the
      bitter
      end.
      In
      addition
      I
      can #8217;t
      prove
      that
      anyone
      is
      backing
      out
      negligently
      because
      I
      know
      things
      come
      up
      where
      someone
      may
      have
      to
      suddenly
      go
      offline.
      I #8217;ve
      just
      seem
      to
      notice
      a
      trend.
      And
      I
      agree,
      with
      exploiting
      poor
      programming
      such
      the
      one
      handed
      tuck
      is
      very
      effective
      and
      a
      computer
      goalie
      will
      succumb
      to
      it
      often.
      Maybe
      I #8217;m
      stubborn
      or
      old
      fashioned
      but
      quitting
      at
      that
      point
      almost
      feels
      like
      competing
      for
      participation
      trophies.

      Not
      this
      last
      Easter
      but
      the
      one
      prior
      when
      it
      was
      on
      April
      fools
      day,
      I
      had
      just
      recently
      gone
      through
      a
      difficult
      break
      up
      with
      someone
      I
      admittedly
      still
      love
      today.
      I
      was
      leaving
      for
      work
      and
      noticed
      a
      note
      left
      under
      the
      windshield
      wiper
      of
      my
      Jeep.
      It
      read
       #8220;I #8217;m
      sorry
      and
      I
      love
      you. #8221;
      It
      was
      from
      my
      ex
      and
      that
      really
      kind
      of
      set
      my
      tone
      for
      the
      day.
      Fast
      forward
      maybe
      45
      minutes,
      it
      was
      a
      relatively
      slow
      morning
      for
      working
      in
      the
      metro.
      I
      believe
      it
      was
      the
      second
      call
      I
      took
      that
      morning
      of
      a
      hysterical
      woman
      stating
      her
      boyfriend
      shot
      himself
      in
      the
      head,
      it
      was
      difficult
      to
      get
      information
      from
      her
      as
      you
      could
      imagine
      but
      what
      made
      it
      difficult
      was
      that
      I
      could
      hear
      him
      making
      sounds
      that
      did
      not
      sound
      human,
      gagging,
      gasping
      for
      air,
      difficulty
      breathing
      and
      retching.
      I
      remember
      thinking
      how
      this
      woman
      just
      lost
      someone
      she
      loved,
      she
      had
      witness
      him
      take
      his
      life.
      I
      also
      remember
      thinking
      how
      I
      never
      want
      to
      lose
      someone
      that
      I
      love
      again
      -
      not
      that
      my
      break
      up
      even
      holds
      a
      light
      to
      what
      she
      went
      through.
      Anyways,
      he
      still
      had
      a
      pulse
      by
      the
      time
      the
      officers
      arrived
      and
      by
      the
      time
      he
      reached
      the
      hospital.
      I
      don #8217;t
      know
      if
      he
      lived
      or
      not,
      I #8217;d
      imagine
      he
      succumbed
      to
      his
      injuries.

      I
      suppose
      you #8217;re
      wondering
      why
      I
      posted
      this
      in
      r/diabetes,
      well
      I #8217;ve
      boxed
      for
      several
      years
      and
      did
      BJJ
      for
      several
      months.
      My
      boxing
      gym
      is
      no
      longer
      and
      I
      really
      enjoyed
      BJJ,
      however
      I
      just
      started
      using
      the
      Freestyle
      Libre
      CGM
      and
      due
      to
      the
      nature
      of
      the
      sport
      there
      is
      a
      lot
      of
      grabbing
      and
      pulling.
      Does
      anyone
      out
      there
      with
      a
      CGM
      participate
      in
      anything
      like
      BJJ
      or
      judo?
      Do
      you
      have
      any
      tips
      for
      keeping
      your
      monitor
      intact
      without
      fear
      of
      it
      being
      ripped
      out?
      Any
      advice
      is
      appreciated!!

      Sidenote:
      I
      like
      live
      entertainment,
      brewery,
      social
      events,

      fishing
      or
      something

      be
      able
      to
      afford
      a
      guide
      or
      charter.
      Would
      love
      to
      go
      snowboarding
      but
      it
      would
      be
      just
      me
      going
      and
      wont
      be
      able
      to
      bring

      probably
      even
      find

      it.

      Thanks
      man!
      Yeah
      the
      tegaderm
      is
      more
      than
      meets
      the
      eye,
      but
      not
      sure
      if
      it
      would
      quite
      hold
      up
      to
      some
      rolling
      without
      extra
      support.
      It #8217;s
      hard
      to
      imagine
      placement
      that #8217;s
      considerably
      less
      vulnerable
      or
      exposed.
      I
      also
      have
      very
      little
      body
      fat
      making
      placement
      even
      on
      the
      arm
      tricky
      sometimes.
      I
      love
      BJJ
      but
      was
      thinking
      maybe
      judo
      may
      be
      a
      more
      practical
      alternative
      and
      easier
      to
      avoid
      those
      complications.
      But
      thanks
      for
      the
      post
      I
      appreciate
      it!

      Honestly
      not.
      Not
      for
      me
      anyways.
      I
      lost
      the
      one
      I
      love
      and
      it
      has
      made
      dating
      difficult.
      Or
      it #8217;s
      made
      me
      difficult
      to
      date.
      It #8217;s
      been
      about
      a
      year
      and
      sure
      some
      days
      are
      better
      than
      others
      but
      I
      honesty
      have
      a
      hard
      time
      expressing
      the
      same
      compassion
      as
      before
      when
      I #8217;m
      in
      a
      relationship
      now.
      I
      still
      do
      all
      the

      I
      would

      I
      was

       #8220;her #8221;
      I #8217;m
      just
      not
      as
      excited
      or
      motivated
      anymore.
      You
      know
      when
      they
      refer
      to
      love
      as
      a
       #8220;spark #8221;?
      Well
      it
      feels
      like
      I
      had
      a
      spark
      that
      grew
      into
      a
      flame
      and
      that
      flame
      was
      snuffed.

      I
      had
      similar
      feelings
      even
      though
      I
      consider
      myself
      a
      gun
      enthusiast.
      However,
      I
      will
      say
      that
      my
      opinion
      has
      changed
      in
      the
      last
      couple
      years
      since
      I #8217;ve
      been
      a
      911
      dispatcher
      and
      living
      in
      the
      metro.
      If
      you
      asked
      me
      if
      I
      was
      afraid
      to
      leave
      the
      house
      without
      it,
      I #8217;d
      say
      no.
      But
      anyone
      who
      carries
      would
      probably
      agree
      that
      they #8217;d
      rather
      have
      it
      with
      them
      and
      not
      need
      it
      than
      to
      need
      it
      and
      not
      have
      it.
      Sometimes
      I #8217;m
      nervous
      to
      leave
      with
      it
      because
      in
      my
      state
      you
      can
      conceal
      or
      open
      carry
      a
      pistol
      and
      people
      will
      call
      911
      all
      the
      time
      (I
      know
      from
      work
      experience)
      about
      someone
      they
      saw
      who
      has
      a
      pistol
      in
      public
      and
      not
      displaying
      any
      aggressive
      or
      disorderly
      behavior
      and
      we
      send
      police
      anyways
      and
      I
      haven #8217;t
      come
      across
      one
      of
      those
      calls
      where
      the
      person
      didn #8217;t
      have
      a
      valid
      permit
      to
      carry.
      Typically
      these
      calls
      are
      at
      grocery
      stores
      and
      such
      or
      people
      just
      doing
      their
      every
      day
      tasks.
      On
      the
      other
      side
      of
      the
      coin
      though
      we
      receive
      calls
      all
      the
      time
      about
      someone
      being
      robbed
      or
      weapon
      brandished
      at
      them
      and
      those
      people
      never
      have
      a
      permit
      to
      carry
      and
      usually
      have
      a
      stolen
      firearm.
      Hope
      this
      provided
      some
      insight
      to
      the
      question!

      Knife
      enthusiast
      of
      reddit,
      I
      am
      looking
      to
      add
      to
      my
      knife
      edc.
      Right
      now
      I
      carry
      a
      benchmade
      pardue
      presidio
      with
      a
      modified
      blade.
      I
      am
      thinking
      about
      getting
      the
      Gerber
      Flatiron
      cleaver
      or
      something
      comparable
      or
      something
      OTF.
      I
      really
      like
      microtech
      and
      heretic
      manticore
      but
      there
      are
      no
      dealers
      nearby
      and
      honestly
      it #8217;s
      hard
      for
      me
      to
      justify
      the
      price
      too.
      Any
      suggestions?

      $100
      max
      for
      right
      now.
      I
      suppose
      the
      dealer
      doesnt
      have
      to
      be
      local
      -
      I
      would
      just
      like
      to
      go
      in
      and
      hold
      one
      before
      purchase.
      I
      suppose
      other
      dealers
      might
      ship.
      I
      saw
      a
      brand
      MTN
      forgery
      or
      something
      on
      amazon
      that
      looked
      like
      they
      made
      a
      pretty
      solid
      OTF.

      I
      had
      a
      Gerber
      Para
      from
      probably
      around
      2009-2012
      or
      so
      before
      the
      frame
      broke.
      I
      felt
      like
      I
      got
      really
      lucky
      with
      that
      specific
      gerber
      knife
      though.

      I
      worked
      in
      plumbing
      and
      plumbing
      wholesale
      so
      I
      was
      opening
      up
      a
      lot
      of
      stuff,
      cutting
      down
      boxes,
      prying
      things.
      But
      it
      was
      so
      long
      ago
      that
      I
      don't
      remember
      what
      I
      did
      before
      it
      broke.
      That
      was
      my
      segue
      into
      higher
      end
      knives
      and
      eventually
      bought
      a
      benchmade
      shortly
      after
      and
      I
      have
      had
      it
      ever
      since
      2013
      or
      so.

      I
      am
      29
      going
      on
      30
      and
      I
      had
      my
      first
      paying
      job
      at
      12
      years
      old
      working
      with
      honeybees.
      If
      I
      wasn #8217;t
      doing
      that
      I
      was
      mowing
      lawns.
      I
      promptly
      said
      fuck
      working
      with
      bees
      and
      started
      working
      at
      the
      local
      cafe
      up
      until
      I
      was
      16
      years
      old.
      I
      started
      as
      a
      dishwasher
      then
      promoted
      to
      waiter,
      then
      to
      cook.
      After
      that
      I
      worked
      at
      a
      call
      center,
      a
      grocery
      store
      and
      a
      group
      home
      until
      I
      was
      18.
      All
      those
      years
      working
      and
      I
      was
      never
      able
      to
      save.
      I
      grew
      up
      poor
      and
      spent
      my
      money
      on
      frivolous
      things.
      So
      work
      bard
      and
      save.
      Cut
      back
      on
      things
      you
      don #8217;t
      need.

      I
      definitely
      thought
      about
      it.
      Why
      I
      chose
      mick
      is
      because
      he
      keeps
      popping
      out
      kids
      and
      does
      an
      insane
      workout
      regiment
      given
      his
      age
      and
      history
      haha.
      But

      Stupid

      I #8217;m

      waiting

      before
      puck
      drop?
      Playing
      on
      PS4.
      It #8217;s
      bothering
      me
      that
      I
      can #8217;t
      figure

      No
      it
      was
      just
      a
      very
      surreal
      moment
      I
      think
      for
      him.
      The
      original
      scene
      is
      him
      running
      like
      20
      football
      fields
      to
      stumble
      across
      like
      a
      whole
      other
      company
      of
      German
      soldiers
      sleeping
      with
      his
      soldiers
      trailing
      like
      20
      seconds
      behind
      and
      that
      kid
      was
      the
      first
      person
      he
      killed
      that
      day
      and
      while
      on
      the
      train
      he
      had
      flashbacks
      because
      a
      boy
      on
      the
      train
      looked
      very
      similar
      and
      made
      him
      realize
      probably
      the
      age
      of
      the
      boy
      he
      killed.

      That #8217;s
      super
      cool.
      I
      wrote
      Ipecac
      an
      email
      as
      I
      mentioned
      and
      expressed
      how
      his
      music
      has
      literally
      saved
      my
      life.
      I
      was
      diagnosed
      very
      late
      in
      my
      life
      with
      type
      1
      diabetes
      at
      the
      age
      of
      23
      and
      I #8217;ll
      be
      30
      in
      October.
      Not
      to
      get
      all
      scientific
      but
      I
      was
      very
      active
      and
      healthy
      with
      lifestyle
      and
      now
      I
      have
      an
      irreversible
      disease
      that
      has
      inevitably
      caused
      some
      depression
      and
      other
      hardships
      and
      when
      I
      was
      in
      the
      hospital
      mr
      bungle
      really
      helped
      me
      get
      through
      it.
      I
      was
      very
      matter
      of
      fact
      and
      made
      my
      slight
      embarrassment
      known
      and
      that
      they
      possibly
      don #8217;t
      even
      have
      direct
      contact
      with
      Mr.Patton.
      Well,
      not
      even
      an
      hour
      goes
      by
      comforting
      all
      my
      worries
      of
      fan
      boy
      embarrassment
      and
      that
      they
      indeed
      do
      directly
      have
      contact
      with
      him
      and
      that
      they
      would
      relay
      the
      message
      to
      him.
      That
      was
      a
      couple
      months
      ago,
      I
      still
      haven #8217;t
      heard
      from
      him
      but
      I
      love
      that
      label
      even
      more
      for
      taking
      their
      time
      on
      a
      a
      Sunday
      none
      the
      less
      to
      respond
      with
      a
      genuine
      and
      wholesome
      message.

      Everyone
      on
      here
      has
      been
      great
      and
      friendly.
      As
      much
      as
      I
      would
      love
      a
      free
      knife
      to
      cheer
      me
      up
      about
      my
      current
      financial
      and
      health
      situation
      but
      it
      would
      be
      a
      waste
      on
      me
      as
      I
      would
      not
      be
      able
      to
      give
      away
      a
      knife
      for
      sometime.
      But
      you
      guys
      are
      awesome,
      I
      love
      how
      passionate
      this
      knife
      community
      is
      on
      here,
      have
      a
      great
      weekend

      and

      Unfortunately
      he
      succumbed
      due
      to
      diabetic
      complications
      when
      I
      was
      around
      10-11
      years
      old
      if
      I
      remember
      correctly.
      So
      he
      passed
      about
      20
      years
      ago,
      he
      was
      always
      happy
      and
      I
      remember
      always
      being
      excited
      to
      see
      him.
      When
      he
      passed
      I
      didn #8217;t
      really
      comprehended
      but
      through
      stories,
      documents
      and
      my
      grandma
      I
      get
      to
      revisit
      a
      lot
      of
      old
      memories.
      It #8217;s
      so
      strange
      too
      that
      I
      have
      a
      lot
      of
      parallels,
      I
      was
      diagnosed
      as
      a
      type
      1
      diabetic
      when
      I
      was
      23
      years
      old,
      I
      boxed
      for
      seven
      years,
      and
      I
      have
      been
      pursuing
      law
      enforcement
      -
      all
      which
      he
      did.

      Yeah
      we
      had
      most
      sports
      except
      high
      school
      Hockey
      (which
      is
      blasphemy
      for
      living
      in
      MN)
      or
      tennis
      or
      dance.
      I
      got
      to
      play
      high
      school
      football
      and
      basketball.
      We
      tried
      for
      a
      couple
      years
      to
      get
      boxing
      as
      a
      extracurricular
      activity
      but
      no
      go.

      But
      can
      you

      MN
      and

      you #8217;d
      need
      a

      more
      than
      likely
      to
      go
      get
      the

      due

      Who
      knows
      what
      the
      exact
      numbers
      are
      for
      partial
      and
      full
      because
      I #8217;ve
      only
      been
      to
      the
      hospital
      for
      it
      once.
      After
      I
      learned
      how
      to
      set
      the
      shoulder
      back
      into
      place
      I
      never
      went
      back
      in
      to
      the
      ER.
      the
      X-ray
      and
      Scans
      of
      my
      shoulder
      show
      that
      a
      good
      majority
      of
      the
      bone
      has
      broken
      away.
      A
      few
      months
      ago
      before
      I
      finally
      had
      said
      enough
      is
      enough,
      I
      reached
      to
      the
      end
      table
      by
      my
      couch
      for
      a
      can
      of
      water
      and
      my
      shoulder
      came
      out.
      Before
      that
      it
      was
      closing
      my
      car
      door.
      The
      very
      first
      time
      I
      dislocated
      my
      shoulder
      it
      was
      out
      of
      socket
      for
      over
      4
      hours
      before
      I
      could
      get
      to
      the
      hospital,
      get
      it
      xrayed
      and
      for
      a
      doctor
      to
      get
      it
      into
      place.
      It
      sucks
      and
      I #8217;m
      nervous
      I #8217;ve
      never
      had
      surgery
      before.

      That #8217;s
      comforting
      then
      haha!
      How
      long
      has
      it
      been?
      Sorry
      if
      you
      explain
      this
      in
      the
      video,
      I
      work
      as
      a
      911
      operator
      and
      hard
      to
      watch
      videos
      here
      so
      I
      saved
      it
      so
      I
      can
      watch
      it
      later.
      I #8217;m
      so
      nervous
      and
      incredibly
      paranoid
      it #8217;s
      going
      to
      make
      things
      worse
      for
      me
      -totally
      irrational.

      Damn
      you
      got
      right
      on
      that.
      I
      dislocated
      mine
      when
      I
      was
      17
      the
      first
      time
      and
      I #8217;ll
      be
      turning
      30
      this
      October
       #128533;
      but
      in
      the
      last
      decade
      I
      spent
      seven
      years
      boxing
       #129354;
      and
      a
      summer
      of
      Brazilian
      jiu
      jitsu
      where
      I #8217;ve
      injured
      that
      shoulder
      multiple
      times
      in
      both.
      I
      really
      regret
      not
      taking
      the
      route
      as
      soon
      as
      you
      did.
      I #8217;ll
      watch
      the
      video
      on
      my
      break
      and
      I #8217;ll
      make
      sure
      to
      follow
      you
      so
      I
      don #8217;t
      miss
      any
      updates.
      This
      has
      seriously
      been
      keeping
      me
      awake
      at
      night,
      I #8217;m
      being
      very
      literal
      about
      that
      too
      haha.

      Oh
      that #8217;s
      all
      you
      have
      to

      I #8217;ve

      reading
      the
      necronomicon,
      summoning
      Satan
      in
      Latin,
      dead
      chicken
      dances
      over
      the
      popes
      tomb,
      switching
      which
      side
      the
      roll
      of
      toilet
      paper
      is
      facing,
      carving
      slayer
      into
      my
      forearms
      and
      cursing
      the
      Lords
      name
      for
      years
      and
      I
      ain #8217;t
      received
      an
      Emmy
      or
      a
      Grammy

      I
      applied
      at
      a
      paper
      mill
      once
      and
      in

      I
      got
      a
      tour
      of
      the
      place
      it
      could
      be
      just
      giant
      rolls
      of
      regular
      paper.
      But
      they #8217;re
      throwing
      it
      around
      fairly
      easy
      so
      I
      doubt
      it.
      Could
      be

      wrap

      else
      had

      tracker
      front
      strap
      Contents
      inside
      vary.
      This
      day
      was
      tackle
      and
      sunflower
      seeds.
      Pros:
      compact,
      sturdy,
      waist
      and
      chest
      strap
      for
      support,
      adequate
      number
      and
      appropriately
      proportioned
      pockets
      and
      storage,
      sounds
      silly
      but
      honestly
      the
      zippers
      work
      immaculately.
      Cons:
      I
      know
      I
      listed
      compact
      as
      a
      pro
      but
      could
      be
      just
      a
      touch
      bigger.
      The
      molle
      pouche
      on
      the
      front
      has
      a
      little
      play
      to
      it.
      And
      The
      bottle
      pouch
      doesn #8217;t
      quite
      fit
      down
      the
      side
      straps
      -
      I
      had
      to
      purchase
      snap
      on
      button
      extenders
      and
      those
      occasionally
      come
      undone.
      I #8217;m
      not
      sure
      if
      it #8217;s
      the
      backpacks
      dimensions
      or
      the
      pouch #8217;s
      dimensions.
      This
      bag
      is
      part
      of
      my
      EDC
      for
      work
      and
      daily
      life.
      I #8217;m
      type
      one
      diabetic
      and
      keep
      my
      supplies
      in
      there,
      work
      notes
      (911
      operator)
      and
      maybe
      overnight
      items.
      Thanks
      for
      checking
      out

      Of
      course
      friend!
      They
      have
      some
      pretty
      funny
      ones
      and
      some
      obscure
      pop
      references
      too.
      That #8217;s
      where
      I
      got
      my
      diabeetus
      patch.
      I
      highly
      recommend
      checking
      out
      the
      silence
      of
      the
      lambs
      buffalo
      bill
      wiener
      tuck
      dance
      a

      I
      rock
      the
      hook
      and
      loop
      aka
      Velcro
      so
      they
      are
      easily
      interchangeable!
      The
      only
      one
      I
      had
      to
      modify
      was
      my
      primus
      one,
      I
      had
      to
      iron
      on
      Velcro
      to
      the
      back
      of

      No

      Totally
      serious
      I
      have
      the
      same
      bag
      and
      I
      love
      it.
      Should
      be
      a
      good
      size
      for
      high
      school
      text
      books
      and
      other
      things.
      Has
      adequate
      pockets
      and
      access,
      sturdy
      as
      Hell
      I #8217;ve
      had
      mine
      for
      over
      a
      year
      and
      it #8217;s
      held
      up,
      I
      literally
      carry
      it
      every
      day,
      it
      has
      molle
      webbing
      so
      you
      can
      add
      additional
      pouches
      and
      accessories.
      I
      think
      they
      look
      badass
      and
      a
      they
      are
      a
      decent
      price
      for
      this
      style
      bag.
      I
      have
      owned
      brands
      such
      as
      red
      rock
      backpacks
      similar
      style
      and
      price
      but
      cheaply
      made
      and
      didn #8217;t
      care
      for
      it.
      I #8217;ve
      also
      owned
      SOG
      tactical
      backpacks
      which
      in
      my
      opinion
      worth
      checking
      out.
      Let
      me
      know
      what
      you
      think!

      Definitely
      need
      a
      fishing
      trip.
      There
      are
      a
      few
      spots
      in
      MN
      that
      stock
      trout.
      I
      went
      ice
      fishing
      on
      lake
      holland
      in
      Eagan
      mn
      and
      the
      8-10 #8221;
      trout
      I
      caught
      was
      so
      much
      fun.
      They
      can
      be
      surprisingly
      strong
      for
      how
      little
      they
      can
      be
      -
      also
      knowing
      how
      big
      those
      suckers
      can
      get.
      Their
      mouths
      honestly
      remind
      me
      of
      the
      movie
      tremors
      except
      in
      water.

      Thank
      you
      for
      the
      info
      sir,
      I
      am
      now
      reevaluating
      my
      decision.
      I #8217;m
      not
      too
      concerned
      about
      the
      legal
      aspect
      of
      things
      haha
      as
      a
      911
      operator
      I
      know
      how
      to
      steer
      away
      from
      stupid
      situations
      but
      as
      far
      as
      durability
      and
      maintenance
      you
      put
      a
      lot
      of
      my
      curiosity
      to
      rest!

      Mainly
      light
      weight
      carry
      or
      something
      I
      obviously
      can
      bring
      places
      that
      you #8217;re
       #8220;not
      allowed #8221;
      to.
      I
      hardly
      ever
      go
      a
      day
      without
      carrying
      but
      I
      like
      to
      go
      to
      a
      lot
      of
      events
      that
      prohibit
      blades.
      I
      hate
      that
      I
      have
      to
      even
      say
      so
      but
      only
      intentions
      of
      carrying
      as
      a

      ...thanks
      for
      a
      comment
      that #8217;s
      as
      useless
      as
      a
      poopie
      flavored
      lollipop.
      Unless
      you #8217;re
      into
      that
      sort
      of
      thing.
      Also,
      what
      evidence
      provided
      gave
      you
      the
      assumption
      that
      I
      don #8217;t
      own
      any
      real
      knives?

      Hey
      man,
      just
      because
      you
      have
      your
      head
      shoved
      up
      your
      ass
      doesn #8217;t
      mean
      it #8217;s
      not
      light
      out.
      Hate
      to
      break
      it
      to
      you
      though,
      I
      guess
      I
      have
      to
      go
      on
      record
      and
      say
      that
      ummmmm
      I
      own
       #8220;real #8221;
      knives.
      Good
      day
      sir.

      Awesome
      thank
      you
      for
      the
      input,
      rather
      than
      being
      completely
      useless
      and
      giving
      a
      condescending
      response
      based
      on
      a
      assumption
      with
      zero
      validity.
      But
      this
      is
      exactly
      what
      I
      would
      keep
      one
      for.

      Hell
      yeah!
      I
      haven #8217;t
      had
      any
      luck
      this
      year
      but
      it #8217;s
      hard
      to
      get
      past
      the
      weeds
      at
      the
      spots
      I
      go
      to
      around
      St
      Paul.
      This
      last
      fall
      I
      caught
      my
      record
      northern
      on
      the
      Missouri
      River
      in
      South
      Dakota
      while
      on
      a
      hunting
      trip,
      43 #8221;
      20lb
      Will
      post
      later!
      Congratulations!

      Hey
      thank
      you
      so
      much
      for
      taking
      the
      time
      to
      respond
      with
      some
      depth
      and
      insight!
      Definitely
      something
      I
      didn #8217;t
      think
      about,
      one
      reason
      I
      love
      my
      benchmade
      is
      because
      it
      has
      a
      nice
      dense
      feeling
      weight
      to
      it.
      It #8217;s
      not
      something
      I
      plan
      on
      using
      to
      replace
      my
      EDC
      knives
      but
      something
      that
      would
      make
      a
      nice
      addition
      to
      my
      collection
      of
       #8220;not
      real
      knives #8221;.

      Never
      meant
      that
      my
      intentions
      were
      to
      get
      a
      pass
      or
      freely
      break
      the
      law.
      I #8217;m
      a
      person
      who
      values
      personal
      responsibility
      and
      owns
      up
      to
      my
      fuck
      ups.
      When
      I
      get
      pulled
      over
      I
      don #8217;t
      pull
      the
      public
      service
      card
      or
      the
      fact
      that
      I
      am
      a
      part
      of
      the
      police
      reserves.
      Not
      my
      style,
      what
      I
      do
      outside
      of
      work
      out
      of
      my
      uniform
      does
      not
      necessarily
      reflect
      my
      personal
      life.
      I
      understand
      where
      you #8217;re
      coming
      from.
      I #8217;m
      sorry
      you
      perceived
      my
      comment
      as
      such.
      And
      what #8217;s
      with
      the
      quotation?
      I
      can #8217;t
      tell
      if
      you #8217;re
      being
      condescending
      or
      questioning
      my
      validity
      as
      a
       #8220;public
      safety
      personnel #8221;
      ...see
      what
      I
      mean?
      In
      addition,
      as
      I
      had
      mentioned
      in
      previous
      comments
      that
      as
      a
      knife
      enthusiast
      it #8217;s
      something
      I #8217;m
      willing
      to
      add
      towards
      my
      collection,
      and
      as
      you
      probably
      can
      relate
      that
      you
      want
      to
      take
      the
      appropriate
      measure
      before
      committing
      to
      a
      new
      addition.
      Hope
      that
      helps
      to
      clarify
      my
      position
      on
      the
      matter.

      lake
      Elmo
      supposedly
      stocks

      as

      I
      think
      a
      lake
      in
      coon
      rapids
      does
      as

      which
      lake.

      Nice!
      I
      caught
      my
      only
      dogfish
      on
      lake
      pickerel
      by
      the
      lily
      dale
      pool
      and
      yacht
      club,
      scared
      the
      hell
      out
      of
      me
      when
      I
      pulled
      it
      out.
      It
      took
      my
      white
      spinner
      bait
      and
      pretty
      much
      bent
      the
      hook.
      I #8217;ve
      only
      fished
      Elmo
      once
      a
      couple
      weeks
      ago
      but
      surprised
      at
      how
      clear
      the
      water
      was
      this
      time
      of
      year.

      Yeah
      when
      I
      pulled
      the
      one
      out
      of
      pickerel
      I
      had
      to
      search
      online
      what
      it
      was.
      After
      finding
      out
      I
      was
      surprised
      that
      it
      went
      after
      casting
      bait.
      I #8217;ve
      only
      tried
      the
      dock
      at
      Elmo,
      my
      buddy
      and
      I
      were
      talking
      about
      bringing
      kayaks
      out
      there.
      Went
      fishing
      on
      a
      canoe
      on
      phalen
      a
      couple
      weeks
      ago,
      it
      was
      hot
      and
      windy
      so
      it
      was
      hard
      to
      just
      get
      to
      one
      spot
      -
      had
      a
      decent
      bass
      breach
      the
      water
      to
      go
      for
      my
      top
      water
      but
      I
      just
      missed
      him.
      It #8217;s
      been
      a
      rough
      year
      :(
      I
      know
      I #8217;ve
      said
      it
      a
      few
      times
      already
      but
      once
      I #8217;m
      done
      with
      this
      plumbing
      project
      today
      I #8217;ll
      post
      my
      SD
      northern

      Yeah
      phalen
      has
      some
      decent
      fish,
      I
      haven #8217;t
      had
      much
      luck
      there
      as
      of
      recently
      but
      over
      by
      the
      lake
      phalen
      old
      folks
      home
      the
      lake
      like
      drops
      off
      to
      about
      90
      ft
      deep
      or
      so.
      My
      buddy
      and
      I
      usually
      pull
      a
      pike
      or
      bass
      out
      of
      there.
      This
      time
      of
      year
      though
      it #8217;s
      suuuuuuper
      weedy
      so
      it #8217;s
      hard
      to
      cast
      out

      them.
      Rentals
      there
      are
      pretty
      reasonable
      though,
      downside
      is
      concessions

      Hey
      man,
      those
      people
      are
      probably
      jealous
      because
      you #8217;ve
      found
      ways
      to
      happiness
      despite
      your
      limitations
      or
      physical
      capabilities
      and
      they #8217;re
      just
      miserable
      because
      they
      can #8217;t
      find
      a
      good
      enough
      excuse
      for
      not
      finding
      happiness.
      This
      post
      has
      really
      inspired
      me
      man,
      you
      rock!
      Keep
      it
      up
      brother
      and
      keep
      kicking
      the
      ass
      of
      adversity!

      Of
      course
      my
      man.
      The
      world
      can
      be
      a
      cold
      and
      dark
      place
      sometimes
      so
      make
      it
      better
      by
      being
      the
      best
      version
      of
      you.
      You
      seem
      to
      be
      ahead
      of
      the
      game
      already

      I
      went
      out
      to
      Pollock
      SD
      on
      a
      pheasant
      hunting
      trip
      and
      on
      my
      birthday
      the
      birds
      were
      getting
      up
      too
      far
      ahead
      and
      it
      was
      windy
      so
      I
      tried
      my
      luck
      fishing.
      Bought
      my
      day
      permit
      and
      a
      six
      pack
      and
      on
      my
      second
      cast
      it
      followed
      my
      green
      spinner
      bait
      right
      up
      to
      the
      shore
      line
      and
      did
      the
      classic
      bite
      and
      side
      turn
      and
      I
      landed
      him
      with
      no
      leader
      -
      I
      was
      in
      shock
      and
      super
      stoked.
      I
      tried
      another
      spot
      where
      the
      locals
      were
      fishing
      and
      I
      got
      a
      couple
      more
      pikes
      in
      the
      34-38 #8221;
      range
      and
      caught
      a
      nice
      fat
      walleye
      on
      a
      red
      and
      white
      spoon.
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      the
      locals
      will
      let
      me
      fish
      there
      again.
      Next
      time
      I #8217;ll
      be
      trying
      for
      salmon
      on
      the
      Missouri
      River.

      Yes
      if
      you
      clean
      them
      right,
      they
      have
      a
      lot
      of
      little
      bones.
      I
      pickled
      some
      of
      it.
      During
      the
      brining
      and
      pickling
      process
      the
      bones
      actually
      dissolve.
      I
      came
      up
      with
      my
      own
      picking
      recipe
      based
      on
      a
      bunch
      I
      had
      researched
      and
      mainly
      gave
      them
      out
      as
      gifts
      to
      people
      who
      enjoy
      it
      as
      a
      treat.
      They #8217;re
      excellent
      on
      club
      crackers!

      Damn
      brother.
      I
      was
      supposed
      to
      have
      a
      laterjet
      surgery
      on
      my
      shoulder.
      Which
      would
      require
      a
      bone
      graft
      into
      my
      shoulder.
      It
      hasn #8217;t
      happened
      yet
      but
      I
      was
      shitting
      my
      pants
      even
      for
      that.
      Can #8217;t
      imagine
      your
      thoughts
      going
      into
      this.

      mess
      around
      and
      see
      if
      I
      can
      find
      a
      way
      to
      supply
      ink
      to
      the
      cartridge
      that #8217;s
      in
      there
      or
      modify
      one
      or
      just
      get
      lucky!

      I #8217;ve
      honestly
      been
      looking
      for
      good
      videos.
      I #8217;m
      amazed
      at
      how
      very
      little
      of
      them
      have
      any
      dialogue
      or
      explain
      why
      you
      may
      be
      failing
      the
      mission.
      It
      would
      be
      nice
      for
      following
      along
      especially
      when
      watching
      videos
      the
      text
      is
      incredibly
      difficult
      to
      read
      and
      often
      one
      of
      few
      clues
      to
      know
      if
      you #8217;re
      on
      track.

      I

      T1
      6
      years
      ago
      -
      no
      prediabetes.
      Yesterday
      I
      was
      out
      fishing
      and
      it
      was
      really
      hot
      and
      sunny
      out
      on
      the
      lake.
      I
      noticed
      even
      after
      taking
      my
      Lantus
      my
      bg
      wouldn #8217;t
      go
      down.
      Well,
      eventually
      it
      did
      and
      then
      I
      got
      sunburnt.
      So
      I #8217;m
      dealing
      with
      sun
      burn

      I

      I #8217;m

      it
      uncontrollable
      like
      that
      in
      the
      heat
      before.
      But
      I
      guess
      it #8217;s
      oddly
      comforting
      I

      Friday
      so
      I #8217;m
      sure
      I #8217;ll
      be
      ready
      for
      some
      space
      exploration
      later
      tonight
      :)

      Haha
      I
      was
      discussing
      this
      with
      a
      friend
      last
      night
      to
      which
      we
      are
      no
      stranger
      to
      horizontal
      rains
      -
      but
      neither
      of
      us
      have
      seen
      horizontal
      hail.
      Especially
      with
      enough
      force
      to
      blow
      sideways
      and
      do
      that
      kind
      of
      damage.
      Now
      here
      me
      out
      this
      is
      just
      my
      theory.
      Paintball
      gun
      with
      marbles
      and
      the
      two
      VERY
      large
      dents
      up
      near
      the
      rear
      windshield
      possibly
      could
      have
      been
      two
      stomps
      it
      hits
      with
      a
      baseball
      bat.
      Or
      horizontal
      hail.
      But
      to
      me
      definitely
      looks
      like
      vandalism

      I
      definitely
      thought
      that
      as
      a
      possibility
      based
      on
      the
      consistent
      size
      of
      the
      majority
      of
      dents!

      Agreed!
      I
      can #8217;t
      say
      I #8217;ve
      ever
      been
      on

      for
      this

      damage
      but
      even
      my
      server
      noticed
      I
      was
      snapping
      this
      pic
      and
      she
      was
      like
       #8220;what

      do
      you
      think
      happened

      Maybe
      the
      car
      is
      just
      trying

      build

      immunity

      dings
      and

      hack
      -
      I
      grew
      up
      in
      rural
      MN
      if
      you
      go

      ranch
      or

      feed
      the
      livestock
      hemp
      that
      has
      seeds
      they
      will
      shit
      it
      out
      in
      the
      pasture
      and
      will
      literally
      be
      a
      forest
      in
      a
      season
      or
      two.
      There #8217;s

      much
      not
      a

      lot
      you

      they
      stems
      grow

      Negative,
      one
      little
      seeding
      plant
      can
      populate
      ACRES.
      Which
      totally
      makes
      sense.
      Cows
      eat
      the

      seeds,
      crap
      it
      out
      in
      its
      own
      fertilizer,
      and
      sits
      in
      a
      sunny
      pasture.
      You
      would
      think
      they
      be
      effected
      by
      acids
      and
      enzymes
      but
      keep
      in
      mind
      they
      plants
      produced
      are
       #8220;hemp #8221;
      and
      hold
      very
      little
      THC
      content
      -
      the
      chemical
      in
      marijuana
      that
      gets
      you
      high.
      But
      if
      you #8217;re
      like
      chaoschode6969
      you #8217;d
      be

      However,
      making
      butter
      or
      oil
      out
      of
      it
      would
      likely
      achieve
      better
      results.
      When
      you
      ingest
      via
      eating
      -
      the
      chemical
      is
      broken
      down
      by
      the
      liver
      in
      the
      body
      and
      changes
      the
      psychoactive
      chemical
      of
      THC
      into
      a
      psychoactive
      chemical
      4-5
      times
      more
      potent
      than
      smoking
      known
      as
      11-hydroxy
      THC
      metabolite.
      That #8217;s
      why
      people
      who
      eat
      edibles
      tend
      to
      freak
      out
      because
      of
      its
      stronger
      chemical
      compounds
      coupled
      with
      a
      delayed
      onset
      of
      the
       #8220;high #8221;
      and
      will
      either
      double
      down
      and
      eat
      more
      edibles
      and
      or
      smoke
      and
      before
      you
      know
      it
      the
      walls
      are
      breathing
      and
      you #8217;re

      That #8217;s

      the

      that
      I

      some

      Super
      cool.
      When
      I
      was
      a
      child
      I
      went
      fishing
      on
      lake
      winnibigoshish
      we
      were
      out
      in
      the
      boat
      and
      my
      cousin
      had
      a
      fish
      on
      the
      line
      but
      the
      line
      broke.
      The
      next
      day
      my
      cousin
      pulled
      in
      a
      northern
      with
      the
      same
      jig,
      soft
      bait
      and
      leader
      still
      in
      the
      lip
      of
      the
      fish.
      We
      were
      certain
      it
      was
      the
      one
      from
      the
      day
      before
      however
      there
      is
      no
      way
      to
      confirm
      it.

      I #8217;ve
      noticed
      that
      there
      is
      a
      difference
      with
      the
      friction
      between
      the
      cards.
      For
      example
      my
      high
      Victorian
      sets
      from
      T11
      seem
      more
      slippery
      when
      doing
      certain
      cardistry
      maneuvers
      and
      my
      mailchimp
      ones
      seem
      to
      have
      a
      less
      slippery
      top.
      Has
      that
      happened
      to
      you?
      Does
      that
      make
      sense??

      I
      sit
      at
      a
      911
      call
      center
      for
      12
      hour
      shifts
      and
      I #8217;ve
      even
      noticed
      with
      my
      high
      Victorians
      after
      doing
      one
      hand
      cuts,
      bridges
      and
      just
      shuffling
      that
      those
      ones
      in
      particular
      stay
      slick.
      It #8217;s
      not
      a
      bad
      thing,
      if
      anything
      it
      helps
      with
      control
      but
      somedays
      I #8217;m
      not
      as
      tight
      with
      my
      cardistry
      as
      other
      days.
      Glad
      to
      know
      I #8217;m
      not
      the
      only
      one
      though!

      thanks
      for
      the

      I

      embrace

      Wow
      that #8217;s
      really
      interesting.
      Thank
      you
      for
      taking
      the
      time
      to
      reply
      with
      that
      info!
      Yeah
      when
      I
      started
      I
      learned
      through
      research
      that
      different
      companies
      will
      source
      to
      different
      manufacturers
      which
      could
      ultimately
      change
      the
      feel
      and
      movement
      of
      the
      deck
      but
      didn #8217;t
      know
      it
      went
      further
      than
      that!
      So
      rock
      on!
      I #8217;ll
      have
      to
      go
      through
      my
      inventory
      and
      create
      a
      spreadsheet
      with
      all
      the
      different
      metrics
      of
      the
      decks.
      Awesome
      info
      man!

      Ohhhh
      I
      know
      lol,
      I
      love
      knives,
      guns
      and
      guitars
      and
      let

      tell

      about
      expensive
      haha.
      But
      I
      think
      my
      next
      set
      is
      going
      to
      be
      Leonardo
      davinci
      playing
      cards
      with
      his
      work
      in
      them.
      They
      are
      beautiful
      here #8217;s

      vinci
      playing
      cards](https://www.maxplayingcards.com/en/2015/02/08/leonardo-decks-pure-renaissance-in-playing-cards/)
      Also
      love
      finding
      vintage
      decks
      whether
      it
      be
      babes,
      or
      anti
      smoking
      or
      whatever.
      My
      best
      friends
      gf
      showed
      me
      a
      deck
      her
      grandma
      had
      personally
      made
      several
      decades
      ago
      to
      promote
      her
      upholstery
      business
      -
      weird
      flex
      I
      know.
      She
      also
      had
      this
      one
      where
      the
      tops
      looked
      like
      the
      old
      cheap
      white
      counter
      top
      with
      the
      gold
      specs
      in
      it
      -
      I
      actually
      really
      really
      liked
      those
      because
      they
      were
      so
      vintage.

      I
      guess
      it
      depends
      on
      who
      posts
      it.
      If
      I
      posted
      it
      on
      social
      media
      my

      would
      totally
      be
      sarcastic
      and
      ironic.

      Hey
      all,
      this
      is
      my
      first
      post
      and
      need
      help.
      Would
      a
      compound
      bow
      or
      a
      recurve
      be
      better
      for
      someone
      with
      frequent
      shoulder
      dislocations
      and
      problems?

      I
      am
      waiting
      to
      have
      surgery
      on
      my
      left
      shoulder
      that
      dislocates
      all
      the
      time
      and
      up
      until
      that
      point
      I #8217;d
      like
      to
      start
      archery.
      With
      that
      being
      said,
      once
      I
      start
      to
      recover
      I #8217;d
      like
      to
      not
      blow
      my
      shoulder
      out
      again
      but
      I
      know
      I #8217;ll
      still
      want
      to
      shoot.
      What
      do
      you
      think?

      I #8217;ll
      try
      to
      provide
      a
      little
      more
      context.
      I #8217;m
      a
      righty
      and
      my
      left
      shoulder
      is
      the
      bad
      one.
      Now
      there
      are
      certain
      movements
      I #8217;m
      afraid
      to
      do
      that
      are
      of
      simple
      every
      day
      task
      however
      there
      i
      tasks
      I
      can
      perform
      that
      don #8217;t
      make
      any
      physical
      sense
      and
      not
      worry
      about
      my
      shoulder.
      A
      couple
      years
      ago
      I
      was
      testing
      the
      lb
      on
      my
      friends
      compound.
      Basically
      told
      me
      to
      see
      if
      I
      could
      pull
      it
      back
      and
      during
      the
      draw
      my
      shoulder
      felt
      easily
      tired
      and
      sore,
      but
      once
      I
      pulled
      it
      all
      the
      way
      back
      and
      I
      was
      able
      to
      rest
      it
      it
      was
      fine.
      I
      hope
      that
      made
      some
      sense

      You
      had
      me
      by
      giving
      your
      floor
      the

      elbow
      haha
      yeah
      that #8217;s
      probably
      the
      wisest
      to
      wait
      out
      the
      surgery
      but
      I
      feel
      confident
      my
      shoulder
      would
      hold
      up
      before
      surgery
      (my
      surgery
      date
      is
      yet
      to
      be
      set
      and
      because
      of
      a
      bone
      graft
      the
      dates
      are
      tentatively
      set)
      but
      good
      to
      know
      others
      with
      shoulder
      problems
      enjoy
      the
      life
      of
      archery.
      Hope
      your
      shoulder
      doesn #8217;t
      keep
      giving
      you
      problems.

      The
      example
      I
      found
      on
      google
      used
       #8220;dance
      a
      flamingo #8221;
      instead
      of
      flamenco
      -
      synonymous
      with
      error,
      misuse,
      misapplication
      and
      wrong
      word.
      But
      honestly
      grammar
      and
      English
      are
      not
      pacifically
      my
      forte
      ;)
      See
      what
      I
      did
      there
      lol?
      But
      yeah,
      in
      this
      application
      it
      would
      be
      a
      misspelling
      of
      his
      intended
      word
      but
      correctly
      spelt
      an
      unintended
      word.
      But
      please
      don #8217;t
      tell
      the
      mods
      :)

      That
      is
      the
      perfect
      example
      too,
      I
      can
      confirm
      without
      bias
      from
      occupational
      experience
      of
      the
      perpetual
      cycle
      of
      returning
      to
      an
      abuser.
      It #8217;s
      sad
      because
      it
      is
      a
      pretty
      useful
      platform
      until
      you
      happen
      to
      PISS
      SOMEBODY
      off
      where
      mods
      can
      indiscriminately
      ban
      and
      delete
      people,
      coupled
      with
      the
      mob
      mentality
      usually
      derived
      from
      misunderstanding
      context,
      tone,
      sarcasm,
      and
      people #8217;s
      honest
      opinions.
      People
      have
      become
      so
      afraid
      of
      adversity
      that
      they #8217;d
      rather
      not
      understand
      indifferences
      and
      find
      rationality,
      but
      to
      seek
      out
      and
      silencing
      the
      opposition
      and
      sheltering
      themselves
      through
      many
      different
      methods
      of
      safe
      spaces.
       #8220;If
      you
      have
      to
      fight
      a
      dragon
      it #8217;s
      better
      to
      go
      to
      its
      cave
      and
      fight
      it
      before
      it
      comes
      to
      your
      village. #8221;

      I
      made

      was
      just

      advice
      and
      got
      backhanded
      and
      trivial
      opinions.
      It #8217;s
      really
      annoying,
      especially
      over

      It

      interesting
      how
      stress
      can
      do
      that.

      I #8217;m
      not
      dead
      yet
      I #8217;ve

      populated
      county
      of

      I #8217;ve

      much
      better

      I
      have
      had
      people
      call
      and
      ask
      to
      order
      a
      pizza
      sometimes
      it
      comes
      off
      as
      a
      prank
      but
      it #8217;s
      a
      good
      way
      to
      get
      an
      address
      and
      a
      phone
      number
      and
      ask
      yes
      or
      no
      questions.
      I
      dispatch
      for
      one
      of
      the
      biggest
      metros
      in
      my
      state,
      it #8217;s
      safe
      to
      say
      that
      when
      you
      think
      you #8217;ve
      heard
      it
      all
      -

      really

      Hey
      there,
      I
      typically
      have
      green
      ones,
      I
      may
      have
      clear
      ones
      as
      well
      but
      certainly
      have
      green.
      I
      will
      certainly
      start
      saving
      them
      for
      you
      if
      green
      is
      okay.
      Edit:

      customer
      service
      like
      that
      is
      very

      imo.
      I

      written
      thank

      I
      purchased
      for

      that
      I
      make.
      It
      feels
      really
      nice
      and
      personable.
      Will
      be
      checking

      some
      trainers
      myself
      here

      Awesome
      good
      to
      know,
      I #8217;m
      t1
      as
      well
      but
      don #8217;t
      use
      a
      pump,
      however
      I
      do
      have
      a
      CGM
      and
      has
      been
      a
      game
      changer.
      I #8217;m
      planning
      a
      3
      day
      trip
      for
      next
      year,
      it
      will
      be
      my
      first
      extended
      bushcraft
      stay
      and
      want
      to
      prepare
      for
      my
      health
      and
      safety
      above
      all

      I
      used
      them
      when
      I
      was
      first
      diagnosed
      7
      years
      ago
      (turning
      30
      this
      year).
      I
      have
      used
      those
      before
      they #8217;re
      like
      giant
      smarties
      candies
      haha.
      I
      always
      have
      this
      problem
      when
      I
      go
      hello
      I
      have
      the

      eat

      substance
      or
      just
      a

      the
      fridge
      but
      when
      it
      comes
      to
      practicality
      they
      are
      a
      great
      method
      for
      treating
      a

      Your
      backpack
      is
      something
      I
      am
      definitely
      going
      to
      be
      upgrading
      for
      this.
      I
      have
      a
      personal
      backpack
      that
      I
      use
      for
      my
      every
      day
      carry
      but
      it #8217;s
      not
      suitable
      for
      a
      multiple
      day
      trip
      in
      the
      woods
      so
      that #8217;s
      good
      to
      know
      that
      some
      bags
      have
      that
      accessibility.
      Thank
      you.

      That #8217;s
      quite
      interesting
      to
      know.
      Because
      when
      my
      blood
      sugar
      goes
      low
      that #8217;s
      when
      I
      get
      grumpy
      and
      when
      I
      mean
      grumpy
      I
      mean
      very
      grumpy.
      I #8217;m
      a
      very
      patient
      person,
      and
      that #8217;s
      one
      of
      my
      telltale
      signs
      that
      I
      know
      when
      I
      am
      going
      low
      is
      that
      I
      get
      short
      or
      grumpy
      with
      a
      person
      but
      I
      don #8217;t
      really
      get
      symptoms
      when
      my
      blood
      sugar
      gets
      high
      often
      times
      I
      feel
      like
      I
      am
      just
      normal
      sometimes
      I
      feel
      a
      little
      sluggish
      or
      slow
      but
      it #8217;s
      not
      as
      an
      extreme
      affect
      as
      when
      my
      blood
      sugar
      goes
      well.
      Thought
      that
      was
      just
      very
      interesting
      thank
      you
      for
      sharing.

      came
      home
      to
      a
      freezer
      spraying
      Freon
      everywhere.
      Anyways

      Dude
      I
      feel
      the
      same
      way.
      I #8217;ve
      really
      been
      considering
      getting
      my
      friends
      a
      decent
      knife
      to
      show
      them
      the
      difference
      and
      when
      they
      own
      it
      hopefully
      they
      will
      enjoy
      it
      and
      understand
      the
      attraction
      as
      well.
      I
      just
      finally
      got
      my
      first
      microtech
      after
      carrying
      my
      benchmade
      for
      the
      last
      6
      years.

      I
      couldn #8217;t
      agree
      more.
      Sometimes
      the
       #8220;best #8221;
      isn #8217;t
      the
      most
      suitable
      for
      you.
      Sometimes
      upgrades
      can
      actually
      cause
      a
      downgrade
      in
      your
      performance
      until
      you
      hone
      it
      in.
      I
      can #8217;t
      tell
      you
      how
      many
      times
      in
      other
      dirt
      games
      that
      I #8217;ve
      used
      not
      the
       #8220;best #8221;
      car
      and
      I #8217;ve
      still
      whooped
      the
      cpus.
      It #8217;s
      all
      a
      matter
      of
      what
      you #8217;re
      comfortable
      with
      and
      what
      you
      perform
      best
      with.
      It #8217;s
      usually
      the
      driver
      that
      matters
      the
      most.

      Hey
      thanks
      for
      the
      reply!
      I
      got
      this
      secondhand
      off
      eBay.
      It
      was
      refurbished.
      The
      blade
      had
      a
      broken
      tip
      and
      it
      was
      serrated.
      Thanks
      for
      the
      information
      too!
      I
      really
      appreciate
      it
      -
      and
      for
      the
      cards
      they
      are

      They
      make
      amazing
      cards,
      I
      have
      been
      collecting
      for
      about
      a
      year
      now.
      Playing
      cards
      are
      usually
      in
      my
      EDC
      aside
      from
      an
      offensive
      pokey
      fidget
      spinner
      aka
      my
      knives
      I
      will
      fiddle
      with
      these
      in
      public
      and
      if
      someone
      wants
      to
      play
      a
      game
      I #8217;m
      always
      prepared.

      What
      got
      me
      into
      collecting
      cards
      was
      cardistry,

      shuffling/cutting/sleight

      hand
      techniques
      and
      tricks
      -
      not
      to
      be
      confused
      with
      magic.
      I
      know
      several
      different
      shuffles
      and
      cuts
      that
      look
      rad
      when
      done
      right!
      It #8217;s

      Whoops
      my
      mistake,
      definitely
      getting
      the

      bees
      first!
      The

      come

      Yeah
      I #8217;ve
      been
      justifying
      buying
      packs

      playing

      Good
      for
      you
      man,
      I
      quit
      drinking
      that
      stuff
      7
      years
      ago
      for
      the
      most
      part
      when
      I
      was
      a
      healthy
      23
      year
      old
      who
      out
      of
      nowhere
      was
      diagnosed
      type
      one
      diabetic.
      Lol
      so
      the
      money
      I
      used
      to
      waste
      on
      sugary
      drinks
      and
      candy
      help
      line
      my
      pockets
      haha.
      I
      just
      bought
      a
      microtech
      though
      so
      now
      I #8217;m

      They #8217;re
      certainly
      worth
      it.
      I
      got
      mine
      off
      eBay
      and
      it
      was
      refurbished
      so
      there
      was
      some
      relief
      from
      the
      original
      value,
      I #8217;ve
      had
      it
      for
      about
      5-6
      years
      now,
      only
      problem
      I #8217;ve
      had
      is
      occasionally
      the
      clip
      screws
      would
      come
      a
      little
      loose
      otherwise
      I #8217;m
      a
      benchmade
      fan
      for
      life.
      I
      almost
      bought
      a
      budget
      spyderco
      at
      Walmart
      -
      they
      have
      been

      the
      tenacious
      for
      around

      It
      is
      a
      moth
      then!
      I
      was
      trying
      to
      figure
      out,
      it #8217;s
      wings
      were
      up
      so
      I
      assumed
      it
      was
      a
      butterfly
      but
      I
      know
      it
      could
      have
      just
      been
      the
      timing
      of
      the
      shot.
