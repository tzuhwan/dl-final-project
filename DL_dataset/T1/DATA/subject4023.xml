      And
      that
      makes
      its
      ok
      to
      try
      and
      leech
      of
      him
      for
      the
      rest
      of
      his
      career?
      Its
      not
      even
      legal.
      Dont
      know
      if
      you
      follow
      football,
      but
      Luka
      Modric
      had
      a
      similar
      contrsct
      when
      he
      was
      underage
      bcuz
      that
      manager
      gave
      him
      a
      place
      tovstay,
      gave
      him
      clothes
      and
      money.
      So
      he
      said
      now
      im
      entitled
      to
      20%
      of
      your
      earnings
      till
      kingdom
      come.
      And
      it
      was
      nullified
      By
      the
      eu
      courts
      cuz
      its
      illegal
      to
      do
      that.
      Ana
      was
      maybe
      young
      and
      didnt
      understand
      how
      things
      work
      completely,
      but
      his
      manager
      was
      the
      scummy
      one.

      Ok
      maybe
      I
      misread,
      it
      looked
      to
      me
      like
      the
      point
      of
      your
      comment
      was
      that
      bcuz
      he
      gave
      Ana
      all
      that
      its
      ok
      to
      ask
      for
      %
      till
      the
      end
      of
      his
      career.
      My

      You
      can
      do
      that,
      but
      that
      would
      "hurt"
      official
      ads
      ran
      by
      his
      campaign
      because
      you
      would
      siphon
      some
      of

      so
      in
      order
      to
      be
      effective
      this
      would
      need
      to
      be
      a
      coordinated
      effort.
      I
      do
      this
      for
      a

      I

      In
      last
      5
      days
      I
      had
      a
      heartattack
      followed
      by
      a
      stroke
      at
      age
      28.
      Also
      had
      some
      family
      events
      earlier.
      If
      you
      react
      within
      an
      hour
      or
      so
      you
      havw
      great
      chances
      of
      survival
      and
      not
      having
      long
      term
      problems.
      Also
      when
      you
      are
      younger
      your
      body
      does
      crazy
      stuff
      to
      help
      itself.
      In
      my
      case,
      brain
      found
      alternative
      paths
      to
      keep
      that
      part
      of
      brain
      alive
      before
      i
      was
      operated
      on.
      So
      while
      its
      shitty
      for
      us
      to
      have
      to
      constantly
      worry,
      there
      is
      hope
      aswell.
      These
      operations
      are
      minimally
      invasive
      and
      almost
      routine
      at
      this
      point.
      If
      you
      can
      recognize
      symptoms
      fast
      enough
      youll
      probably
      be
      fine.

      first
      day
      and
      was
      really
      happy.
      Got
      heart
      attack
      on
      Saturday
      evening
      followed
      by
      a
      stroke

      Watched

      so
      was

      he
      added
      and

      he
      improved
      on
      those

      And
      I
      loved

      I
      for
      one
      welcome
      it.
      People
      coming
      to
      EU
      should
      assimilate
      and
      live
      with
      European
      values.
      Minorities
      hsve
      their
      rights
      and
      those
      rights
      are
      valued
      and
      they
      are
      free
      to
      prsctice
      them.
      Lets
      not
      lie
      about
      this
      also,
      this
      is
      mostly
      because
      of
      Islam.

      Go

      go

      No

      no

      Missed

      cost
      them
      the

      team,

      isnt

      As
      I
      said
      this
      is
      mostly
      because
      of
      the
      influx
      of
      Muslims.
      So
      in
      this
      case
      European
      values
      would
      be
      women
      and
      minority
      rights,
      separation
      of
      church
      and
      state,
      freedom
      to
      choose
      your
      religion,
      stoning
      people
      isnt
      ok
      etc..
      sorry
      to
      say
      it
      like
      that
      but
      islam
      is
      currently
      where
      all
      the
      bad
      ideas
      are.

      Its

      Later

      this
      stupid

      And
      confusing
      said

      in
      a
      "backwards"
      country
      where
      this
      will
      never
      be
      even
      entertained
      and
      these
      parents
      would
      get
      shit
      kicked
      out
      of
      them
      for
      abusing
      children
      like
      this.

      To

      because
      you

      a
      casual
      fan

      is
      mad

      stupid
      shit
      at

      while
      filming
      specials

      Pc
      culture
      is

      fuckong
      worst,
      if
      for

      Its
      not
      just
      age,
      its
      inevitability
      of
      it
      that
      gives
      you
      somewhat
      of
      peace
      and
      calm.
      About
      3
      weeks
      ago
      I
      had
      a
      heart
      attack
      followed
      by
      a
      stroke
      at
      28yo,
      and
      lying
      there
      in
      intensive
      care
      not
      knowing
      what
      will
      happen
      made
      me
      sad
      for
      my
      family,
      but
      you
      make
      peace
      with
      yourself.
      Its
      not
      the
      same
      I
      know,
      but
      dying
      there
      was
      still
      an
      option
      I
      had
      to
      think
      about.

      Im
      glad
      to
      see
      your
      are
      still
      here
      and
      kicking
      :)
      but
      yeah,
      I
      felt
      so
      bad
      for
      my
      parents
      and
      gf.
      I
      remember
      an
      interview
      I
      read
      with
      some
      dude
      that
      defused
      explosives
      where
      they
      asked
      him
      how
      he
      handles
      stress
      and
      he
      just
      replied
      "what
      stress?
      It
      either
      goes
      well
      or
      its
      not
      my
      problem
      anymore."
      Tried
      to
      keep
      that
      perspective
      for
      me,
      but
      felt
      really
      sad
      for
      my
      family.
      But
      hey,
      we
      are
      still
      here!

      I
      still
      dont
      know
      what
      was
      the
      trigger,
      waiting
      on
      results
      for
      some
      genetics
      tests
      and
      trombophilia.
      I
      do
      know
      that
      clot
      from
      my
      heart
      separated
      and
      went
      to
      the
      brain
      and
      that
      gave
      me
      a
      stroke,
      so
      that
      was
      just
      shitty
      luck.
      What
      I
      do
      know
      is
      that
      I
      worked
      like
      60-70
      hour
      weeks,
      ate
      shit
      and
      worked
      out
      once
      a
      week.
      But
      alot
      of
      people
      live
      like
      that
      and
      dont
      have
      heart
      attack
      at
      28.
      Definetly
      try
      to
      make
      a
      habit
      of
      eating
      veggies
      and
      fruit
      alot
      and
      try
      atleast
      like
      walk
      30min
      each
      day,
      and
      if
      you
      are
      a
      smoker
      just
      quit.
      Its
      not
      worth
      it.

      I
      wouldnt
      say
      heavy
      smoker,
      smoked
      less
      than
      a
      pack
      a
      day,
      and
      I
      drink
      rarely,
      once
      in
      a
      month
      or
      so.
      But
      I
      get
      drunk
      of
      5
      beers,
      so
      I
      wouldnt
      call
      that
      heavy
      drinking
      either,
      atleast
      where
      I
      live.
      I
      did
      drink
      and
      smoke
      much
      more
      when
      I
      was
      younger
      (highschool
      and
      college)
      and
      you
      could
      add
      in
      weed
      then.
      Im
      not
      fat,
      healthy
      bmi
      (im
      like
      2m
      tall
      and
      around
      95kg).

      so
      sorry

      because

      And

      Im
      sure

      friend
      found
      his
      peace,
      there
      is
      no
      escaping
      death
      and
      that
      is
      the
      big
      tragedy
      and
      blessing
      of
      life
      we
      all
      have
      to
      accept

      peace
      as

      I
      cant
      imagine
      what
      losing
      someone
      close
      feels
      like.

      I
      think
      nuking
      it
      would
      create
      a

      instead
      of
      one
      rock
      now
      you
      have
      to
      worry
      about
      potentially
      alot
      of
      rocks.
      Granted,
      they'd
      be

      I
      dont

      I
      started
      playing
      Division
      1
      couple
      of
      years
      ago
      with
      some
      friends
      and
      we
      had
      a
      blast.
      But
      after
      a
      while
      they
      turned
      to
      other
      games
      so
      I
      tried
      to
      play
      solo.
      And
      it
      was
      a
      pretty
      boring/bad
      experience.
      Last
      week
      we
      tried
      division
      2
      over
      uplay+
      and
      had
      a
      blast
      but
      i
      see
      already
      that
      this
      wont
      last
      (we
      all
      work,
      some
      have
      kids
      etc).
      I
      really
      like
      the
      game
      but
      playing
      solo
      feels
      lackluster.
      Is
      there
      something
      to
      improve
      solo
      experience?
      Or
      how
      hard
      is
      it
      to
      find
      a
      decent
      group
      that
      speaks
      english?
      Im
      sorry
      if
      this
      question
      goes
      against
      rules
      or
      something,
      couldn't
      find
      like
      a
      daily
      question
      thread
      or
      similar.

      But

      was
      that
      Serbs
      to

      cant
      accept
      they
      were
      in

      not
      that
      all
      Serbs
      did
      crimes.
      And
      yes,
      if
      Americans
      think
      US
      did
      good
      things
      in

      they
      are
      in
      the
      same
      wrong
      as
      Serbs.
      That

      mean
      they
      all
      commited
      crimes.

      should
      go
      the

      say

      Lol
      It

      vetted
      by
      journalists
      and
      published
      to

      is

      This.
      Ive
      had
      a
      heartattack
      a
      month
      ago
      at
      age
      28,
      and
      drs
      said
      this
      is
      happening
      more
      often
      than
      ever.
      Im
      not
      fat,
      exercising
      like
      once
      twice
      a
      week
      and
      tried
      eating
      semi
      healthy
      but
      failing
      often
      aswell.
      People,
      start
      caring
      about
      your
      bodies
      more,
      it
      sucks
      when
      it
      goes
      bad.

      This

      fake.
      Their

      I

      you
      like

      his

      killed
      more
      civilans
      with
      drone
      strikes
      than
      this
      one
      probably
      will.
      Is
      saying
      something
      suddenly
      worse
      than
      doing
      it?

      you

      Definetly,
      Im
      not
      defending
      anyone
      and
      alot
      of
      shitty
      people
      get
      paid
      alot
      due
      to
      corruption
      and
      nepotism.
      And
      I
      dont
      know
      what
      influence
      was
      bought,
      but
      this
      doesnt
      look
      fishy
      to
      you?
      If
      this
      was
      one
      of
      the
      Republicans,
      you
      wouldnt
      think
      this
      was
      strange?
      To
      get
      paid
      so
      much
      while
      your
      dad
      is
      VP
      of
      the
      most
      powerful
      country
      in
      the
      world?
      There
      is
      absolutely
      no
      corruption
      and
      nepotism
      in
      the
      Democratic
      party?
      As
      I
      said,
      Im
      not
      even
      an
      American
      so
      Im
      just
      asking
      honestly,
      because
      from
      the
      outside
      it
      looks
      strange.

      I
      understand
      you
      guys
      like
      Obama
      because
      you
      have

      you
      had

      dont

      the

      thinks
      that
      highly

      him.
      Yes,
      he
      was

      well

      No,

      Agreed,
      but
      then
      solution
      is
      to
      vote
      for
      someone
      thats
      just
      less
      corrupt?
      Why
      defend
      Biden
      if
      he
      is
      also
      corrupt?
      If
      this
      story
      isnt
      true,
      you
      and
      me
      both
      know
      he
      is
      a

      I
      live
      in
      a
      much
      worse
      and
      corrupt
      shithole
      than
      you
      do,
      so
      its
      not
      like
      Im
      judging
      you
      at
      all,
      I
      just
      wished
      at
      least
      one
      side
      somewhere
      does
      the
      right
      thing
      and
      cleans
      their
      own
      yard
      aswell!
      And
      I
      mean
      yet
      because
      if
      this
      story
      isnt
      true
      some
      other
      is
      because
      dealing
      with
      Ukrainan
      energy
      oligarchs
      is
      shady
      af,
      Trump
      knows
      this
      well
      and
      sooner
      or
      later
      something
      will
      come
      out.

      And
      I
      was
      born
      and
      am
      living
      in
      Eastern
      Europe
      and
      Im
      telling
      you
      there
      is
      no
      way
      they
      paid
      Mr.
      Biden
      this
      amount
      of
      money
      for
      nothing.
      Also,
      look
      at
      Zlochevsky,
      dude
      that
      founded
      that
      company
      (he
      was
      also
      a
      minister
      under
      a
      very
      corrupt
      president):
      At
      the
      end
      of
      2014,
      Zlochevsky
      fled
      Ukraine
      amid
      allegations
      of
      unlawful
      self
      enrichment
      and
      legalization
      of
      funds
      (Article
      368-2,
      Criminal
      Code
      of
      Ukraine)
      during
      his
      tenure
      in
      public
      office. #160;At
      the
      end
      of
      2016
      the #160;Central
      Criminal
      Court #160;in
      London
      released
      $23
      million
      that
      were
      blocked
      on
      accounts
      of
      Zlochevsky. #160;As
      the
      Serious
      Fraud
      Office
      press
      service
      explained,
      the
      reason
      why
      the
      funds
      were
      released
      was
      due
      to
      the
      fact
      that
      it
      never
      obtained
      necessary
      evidences. #160;According

      former
      Ukrainian
      parliamentary #160;Oleksandr
      Onyshchenko,
      Zlochevsky
      might
      have
      paid
      some
      money
      to
      close
      investigations
      against
      him
      in

      Look,
      Im
      not
      saying
      Biden
      is
      the
      same
      or
      worse
      than
      Trump,
      thats
      clearly
      not
      the
      case.
      But
      as
      I
      wrote
      in
      another
      comment,
      I
      live
      in
      Eastern
      Europe
      and
      there
      is
      no
      chance
      in
      hell
      Hunter
      Biden
      got
      paid
      600.000$
      a
      year
      for
      his
      expertise.
      Just
      read
      [wiki
      page
      of
      the
      founder
      and
      chairman
      of
      that
      company](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mykola_Zlochevsky?wprov=sfla1)
      and
      tell
      me
      you
      think
      this
      is
      a
      type
      of
      person
      that
      will
      care
      about
      Hunter
      Biden's
      expertise?
      This
      is
      like
      a
      comic
      book
      Eastern
      Europe

      I
      mean
      thats
      not
      true.
      Republicans
      and
      Trump
      are
      a
      criminal
      organization
      by
      any
      reasonable
      standard
      while
      there
      is
      still
      hope
      for
      the
      Democratic
      party.
      What
      I
      dont
      understand
      is
      why
      Democratic
      voters
      think
      Democrats
      are
      without
      flaws
      and
      any
      attempt
      to
      honestly
      talk
      about
      topics
      like
      these
      just
      gets
      you
      downvoted
      and
      yelled
      at.
      Ill
      admit
      I
      was
      wrong
      in
      my
      comment
      about
      Obama
      above,
      but
      this
      about

      Biden
      is
      just

      They
      just
      dont
      get
      it.
      I
      wish
      they
      would
      go
      to
      Bosnia
      or
      Serbia
      and
      walk
      among
      those
      centres
      and
      streets
      at
      night.
      They
      would
      change
      their
      opinion
      in
      a
      heartbeat
      but
      its
      easy
      to
      virtue
      signal
      over
      keyboard.
      Im
      glad
      to
      live
      in
      a
      "backwards"
      country
      where
      these
      people
      dont
      want
      to
      go
      live
      and
      we
      dont
      want
      them
      anyway.
