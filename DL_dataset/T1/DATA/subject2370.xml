      So
      essentially
      you
      have
      a
      change
      in
      potential
      energy.
      Potential
      energy
      is
      the
      integral
      of
      Force,
      and
      the
      force
      in
      this
      case
      is
      simply
      F=Gmm/r^2.
      The
      intergral
      of
      this
      is
      U=-Gmm/r.
      The
      mass
      and
      velocity
      do
      not
      change
      so
      the
      kinetic
      energy
      remains
      the
      same.
      Because
      you
      are
      now
      in
      a
      completely
      different
      state
      you
      do
      not
      need
      to
      factor
      in
      conservation
      of
      energy
      between
      the
      r
      and
      3r
      distance.
      If
      that
      was
      the
      case
      then
      clearly
      the
      orbital
      speed
      would
      slow
      down.

      Unless
      of
      course
      the
      speed
      does
      not
      remain
      constant...
      then
      just
      make
      E=Ep+Ek
      where
      E
      is
      constant
      and
      work
      from
      there.
      It
      is
      a
      good
      idea
      to
      try
      and
      understand
      Keplers
      laws
      to
      get
      a
      feel
      for
      classical
      orbital
      motion.

      It #8217;s
      amazing
      how
      much
      they
      connect
      with
      us.
      Truly
      humble
      and
      loving
      creatures.
      The
      way
      I
      think
      about
      it
      when
      they
      pass
      (having
      lost
      two
      of
      my
      babies
      already)
      is
      that
      they
      aren #8217;t
      and
      were
      never
      ours.
      They
      come
      into
      our
      lives
      and
      brighten
      them
      up
      and
      we
      do
      our
      best
      to
      protect
      them
      from
      the
      harshness
      of
      the
      world.
      But
      when
      the
      time
      comes
      we
      let
      them
      go.
      We
      don #8217;t
      deserve
      the
      love
      from
      dogs
      if
      we
      look
      at
      how
      we
      treat
      other
      animals.
      But
      it #8217;s
      always
      a
      comfort
      to
      remember
      that
      you
      gave
      that
      dog
      everything
      you
      could
      in
      order
      for
      him/her
      to
      be
      happy.
      And
      knowing
      that
      you
      can
      love
      something
      so
      much
      and
      be
      loved
      back
      makes
      us
      as
      humans
      feel
      like
      we
      aren #8217;t
      so
      bad
      after
      all.
      I #8217;m
      on
      a
      little
      tangent
      here.
      The
      first
      dog
      I
      ever
      got
      was
      a
      staffie
      named
      Piggie.
      She
      was
      absolutely
      amazing.
      So
      calm
      and
      also
      quite
      grumpy-
      but
      had
      an
      amazing
      sense
      of
      humor.
      The
      day
      she
      went
      was
      the
      first
      time
      I
      saw
      my
      dad
      cry.
      If
      I
      had
      a
      chance
      to
      spend
      5
      minutes
      with
      someone
      who
      has
      departed
      I
      would
      choose
      to
      see
      her
      over
      any
      other
      person.
      I
      find
      it
      difficult
      to
      understand
      people
      who
      are
      critical
      of
      human-dog
      relationships.
      There
      has
      never
      been
      anything
      more
      amazing
      to
      come
      out
      of
      life
      than
      having
      a
      dog
      as
      a
      best
      friend.

      First
      question:
      The
      physics
      is
      understood.
      But
      no,
      quantum
      mechanics
      is
      not
      macro.
      Otherwise
      weird
      things
      would
      happen...
      like
      a
      ball
      bouncing
      higher
      than
      the
      height
      it
      was
      dropped.
      Entropy
      is
      macro.
      And
      we
      are
      governed
      by
      that.
      It
      will
      never
      be
      the
      case
      where
      quantum
      mechanics
      becomes
      tangible.
      2nd:
      I
      do
      think
      that
      the
      world
      in
      some
      senses
      is
      only
      around
      when
      we
      observe
      it.
      Our
      bodies
      are
      attuned
      to
      receiving
      waves
      at
      different
      frequencies
      and
      our
      brain
      filters
      them
      into
      useful
      information.
      But
      other
      creatures
      perceive
      differently.
      However
      one #8217;s
      direct
      presence
      doesn #8217;t
      mean
      the
      wave
      isn #8217;t
      emitted.
      But...
      alas
      I #8217;m
      still
      clueless.
      3rd:
      space
      time
      is
      a
      thing.
      We
      can #8217;t
      really
      conquer
      all
      because
      of
      it.
      We
      will
      never
      be
      able
      to
      control
      time
      and
      space.
      We
      can
      try
      to
      understand
      it
      though.
      Space
      time
      is
      actually
      the
      relationship
      between
      time
      and
      space
      and
      often
      we
      think
      of
      it
      as
      space
      never
      being
      able
      to
      move
      faster
      than
      light,
      so
      that #8217;s
      always
      the
      upper
      bound
      for
      space.

      I #8217;m
      no
      specialist,
      but
      I
      study
      3rd
      year
      Physics.
      A
      humanities
      major,
      who
      had
      done
      a
      metaphysics
      course,
      was
      going
      on
      about
      the
      possibilities
      of
      time
      travel
      and
      how
      close
      we
      are
      to
      being
      able
      to
      travel
      back
      and
      forth
      in
      time...
      must
      of
      been
      a
      YouTube
      video...
      Anyways,
      I
      listened
      and
      gritted
      my
      teeth
      but
      eventually
      it
      got
      to
      the
      point
      where
      I
      had
      to
      say
      something.
      We
      agreed
      that
      one
      would
      have
      to
      travel
      at
      the
      speed
      of
      light
      for
      any
      meaningful
      time
      travel
      to
      be
      made.
      I
      then
      told
      him
      that
      that
      would
      make
      one #8217;s
      mass
      infinite...
      He
      got
      pretty
      sulky
      after
      that.

      I
      am
      really
      struggling
      with
      how
      polarization
      works.

      how
      the
      E
      and
      B

      are
      angled

      I #8217;m

      Yeah,
      I #8217;m
      at
      UCT
      (south
      Africa).
      Quite
      a
      great
      physics
      department.
      They
      do
      a
      lot
      of
      work
      with
      CERN.
      I
      guess
      this
      meme
      would
      resonate
      with
      more
      members
      of
      the
      class.
      We
      just
      wrote
      a
      relativistic
      EM
      exam
      where
      only
      the
      last
      week
      of
      work
      was
      tested.
      Needless
      to
      say,
      making
      memes
      is
      a
      way
      of
      expressing
      annoyance.

      feild
      along
      the
      z
      axis
      and
      the
      second
      with
      B
      along
      the
      z'
      axis,
      which
      lies
      in
      the
      xz
      plane
      at
      an
      angle
      `$\theta$`
      relative
      to
      the
      z
      axis.
      Both
      apparatuses
      transmit
      only
      the
      uppermost
      beams.
      What
      fraction
      leaving
      the
      first
      will
      pass
      the
      second?
       #8203;
      The
      solution
      given:
      Particles
      exciting
      the
      first
      filter
      will
      be
      in
      the
      (1,
      0,
      0)\^t
      (transpose)
      state
      (S(z)
      basis).
      Particles
      passing
      the
      filter
      will
      be
      in
      the
      eigenstate
      of
      the
      `$B
      \cdot
      S$`
      opperator,
      which
      is
      =
      B(cos
      \*
      S(z)
      +
      sin
      \*
      S(x))
      (which
      becomes
      a
      matrix
      of
      cos
      and
      sin).
      The
      solution
      then
      states
      that
      the
      spin
      up
      eigen
      vector
      is
      1/2(1+cos,
      sqrt(2)
      sin,
      1-cos).
      Then
      the
      inner
      product
      \^2
      of
      this
      with
      the
      spin
      up
      z
      basis
      vector
      is
      1/4
      (1+cos(theta))\^2.
       #8203;
      Where
      we
      loose
      the
      plot:
      \-
      Why
      is
      (001)
      spin
      up
      in
      S(z).
      This
      seems
      so
      trivial
      but
      working
      with
      spin-one
      is
      confusing.
      How
      can
      this
      be
      show.
      Any
      explicit
      resources
      that
      anyone
      knows
      of?
       #8203;
      \-
      From
      the
      matrix
      B(cos
      \*
      S(z)
      +
      sin
      \*
      S(x)),
      how
      does
      one
      extract
      the
      spin
      up
      eigen
      vector...
      I
      have
      tried
      Gaussian
      reduction
      and
      looked
      online...
      nothing.
       #8203;
      Thanks
      so
      much
      if
      you
      are
      able
      to
      help.
      Spin
      is
      so
      elusive
      and
      really
      not
      explicit
      explained
      for
      spins
      other
      than
      spin-1/2.

      That

      Yeah
      fining
      the
      matrix
      isn #8217;t
      difficult.
      The
      difficulty
      I
      find
      is
      extracting
      spin
      up
      from

      So
      I
      bought
      some
      items
      at
      a
      pharmacy
      which
      totaled
      to
      R790
      (South
      African
      rands)
      however
      the
      cashier
      didn #8217;t
      notice
      one
      item
      after
      I
      had
      pushed
      in
      my
      pin
      to
      pay.
      She
      cancelled
      it
      on
      the
      device
      and
      I
      got
      an
      error
      receipt.
      She
      added
      the
      item
      and
      said
      I
      would
      receive
      the
      balance
      of
      the
      cancelled
      purchase
      as
      soon
      as
      it
      bounced
      back
      on
      the
      system.
      I
      repaid
      with
      added
      item.
      Two
      days
      later
      no
      such
      reflection
      in
      my
      account.
      I
      kept
      all
      the
      receipts
      and
      the
      error
      code
      from
      the
      card
      machine
      from
      the
      first
      swipe.
      I
      called
      the
      pharmacy
      and
      they
      said
      they
      would
      investigate
      and
      get
      back
      to
      me.
      They
      haven #8217;t.
      I #8217;m
      a
      student
      and
      it #8217;s
      quite
      a
      large
      amount
      of
      money
      for
      me
      but
      I
      will
      struggle
      with
      transport
      to
      get
      back
      to
      the
      pharmacy
      itself.
      I #8217;m
      not
      sure
      what
      to
      do
      here...
      I
      feel
      like
      I
      shouldn #8217;t
      have
      to
      physically
      go
      in
      and
      deal
      with
      the
      issue
      since
      it
      is
      their
      issue
      and
      they
      have
      my
      money.
      I
      live
      in
      South
      Africa,
      does
      anyone
      have
      any
      advice?
      What
      are
      my
      rights
      in
      this
      situation?
