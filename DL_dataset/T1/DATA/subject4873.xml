      I
      order
      red
      veins
      powder
      by
      the
      pound
      online
      and
      just
      toss
      and
      wash.
      But
      about
      a
      year
      ago
      I
      was
      able
      to
      buy
      opm's
      capsules
      from
      a
      local
      tobacco
      outlet.
      That
      Kratom
      really
      gave
      me
      unparalleled
      levels
      of
      energy
      and
      mood
      enhancement.
      Is
      there
      anything
      like
      that
      on
      the
      market
      today?

      I
      just
      got
      out
      of
      Mass,
      I
      had
      a
      question
      for
      my
      Father.
      He
      turned
      his
      back
      on
      me
      and
      walked
      away
      annoyed
      that
      I
      was
      disturbing
      him.

      I
      have
      had
      a
      question
      that
      has
      been
      bothering
      me.
      I
      am
      marrying
      a
      woman
      from
      the
      Philippines
      and
      I
      send
      her
      and
      her
      family
      money
      every
      week.
      I
      asked
      God
      to
      accept
      the
      money
      I
      send
      to
      her
      and
      her
      family
      as
      tithing.
      Her
      family
      is
      extremely
      poor:
      no
      running
      water,
      they
      lived
      in
      a
      one
      room
      bamboo
      hut
      when
      I
      met
      them,
      no
      plumbing,
      an
      out
      house
      for
      a
      bathroom
      that
      they
      have
      to
      go
      outside
      when
      it's
      raining
      to
      use.
      I
      could
      go
      on
      and
      on.
      I
      helped
      move
      them
      into
      a
      two
      story
      better
      home.
      I
      pay
      their
      electricity,
      their
      groceries,
      I
      got
      them
      a
      refrigerator
      so
      they
      could
      finally
      have
      cold
      water
      and
      left
      overs,
      Mosquito
      nets,
      internet,
      a
      tv,
      and
      just
      stuff
      to
      make
      life
      easier
      and
      better.
      So
      what
      I've
      been
      doing
      is
      I
      asked
      God
      to
      accept
      my
      weekly
      assistance
      to
      them
      as
      part
      of
      my
      tithing
      until
      my
      fianc #233;
      gets
      here
      to
      America.
      At
      the
      same
      time
      I
      still
      give
      a
      weekly
      additional
      humble
      amount
      to
      my
      church
      as
      well.
      I
      have
      been
      feeling
      more
      and
      more
      conflicted
      about
      this
      lately
      so
      earlier
      in
      the
      week
      I
      decided
      that
      I
      should
      ask
      my
      father
      his
      opinion
      after
      church.
      We
      have
      three
      priests
      and
      it
      could've
      been
      any
      of
      them,
      I
      didn't
      know
      who
      would
      be
      speaking
      but
      I
      was
      happy
      to
      ask
      any
      of
      them.
      So
      today,
      just
      now
      after
      mass
      I
      walked
      up
      to
      our
      Father
      And
      attempted
      to
      ask
      his
      opinion.
      I've
      seen
      him
      talking
      to
      families
      or
      indoviduals
      before
      after
      service
      so
      I
      assumed
      this
      was
      an
      appropriate
      time.
      No
      one
      else
      was
      speaking
      to
      him.
      Just
      walking
      by
      and
      saying
      thank
      you
      or
      good
      bye.
      I
      told
      him
      I
      had
      a
      question
      about
      tithing.
      He
      barely
      glanced
      at
      me
      and
      said
      5%
      to
      your
      church
      and
      5%
      to
      a
      local
      charity
      (my
      fianc #233;
      isn't
      a
      local
      charity
      and
      it's
      not
      an
      even
      5%
      split,
      and
      I'm
      wondering
      if
      helping
      my
      fianc #233;s
      family
      can
      even
      be
      considered
      charity.
      They're
      my
      family
      now.)
      so
      I
      tried
      to
      express
      my
      full
      question.
      He
      cut
      me
      off
      and
      started
      talking
      to
      someone
      else.
      So
      I
      waited.
      When
      he
      was
      done
      I
      asked
      if
      this
      was
      a
      bad
      time.
      He
      just
      said
      you're
      supposed
      to
      give
      5%
      to
      your
      church
      and
      5%
      to
      a
      local
      charity.
      And
      I
      swear,
      he
      was
      flustered
      and
      annoyed.
      Then
      he
      jumped
      into
      talking
      to
      another
      passerby.
      Again
      I've
      seen
      him
      talking
      with
      people
      at
      this
      time,
      so
      I'm
      just
      completely
      baffled.
      I
      waited
      again
      and
      then
      tried
      to
      express
      my
      full
      question.
      He
      then
      turned
      his
      back
      to
      me
      and
      walked
      away.
      I
      just
      stood
      there,
      I
      thought
      about
      following
      him
      to
      ask
      him
      what
      was
      the
      matter,
      but
      I'm
      a
      grown
      man.
      I'm
      not
      chasing
      another
      man
      down
      like
      that.
      He
      completely
      cut
      me
      off,
      turned
      his
      back
      to
      me
      and
      walked
      away.
      I
      am
      so
      confused.
      No
      kidding.
      I'm
      actually
      hurt.
      Very
      hurt.
      I've
      confessed
      to
      this
      man
      before.
      I
      don't
      know
      what
      just
      happened.
      Did
      I
      insult
      him,
      was
      this
      an
      inappropriate
      time?
      Did
      he
      think
      I
      was
      trying
      to
      trick
      him?
      He
      should
      know
      I'm
      not
      trying
      to
      trick
      him
      as
      he
      has
      heard
      me
      confess
      and
      he
      sees
      me
      in
      the
      pews
      every
      week
      that
      he
      is
      speaking.
      I
      immediately
      went
      to
      the
      adoration
      chapel
      and
      prayed.
      I
      was
      deeply
      comforted
      by
      our
      Father
      through
      Christ.
      I
      asked
      him
      if
      I
      did
      something
      wrong.
      I
      was
      comforted
      very
      much.
      I
      love
      that
      God
      held
      and
      comforted
      me,
      He
      is
      so
      good.
      But,
      I'm
      still
      confused
      about
      what
      just
      happened.
      Can
      anyone
      help?
      Thoughts,
      insights
      or
      advise?
      What
      just
      happened?

      I
      don #8217;t
      understand
      why
      the
      kid
      should
      have
      moved.
      If
      I #8217;m
      standing
      somewhere,
      anywhere...a
      street
      corner,
      in
      the
      mall,
      at
      a
      bus
      stop,
      in
      a
      grocery
      store,
      in
      Central
      Park
      NYC...or
      anywhere,
      and
      someone
      walks
      up
      to
      me
      as
      I #8217;m
      just
      standing
      there,
      it #8217;s
      not
      my
      obligation
      to
      get
      out
      of
      their
      way.
      This
      man
      walked
      into
      this
      group
      of
      kids.
      He
      walked
      up
      to
      that
      boy.
      That
      kid
      did
      not
      get
      in
      the
      mans
      face,
      the
      man
      got
      in
      his
      face.
      The
      boy
      didn #8217;t
      even
      move,
      the
      man
      100%
      instigated
      this.
      Just
      because
      that
      man
      walked
      into
      the
      kids
      face
      does
      not
      mean
      the
      kid
      had
      to
      step
      aside.
      He
      just
      didn #8217;t.
      The
      man
      is
      in
      the
      wrong
      for
      approaching
      the
      boy
      and
      beating
      a
      drum
      in
      the
      kids
      face.

      Bro.
      I #8217;m
      sure
      you
      already
      know
      but
      this
      guy
      your
      arguing
      with,
      he
      posts
      in
      r/politics
      and
      in
      r/dotard.
      I
      think
      he
      is
      literally
      touched
      a
      bit
      by
      his
      internalized
      hate
      (retarded).
      He
      is
      watching
      the
      truth
      like
      the
      rest
      of
      us
      but
      can
      not
      admit
      to
      himself
      that
      the
      kids
      did
      nothing
      wrong.
      Just
      because
      they
      had
      on
      MAGA
      hats
      he
      feels
      the
      need
      to
      destroy
      their
      lives
      even
      if
      it
      means
      lying
      to
      himself
      and
      others
      to
      ruin
      these
      innocent
      children #8217;s
      lives.
      I
      mean,
      that #8217;s
      a
      sick
      mentality.
      I
      wouldn #8217;t
      even
      bother
      with
      him.

      It

      My
      wife
      is
      from
      Mindanao
      island.
      Just
      before
      the
      last
      time
      I
      went
      to
      visit
      her
      family
      in
      2017
      a
      group
      of
      ISIS
      wannabes
      besieged
      a
      town
      only
      20
      miles
      from
      her
      parents
      front
      door
      (Marawi
      City)
      and
      the
      militants
      were
      decapitating
      priests
      and
      slaughtering
      Christians
      mercilessly.
      Two
      of
      my
      mother
      in
      laws
      neighbors
      we #8217;re
      stuck
      hiding
      in
      the
      basement
      of
      a
      storage
      facility
      for
      weeks
      until
      they
      were
      rescued
      by
      Duterte #8217;s
      military,
      thank
      God.
      It
      was
      awful
      and
      terrifying.

      my

      I
      love
      you.
      Can #8217;t
      wait

      you

      It
      was
      with
      Jesus,
      in
      the
      flesh.
      He
      is
      real.
      It
      happened
      in
      a
      Catholic
      way,
      so
      much
      so
      I
      can #8217;t
      deny
      or
      ignore
      it.
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      or
      know
      that
      catholicism
      is
      the
      only
      way
      to
      worship
      our
      Lord,
      but
      He
      clearly
      directed
      me
      to
      it.

      My
       #8220;daddy #8221;
      is
      a
      70
      year
      old
      black
      Catholic
      priest.
      You
      would
      be
      amazed
      at
      his
      heart
      felt,
      emotional,
      and
      inspiring
      services.
      The
      majority
      black
      congregation
      get
      up
      and
      sing
      and
      dance
      and
      holler
      AMEN,
      HALLELUJAH,
      PREACH,
      TAKE
      YOUR
      TIME
      NOW,
      etc.
      just
      like
      what
      you
      expect
      from
      many
      black
      Protestant
      Churches.
      it #8217;s
      a
      blast
      and
      it #8217;s
      healing
      :)

      Agreed
      (minus
      the
      study
      part,
      you
      can
      think
      for
      yourself
      and
      God
      wants
      you
      to
      interpret
      His
      word
      the
      way
      the
      Holy
      Spirit
      directs
      you
      to
      interpret
      it),
      but
      the
      NASB
      is
      a
      much
      easier
      read
      and
      is
      by
      far
      one
      of
      the
      most
      word

      word

      I
      just
      had
      a
      great
      wine
      from
      Alto
      Adige
      /
      Sudotrol.
      It
      was
      a
      Muller
      Thurgau.
      Is
      this
      near
      that
      area?
      Those

      LOOK

      wine
      tasted!

      Ha.
      Thanks!
      My
      division
      is
      heading
      to
      France
      and
      Germany
      this
      year,
      I #8217;m
      definitely
      going
      to
      ask
      about
      Italy
      too.
      I
      just
      moved
      to
      Ohio
      from
      Florida
      and
      there #8217;s
      a
      much
      larger
      demand
      for
      wines
      from
      your
      area
      then
      I #8217;d
      ever
      expect
      up
      here.
      I
      love
      the
      fact
      about
      apples,
      I
      can #8217;t
      wait
      to
      share
      that.
      It
      looks
      like
      we
      recycled
      the
      empty
      bottle
      already
      but
      the
      link
      you
      sent
      is
      definitely
      the
      winery.
      Edit:
      what
      a
      blessing
      meeting
      someone
      from
      Alto
      Adige.

      You
      are
      taking

      I
      bought
      some
      keto
      strips
      so
      I
      know
      I #8217;m
      in
      a
      state
      of
      ketosis.
      I
      started
      the
      diet
      early
      January
      and
      got
      into
      a
      state
      of
      ketosis
      on
      Jan
      15th
      2019,
      abd
      still
      in
      ketosis.
      But
      I
      haven #8217;t
      lost
      a
      pound!
      Can
      anyone
      give
      me
      any
      advice
      as
      to
      what
      could
      be
      wrong
      and
      what
      I
      can
      do?

      Ma #8217;am,

      due
      respect...it #8217;s
      throw,
      not
      through.
      EDIT:
      she
      fixed
      her
      spelling
      after
      i
      pointed
      it
      out.
      But
      honestly,
      I
      meant
      no
      disrespect,
      it
      just
      made
      reading
      her
      point
      of
      view
      difficult.
      Why
      the
      down
      votes
      for
      asking
      her
      to
      make
      her
      position
      more
      clear?

      Mueller

      a

      when
      he
      said
      trump

      was

      Mueller

      nor

      Can
      confirm.
      Keto
      is
      where
      it #8217;s
      at.
      You
      will

      to
      feel
      stuffed
      and

      even
      want
      to
      eat
      after
      a
      month.
      Seriously.
      If
      you #8217;re
      truly
      worried
      about
      gluttony
      I

      I
      went
      through
      the
      same
      thing
      brother
      (or
      sister).
      The
      weight
      piles
      on
      with
      an
      addictive
      personality,
      then
      it #8217;s
      just
      as
      hard
      to
      lose
      the
      weight
      as
      it
      was
      to
      kick
      the
      habit.
      But
      you
      can
      and
      will
      do
      it.
      No
      joke,
      the
      keto
      diet
      has
      helped
      me
      tremendously.

      Agreed.
      That #8217;s
      a
      beautiful
      perspective
      and
      insightful.
      I
      totally
      think
      that
      any
      parent
      should
      be
      able
      to
      prevent
      anyone
      else
      from
      injecting
      their
      child
      with
      anything
      they
      don #8217;t
      approve.
      I
      100%
      believe
      this.
      To
      be
      clear,
      i
      think
      it
      would
      be
      dumb
      to
      not
      vaccinate,
      but
      it
      is
      still
      a
      parent
      or
      individuals
      right
      to
      get
      a
      shot
      or
      not.
      But
      I
      love
      that
      the
      hospital
      accepted
      this
      and
      did
      their
      best
      to
      protect
      the
      innocent
      child.

      Agreed.
      I
      didn #8217;t
      say
      that.
      Just
      like
      someone
      with
      HIV
      cant
      fill
      a
      squirt
      gun
      with
      their
      blood
      and
      shoot
      strangers.
      If
      a
      kid
      is
      infected
      and
      they
      are
      running
      around
      infecting
      people
      then
      they
      need
      to
      be
      kept
      home.
      However
      if
      someone
      has
      received
      their
      vaccination
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      they
      have
      anything
      to
      worry
      about
      because
      they #8217;re
      now
      immune...(I
      could
      be
      wrong,
      i
      admit
      I #8217;m
      not
      educated
      here,
      but
      that
      seems
      logical)
      ...But
      a
      parent
      100%
      has
      the
      right
      to
      refuse
      allowing
      their
      child
      to
      get
      an
      injection.
      To
      force
      it
      on
      them
      would
      literally
      be
      fascism,
      and
      not
      like
      the
      fake
      kind
      of
      fascism
      being
      commonly
      thrown
      around
      today.
      Real
      fascism.

      Well
      there
      you
      go...
      ...then
      you
      agree

      that

      don #8217;t

      to

      I #8217;m

      Um
      yeah.
      We
      are
      in
      the
      same
      page.
      Why
      do
      you
      keep
      telling
      me
      the
      same
      thoughts.
      The
      government
      can #8217;t,
      and
      should
      never,
      force
      anyone
      into
      taking
      an
      injection
      against
      their,
      or
      in
      the
      case
      of
      a
      monitory...their
      children #8217;s,
      will.
      If
      they
      don #8217;t
      get
      vaccinated
      and
      they
      are
      shown
      to
      have
      any
      infectious
      disease
      they
      should
      be
      kept
      home
      and
      not
      allowed
      to
      infect
      anyone
      else.
      Pretty
      simple
      ideas
      we #8217;ve
      got
      over
      here.
      :)
      You
      would
      be
      dumb
      not
      to
      get
      a
      vaccination
      but
      you
      can #8217;t
      force
      it
      on
      anyone.
      Glad
      we
      agree.
      Good
      stuff!
      Thanks
      :)

      Well.
      That
      would
      be
      fascism
      as
      we
      both
      previously

      I #8217;m

      you
      don #8217;t
      agree
      with
      that?

      was

      just
      leading
      to
      the
      idea
      that
      you
      think
      the

      should
      force
      vaccinations
      on
      people?
      please
      tell
      me
      you

      agree
      with
      fascism.
      Please
      tell
      me
      your
      not
      a
      fascist...

      Yo,
      is
      that
      you
      downvoting
      me?
      You
      know
      I
      mostly
      agree
      with
      you
      right?
      We
      seem
      to
      be
      agreeing
      on
      the
      fact
      that
      the
      government
      shouldn #8217;t
      FORCE
      injections
      on
      people.
      Unless
      you
      disagree
      and
      think
      the
      government
      should
      inject
      people
      against
      their
      will.
      Hey,
      I
      won #8217;t
      downvote
      you
      of
      you

      downvote
      me

      I

      all

      Uh
      no.
      Just

      no
      ones
      trying
      to
      hate
      on
      you,
      we
      just
      aren #8217;t
      racists
      here
      in
      this
      sub
      and
      we
      have
      to
      fight
      the
      good
      fight.
      You
      just
      expressed
      yourself
      poorly,
      I
      get
      it.

      So
      I
      went
      ahead
      and
      looked
      into
      your
      history.
      All
      you
      talk
      about
      is
      race.
      You
      seem
      very
      obsessed
      with
      race.
      It #8217;s
      unhealthy
      to
      fill
      yourself
      with
      hate.
      I
      prayed
      for
      you,
      I #8217;ll
      try
      to
      remember
      to
      do
      it
      again
      later.
      God
      bless
      you
      and
      good
      luck.

      I #8217;d
      wager
      that
      you
      have
      never
      really
      had
      a
      discussion
      with
      trump
      supporters.
      If
      you
      would
      allow
      a
      civil
      discussion
      and
      be
      intellectually
      honest
      with
      yourself,
      truly
      no
      bigotry
      in
      your
      thinking
      during
      the
      conversation,
      then
      you #8217;ll
      realize
      99
      plus
      percent
      of
      trump
      supporters
      are
      not
      anti
      Muslim,
      nor
      racist,
      not
      bigots
      or
      any
      of
      the
      imaginary
      boogeyman
       #8220;hate #8221;
      titles
      given
      to
      them.
      I
      understand
      why
      you
      don #8217;t
      realize
      it,
      but
      your
      comment
      here
      shows
      that
      the
      above
      poster
      is
      correct.
      Civil
      discussion
      is
      at
      an
      end
      and
      it #8217;s
      either
      you #8217;re
      with
      me
      or
      against
      me
      mentality.
      You #8217;re
      entire
      post
      is
      a
      facade
      of
      you
      giving
      the
      impression
      that
      your
      open
      to
      civil
      discourse
      while
      actually
      shutting
      down
      and
      dismissing
      those
      whom
      you
      disagree
      with.
      Hopefully
      you
      grow
      past
      the
      idea
      that
      people
      who
      disagree
      with
      you
      aren #8217;t
       #8220;working
      against
      humanity #8221;.
      Good
      luck

      anything
      to
      do
      with
      you
      if
      you
      are
      pro
      someone
      who
      is
      prejudiced
      against
      nearly
      everyone
      who
      isn #8217;t
      a
      white
      rich
      man.
       #8220;
      You
      completely
      packaged
      all
      trump
      supporters
      into
      this
      comment.
       #8220;I
      never
      stated
      that
      all
      Trump
      supporters
      were
      that
      way,
      simply
      that
      the
      ones
      who
      support
      hate-rhetoric
      won't
      be
      my
      friends. #8221;
      But
      you
      literally
      said
      you
      don #8217;t
      want
      anything
      to
      do
      with
      anyone
      who
      supports
      Trump.
      ....Whatever.
      Good
      luck:)

      I
      think
      we
      could
      have
      some
      good
      discussions
      regarding
       #8220;hate
      rhetoric #8221;.
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      trump
      promotes
      hate
      at
      all.
      I
      know
      I
      don #8217;t
      promote
      it
      in
      the
      slightest....so,
      We
      disagree
      there.
      But,
      I
      appreciate
      how
      you
      don #8217;t
      shut
      people
      off
      if
      you
      disagree
      with
      them.
      I
      truly
      truly
      do.
      You #8217;re
      giving
      me
      hope
      in
      the
      reunification
      of
      our
      country.
      Thanks
      homie
      :)
      God
      bless
      you,
      keep
      that
      great
      mind
      of
      yours
      open!

      How
      do
      you
      expect
      to
      have
      a
      conversation
      with
      anyone
      when
      you
      give
      them
      questions
      in
      the
      form
      of
      absolutes
      and
      pre
      condemn
      someone
      in
       #8220;disgust #8221;
      before
      they
      even
      answer.
      Do
      you
      see
      how
      your
      shutting
      someone
      down
      you
      disagree
      with
      before
      the
      conversation
      had
      even
      begun?
      You
      imagined
      my
      possible
      answers
      and
      came
      to
      conclusions
      of
      me
      before
      even
      speaking
      with
      me.
      Do
      you
      see
      the
      problem
      here?
      I #8217;ll
      pray
      for
      you
      brother
      (or
      sister),
      and
      those
      you
      hate.
      I #8217;ll
      pray
      you
      begin
      to
      start
      loving
      your
      neighbors

      Okay.
      Yesterday
      was
      a
      busy
      day.
      So
      is
      today
      but
      I #8217;ve
      got
      a
      few
      minutes
      for
      lunch.
      I #8217;m
      giving
      you
      the
      benefit
      of
      the
      doubt
      that
      you
      won #8217;t
      get
      emotionally
      worked
      up
      and
      insult
      me.
      I #8217;ll
      attempt
      to
      have
      a
      mature
      respectful
      political
      conversation
      with
      you
      so
      you
      can
      see
      that
      disagreeing
      adults
      can
      have
      political
      discussions.
      Please
      remember,
      your
      first
      post
      above
      says
      you
      can #8217;t
      have
      a
      political
      conversation
      with
      a
      trump
      supporter
      because
      they #8217;re
      too
      emotional,
      hopefully
      you
      do
      not
      succumb
      to
      your
      own
      projections.
      :)
      Let #8217;s
      unpack
      this
      one
      point
      at
      a
      time.
      You
      originally
      asked
      me
      for
      good
      reasons
      why
      I
      support
      trump
      based
      on
      fact,
      you
      asked
      for
      policies
      that
      he
      has
      put
      in
      place
      that
      I
      agree
      with.
      I #8217;ll
      start
      with
      four
      policies
      trump
      has
      enacted.
      On
      each
      of
      the
      legislation
      I #8217;ve
      listed
      below,
      Trump
      has
      worked
      bipartisan
      with
      both
      Democrats
      and
      Republicans
      to
      pass.
      1.
      Criminal
      justice
      reform
      policy
      -
      Trump
      passed
      legislation
      that
      reduced
      life
      sentences
      for
      some
      drug
      offenders
      with
      three
      convictions,
      or
      "three
      strikes,"
      to
      25
      years.
      Another
      provision
      would
      allow
      about
      2,600
      federal
      prisoners
      sentenced
      for
      crack
      cocaine
      offenses
      before
      August
      2010
      the
      opportunity
      to
      petition
      for
      a
      reduced
      penalty.
      This
      was
      a
      needed
      policy
      and
      there
      are
      many
      more
      benefits
      than
      these
      two
      listed
      here
      that
      stem
      from
      this
      policy.
      2.
      Anti
      sex
      trafficking
      legislation.
      -
      In
      April
      2018,
      President
      Trump
      signed
      legislation
      into
      law
      to
      combat
      online
      sex
      trafficking,
      holding
      perpetrators
      accountable
      and
      ensuring
      justice
      for
      survivors.
      Last
      year,
      President
      Trump
      issued
      an
      Executive
      Order
      which
      directed
      his
      Administration
      to
      crack
      down
      on
      transnational
      criminal
      organizations
      that
      use
      human
      trafficking.
      3.
       #8220;Right
      to
      try #8221;
      -
      Dying
      Americans
      now
      have
      access
      to
      experimental
      medication
      if
      they
      so
      choose
      4.
      White
      House
      Opportunity
      and
      Revitalization
      Council.
      -
      Trump
      signed
      an
      executive
      order
      establishing
      the
      White
      House
      Opportunity
      and
      Revitalization
      Council.
      The
      council
      is
      currently
      working
      with
      predominantly
      black
      communities
      in
      low
      income
      and
      impoverished
      areas.
      The
      executive
      order
      is
      projected
      to
      attract
      investments
      into
      black
      communities
      across
      America
      of
      around
      $100
      billion
      dollars.
      These
      are
      just
      a
      few
      examples.

      Well.
      I
      see
      you #8217;ve
      posted
      in
      other
      subs
      since
      I
      answered
      you.
      Hopefully
      you
      can
      now
      be
      honest
      with
      yourself
      and
      everyone
      else
      and
      not
      say
      Trump
      supporters
      are
      out
      of
      control
      and
      refuse
      to
      have
      a
      real
      political
      Conversation.
      The
      fact
      is
      you
      refuse
      to
      do
      so.
      And
      if
      you
      try
      to
      repeat
      that
      lie
      again
      YOU
      will
      know
      deep
      down
      who
      the
      enemy
      is.
      Yourself.
      Hopefully
      we
      can
      all
      start
      to
      mend
      as
      a
      country
      soon.
      God
      bless
      you
      homie!

      Your
      answer
      here
      does
      not
      make
      your
      inconsistent

      now
      consistent.
      Just

      thanks
      providing

      learning
      your
      points

      The
      best
      way
      to
      explain
      this
      to
      leftists
      is
      to
      point
      out
      that
      minority
      regions
      would
      be
      enslaved
      by
      majority
      regions.
      Example:
      Michigan
      has
      a
      large
      base
      of
      leftist
      Muslim
      voters
      and
      is
      a
      relatively
      small
      state.
      Texas
      has
      a
      large
      base
      of
      right
      leaning
      Christian
      voters
      and
      us
      vastly
      lagger
      and
      more
      populated
      than
      Michigan.
      In
      a
      popular
      vote
      scenario,
      whatever
      Texas
      chose
      to
      enact
      as
      law
      would
      be
      forced
      upon
      all
      those
      in
      Michigan.
      The
      right
      leaning
      Christians
      would
      enslave
      the
      left
      leaning
      Muslims.
      Ask
      them
      if
      they
      would
      want
      that
      or
      if
      they
      think
      that
      is
      fair.

      Trillions?
      I #8217;m
      pretty
      sure
      it #8217;s
      only
      like
      28
      billion.
      Edit:
      below
      is
      an
      article
      that
      describes
      the
      estimated
      costs
      of
      the
      wall.
      I
      chose
      an
      article
      that
      is
      as
      biased
      against
      having
      a
      border
      wall
      as
      possible
      so
      there
      is
      no
      confusion.
      On
      the
      low
      end
      the
      wall
      would
      cost
      $8
      billion.
      On
      the
      high
      end
      $70
      billion.
      The
      trump
      admin
      quoted
      a
      cost
      of
      just
      over
      $21
      billion.
      The
      estimated
      maintenance
      per
      year
      is
      $150million
      (high
      end
      according
      to
      the
      New
      York
      Times).
      The
      amount
      the
      united
      states
      takes
      in
      taxes
      each
      year,
      their
      budget,
      is
      about
      3.5
      trillion
      dollars.
      Just
      for
      perspective,
      that #8217;s
      like
      $8
      to
      $70
      out
      of
      $35,000.
      https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/us/politics/senate-democrats-border-wall-cost-trump.html
      If
      you
      made
      (after
      taxes)
      $35k
      a
      year,
      would
      you
      be
      willing
      to
      spend
      between
      $8
      and
      $70
      to
      fix
      your
      door,
      especially
      if
      you
      knew
      people
      were
      sneaking
      in?
      Then
      pay
      fifteen
      cents
      ($0.15)
      a
      year
      to
      maintain
      it
      thereafter?
      Again,
      this
      is
      just
      for
      perspective
      at
      how
      minimal
      the
      cost
      really
      is
      in
      the
      big
      picture.
      I
      appreciate
      how
      polite
      you
      were
      to
      op
      above,
      just
      wanted
      the
      facts
      out
      there.

      you.
      I
      am
      doing
      keto
      and
      IF,
      but
      for

      me
      I
      have

      every

      and
      I #8217;m

      about
      2
      lbs
      a
      week.
      It
      didn #8217;t
      melt
      off
      like
      I
      thought,
      but
      now
      it #8217;s
      been
      3
      and
      a
      half
      months
      and
      I #8217;m
      20
      lbs
      down
      and
      feel
      great!

      Agreed.
      Those
      business
      owners
      using
      them
      for
      cheap
      labor
      are
      breaking
      the
      law
      and,
      quite
      frankly,
      being
      evil.
      But
      those
      biz
      owners
      have
      nothing
      to
      do
      with
      me
      or
      most
      of
      the
      Americans
      against
      illegal
      immigration.
      Most
      Americans
      that
      are
      against
      illegal
      immigration,
      as
      in
      the
      vast
      majority,
      are
      just
      as
      adamantly
      against
      these
      businesses
      breaking
      the
      law
      and
      abusing
      these
      poor
      people
      as
      they
      are
      opposed
      to
      illegal
      immigration
      itself.
      It
      looks
      like
      you
      and
      I
      have
      found
      common
      ground
      my
      brother
      (or
      sister).
      I
      really
      like
      that,
      and
      so
      far
      I
      like
      you.
      Thank
      you
      :)
      seriously.
      EDIT:
      you
      get
      my
      upvote
      for
      that
      honest
      opinion.
      I
      appreciate
      that.

      You
      don #8217;t
      realize
      how
      much
      we
      agree.
      The
      issues
      you
      mention
      above
      are
      what
      we
      are
      trying
      to
      change.
      We
      are
      against
      illegal
      immigration,
      against
      business
      who
      abuse
      and
      use
      illegal
      immigrants
      for
      cheap
      labor,
      and
      against
      politicians
      and
      policies
      that
      promote
      illegal
      immigration
      to
      support
      labor
      shortages.
      We
      are
      against
      policies
      and
      politicians
      who
      want
      to
      use
      cheap
      labor
      then
      deport
      them
      after
      abusing
      them
      for
      resources.
      We
      are
      also
      against
      any
      policies
      or
      procedures
      that
      allow
      for
      human
      trafficking
      and
      specifically
      the
      sexual
      abuse
      of
      women
      and
      children.
      I
      think
      your
      heart
      is
      in
      the
      right
      spot.
      You
      seem
      to
      be
      concerned
      that
      not
      having
      illegal
      immigrants
      will
      affect
      the
      market,
      I #8217;m
      sure
      prices
      on
      many
      products
      and
      services
      will
      increase.
      You
      hint
      you
      believe
      people
      that
      are
      against
      illegal
      immigration
      are
      opposed
      to
      this
      oncoming
      increase
      in
      prices.
      I
      disagree
      with
      you
      here.
      We
      are
      ready
      and
      willing
      to
      tighten
      the
      American
      belt
      to
      help
      save
      the
      victims
      of
      illegal
      immigration.
      We
      also
      do
      not
      believe
      the
      solution
      is
      to
      allow
      immigrants
      to
      enter
      our
      borders
      undetected
      and
      with
      no
      oversight.
      We
      believe
      non-supervised
      immigration
      results
      in
      detrimental
      human
      abuse
      and
      tragedy.
      This
      is
      why
      we
      are
      profoundly
      against
      illegal
      immigration.
      Also,
      reading
      everything
      you
      wrote
      above
      it
      should
      be
      easy
      to
      see
      that
      putting
      an
      absolute
      stop
      to
      illegal
      immigration
      and
      focusing
      on
      assisting
      and/or
      increasing
      Legal
      immigration
      would
      put
      a
      curb
      to
      ALL
      the
      issues
      you
      mention.
      It
      sounds
      like
      we
      want
      the
      same
      thing,
      our
      solutions
      are
      discernibly
      different,
      our
      perceived
      enemies
      are
      notably
      opposite,
      but
      we
      both
      want
      to
      stop
      the
      abuse
      of
      illegal
      immigrants
      and
      the
      American
      people
      who
      are
      also
      affected
      by
      this
      tragedy.
      Anyway
      brother
      (or
      sister),
      I
      gotta
      go...I
      just
      found
      out
      on
      Father #8217;s
      Day
      I #8217;m
      going
      to
      be
      a
      dad.
      :)
      My
      wife
      is
      asking
      me
      to
      take
      her
      out
      now
      so
      I
      gotta
      go
      and
      focus
      on
      my
      family
      for
      a
      bit.
      I #8217;m
      going
      to
      dip
      out
      of
      this
      conversation
      for
      now
      but
      I
      appreciate
      your
      good
      heart.
      Great
      conversation!
      God
      bless
      you.

      an

      The

      Almost
      my
      entire
      family
      are
      extreme
      leftists,
      my
      biological
      dad
      is
      the
      only
      conservative
      Christian.
      But
      he
      literally
      abandoned
      me
      in
      a
      park
      when
      I
      was
      a
      little
      boy,
      I
      was
      picked
      up
      off
      the
      streets
      by
      police,
      I
      was
      about
      to
      be
      put
      into
      foster
      care
      with
      strangers.
      But
      instead
      I
      was
      lucky
      and
      a
      church
      preacher
      took
      me
      in,
      tracked
      my
      mom
      down
      and
      shipped
      me
      home
      to
      her.
      My
      mom
      eventually
      married
      a
      very
      very
      wealthy
      man
      who
      claimed
      to
      be
      a
      socialist
      communist
      atheist.
      But
      he
      took
      care
      of
      me.
      Taught
      me
      how
      a
      loving
      man
      should
      be
      towards
      women,
      taught
      me
      to
      think,
      him
      and
      I
      read
      a
      book
      a
      month
      together,
      he
      traveled
      with
      me
      around
      the
      world,
      he
      sent
      me
      to
      college,
      and
      he
      invested
      in
      me.
      I
      love
      him.
      But
      I
      grew
      up,
      became
      my
      own
      man,
      weighed
      the
      options
      and
      realized
      I
      believed
      in
      God,
      truth,
      and
      in
      addition,
      I
      agreed
      with
      conservative
      ideals.
      Both
      sides
      have
      love.
      Both
      sides
      have
      hate.
      I
      talk
      with
      my
      bio
      dad
      about
      politics
      whenever
      we
      speak.
      (I
      forgave
      him)
      and
      I
      just
      don #8217;t
      talk
      about
      politics
      or
      religion
      much
      with
      my
      step
      dad,
      and
      my
      mom.
      They
      have
      some
      sort
      of
      cognitive
      dissonance
      and
      can
      get
      very
      emotionally
      angered
      when
      I
      voice
      my
      different
      views
      from
      theirs.
      But
      we
      all
      love
      each
      other.
      Even
      my
      bio
      dad
      and
      I.
      Life #8217;s
      hard
      man
      Without
      Jesus
      I #8217;d
      be
      dead.
      Literally.
      But
      life
      is
      good.

      But
      I #8217;m
      in
      a
      rather
      large
      city.
      I #8217;m
      a
      conservative
      Christian.
      But
      remember.
      There
      is
      love
      and
      hate
      on
      both
      sides
      of
      politics.
      There
      are
      true
      TRUE
      Christians
      on
      both
      sides
      too.
      And
      that #8217;s
      where
      the
      battle
      lines
      are
      truly
      drawn.

      You
      know,
      I
      was
      the
      first
      one
      to
      post
      this
      to
      pics
      a
      week
      ago
      but
      it
      was
      removed
      by
      mods
      because
      it
      was
      a
      screenshot.
      So
      I
      cropped
      it
      and
      reposted
      it
      today.
      Didn #8217;t
      know
      anyone
      had
      posted
      (reposted)
      this
      since
      then.
      But
      whatever.
      I
      hope
      people
      liked
      the
      other
      posts
      that
      were
      uploaded
      a
      few
      days
      ago
      after
      mine
      was
      removed
      and
      I
      hope
      people
      like

      Have

      ever
      heard
      of
      the

       #8220;Nova #8221;
      it
      was
      an
      American
      car.
      When

      tried
      to
      market
      it
      in
      Mexico
      it
      became
      a
      laughing
      stock.
      Turns
      out
      No
      Va
      means
       #8220;No
      Go #8221;
      as
      in

      won #8217;t
      go.
      A

      It
      was

      a

      This

      of
      the

      placenta
      in
      the
      US

      a
       #8220;gross #8221;
      connotation
      to
      their

      which
      is
      supposed
      to
      make
      you

      I #8217;ll
      repost
      what
      I
      said
      above.
       gt;
      Have
      you
      ever
      heard
      of
      the
      car
       #8220;Nova #8221;
      it
      was
      an
      American
      car.
      When
      they
      tried
      to
      market
      it
      in
      Mexico
      it
      became
      a
      laughing
      stock.
      Turns
      out
      No
      Va
      means
       #8220;No
      Go #8221;
      as
      in
      it
      won #8217;t
      go.
      A
      car
      that
      won #8217;t
      go.
      It
      was
      a
      good
      name
      in
      the
      states
      but
      a
      crappy
      design
      for
      Mexico.
       gt;
      This
      soap
      is
      being
      marketed
      here
      in
      the
      states,
      the
      meaning
      of
      the
      word
      placenta
      in
      the
      US
      gives
      a
       #8220;gross #8221;
      connotation
      to
      their
      soap,
      which
      is
      supposed
      to
      make
      you
      feel
      clean.
       gt;
      This
      makes

      Do
      you
      think
      this
      would
      sell
      well
      in
      the

      If
      it
      might
      have
      a
      hard
      time
      selling
      due

      I

      it #8217;s
      a

      in

      it
      has

      in

      to

      the
      least.

      My
      wife #8217;s
      from
      the
      Philippines.
      I
      know
      exactly
      what
      this
      means,
      in
      the
      Philippines
      and
      in
      the
      US.
      I
      also
      know
      that
      the
      majority
      of
      US
      consumers
      will
      be
      turned
      off
      by
      this.
      I
      hate
      to
      tell
      you
      but
      eating
      your
      own
      placenta
      does
      not
      make
      you
      more
      cultured
      than
      others.
      I #8217;m
      not
      saying
      it #8217;s
      bad
      to
      eat
      your
      placenta
      but
      I
      am
      saying
      it
      doesn #8217;t
      make
      me
      a
      redneck
      for
      having
      the
      clarity
      to
      see
      this
      is
      a
      crappy
      design
      for
      the
      US
      market.
      Look,
      how
      about
      you
      go
      find
      some
      nice
      placenta
      soap
      and
      give
      it
      a
      whirl,
      let
      me
      know
      how
      it
      goes.
      And
      if
      you
      happen
      to
      eat
      your
      placenta
      anytime
      soon
      feel
      free
      to
      let
      me
      know
      how
      that
      goes
      too.

      Bro.
      It #8217;s
      a
      crappy
      design.
      It
      won #8217;t
      sell
      well
      in
      the
      states
      with
      the
      name
      placenta.
      People
      don #8217;t
      want
      to
      wash
      themselves
      with
      a
      placenta.
      It #8217;s
      just
      the
      truth.
      You
      might
      enjoy
      it.
      A
      few
      others
      might
      like
      rubbing
      themselves
      in
      a
      placenta.
      But
      most
      Americans
      will
      be
      grossed
      out
      by
      this.
      I
      understand
      the
      other
      meaning
       #8220;a
      combination
      of
      herbs #8221;
      but
      that #8217;s
      not
      a
      known
      meaning
      for
      this
      word
      in
      America.
      It #8217;s
      a
      crappy
      design
      for
      the
      US.
      Lol.
      But
      hey,
      thanks
      for
      entertaining
      me
      this
      morning.
      :)
      and
      I
      really
      mean
      that.
      Not
      trying
      to
      be
      mean.

      negative
      or
      calling
      out
      someone #8217;s
      new
      posting.
      This
      is
      how
      you
      fill
      your
      time?
      You #8217;re
      literally
      the
      r/crappydesign

      Here
      he
      goes

      FYI:
      this
      guy
      is
      such
      a
      funny
      troll
      who
      just
      tries

      He #8217;s
      harmless
      but
      very
      entertaining
      if
      you
      start
      watching
      him.
      Enjoy

      Hey
      u/perm_suspended.
      Don #8217;t
      worry
      about
      this
      guy,
      he #8217;s
      a
      troll.
      Go
      through
      his
      history,
      he
      either
      asks
      mods
      to
      delete
      everything
      or
      he
      is
      saying
      something
      negative.
      It #8217;s
      just
      his
      MO.
      Just
      thought
      you #8217;d

      you

      God
      is
      omnipotent.
      You #8217;re
      right,
      he
      doesn #8217;t
      have
      to
      struggle.
      So
      He
      became
      a
      man
      so
      we
      could
      relate
      to
      Him
      and
      He
      could
      relate
      to
      us,
      and
      so
      we
      could
      have
      a
      true
      relationship
      with
      Him.
      And
      He
      did
      struggle,
      the
      ultimate
      struggle.
      And
      He
      accomplished
      quite
      a
      lot,
      the
      salvation
      of
      all
      mankind,
      if
      you
      accept
      Him.

      Ah.
      It

      the

      shirt
      is
      the

      the

      shirt.
      You
      can
      also
      tell
      because
      the
      young
      boy
      has
      hairless
      legs
      and
      the
      guy
      on
      her
      back
      has
      hairy
      legs
      like

      should.

      Fun
      fact:
      The
      word
      gargoyle
      comes
      from
      the
      word
      gargle
      which
      comes
      from
      the
      French
      word
      for
      throat,
      gorge
      or
      gargouille.
      Gargoyles
      are
      used
      as
      water
      drains
      and
      water
      flows
      through
      the
       #8220;throat #8221;
      and
      shoots
      out
      the
      mouth.
      If
      water
      doesn #8217;t

      if
      she
      wants
      to
      post
      it
      here
      herself.

      great
      piece
      of
      work
      and

      It #8217;s
      a
      crosspost.

      posts

      on

      a

      messed
      up
      the

      Ha.

      I

      I
      was
      an
      atheist
      who
      was
      called
      by
      Christ
      to
      be
      a
      Christian
      in
      the
      Catholic
      Church.
      Personally.
      Very
      much
      in
      the
      flesh
      and
      the
      spirit.
      Anyone
      hearing
      the
      call
      to
      Christ
      in
      a
      Catholic
      way,
      keep
      your
      ears
      to
      hear.
      Not
      saying
      any
      other
      path
      is
      wrong
      or
      bad,
      just
      saying
      neither
      is
      the
      path
      via
      Catholicism.
      We
      all
      have
      our
      own
      calling
      and
      gifts.
      Pursue
      God,
      however
      you
      may
      be
      called.

      Why
      did
      you
      immediately
      respond
      with
      negativity?
      The
      guy
      who
      said
       #8220;50/50 #8221;
      was
      just
      trying
      to
      be
      a
      part
      of
      the
      conversation.
      He
      did
      nothing
      bad
      or
      negative.
      I
      was
      being
      nice.
      Then
      you
      jumped
      in
      and
      turned
      the
      course
      of
      this
      towards
      negativity.
      And
      now
      you #8217;re
      complaining
      about
      it.
      Perhaps
      consider
      self
      reflection
      before
      condemning
      others.
      :)
      Hope
      you
      have
      a
      good
      day.

      Wait.
      So
      you
      go
      around
      saying
      unwarranted
      negative
      things
      to
      strangers
      online,
      you
      read
      people #8217;s
      history,
      you
      stalk
      their
      posts
      and
      ghost
      edits...like
      a
      creep.
      But
      the
      second
      someone
      says
      something
      negative
      back
      to
      you
      you
      cry?
      And
      call
      them
      a
      creep
      while
      crying?
      That #8217;s
      entertaining.
      Lol.
      Good
      luck
      with
      that,
      son
      ;)
      Edit.
      And
      you #8217;re
      wrong,
      I
      wrote
      all
      that
      specifically
      for
      you.
      Not
      for
      anyone
      else.
      But
      I
      thought
      better
      of
      it
      and
      figured
      it
      was
      a
      waste
      of
      effort
      so
      deleted
      most
      of
      it.
      Little
      did
      I
      know
      you
      were
      a
      creep.

      All
      due
      respect,
      and
      I
      mean
      that,
      but
      you
      would
      be
      mistaken,
      Mr
      (or
      Mrs)
      Nekro.
      I
      was
      called
      in
      a
      very
      Catholic
      way.
      No
      mistaking
      what
      Jesus
      was
      asking
      of
      me.
      And
      just
      so
      you
      understand,
      I
      don #8217;t
      believe
      that
      Catholicism
      is
      the
      only
      way.
      I
      think
      He
      calls
      many
      people
      in
      many
      different
      ways,
      I
      think
      if
      you
      have
      Christ
      as
      your
      center
      and
      you #8217;re
      following
      His
      Life
      then
      you #8217;re
      on
      the
      path
      of
      His
      Way.
      However,
      His
      plans
      for
      me
      required
      strict
      Catholic
      direction.
      I
      didn #8217;t
      understand
      at
      first,
      but
      I
      understand
      a
      bit
      more
      now.
      Are
      you
      claiming
      to
      understand
      all
      of
      Jesus #8217;
      ways
      and
      all
      His
      plans
      for
      each
      individual?

      No
      malice
      taken,
      God
      bless
      my
      brother
      or
      sister.
      If
      Jesus
      calls
      a
      person
      in
      any
      particular
      way
      is
      he
      showing
      favoritism?
      There #8217;s
      no
      favoritism
      in
      being
      called
      to
      Catholicism
      any
      more
      than
      there
      is
      to
      being
      called
      to
      being
      a
      doorman,
      or
      a
      Baptist,
      or
      a
      CEO,
      or
      a
      street
      cleaner.
      My
      question
      is,
      are
      you
      assuming
      the
      thoughts
      of
      our
      Lord.
      Are
      you
      truly
      brave
      enough
      to
      say
      you
      know
      what
      our
      Lord
      would
      or
      would
      not
      do,
      or
      how
      He
      would
      or
      would
      not
      call
      me?
      Are
      you
      taking
      the
      authority
      to
      speak
      for
      Christ?
      I
      almost
      don #8217;t
      want
      to
      ask
      you,
      my
      brother,
      as
      I
      don #8217;t
      want
      you
      to
      say
      something
      to
      get
      you
      in
      above
      your
      head.

      Thank
      you
      brother.
      I
      don #8217;t
      want
      you
      scaring
      off
      any
      children
      called
      to
      Catholicism.
      As
      it
      is
      a
      calling
      of
      Christ #8217;s.
      It #8217;s
      how
      He
      called
      me.
      It #8217;s
      not
      a
      different
      belief
      than
      you.
      We
      read
      the
      same
      Word,
      if
      you
      do
      read
      His
      Word.
      If
      anything
      it #8217;s
      maybe
      a
      more
      different,
      perhaps
      a
      more
      strict
      call
      to
      worship.
      Not
      saying
      there #8217;s
      any
      way
      to
      worship
      that #8217;s
      above
      or
      below
      any
      other.
      Just
      saying
      it #8217;s
      a
      very
      particular
      and
      guided

      It
      works
      for

      people.

      reality.
      Better
      to

      with
      it.
      I
      had
      an
      abortion
      with
      my
      ex.
      These
      pictures
      brought
      us
      to
      repentance.
      It
      helped
      it
      hit
      home.
      Just
      an
      FYI,
      you #8217;re
      talking
      to
      the
      target
      audience.
      Edit:
      and
      turn
      them
      off
      from
      what?
      Having
      another
      abortion?
      ...great.

      It
      may
      turn
      some
      off,
      but
      it
      will
      turn
      some
      on.
      It
      turned
      me
      and
      the
      mother
      of
      our

      And
      repentance.

      Agreed.
      You
      should
      gauge
      the
      situation
      the
      best
      you
      can,
      however
      that #8217;s
      a
      little
      more
      difficult
      to
      do
      with
      a
      billboard.
      And
      again,
      there #8217;s
      nothing
      negative
      or
      graphic
      about
      a
      living
      healthy
      baby
      fetus.
