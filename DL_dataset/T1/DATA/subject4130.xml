      The
      other
      day
      my
      arm
      had
      radiating
      pain
      shooting
      from
      my
      fingertips
      down
      to
      my
      elbow.
      I
      perked
      up,
      hoping
      for
      blood
      poisoning
      (original
      point
      of
      pain
      was
      a
      cut).
      Nope.
      Just
      a
      damaged
      tendon,
      supposedly,
      according
      to
      google.
      Fuck
      me.

      I
      always
      fantasize
      in
      a
      shooter
      scenario,
      I
      demand
      to
      be
      shot
      and
      then
      die
      on
      the
      spot.
      I
      dunno
      if
      it
      will
      actually
      play
      out
      that
      way,
      but
      I
      wanna
      see
      my
      reaction.
      I
      don't
      secretly
      wish
      it
      would
      happen
      so
      I
      could
      reveal
      myself
      a
      hero,
      I
      just
      want
      to
      see
      if
      I
      had
      the
      chance
      I'd
      take
      it
      to
      be
      dead.

      Wouldn't
      it
      be
      better
      to
      just
      go
      after

      Damn,
      you're
      right.
      I'll
      be
      waiting
      for
      the
      moment
      to
      speak
      up
      until
      the
      moment
      never
      comes
      and
      I'm
      kicking
      myself
      cause
      everyone
      was
      shot
      but
      me.

      No,
      because
      I
      can't
      access
      guns.
      I
      don't
      know
      how
      I
      could
      possibly
      get
      a
      gun.
      And
      you're
      probably
      right
      anyway.
      I'll
      want
      to
      die
      until
      those
      5min
      of
      self

      kick
      in,
      and
      then
      I'll
      want
      to
      die
      again
      when
      it's
      over.

      I
      have
      a
      bunch
      of
      burn
      scars
      and
      hands
      down
      the

      was
      not

      not

      the
      scars...
      Scar
      tissue
      doesn't

      so
      I'm
      fucking
      hot
      all

      feel
      overheated
      at
      a
      mildly
      warm
      temperature.
      Not
      really
      a
      consequence
      you
      think
      about
      beforehand.

      I
      went
      to
      their
      website
      and
      they
      say
      there's
      a
      global
      helium
      shortage.
      Edit:
      ok
      I
      found
      another
      part
      of
      the
      site
      that
      does
      seem
      to
      offer
      small
      tanks.
      Do
      you
      think
      a
      small
      tank
      would
      be
      enough?
      Edit
      edit:
      a
      lot
      of
      the
      reviews
      claim
      tanks
      were
      empty
      or
      not
      all
      the
      way
      full.
      Seems
      disappointingly
      unreliable.

      Similar
      happened
      to
      my
      husky!
      My
      cousin
      was
      skipping
      rocks
      on
      some
      floating
      ice,
      she
      observed
      the
      rocks
      skittering
      and
      jumped
      to
      test
      the
      ice
      herself.
      Fell
      right
      through.
      Didn't
      see
      any
      side
      effects
      until
      she
      got
      stuck
      on
      a
      log
      this
      summer,
      afraid
      to
      jump
      into
      the
      water.
      She'll
      still
      wade,
      but
      won't
      jump.

      Hard
      to
      describe.
      A
      lot
      of
      1-2"
      burns.
      The
      worst
      are
      like...
      5x3"
      maybe.
      It
      was
      after
      those
      bigger
      ones
      when
      I
      immediately
      noticed
      overheating.
      And
      that's
      true.
      I
      was
      in
      a
      "freezing
      cold"
      room
      everyone
      was
      complaining
      about,
      but
      I
      quite
      enjoyed
      the
      temp.

      I
      think
      it
      depends
      on
      the
      3
      yr
      old.
      I
      remember
      when
      I
      was
      a
      little
      girl,
      I
      was
      SUPER
      self
      conscious
      being
      naked
      around
      adults.
      At
      this
      age,
      a
      kid
      should
      be
      given
      privacy
      and
      not
      have
      to
      experience
      being
      naked
      around
      any
      adult.
      If
      the
      kid
      didn't
      give
      a
      shit,
      she's
      still
      too
      young
      to
      care
      so
      it
      doesn't
      matter.
      If
      the
      kid
      is
      embarrassed,
      op
      shouldn't
      have
      bathed
      her.
      People
      are
      missing
      the
      point.
      The
      kid
      is
      the
      one
      you
      should
      look
      to,
      not
      the
      parents'
      opinion,
      unless
      they
      are
      specifically
      basing
      it
      off
      of
      their
      kid's
      reaction.

      we
      all
      wanna

      A
      kid
      from
      my
      high
      school
      posted
      asking
      for
      prayers
      and
      good
      vibes
      for
      his
      surgery.
      That
      was
      his
      final
      post.
      He
      died
      in
      surgery.

      They
      started

      sometime

      The
      only
      experience
      I've
      had
      with
      dmt
      was
      this
      girl
      that
      came
      into
      the
      psych
      ward
      tripping
      balls.
      She
      was
      fucked
      up,
      man.
      Her
      fingernails
      said
      420,
      and
      she
      came
      in
      on
      4/21.
      She
      needed
      a
      1-1
      sitter
      because
      she
      wandered
      into
      other
      people's
      rooms
      and
      would
      just
      start
      touching
      people.
      She
      made
      no
      sense,
      couldn't
      sleep,
      couldn't
      eat,
      was
      in
      her
      own
      world
      for
      2
      more
      days
      straight.
      Talking
      to
      herself,
      singing
      and
      dancing
      and
      wandering
      around
      speaking
      gibberish.
      On
      the
      third
      day
      she
      started
      coming
      down,
      but
      was
      still
      out
      of
      it.
      That's
      when
      she
      muttered
      about
      tripping
      on
      dmt,
      then
      would
      scream
      like
      a
      psycho
      about
      how
      much
      pain
      she
      was
      in
      and
      call
      her
      mom
      begging
      and
      sobbing
      for
      relief.
      She
      apparently
      had
      the
      worst
      hangover
      in
      the
      world.
      I
      was
      like
      damnnn,
      imma
      not
      try
      that
      stuff
      ever.
      Maybe
      after
      4
      days
      she
      was
      finally
      aware
      of
      her
      surroundings.
      And
      she
      came
      in
      the
      day
      AFTER
      4/20
      so
      she
      was
      tripping
      for
      like
      5
      days
      straight.

      Eh,
      I
      think
      it's
      a
      personal
      thing.
      If
      someone
      believes
      in
      prayer
      and
      receives
      prayer,
      that
      will
      be
      a
      different
      result
      than
      someone
      who
      doesn't
      believe
      and
      is
      prayed
      for.
      That
      study
      sounded
      pretty
      random,
      the
      people
      receiving
      prayer
      were
      not
      specifically
      asking
      for
      it.
      I
      think
      that
      makes
      a
      difference

      Really

      Or
      anytime
      I've
      scratched
      near
      a
      needle
      site
      after
      having
      blood
      taken.
      And
      also
      how
      careful
      they
      are
      to
      make
      sure
      the
      site
      is
      clean,
      because
      on
      a
      microscopic
      level
      the
      hole
      that's
      left
      is
      huge.
      Imagine
      all
      the
      bacteria
      that
      would
      love
      to
      snuggle
      up
      in
      there.

      sick

      would
      be

      blow
      my

      just
      for
      the
      sake
      of
      stopping
      the
      dreams.
      Being
      alive
      sucks
      enough,
      the
      fact
      there's
      no
      relief
      in
      sleep
      is
      agony.

      Or
      so
      terrifying
      you
      wake
      up
      screaming.
      People
      apologize

      trapped
      in
      a

      they

      I
      was

      "Natural"
      sex
      is
      considered
      as
      such.
      As
      in,
      no
      assplay.
      I
      think.
      My
      hs
      moral
      theology
      teacher
      proclaimed
      any
      sex
      was
      moral
      sex
      as
      long
      as
      it
      was
      in
      a
      marriage
      and
      the
      man
      creampies
      the
      woman
      in
      the
      end.
      But
      I
      think
      he
      was
      justifying
      his
      own
      depraved
      sex
      habits
      as
      long
      as
      he
      finished
      in
      his
      wife.
      Tsk,
      tsk.

      Well,
      in
      your
      most
      direct
      quote,
      the
      dude
      was
      sleeping
      with
      his
      brother's

      The

      is
      that
      he
      implied
      God
      was
      dead
      when
      it
      was
      Jesus
      who
      died
      on
      the
      cross.
      I
      think
      your
      years
      of
      catholic
      school
      didn't

      was

      Hmmm.
      I
      was
      excited
      about
      meat
      pocket
      guy,
      cos
      I've
      done
      something
      similar.
      Then
      I
      read
      all
      the
      disgusted
      comments.
      Maybe
      my
      therapist
      is
      right
      about
      my
      "mental
      illness".
      A
      lot
      of
      my
      sessions
      are
      about
      how
      I
      feel
      like
      nothings
      wrong
      with
      me
      and
      I'm
      just
      lazy
      and
      unmotivated.
      Especially
      since
      one
      of
      my
      residential
      stays
      recommended
      a
      service
      dog,
      so
      we
      paid
      $$$
      to
      train
      a
      service
      dog,
      and
      people
      judge
      the
      fuck
      out
      of
      me
      when
      I
      take
      her
      anywhere.
      Then
      I
      just
      feel
      like
      a
      faking
      faker
      :(

      His
      father
      or
      some
      guy
      was
      like,
      have
      sex
      with
      your
      brothers
      wife
      so
      she
      can
      bear
      a
      son
      for
      him.
      And
      instead
      he
      pulled
      out
      cos
      he
      didn't
      want
      to
      give
      his
      brother
      a

      I
      felt
      like
      I
      was
      dying
      once,
      didn't
      state
      it
      out
      loud.
      Just
      kept
      mumbling
      that
      I
      felt
      like
      shit,
      just
      don't
      feel
      good.
      Nobody
      took
      me
      seriously
      til
      they
      tried
      to
      get
      me
      to
      walk
      to
      another
      room
      and
      I
      almost
      fell
      the
      moment
      I
      tried
      to
      stand.
      They
      sat
      me
      down
      and
      took
      my
      blood
      pressure,
      it
      had
      bottomed
      out
      and
      they
      rushed
      me
      back
      to
      the
      er.

      I
      never
      made
      that
      statement
      because
      I
      was
      too
      close
      to
      dying
      to
      speak.

      One
      time
      I
      was
      being
      wheeled
      in
      a
      stretcher
      to
      a
      psych
      hospital.
      They
      opened
      the
      door
      to
      let
      me
      in,
      and
      some
      dude
      charged
      the
      fuck
      out
      and
      grabbed
      the
      stretcher
      and
      said
      he
      needed
      to
      save
      me.
      A
      bunch
      of
      people
      grabbed
      him
      to
      yank
      him
      off
      of
      me.
      My
      paramedic
      was
      friggin
      pregnant
      trying
      to
      defend
      me
      lol.
      He
      knocked
      a
      hole
      in
      the
      wall
      with
      the
      doorknob,
      the
      patchwork
      was
      like
      a
      visible
      souvenir
      of
      my
      experience.

      You've
      gotta
      be
      a
      man,
      because
      I
      hope
      no
      woman
      out
      there
      is
      flushing
      their
      sanitary
      products.
      Also,
      the
      question
      isn't
      really
      about
      life
      beginning
      at
      conception,
      most
      medical
      texts
      agree
      to
      this
      "idiotic"
      fact.
      It's
      about
      whether
      this
      life
      deserves
      human
      rights
      or
      not
      that
      is
      the
      question.

      I
      remember
      when
      my
      grandma
      shattered
      the
      coffee
      pot
      and
      I
      stepped
      on
      a
      piece
      of
      glass.
      It
      kept
      hurting
      despite
      no
      glass
      being
      in
      the
      wound.
      Turns
      out
      the
      glass
      had
      slid
      inside
      to
      the
      left.
      I
      had
      to
      slowly
      push
      and
      slide
      it
      out
      from
      under
      my
      skin.
      Yuck.

      I
      always
      come
      to
      that
      same
      realization...
      even
      if
      my
      arms
      were
      miraculously
      scar
      free,
      I'd
      just
      work
      on
      fucking
      them
      up
      all
      over
      again.
