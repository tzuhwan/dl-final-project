      Why
      is
      that
      so
      bad?
      It
      looks
      like
      there
      are
      nice
      parks
      and
      ponds
      between
      the
      buildings.
      And
      there #8217;s
      probably
      ground
      level
      retail
      in
      those
      buildings
      too.

      Well
      they
      should
      vote
      for
      a
      political

      that
      promises
      to
      change

      in
      that

      "This
      week,
      TV
      Ontario
      personality
      Steve
      Paikin
      was
      accused
      by
      businesswoman
      and
      politician
      Sarah
      Thomson
      of
      inappropriate
      conduct.
      Both
      are
      friendly
      acquaintances
      of
      many
      years,
      Steve
      a
      perfect
      gentleman,
      and
      Sarah
      a
      reformed
      aventuriere.
      I
      believe
      she
      leads
      a
      conventional
      married
      life
      now,
      but
      when
      I
      first
      met
      her
      nearly
      20
      years
      ago
      she
      was
      magnificently
      concupiscent,
      and
      in
      large
      groups,
      such
      as
      a
      crowded
      party
      at
      the
      home
      of
      my
      delightful
      and
      talented
      colleague
      Christie
      Blatchford,
      Sarah
      candidly
      volunteered
      that
      she
      was
      unsure
      if
      she
      had
      slept
      with
      various
      of
      the
      other
      men
      who
      appeared.
      She
      offered
      to
      do
      me
      if
      I
      would
      give
      her
      an
      interview
      and
      I
      declined
      but
      commended
      her
      on
      her
      initiative."
      Ok,
      how
      is
      this
      not
      the
      headline
      instead
      of
      the
      "peoplekind"
      bs?

      With
      such
      a
      small
      electorate
      (1000),
      it
      sounds
      like
      people
      are
      voting
      passionately
      towards
      the
      causes
      they
      care
      deeply
      about
      (guns,
      religion).
      It
      might
      not
      be
      what
      you
      seem
      to
      care
      about
      (net
      neutrality)
      but
      it
      somewhat
      egotistical
      to
      think
      that
      -your-
      important
      issue
      is
      so
      much
      more
      imprortant
      than
      the
      issues
      that
      these
      people
      care
      about.
      Honestly
      net
      neutrality
      probably
      won #8217;t
      effect
      the
      guns
      and
      religions
      type
      people
      one
      bit.

      The

      is,
      college-aged
      kids
      now
      might

      back
      fondly
      on

      part
      of
      their
      childhood.
      But
      college-aged
      kids
      then
      probably
      could
      not

      The
      thing
      is
      that
      margins
      matter.
      If
      the
      Republican
      wins
      a
      district
      by
      +30%,
      she
      spends
      the
      next
      2
      years
      pandering
      to
      her
      conservative
      base
      to
      ward
      off
      a
      primary
      challenger
      next
      time.
      If
      that
      same
      district
      swings
      to
      +3%
      Republican,
      she
      starts
      worrying
      more
      about
      the
      Democratic
      challenger
      than
      the
      primary
      opponent
      and
      may
      adjust
      votes
      accordingly.
      That's
      why
      the
      PA
      election
      was
      so
      huge.
      It
      wasn't
      so
      much
      that
      a
      district
      flipped
      (although
      that
      doesn't
      hurt).
      But
      going
      from
      +18%
      GOP
      to
      +/-
      0%
      GOP
      (regardless
      of
      the
      coin
      flip
      result)
      sends
      a
      huge
      message
      to
      everyone
      in
      congress.

      Still
      seems
      to
      me
      like
      1994
      (Newt
      Gingrich
      massively
      winning
      over
      congress
      that
      would
      last
      until
      the
      rest
      of
      Clinton's
      administration
      and
      leading
      to
      impeachment)
      and
      2006
      (following
      Bush's
      re-election
      and
      slide
      in
      popularity,
      Dems
      retake
      congress
      in
      force
      and
      stop
      any
      further
      legislative
      action
      from
      the
      GOP)
      both
      seem
      like
      more
      monumental
      elections.

      Sorry
      didn't
      realize
      you
      were
      using
      a
      translator.
      It's
      one
      of
      those
      words
      that
      people
      use
      to
      sound
      fancy
      and
      sophisticated
      but
      it
      comes
      across
      as
      trying
      to
      show
      off.
      You
      could
      have
      just
      said
      "many"
      and
      it
      would
      have
      the
      exact
      same
      meaning.
      I'm
      sure
      there
      are
      similar
      examples
      in
      your
      language
      as
      well.

      It's
      actually
      not
      that
      dumb,
      in
      theory.
      Someone
      earning
      $100,000
      in
      NY
      and
      CA
      will
      pay
      less
      federal
      taxes
      than
      someone
      living
      in
      TX,
      all
      else
      being
      equal,
      because
      the
      NY
      and
      CA
      people
      can
      deduct
      their
      state
      taxes.
      So
      obviously
      the
      NY
      and
      CA
      guys
      pay
      more
      in
      total
      income
      tax,
      but
      from
      the
      federal
      government's
      perspective,
      they're
      getting
      less
      from
      the
      NY
      and
      CA
      guys,
      so
      the
      TX
      guys
      are
      "subsidizing"
      them
      by
      paying
      more.
      Not
      saying
      I
      agree
      and
      there's
      certainly
      more
      to
      it,
      but
      the
      argument
      isn't
      without
      a
      logical
      core.

      It's
      foolish
      to
      assume
      D's
      will
      hold
      all
      of
      their
      seats.
      One
      very
      unfortunate
      fact
      for
      the
      D's
      is
      that
      a
      lot
      of
      their
      seats
      up
      for
      re-election
      are
      in
      very
      red
      states.
      Such
      as:
      West
      Virginia
      -
      voted
      for
      Trump
      by
      a
      margin
      of
      42%
      (!)
      Indiana
      -
      voted
      for
      Trump
      by
      a
      margin
      of
      19%
      Montana
      -
      voted
      for
      Trump
      by
      a
      margin
      of
      20%
      It
      will
      be
      almost
      impossible
      to
      hold
      onto
      that
      WV
      Senate
      seat,
      and
      the
      R's
      also
      have
      the
      advantage
      of
      many
      of
      their
      defending
      seats
      being
      in
      deep
      red
      states
      (Wyoming,
      Mississippi
      (both
      seats),
      Tennessee,
      Utah,
      Nebraska).
      I
      think
      D's
      will
      definitely
      make
      net
      gains
      in
      the
      Senate,
      but
      it
      will
      be
      extremely
      hard
      for
      them
      to
      take
      a
      majority
      given
      the
      states
      in
      play.

      Oh
      god,
      Ice
      Cube
      is
      being
      brought
      into
      this
      mess.
      I
      thought
      this
      season
      was
      wild
      enough
      without
      resorting
      to
      celebrity
      cameos.

      I
      like
      the
      specificity
      of
      a
      precise
      tradeable
      security
      name
      vs
      the
      name
      of
      a
      technology.
      Like
      saying
      AAPL
      vs
      Apple.
      But
      I
      see
      your
      point
      too.

      what
      they
      did
      was
      significantly
      worse
      too.
      You

      No,
      the
      category
      is
      more
      specific
      than
      "shitty
      things
      to
      do".
      The
      category
      is
      "men
      who
      have
      reported
      allegations
      of
      sexual
      misconduct".
      There
      is
      definitely
      a
      huge
      disparity
      within
      that
      category,
      but
      they
      are
      both
      members.

      No,
      I'm
      saying
      that
      saying
      "Trudeau
      is
      literally
      Weinstein"
      is
      on
      the
      same
      level
      as
      saying
      "Trump
      is
      basically
      Hitler".

      Exactly.
      And
      what
      makes
      it
      worse
      for
      Trudeau
      is
      how
      sanctimonious
      he's
      been
      on
      the
      issue.
      He
      would
      have
      fired
      cabinet
      ministers
      if
      the
      same
      allegations
      about
      them
      were
      to
      have
      come
      up.

      I
      don't
      know
      but
      they
      do.
      Just
      making
      the
      point
      that
      comparing
      someone
      who
      commits
      a
      minor
      version
      of
      a
      wrongdoing
      to
      the
      worst
      historical
      example
      of
      that
      wrongdoing
      isn't
      exclusive
      to
      one
      side
      of
      the
      political
      spectrum.
      So
      the
      article
      that
      this
      post
      is
      linked
      to
      isn't
      outside
      of
      normal
      discourse.

      It's
      a
      broad
      category,
      for
      sure.
      We
      could
      narrow
      it
      further
      an
      say
      "substantiated
      allegations"
      and
      that
      removes
      your
      example.
      But
      still,
      both
      Trudeau
      and
      Weinstein
      are
      alleged
      by
      credible
      sources
      to
      have
      engaged
      in
      inappropriate
      sexual
      behaviors.
      There
      is
      a
      hundred
      miles
      between
      them
      in
      terms
      of
      seriousness.
      But
      it
      doesn't
      automatically
      dismiss
      the
      point
      of
      the
      article
      that
      is
      being
      linked.
      Also,
      Harvey
      Weinstein
      never
      tried
      to
      brand
      himself
      as
      a
      champion
      for
      women
      in
      order
      to
      advance
      his
      career,
      so
      Trudeau
      should
      arguably
      be
      held
      to
      a
      higher
      standard.

      100%.
      Just
      trying
      to
      point
      out
      that
      the
      article
      isn't
      entirely
      without
      merit
      just
      because
      someone
      used
      the
      words
      "Trudeau"
      and
      "Weinstein"
      in
      the
      same
      sentence.
      We
      can
      all
      agree
      they
      are
      totally
      different
      situations,
      but
      it
      doesn't
      necessarily
      exclude
      comparing
      and
      contrasting.

      I
      don't
      think
      anyone
      argues
      against
      that
      the
      left
      is
      more
      collectivist,
      but
      this
      cartoon
      doesn't
      really
      explain
      why
      that's
      better.
      I
      could
      do
      a
      similar
      one
      where
      the
      right
      guy
      says
      "Let
      me
      keep
      what
      I
      earned"
      and
      the
      left
      one
      says
      "Give
      me
      what
      you
      earned",
      and
      it's
      essentially
      the
      same
      principal
      just
      cast
      in
      different
      lights.

      Sure
      but
      they
      cast
      a
      young
      guy
      originally
      so
      he
      would
      look
      his
      age
      in
      the
      1955
      scenes.
      So
      in
      the
      1985
      "present"
      scenes,
      they
      were
      already
      trying
      to
      make
      him
      look
      older,
      which
      is
      why
      he
      looks
      almost
      comically
      old
      (like
      50
      years
      older
      than
      the
      actor)
      in
      the
      2015
      scenes.

      The

      divides
      powers
      between
      the
      federal
      and
      provincial
      governments.
      All
      powers
      that
      municipalities
      have
      are
      those
      that
      the
      provinces
      have
      delegated
      to
      them.
      So
      everything
      at
      the
      municipal
      level
      is
      just
      a
      provincial
      authority
      that's
      been
      delegated
      to
      them.

      Yeah
      I've
      notice
      that
      too.
      Questions
      like
      "where
      are
      we
      going",
      "who
      is
      that"
      or
      "what
      is
      that"
      tend
      to
      produce
      very
      short,
      2-3
      word
      answer.
      The
      answer
      to
      "why"
      is
      guaranteed
      at
      least
      somewhat
      of
      a
      longer
      sentence.

      many
      people,
      I
      have
      an
      annual

      So
      it's
      not
      like
      instead
      of
      cooking
      for
      1
      hour,
      I
      could
      just
      work
      1
      hour
      and
      get
      paid.
      That's
      why
      it's
      a

      really
      bad
      after
      jumping
      off
      at
      high
      speed.
      Had
      to
      go
      to
      the
      ER
      after
      (took
      a

      there
      not
      an

      Thank
      god
      I
      was
      wearing
      a
      helmet.
      When
      I
      called
      their
      support
      line
      all
      they
      did
      was
      refund
      my
      $1.50
      or
      whatever.
      I
      kept
      trying
      to
      tell
      them
      there's
      a
      death
      trap
      on

      they
      could

      In
      a
      fairly
      moderated
      debate,
      any
      functioning
      adult
      destroys
      Cruz.
      "Why
      do
      you
      keep
      supporting
      a
      President
      that
      suggested
      your
      Cuban
      father
      was
      involved
      in
      the
      JFK
      assassination?",
      "You
      support
      a
      president
      that
      made
      a
      career
      out
      of
      claiming
      a
      president
      isn't
      US-born,
      but
      yourself
      weren't
      born
      in
      the
      US
      while
      running
      for
      president."
      So
      that's
      what
      an
      average
      person
      would
      go
      with.
      I

      only
      reason
      Sessions
      didn't
      oversee
      Mueller
      is
      because
      he
      reclused
      himself
      from
      the
      investigation,
      having
      been
      part
      of
      the
      Trump
      campaign.
      That's
      why
      it
      fell
      on
      Rosenstein.
      The
      new
      acting
      AG
      has
      no
      such
      conflict
      and
      will
      take
      over
      as
      supervisor
      of
      the
      Mueller
      investigation.
      The
      new
      AG
      has
      been
      critical
      of
      the
      investigation
      in
      past
      published
      op-eds.

      Imagine

      traffic
      ticket
      in
      20

      of

      is
      from

      at

      intersection.
      Coming

      you

      I
      honestly
      drove
      right
      through
      it.
      I
      could
      very
      much
      have
      been
      in
      your
      montage.
      Since
      then,
      I
      just
      go
      up
      19
      instead
      of
      23
      for

      Aloha
      and

      It's
      so
      easy
      to
      paint
      the
      winners
      as
      "good"
      candidates
      after
      they
      win,
      and
      the
      losers
      as
      "bad"
      candidates
      after
      they
      lose.
      Of
      course
      Obama
      seems
      like
      a
      "presidential"
      choice
      right
      after
      he's
      been
      president
      for
      8
      years.
      It's
      also
      possible
      to
      have
      two
      bad
      candidates
      (2016,
      2000)
      the
      same
      year
      or
      two
      good
      ones
      (2008).

      I'm
      probably
      older
      than
      you
      and
      admittedly
      center-left
      leaning,
      and
      I
      remember
      being
      genuinely
      excited
      at
      Gore,
      Kerry,
      Obama
      and
      Clinton.
      So
      it's
      easy
      to
      paint
      one
      of
      those
      four
      as
      the
      obvious
      great
      candidate
      and
      the
      others
      as
      "terrible"
      in
      hindsight,
      but
      I
      think
      that's
      very
      revisionist.
      Clinton
      and
      Kerry
      especially,
      I
      think,
      would
      have
      made
      great
      presidents.

      Yeah
      maybe
      not
      300k
      but
      not
      that
      far
      off.
      Let's
      say
      you
      are
      the
      lower
      income
      earner
      and
      make
      150k.
      Because
      your
      spouse
      earns
      more
      and
      because
      of
      the
      marriage
      penalty
      your
      "additional"
      income
      is
      taxed
      at
      the
      higher
      marginal
      rate
      of
      37%
      or
      around
      $60k.
      To
      have
      2
      high
      income
      earners,
      you
      are
      probably
      in
      a
      big
      city
      or
      high
      cost
      of
      living
      area.
      If
      you
      have
      even
      2
      children
      (let
      alone
      more),
      you
      are
      probably
      spending
      $60k+
      on
      childcare
      easily.
      So
      factor
      in
      the
      incidental
      costs
      of
      actually
      being
      at
      work
      (parking,

      potentially
      another

      clothes,

      in
      a

      it's
      actually
      not

      worth
      it

      to
      work
      as
      a

      earner.

      there
      are
      thousands
      of
      moms
      in
      the
      $100-200k
      income
      range
      that
      did
      the
      math

      figured
      for
      the
      $20k

      or
      whatever
      it
      was
      with
      the

      it
      was
      wort
      the
      cost
      to
      stay
      at
      home
      with
      the
      kids
      instead
      of
      having

      No
      you
      don't
      understand.
      If
      you
      are
      married,
      you
      can't
      just
      "file
      separately".
      There's
      a
      whole
      separate
      category
      of
      income
      brackets
      for
      "married,
      but
      filing
      separately".
      And
      the
      income
      thresholds
      for
      tax
      brackets
      for
      that
      category
      are
      much
      lower
      than
      just
      the
      regular
      "single"
      category.
      That's
      why
      it's
      called
      the
      marriage
      penalty.
      Look
      it
      up.

      could

      about
      the

      And
      that's
      why
      you
      don't
      understand
      why
      people

      for

      rather
      than
      just
      pure
      income.
      Your
      use
      of
      the
      term
      "casually"
      is
      also
      insulting
      to
      millions
      of

      they're

      another

      or

      I
      can
      see
      an
      argument
      for
      the
      fact
      that
      you
      think
      investigations
      against
      you
      will
      hurt
      you
      politically
      so
      you

      disagree

      that
      an

      charge
      is

      the
      charge

      what
      you're
      obstructing.
      That
      said,
      Trump's

      Fair
      enough,
      but
      there's
      something
      to
      be
      said
      about
      a
      franchise
      with
      interest
      to
      support
      that
      many
      movies.
      When
      some
      of
      the
      other
      franchises
      started
      getting
      saturated
      (Star
      Wars,
      Harry
      Potter),
      they
      started
      seeing
      diminishing
      returns
      on
      the
      newer
      installments
      (Solo,
      Fantastic
      Beasts).
      It's
      certainly

      Reloaded

      good

      73%

      With
      the
      theory
      that
      "White
      people
      vote
      with
      their
      hearts,
      black
      people
      vote
      with
      their
      heads",
      they
      support
      Biden
      because
      he's
      the
      most
      "electable"
      and
      they
      want
      to
      beat
      Trump.
      I
      know
      there's
      debate
      around
      the
      "electable"
      thing,
      but
      Biden
      still
      consistently
      polls
      the
      best
      out
      of
      any
      candidate
      in
      head-to-head
      vs
      Trump
      polls.
      I
      think
      a
      lot
      of
      black
      voters
      aren't
      sure
      the
      country
      would
      vote
      for
      someone
      like
      Kamala
      Harris
      and
      so
      they
      want
      Biden
      to
      win
      the
      nomination.

      If

      24/7,
      isn't

      to

      all
      the

      with
      a
      late
      announcement
      when
      the

      has
      run
      its
      course
      on
      stories
      on
      the
      existing
      candidates?
      All
      I'm
      saying
      is
      that
      it's
      still
      nearly
      half
      a
      year
      before
      Iowa,
      and
      Harris
      consistently
      polls
      in
      the
      double
      digits.
      She's
      far,
      far
      from
      a
      done
      deal.
      And
      I'm
      not
      even
      a
      supporter.
      EDIT:
      Also
      1990-1991
      was
      the
      banner
      year
      for
      CNN
      with
      the
      Gulf
      War.
      It's
      literally
      when
      the
      24/7
      culture
      was

      So
      it's
      the
      top
      5
      (Biden,
      Bernie,
      Pete,
      Warren,
      Harris).
      Almost
      guaranteed
      for
      the
      next
      3
      (Beto,
      Yang,
      Booker).
      Outside
      chance
      for
      Klobuchar
      and
      Gabbard.
      Seeing
      as
      the
      October
      debates
      will
      likely
      have
      11-12
      candidates,
      narrowing
      it
      down
      to
      8-9
      one
      month
      later
      makes
      sense.
      Ideally
      they
      will
      be
      down
      to
      4-5
      right
      before
      Iowa.

      someone

      Trump
      releasing

      summary

      thought
      made

      look

      a
      tan
      suit
      level
      scandal
      though.
      He

      said
      he
      had
      binders
      full
      of
      resumes

      he

      in

      Poor

      the
      sentiment
      was
      there.
