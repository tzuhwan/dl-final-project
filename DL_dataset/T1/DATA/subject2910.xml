      If
      you
      don't
      mind
      loosing
      some
      background
      details,
      I
      would
      recommend
      you
      to
      set
      your
      aperture
      to
      f/4
      or
      so,
      and
      also
      decrease
      shutter
      speed
      to
      1/1000
      or
      faster.
      Shallow
      depth
      of
      field
      should
      make
      drops
      pop
      out
      if
      focused
      right.
      But
      I'm
      not
      100%
      sure,
      tested
      this
      with
      my
      300mm
      lens
      on
      snowflakes,
      the
      result
      was
      awesome
      :)

      Very
      good,
      and
      I
      really
      love
      the
      colors!
      Chromatic
      aberration
      is
      better
      be
      removed
      and
      I'd
      try
      focus
      stacking
      for
      this
      shot.

      I
      decided
      to
      shoot
      my
      wife
      and
      son
      in
      this
      place
      because
      I
      like
      the
      minimalistic
      feel
      of
      the
      image
      and
      how
      path
      goes
      across
      the
      valley.
      I
      cropped
      the
      sky
      out
      because
      there
      is
      a
      cemetery
      on
      the
      farthest
      side
      and
      it
      doesn't
      look
      pleasant.
      In
      general
      I
      like
      how
      it
      looks,
      but
      I
      have
      a
      strong
      feel
      that
      I
      am
      missing
      something.

      Wow!
      Never
      thought
      about
      cropping
      it
      that
      way!
      And

      I
      am
      rather
      new
      in
      photography
      and
      lack
      editing
      skills.
      Some
      tasks
      just
      killing
      me,
      and
      here
      is
      one:
      I
      was
      not
      able
      to
      get
      closer
      to
      the
      bird
      or
      get
      another
      angle
      and
      now
      it
      blends
      with
      the
      tree.
      I
      want
      it
      to
      pop
      out
      somehow,
      but
      it
      looks
      like
      curves
      or
      channels
      doesn't
      help.
      I
      want
      to
      separate
      it
      from
      background
      without
      masking,
      is
      it
      possible
      in
      this
      shot?

      Awesome
      shot
      and
      I
      really
      like
      the
      edit!
      I
      am
      quite
      new
      to
      photography
      and
      want
      to
      know
      how
      can
      you
      benefit
      from
      polarising
      filter
      here.
      I
      have
      one,
      but
      rarely
      use
      it.
      I
      only
      make
      clouds
      better
      with
      it
      and
      remove
      unwanted
      reflections.
      Want
      to
      know
      how
      it
      can
      be
      used
      in
      other
      ways.

      looks
      a
      bit
      ill
      for
      a
      sunset,
      try
      adding
      more
      yellow.

      Made
      this
      silhouette
      shot
      this
      evening
      and
      I
      really
      like
      it!
      Hand
      shape
      is
      not
      very
      attractive,
      but
      hope
      it
      doesn't
      ruin
      the
      photo
      :)
      The
      only
      edit
      was
      making
      shadows
      brighter.
      What
      can
      I
      do
      better
      here?

      Thank
      you
      for
      the
      detailed
      response!
      I
      brought
      shadows
      up
      because
      model
      color
      was
      close
      to
      the
      cloud
      and
      it
      was
      the
      way
      to
      increase
      contrast.
      This
      might
      caused
      the
      artifacts.

      Nice
      shot,
      especially
      for
      the
      bad
      conditions
      you
      have
      mentioned,
      but
      I
      see
      some
      things
      you
      could
      do
      better:
      1.
      Almost
      no
      sky
      here.
      I'm
      not
      a
      good
      photographer,
      but
      one
      should
      either
      include
      a
      meaningful
      amount
      of
      sky
      (e.g.
      1/3
      of
      the
      frame)
      in
      your
      photo,
      or
      focus
      at
      something
      and
      remove
      the
      sky
      completely.
      You
      have
      a
      thin
      line
      which
      doesn't
      look
      well.
      2.
      Too
      much
      grain,
      even
      for
      ISO400.
      You
      might
      want
      to
      go
      down
      to
      ISO100
      1/100,
      35mm
      is
      short
      enough
      for
      that
      shutter
      speed.
      Generally
      you
      can
      shoot
      up
      to
      1/focal_length
      without
      noticable
      shake.
      3.
      Shadows
      are
      too
      dark
      for
      me.
      Trees
      and
      bushes
      seem
      to
      have
      details
      in
      it,
      but
      we
      cannot
      see
      it
      now.
      Try
      bringing
      shadows
      up
      a
      bit.
      4.
      That
      shed
      stands
      out
      so
      much
      that
      it
      tends
      to
      be
      a
      focal
      point
      of
      the
      whole
      image.
      But
      it
      lacks
      details
      and
      hence
      not
      interesting
      at
      all.
      You
      might
      want
      to
      get
      closer
      so
      we
      can
      see
      what
      is
      inside
      or
      another
      attractive
      things
      there.

      Nice
      angle,
      but
      lack
      of
      depth
      of
      field
      ruins
      the
      shot.
      I
      want
      to
      see
      more
      of
      this
      mud

      It
      was
      evening
      when
      we
      was
      sitting
      on
      the
      bench
      on
      promenade.
      Just
      before
      the
      sunset
      the
      sky
      turned
      red
      and

      decided
      to
      take
      some
      shots.
      Here
      is

      Thank
      you
      for
      the
      review!
      Haven't
      noticed
      that
      horizon
      is
      not
      level
      while
      editing,
      phone
      screen
      is
      too
      small
      for
      me
      :)

      Took
      this
      shot
      after
      the
      rain
      from
      the
      rooftop.
      The
      sky
      was
      stunning
      and
      I
      had
      to
      make
      a
      photo!
      The
      problem
      is
      that
      sun
      went
      after
      the
      hill,
      but
      running
      to
      the
      open
      place
      would
      ruin
      that
      golden
      5
      minutes.
      The
      problem
      I
      cannot
      solve
      here
      is
      what
      to
      do
      with
      the
      hill?
      Leaving
      it
      almost
      black
      is
      at
      was
      before
      processing
      would
      throw
      away
      a
      good
      third
      of
      image
      while
      rising
      the
      shadows
      adds
      green
      color
      to
      a
      sunset
      photo,
      which,
      I
      believe,
      should
      be
      made
      within
      yellow-blue
      tones.
      I
      hope
      your
      opinions
      about
      this
      will
      help!
      Thank
      you
      in
      advance!

      I
      made
      this
      shot
      during
      the
      morning
      walk
      on
      the

      From

      it

      First
      of
      all,
      nice
      shot!
      I
      would
      prefer
      horizon
      not
      intersect
      the
      bird
      and
      be
      at
      lower
      part
      of
      the
      rock,
      so
      that
      it
      is
      literally
      emerges
      from
      the
      water.
      On
      this
      kind
      of
      shots
      you
      usually
      don't
      choose
      where
      to
      shoot
      from.
      If
      you
      can
      visit
      this
      place
      again,
      try
      to
      make
      your
      way
      to
      the
      water
      and
      shoot
      from
      a
      lower
      position.
      But
      don't
      put
      yourself
      under
      risk!
      As
      we
      can
      see
      a
      lot
      of
      guano
      on
      the
      rock,
      birds
      sit
      there
      quite
      often
      and
      you
      will
      get
      another
      chance
      for
      a
      great
      shot.
      Also
      I
      support
      previous
      speaker,
      there
      are
      lack
      of
      space
      to
      the
      left
      and
      a
      lot
      of
      to
      the
      right
      -
      rule
      of
      thirds
      will
      fit
      perfectly
      here.

      Right
      after
      the
      rain
      this
      bird
      jumps
      into
      small
      ponds
      of
      water
      inside
      big
      leaves.
      I
      found
      it
      so
      funny
      and
      also
      made
      several
      shots.
      This
      is
      my
      favourite.
      This
      shot
      have
      several
      technical
      flaws
      (bird
      is
      not
      perfectly
      sharp
      and
      there
      are
      a
      lot
      of
      chromatics
      that
      I
      cannot
      remove
      before
      returning
      from
      the
      trip).
      I
      kindly
      ask
      you
      to
      point
      on
      composition
      faults
      I
      could
      make
      here.

      Awesome!
      I
      want
      to
      have
      a
      skill
      to
      decide
      when
      to
      turn
      my
      shots
      b amp;w.
      You
      did
      it
      well,
      I
      like
      the
      edit.
      I
      see
      the
      problem
      in
      that
      pile
      of
      mud
      to
      the
      right.
      Looks
      like
      it
      pretends
      on
      filling
      the
      empty
      space,
      but
      when
      my
      eye
      drops
      on
      it,
      it
      leaves
      me
      frustrated.
      Try
      removing
      it
      for
      a
      stronger
      minimalistic
      feel.

      I
      love
      the
      shapes
      of
      lightning,
      beautiful
      shot.
      I
      would
      crop
      it
      to
      remove
      a
      lot
      of
      unnecessary
      black
      space
      on
      the
      sides.
      Also
      clone
      out
      the
      annoying
      purple
      artifact,
      it
      is
      clearly
      visible
      if
      you
      zoom
      in
      to
      see
      the
      lightning
      in
      details.
      When
      lacking
      tripod,
      try
      to
      find
      any
      good
      surface
      to
      put
      camera
      on.
      On
      your
      shot
      I
      can
      see
      multiple
      lines
      coming
      along
      each
      other,
      this
      doesn't
      make
      it
      good.
      You
      did
      well
      holding
      camera
      for
      so
      long,
      but
      solid
      surface
      would
      do
      better.
      Even
      bag
      or
      a
      pile
      of
      straw
      is
      enough
      if
      you
      shoot
      with
      a
      delay
      of
      2-5s
      which
      will
      eliminate
      any
      initial
      shake.
      Buy
      watch
      for
      your
      camera,
      it
      can
      fall
      during
      the
      process!

      Took
      this
      picture
      of
      lily
      in
      the
      Phuket
      botanical

      removed
      bright
      reflections
      on
      the
      background
      leaving
      only
      dull
      ones,
      and
      enhanced
      color
      and
      sharpness
      slightly.
      What
      do
      you
      think
      about
      composition
      and
      edit?
      Is
      it

      or
      the

      is
      too

      Good
      work,
      I
      like
      how
      it
      looks.
      But
      I
      have
      an
      idea
      that
      could
      make
      it
      even
      better.
      Now
      all
      the
      forest
      but
      the
      one
      tree
      is
      the
      big
      black
      spot.
      You
      could
      try
      to
      sit
      behind
      the
      tent
      and
      use
      flashlight
      to
      lighten
      the
      surrounding
      trees
      to
      make
      sorta
      halo
      of
      trees
      around
      it.
      I'm
      not
      100%
      sure
      it
      would
      look
      better,
      but
      here
      is
      idea
      to
      try.

      I
      like
      the
      left
      side
      of
      the
      image,
      but
      not
      the
      right.
      First
      off,
      the
      composition
      lacks
      balance
      with
      this
      huge
      empty
      space
      to
      the
      right
      and
      cut
      off
      buildings
      to
      the
      left.
      I
      feel
      a
      strong
      need
      to
      move
      a
      camera
      left
      when
      looking
      at
      the
      image.
      The
      second
      thing
      is
      the
      yellowish
      sky
      color
      in
      the
      bottom
      right
      part.
      It
      might
      be
      there
      when
      you
      made
      this
      shot,
      but
      try
      removing
      it
      in
      postprocessing,
      it
      looks
      ill.
      Anyway
      with
      all
      that
      I
      can
      see
      on
      the
      left
      side
      of
      the
      shot,
      you
      have
      great
      potential!

      First
      of
      all,
      you
      should
      learn
      the
      basics
      of
      astro
      photography.
      Sadly
      I
      don't
      have
      a
      link
      on
      hand
      to
      share,
      but
      you
      can
      easily
      google
      it.
      Use
      the
      rule
      of
      500:
      stars
      have
      trails
      on
      the
      shot.
      To
      eliminate
      this
      you
      have
      to
      set
      shutter
      speed
      no
      more
      than
      500/focal_length
      seconds.
      Iirc
      you
      have
      1.6x
      crop
      sensor,
      so
      for
      you
      it
      is
      500/(18x1.6)
      ~
      15s.
      If
      you
      want
      a
      lot
      of
      stars,
      use
      higher
      ISO
      and
      stack
      shots,
      it's
      much
      easier
      than
      it
      sounds
      to
      be.
      And
      I
      don't
      like
      the
      abundance
      of
      trees
      in
      this
      shot,
      try
      moving
      away
      from
      it
      and
      you'll
      benefit
      from
      two
      things:
      there
      will
      be
      more
      sky
      with
      stars
      and
      tree
      movement
      on
      the
      wind
      will
      be
      less
      noticeable.
      Don't
      stop
      trying
      and
      you
      will
      get
      awesome
      results.

      Took
      this
      shot
      while
      climbing
      the
      Aragats
      western
      summit.
      It's
      my
      first
      time
      shooting
      raw
      with
      GoPro
      6,
      later
      edited
      it
      in
      PS.
      I
      decided
      to
      leave
      a
      slight
      fisheye
      effect
      to
      make
      it
      look
      more
      adventure-like
      (sorry
      for
      my
      English).
      Please
      let
      me
      know
      if
      something
      is
      wrong
      with
      this
      image
      :)

      Hello!
      I
      see
      two
      issues
      with
      the
      shot.
      First,
      it
      lacks
      details
      that
      eye
      can
      stop
      upon.
      Silhouette
      is
      pretty
      weak
      -
      almost
      a
      line.
      You
      can
      try
      the
      same
      shot
      but
      from
      the
      closer
      point
      where
      the
      big
      tree
      on
      the
      1/3
      from
      the
      right
      takes
      a
      good
      chunk
      of
      the
      image.
      From
      here
      it
      looks
      like
      a
      solid
      candidates
      for
      this
      kind
      of
      shot.
      Next,
      you
      should
      do
      something
      to
      reduce
      the
      noise.
      IPhone
      5
      should
      have
      good
      camera
      (never
      used
      5,
      but
      had
      4
      long
      time
      ago),
      I
      think
      there
      might
      be
      a
      mode
      where
      you
      set
      lower
      ISO
      and
      longer
      shutter
      speed.
      You
      will
      have
      to
      hold
      phone
      still
      or
      use
      any
      solid
      surface,
      but
      the
      shot
      will
      have
      better
      quality.

      I
      caught
      the
      idea
      of
      this
      shot,
      but
      you
      can
      do
      better.
      Focal
      point
      of
      this
      shot
      is
      a
      plant
      in
      focus,
      so
      the
      blurry
      trunk
      on
      the
      foreground
      is
      just
      a
      distraction.
      Bend
      it
      with
      your
      hand
      so
      it
      is
      out
      of
      the
      frame.
      Next,
      the
      plant
      is
      curved
      to
      the
      left
      that
      makes
      viewer's
      eye
      go
      this
      way,
      but
      this
      it
      hits
      the
      end
      of
      the
      picture.
      Position
      your
      camera
      so
      that
      the
      plant
      is
      on
      the
      1/3
      from
      the
      right
      and
      it
      will
      look
      much
      better.
      Also
      1/320
      shutter
      speed
      is
      an
      overkill
      for
      that
      focal
      length.
      Even
      if
      you
      have
      cropped
      sensor,
      1/80
      would
      be
      enough
      for
      a
      sharp
      shot,
      just
      make
      several
      shots
      and
      choose
      the
      sharpest.
      It
      will
      let
      you
      bring
      ISO
      and
      hence
      the
      noise
      down.
      And
      the
      last,
      it
      might
      be
      a
      sense
      of
      taste,
      but
      I
      would
      shoot
      from
      a
      lower
      position
      to
      let
      the
      more
      leaves
      into
      the
      frame
      (they
      looks
      cool)
      and
      make
      the
      main
      plant
      on
      the
      bright
      background
      for
      more
      contrast.

      Was
      walking
      in
      Sochi
      botanical
      garden
      and
      shooting
      random
      birds
      when
      I
      saw
      this!
      A
      gorgeous
      pelican
      cleaning
      it's
      feathers
      on
      a
      light
      spot
      in
      a
      shady
      woods.
      Had
      time
      to
      make
      a
      few
      shots
      before
      he
      moved
      towards
      the
      fence
      off
      the
      light
      (I
      was
      pecked
      by
      him
      later:)),
      this
      is
      the
      best
      one.
      I
      hope
      I
      haven't
      ruined
      it
      with
      processing.
      Any
      critique
      is
      welcome!

      I
      was
      waiting
      till
      mid-autumn
      to
      make
      this
      kind
      of
      shot.
      But
      when
      I
      came
      to
      the
      place
      I
      wanted
      to
      make
      photo
      of,
      I
      realized
      that
      the
      forest
      green
      on
      the
      one
      half
      of
      the
      road
      because
      of
      coniferous
      trees!
      I
      really
      like
      how
      two
      sides
      of
      this
      shot
      adds
      up
      and
      want
      your
      comments
      on
      what
      could
      be
      done
      better
      here.
      Made
      this
      photo
      with
      DJI
      Phantom
      3
      standard.
