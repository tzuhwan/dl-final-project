      Why
      they
      chose
      out
      of
      all
      possibilities
      the
      name
      'New
      Mecca'
      for?
      First
      I
      thought
      "Nah,
      it's
      probably
      just
      coincidence
      or
      something"
      but
      there
      was
      a
      even
      target
      named
      Omar
      Al-Qasim
      which
      really
      annoyed
      me.
      And
      also
      why
      nobody
      isn't
      talking
      about
      this?
      Like
      I
      wouldn't
      really
      cared
      much
      but
      it
      is
      just
      so
      weird
      when
      you
      think
      about
      it
      with
      everything
      else.
      A
      dystopic
      future
      like
      city,
      a
      war,
      a
      made
      up
      country
      or
      faction
      or
      whatever
      called
      Cromag,
      all
      the
      setting
      and
      names
      western;
      except
      Zero's
      samurai
      theme,
      which
      actually
      not
      so
      weird
      to
      see
      in
      such
      a
      setting
      actually.
      However,
      in
      the
      middle
      of
      all
      these,
      the
      name
      "New
      Mecca"
      is
      just
      too
      out
      of
      place,
      "Omar
      Al-Qasim"
      is
      out
      of
      place.
      If
      the
      setting
      was
      middle
      east,
      I
      wouldn't
      care
      and
      just
      would
      have
      said
      "It's
      just
      random
      nothing
      interesting"
      but
      however,
      except
      the
      name
      'Mecca'
      every
      other
      thing
      is
      fictional,
      and
      unmatching
      with
      it.
      Why
      is
      that?
      Well
      saying
      that
      it
      was
      just
      random
      and
      it
      has
      no
      meaning
      at
      all
      isn't
      satisfaying
      me.
      I
      feel
      like
      there
      should
      be
      a
      better
      answer
      since,
      how
      come
      in
      a
      story
      like
      this,
      a
      name
      used
      a
      lot
      is
      just
      random
      and
      meaningless?
      This
      is
      not
      your
      typical
      ''Let's
      use
      some
      Christian
      and
      Jewish
      stuff
      so
      it
      would
      sound
      eccentric".
      It
      is
      about
      Islam,
      a
      city
      that
      probably
      a
      common
      person
      in
      west
      will
      never
      even
      hear
      about.
      And
      also
      "Omar
      Al-Qasim"
      is
      a
      very
      legit
      name,
      it
      is
      so
      realistic
      that
      it
      bothers
      me.

      Well
      actually,
      isn't
      that
      true?
      Since
      his
      time
      internet
      changed
      wildly
      so,
      I
      guess
      you
      can
      say
      so?

      Yet
      still
      everyday
      I
      got
      surprised
      about
      how
      many
      unimportant
      things
      have
      names
      in

      Well,
      when
      I
      said
      this
      is
      bothering
      me
      I
      didn't
      mean
      it
      in
      a
      negative
      way.
      More
      like
      it
      was
      popping
      in
      my
      head
      during
      I
      was
      playing
      the
      game
      like
      'What's
      it
      really
      about?
      Is
      it
      an
      important
      part
      of
      story,
      or
      just
      something
      completely
      random.
      Or
      maybe
      some
      kind
      of
      easter
      egg?
      That
      only
      careful
      eyes
      will
      catch?
      ".
      Maybe
      I
      chose
      the
      word
      badly,
      I
      don't
      know,
      English
      isn't
      my
      first
      language.
      Also
      I
      am
      not
      seeking
      a
      message,
      but
      just
      suspecting
      maybe
      there
      is
      a
      message,
      but
      not
      so
      serious
      or
      deep.
      Or
      maybe
      is
      deep?
      About
      Mecca
      being
      isolated,
      yeah
      it
      is
      true.
      But
      prosperity?
      Yeah
      Mecca
      isn't
      a
      place
      in
      poverty
      but
      compared
      to
      a
      city
      like
      Dubai
      it
      is
      not
      really
      that
      rich.
      If
      the
      city
      was
      Dubai
      I
      wouldn't
      really
      think
      on
      it
      to
      be
      honest.
      Because
      Dubai
      is
      the
      symbol
      of
      oil
      rich
      Arabs.
      In
      such
      a
      setting
      I
      wouldn't
      think
      "
      That's
      weird"
      at
      all.
      I
      would
      have
      just
      think
      that
      it
      is
      an
      interesting
      choice.
      It
      was
      used
      in
      Spec
      Ops
      Line
      if
      I
      remember
      correctly.
      I
      didn't
      think
      anything
      out
      of
      it.
      But
      Mecca
      isn't
      like
      that.
      Only
      thing
      significant
      about
      Mecca
      is
      Islam.
      Take
      the
      Kaabe
      out,
      Mecca
      is
      worthless,
      just
      rocks
      not
      even
      a
      desert
      with
      sand.
      So
      why
      would
      they
      choose
      it?
      And
      also
      yeah
      maybe
      we
      could've
      said
      that
      it
      is
      a
      symbol
      for
      something
      to
      journey
      to,
      but
      only
      if
      there
      was
      such
      a
      thing
      in
      the
      story.
      But
      there
      is
      nothing
      like
      that
      in
      the
      story.
      And
      also
      Mecca
      is
      where
      Muslims
      face
      when
      they
      pray,
      so
      it
      could've
      used
      as
      a
      symbol
      for
      something
      like
      that
      but
      again
      story
      doesn't
      have
      an
      element
      like
      that.
      Overall
      it
      is
      weird.
      Also
      as
      a
      side
      note
      I'm
      that
      interested
      about
      this,
      because
      I
      am
      a
      muslim.
      I
      also
      think
      that
      is
      why
      most
      people
      don't
      talk
      or
      think
      about
      it.
      They
      probably
      simply
      didn't
      even
      realise
      it.
      And
      that's
      one
      of
      the
      things
      that
      makes
      me
      think
      it
      is
      so
      weird.
      Why
      would
      you
      put
      the
      name
      Mecca
      in
      a
      game
      that
      will
      be
      played
      by
      people
      that
      won't
      even
      realise
      that
      it
      is
      there?
      Why?

      You
      just
      said
      something
      that
      made
      the

      even

      Well
      good
      answer
      but,
      even
      if
      it
      is
      like
      so
      then
      why
      they
      chose
      Mecca?
      It
      feels
      so
      random.
      Also
      there
      isn't
      other
      things
      like
      that
      in
      the
      story,
      at
      least
      I
      didn't
      see.
      About
      Al-Qasim,
      if
      the
      city
      name
      wasn't
      Mecca
      yeah
      I
      would've
      just
      thought
      they
      just
      added
      it
      to
      spice
      things.
      What
      makes
      it
      weird
      is
      it
      is
      there
      with
      the
      name
      New
      Mecca,
      and
      also
      with
      a
      lot
      of
      not
      so
      realistic
      names.
      In
      the
      middle
      of
      all
      made
      up
      names,
      Al-Qasim
      and
      Mecca
      looks
      way
      too
      real
      for
      the
      setting.

      Suddenly
      you
      start
      to
      feel
      everything
      is
      unfamiliar.
      Your
      house,
      family,
      the
      way
      people
      talk...
      Everything
      became
      so
      stranger
      to
      you
      that
      it
      scares
      to
      hell
      out
      of
      you.
      Just
      like
      you
      saw
      aliens.
      It
      is
      so
      scary
      that
