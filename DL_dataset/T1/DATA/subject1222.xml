      There's
      no
      point.
      I
      know
      there's
      NO
      WAY
      I
      can
      live
      the
      rest
      of
      my
      life
      the
      way
      I
      want
      to.
      I'll
      never
      amount
      to
      anything
      in
      the
      future.
      I've
      just
      wasted
      my
      parents
      money.
      I'm
      disappointed
      in
      myself.
      I'm
      pathetic.

      Thank
      you
      but
      I
      wanna
      die
      quickly
      and
      painlessly
      that's
      how
      pathetic
      I
      am
      I
      don't
      have
      the
      guts
      to
      hang
      myself
      I
      tried
      sticking
      my
      head
      in
      a
      plastic
      bag
      to
      suffocate
      but
      that
      didn't
      work
      it
      just
      gets
      so
      scary
      that
      ur
      body
      subconsciously
      gets
      out
      of
      it
      like
      my
      body
      acted
      on
      it's
      own.
      I
      don't
      know
      what
      else
      to
      do.
      I
      have
      no
      future
      I'll
      just
      end
      up
      disappointing
      everyone
      and
      myself
      if
      I
      continue
      to
      live
      like
      this
      so
      it's
      better
      to
      just
      die.

      It
      just
      won't
      get
      better
      I've
      realized
      that
      life
      is
      just
      an
      endless
      grind.
      I
      thought
      it
      would
      be
      work
      hard
      in
      high
      school
      and
      relax
      in
      college
      but
      it's
      not.
      It's
      work
      hard
      in
      college
      then
      work
      hard
      getting
      a
      job
      then
      work
      hard
      in
      the
      job
      I
      don't
      wanna
      live
      like
      that
      but
      if
      I
      don't
      live
      like
      that
      I'll
      be
      worthless.
      I'm
      just
      worried
      what'll
      happen
      to
      my
      parents
      if
      I
      do
      decide
      to
      kill
      myself
      they'll
      start
      blaming
      each
      other
      and
      shit
      and
      I
      wanna
      die
      quickly
      and
      painlessly
      those
      are
      the
      only
      2
      things
      stopping
      me
      right
      now

      Yeah
      exactly
      I'm
      really
      worried
      about
      my
      family
      too
      but
      if
      it
      gets
      too
      certain
      point
      then
      I'll
      have
      to
      jump
      right
      now
      I
      can
      only
      jump
      from
      35-40
      feet
      but
      I
      don't
      know
      if
      that'll
      do
      it
      but
      idk
      if
      that'll
      work.

      K
      I'll
      try
      to
      wait
      till
      college
      starts
      but
      if
      it
      gets
      bad
      then
      I've
      decided
      how
      I'mma
      do
      it
      I'll
      do
      it
      late
      at
      night
      wear
      an
      old
      tight
      shirt
      and
      stuff
      some
      glasses
      in
      the
      shirt's
      chest
      area
      landing
      chest
      first
      should
      be
      easy
      if
      the
      fall
      doesn't
      kill
      me
      then
      the
      blood
      loss
      from
      the
      lacerations
      due
      to
      the
      shattered
      glass
      definitely
      will.
      THANK
      YOU

      Yeah
      I've
      seen
      it.
      It's
      REALLY
      funny
      but
      not
      as
      funny
      as
      gintama
      some
      gintama
      episodes
      will
      literally
      make
      u
      laugh
      till
      ur
      stomach
      hurts
      and
      I
      haven't
      found
      any
      other
      anime
      that
      can
      do
      that
      except
      for
      a
      few
      scenes
      in
      Beelzebub
      and
      Saiki.

      Which
      country
      are
      you
      from?
      I
      just
      finished
      high
      school
      and
      cleared
      Entrance
      exam
      for
      vets.
      In
      my
      country
      some
      medical
      colleges
      are
      heavily
      subsidized
      so
      fees
      is
      like
      1,000
      dollars
      for
      the
      entire
      course.
      Anyway
      these
      colleges
      are
      very
      hard
      to
      get
      into
      like
      acceptance
      rate
      is
      2%.
      Anyway
      animals
      are
      my
      whole
      world
      and
      I
      entered
      this
      profession
      because
      of
      animals
      but
      can
      I
      make
      enough
      money
      to
      live
      comfortably
      alone
      as
      I
      don't
      plan
      on
      having
      a
      family?

      it
      too
      much
      like
      souls
      coz
      I
      have
      2,000+
      hours
      on
      souls
      I
      pretty
      much
      beat
      the
      game
      without
      deflecting
      on
      second
      playthrough
      I
      learned
      deflecting
      and
      it
      was
      much
      easier

      I
      hate
      myself.
      I'm
      fucking
      despicable.
      I
      don't
      wanna
      kill
      myself
      coz
      it'll
      make
      my
      parents
      feel
      sad.
      But
      I
      hate
      myself.
      I
      hate
      the
      way
      I
      look.
      I
      hate
      the
      way
      I
      act
      with
      everyone
      around
      me.
      I'm
      almost
      19
      I'm
      5'10
      and
      48
      Kilograms.
      I
      hate
      my
      face
      I
      hate
      my
      body.
      I
      hate
      the
      fact
      that
      I'm
      jealous
      of
      everyone
      around
      me.
      I'm
      not
      good
      at
      anything.
      I've
      recently
      started
      punching
      stuff
      coz
      the
      pain
      gives
      me
      satisfaction
      but
      I
      can't
      do
      it
      as
      often
      as
      I'd
      like
      coz
      everyone
      asks
      questions
      about
      it
      and
      I
      can't
      think
      of
      more
      excuses.
      I
      tried
      cutting
      myself
      a
      few
      days
      ago
      it
      was
      kinda
      fun
      but
      not
      really
      thrilling.
      I
      don't
      know.
      I
      just
      hate
      the
      person
      I
      am
      right
      now.
      Everytime
      I
      see
      myself
      in
      the
      mirror
      or
      in
      a
      picture
      I'm
      just
      disappointed
      and
      angry.
      I
      hate
      everything
      I
      do.
      I
      don't
      know
      why
      I'm
      like
      but
      I
      wish
      I
      was
      different.
      If
      I
      were
      you
      I
      wouldn't
      love
      me
      neither.
      Thank
      you
      for
      reading
      I
      just
      wanted
      to
      vent
      to
      see
      if
      it
      would
      help.
      Have
      a
      nice
      day
      :)

      I
      hate
      myself.
      I
      hate
      the
      way
      I
      look
      I
      hate
      my
      voice
      I
      hate
      the
      way
      I
      speak
      I
      hate
      the
      way
      I
      interact
      with
      people.
      I've
      always
      hated
      myself
      but
      lately
      I'm
      realizing
      how
      pathetic
      I
      actually
      am
      and
      now
      I
      just
      love
      punching
      walls.
      I
      started
      a
      month
      ago.
      I
      love
      the
      rush
      I
      get
      while
      punching
      and
      I
      love
      the
      pain
      I
      feel
      after.
      I
      love
      seeing
      bruises
      and
      blood
      and
      I
      love
      the
      scars
      that
      come
      after.
      A
      couple
      days
      ago
      I
      like
      dislocated
      my
      tendon.
      I
      loved
      that
      too
      it
      was
      like
      a
      new
      injury.
      I'm
      a
      college
      student
      everyone
      asks
      what
      happened
      to
      your
      hand
      I
      just
      lie
      to
      them
      it's
      not
      like
      they
      care
      anyway.
      I
      wanna
      get
      hurt
      really
      bad
      but
      then
      I'll
      get
      caught.
      I
      tried
      cutting
      myself
      between
      2
      knuckles
      but
      it
      was
      just
      painful.
      There
      was
      no
      satisfaction
      so
      I'ma
      stick
      to
      punching
      walls.
      I
      just
      wanted
      to
      share
      this
      because
      I
      could
      relate
      to
      a
      lot
      of
      ppl
      on
      here.
