      Took
      my
      daughter
      (3
      at
      the
      time)
      and
      younger
      brother
      camping
      on
      an
      island
      in
      the
      middle
      of
      the
      lake
      one
      summer
      afternoon.
      We
      would
      yell
      random
      words
      to
      hear
      the
      distinct
      3
      echos
      that
      would
      come
      back
      at
      different
      times.
      For
      some
      reason
      my
      daughter
      yelled
      "PENIS"
      out
      of
      the
      blue.
      My
      brother
      and
      I
      both
      started
      cracking
      up
      and
      we
      started
      yelling
      it
      too.
      For
      the
      next
      2
      months
      my
      daughter
      would
      randomly
      yell
      penis
      as
      loud
      as
      she
      could
      to
      see
      if
      there
      was
      an
      echo.
      I
      couldn't
      be
      mad
      at
      her,
      but
      her
      mother
      on
      the
      other
      hand

      Friend
      And
      I
      decided
      to
      go
      offroading
      in
      my
      Suzuki
      samurai
      one
      night
      due
      to
      boredom.
      There
      was
      a
      big
      thunderstorm
      that
      had
      just
      passed
      and
      everything
      was
      drenched.
      We
      are
      driving
      up
      the
      mountain
      to
      this
      local
      offroad
      spot,
      imagine
      a
      5
      mile
      twisty
      gravel
      road.
      There
      is
      one
      spot
      where
      the
      trees
      clear
      and
      you
      can
      see
      everything
      around
      you
      for
      miles.
      As
      we
      approach
      this
      spot
      there
      appears
      to
      be
      a
      thick
      white
      cloud
      or
      fog
      bank,
      but
      its
      small,
      about
      50
      foot
      in
      diameter.
      I
      slow
      down
      as
      it
      is
      so
      thick
      we
      cannot
      see
      through
      it.
      The
      INSTANT
      we
      drive
      into
      it
      everything
      electrical
      dies.
      Headlights,
      gauges,
      engine,
      radio
      etc.
      We
      both
      look
      at
      each
      other
      as
      I
      attempt
      to
      re
      start
      the
      samurai
      but
      nothing.
      At
      this
      point
      it
      seems
      like
      maybe
      a
      battery
      cable
      came
      loose
      so
      I
      get
      my
      phone
      out
      to
      use
      the
      flashlight.
      What
      do
      you
      know
      its
      off
      too.
      My
      friend
      checks
      his
      phone
      too
      and
      its
      the
      same
      way,
      dead
      and
      wont
      power
      up.
      We
      are
      starting
      to
      get
      a
      little
      freaked
      out.
      Unsure
      what
      we
      should
      do
      we
      just
      sit
      there.
      About
      a
      minute
      passes
      and
      suddenly
      the
      "fog"
      slowly
      moves
      to
      the
      left.
      We
      couldnt
      tell
      this
      at
      the
      time
      because
      we
      are
      still
      inside
      of
      it
      blind.
      The
      instant
      the
      fog
      cleared
      us
      everything
      electrical
      came
      back
      to
      life.
      The
      headlights
      come
      on,
      radio
      starts
      playing
      and
      our
      phones
      start
      powering
      up.
      I
      reach
      forward
      and
      turn
      the
      key
      and
      it
      fires
      up
      no
      problem.
      I
      back
      up
      and
      see
      whatever
      it
      was
      we
      drove
      into
      floating
      off
      to
      the
      left
      at
      about
      walking
      speed.
      Still
      dont
      know
      what
      it
      is
      to
      this
      day
      but
      it
      was
      pretty
      strange
      and
      incredible
      timing
      to
      be
      a
      coincidence.

      Got
      bored
      with
      my
      track
      car
      miata,
      took
      it
      in
      the
      woods
      and
      loved
      it.
      Im
      building
      a
      4
      link
      with
      a
      toyota
      4runner
      solid
      rear
      axle
      and
      some
      long
      travel
      front
      control
      arms.
      Should
      be
      fun.
      Im
      shooting
      for
      12"
      of
      travel.
      Hopefully
      the
      picture
      works.

      I
      overdo
      everything.
      The
      toyota
      solid
      rear
      axle
      will
      be
      locked,
      either
      welded
      or
      itll
      have
      a
      spool.
      I
      build
      suspension
      for
      a
      living
      so
      it
      comes
      naturally
      for
      me.
      This
      will
      essentially
      get
      a
      scaled
      down
      trophy
      truck
      setup.
      29"
      tall
      mud
      tires.

      One
      day
      I
      was
      at
      a
      friends
      house
      and
      happened
      to
      be
      grilling
      hamburgers.
      My
      friend
      did
      something
      annoying
      and
      my
      response
      was
      to
      lightly
      jab
      him
      in
      the
      throat
      with
      the
      spatula.
      Little
      did
      i
      realize
      the
      end
      of
      the
      spatula
      has
      hot
      as
      hell
      since
      I
      had
      been
      keeping
      it
      on
      the
      grill.
      He
      got
      a
      pretty
      severe
      burn
      right
      across
      the
      front
      of
      his
      throat,
      there
      was
      no
      hiding
      it.
      He
      said
      he
      lost
      track
      of
      the
      amount
      of
      people
      that
      asked
      him
      why
      he
      tried
      to
      kill
      himself
      by
      cutting
      his
      own
      throat.
      About
      10
      years
      later
      I
      think
      the
      scar
      has
      faded.
      Same
      guy
      also
      got
      his
      shirt
      burnt
      off
      of
      him
      by
      a
      bottle
      rocket
      as
      he
      was
      jumping
      on
      the
      trampoline.
      I
      had
      a
      1/1000000
      shot
      hit
      him
      square
      in
      the
      chest
      as
      he
      was
      jumping.
      luckily
      that
      one
      didnt
      hurt
      him.

      I
      love
      my
      xb9r.
      My
      dad
      bought
      it
      brand
      new
      in
      2003
      and
      I
      got
      it
      4
      years
      ago
      when
      he
      got
      too
      fat
      to
      ride
      it.
      I
      took
      it
      apart
      3
      years
      ago
      for
      no
      reason
      and
      havent
      put
      it
      back
      together
      yet.
      One
      day
      I
      will.
      I
      bought
      an
      fz09
      yesterday
      to
      ride
      and
      enjoy.

      A
      little
      back
      story.
      In
      2014
      I
      ordered
      a
      liquid
      metallic
      fz09
      when
      they
      first
      came
      out.
      The
      dealer
      calls
      me
      about
      a
      month
      later
      and
      says,
      "your
      bike
      is
      here,
      you
      can
      come
      pick
      it
      up".
      I
      arrive
      at
      the
      dealership
      where
      they
      have
      a
      RED
      bike
      for
      me.
      I
      politely
      say
      I
      ordered
      the
      grey
      one
      with
      blue
      wheels
      and
      I
      dont
      want
      a
      red
      one.
      They
      basically
      tell
      me
      too
      bad
      you
      cant
      choose
      the
      color
      and
      I
      proceed
      to
      walk
      out.
      I
      never
      got
      one.
      Fast
      forward
      4
      years
      and
      the
      itch
      came
      back.
      See
      I
      have
      about
      10
      other
      motorcycles
      but
      they
      are
      constantly
      taken
      apart
      in
      various
      stages
      of
      customization.
      I
      wanted
      something
      to
      ride
      now.
      I
      hadnt
      thrown
      a
      leg
      over
      something
      in
      2
      years.
      Thursday
      I
      find
      a
      nicely
      modded
      fz09
      in
      the
      color
      I
      like
      with
      low
      miles,
      then
      I
      make
      it
      mine.
      In
      the
      last
      3
      days
      ive
      put
      400
      miles
      on
      it
      just
      playing
      around
      town.
      Its
      everything
      I
      had
      hoped
      it
      was
      and
      im
      totally
      in
      love
      with
      it.

      I
      plan
      on
      making
      it
      black
      later
      to
      help
      it
      blend
      in.
      Its
      10
      lbs
      lighter
      than
      the

      much
      less
      restrictive
      so
      it
      cant
      hurt.
      It
      pulls
      slightly
      harder
      but
      I
      think
      I
      need
      to
      adjust
      the
      tune
      to
      see
      any
      real
      benefit.
      I
      have
      noticed
      some
      popping
      at
      wot
      in
      1-3
      gear,
      almost
      sounds
      like
      traction
      control
      cutting
      in.

      Got
      the
      ducati
      swingarm
      in
      the
      mail
      today
      and
      started
      fitting
      it.
      Now
      that
      I
      know
      it
      will
      work
      I'll
      order
      a
      wheel.

      I've
      built
      several
      swingarms
      and
      frames
      from
      scratch
      for
      road
      and
      race
      bikes.
      This
      is
      fairly
      straight
      forward.
      The
      length
      is
      very
      close
      to
      stock.
      The
      biggest
      change
      will
      be
      the
      shock
      linkage
      which
      i
      wasnt
      happy
      with
      anyway.

      Update.
      Bike
      now
      supports
      itself.
      Machined
      a
      heim
      adaptor
      for
      the
      shock.
      It
      will
      need
      a
      stiffer
      spring
      but
      I
      have
      a
      few
      to
      choose
      from.
      I'll
      need
      a
      longer
      rear
      brake
      like
      and
      a
      14t
      front
      sprocket
      for
      the
      gearing
      to
      be
      near
      stock.

      100%
      looks.
      The
      1098
      arm
      is
      heavier
      but
      the
      forged
      wheel
      is
      lighter.
      The
      single
      sided
      arm
      matches
      the
      frame
      beautifully.

      I've
      never
      seen
      it
      before.
      The
      swingarm
      needed
      to
      be
      widened
      4mm
      to
      fit
      the
      frame.
      I
      machined
      sleeves
      to
      adapt
      the
      pivot
      bolt.
      The
      obvious
      frame
      clearancing.
      I
      am
      using
      a
      Penske
      shock
      so
      there
      is
      a
      wide
      range
      of
      adjustments,
      but
      I
      did
      have
      to
      put
      a
      stiffer
      rate
      spring
      on
      it.
      I'll
      ride
      it
      for
      the
      first
      time
      today
      once
      i
      put
      a
      tire
      on
      the
      wheel.

      could
      sell
      a
      kit
      for
      everyone
      to
      do
      it
      themselves.
      Unfortunately
      it
      doesnt
      look
      like
      yamaha
      consulted
      with
      ducati
      while
      designing
      the
      bike.
      I
      am
      happy
      with
      how
      well
      the
      frame
      and
      swingarm
      match.
      I'll
      take
      pictures
      from
      the
      other
      side
      this
      afternoon.

      It's
      got
      about
      a
      half
      inch
      of
      clearance
      now
      but
      the
      tire
      moves
      away
      from
      the
      muffler
      under
      compression.
      I'm
      putting
      a
      smaller
      rear
      tire
      on
      it
      and
      changing
      the
      exhaust
      up
      soon
      but
      it
      works
      as
      is.
      I've
      already
      put
      100
      miles
      on
      this
      setup
      yesterday.

      MOAR
      PICS
      for
      those
      who
      are
      interested.
      Current
      rear
      tire
      is
      a
      190/55-17.
      I'll
      be
      replacing
      it
      with
      a
      190/50-17.
      Also
      disregard
      the
      rusty
      chain,
      it's
      all
      I
      had
      laying
      around.
      I
      think
      the
      swingarm
      suits
      the
      bike
      well.

      It
      is.
      I
      dont
      like
      the
      way
      it
      looks
      but

      800

      2
      days
      and
      my
      butt
      was
      happy.
      Unfortunately
      its
      heavy
      and
      the
      material
      developed
      a
      crack
      in
      it,
      plus
      the
      center
      section
      is
      coming
      loose.
      Pretty
      poor
      quality
      for
      an
      almost
      500$
      seat.

      Everything
      has
      pros
      and
      cons.
      Per
      given
      weight
      a
      dss
      will
      be
      stiffer,
      but
      there
      are
      drawbacks
      like
      chain
      alignment
      issues.
      I
      did
      it
      to
      be
      different
      and
      I
      think
      it
      looks
      1000%
      better.
      This
      isn't
      a
      racebike
      and
      it
      handles
      as
      well
      as
      it
      did
      before.

      Swingarm
      needs
      to
      be
      widened
      4mm
      at
      the
      pivot.
      Yamaha
      pivot
      bolt
      is
      smaller
      so
      you
      machine
      sleeves
      to
      adapt
      the
      pivot
      to
      the
      bigger
      ducati
      bearings.
      From
      the
      pivot
      bolt
      back
      everything
      is
      ducati.
      Some
      clearancing
      needs
      to
      happen
      for
      the
      swinger
      to
      compress
      over
      the
      odd
      shape
      of
      the
      yamaha
      frame,
      that's
      what
      I
      capped
      and
      welded.
      I
      had
      to
      adapt
      a
      heim
      to
      the
      penske
      shock
      and
      up
      the
      spring
      rate.
      I
      prefer
      the
      new
      motion
      ratio
      of
      the
      shock
      to
      the
      stock
      setup.

      Biggest
      handling
      difference
      comes
      from
      the
      different
      sized
      rear
      tire.
      It's
      still
      as
      good
      or
      better
      than
      before.
      Once
      I
      get
      a
      rear
      brake
      on
      it
      I'll
      start
      pushing
      it
      harder.
      Rear
      wheel
      is
      also
      lighter
      than
      stock.

      Grew
      up
      around
      a
      manual
      shop,
      did
      CNC
      work
      for
      a
      few
      years
      in
      my
      teens,
      then
      went
      to
      programming.
      Now
      I
      do
      design
      and
      engineering
      along
      with
      inspection.
      Luckily
      I
      still
      get
      to
      use
      any
      of
      the
      machines
      I
      want.
      This
      was
      programmed
      at
      the
      machine.
      Luckily
      I
      didnt
      kill
      one
      because
      I
      need
      both
      of
      them.

      Most
      important
      thing
      you
      need
      to
      do
      is
      learn
      how
      to
      use
      the
      machines
      BEFORE
      you
      become
      an
      engineer.
      That

      will
      make
      your

      the

      who
      work
      with
      you
      much
      easier.
      Most
      colleges
      have
      a
      machine
      shop
      or
      fsae
      team
      where
      you
      can
      learn
      tons.
      I
      guess
      I
      lucked
      into
      this
      job,
      there
      is
      no
      where
      else
      I
      could
      go
      in
      the
      city
      and
      do
      the
      same
      thing.

      Hi
      everyone
      this
      is
      my
      first
      post
      here.
      I
      have
      a
      lulzbot
      taz
      5
      in
      an
      enclosure.
      The
      first
      6
      months
      were
      fine
      but
      now
      I
      cant
      get
      any
      prints
      to
      work.
      I
      run
      cura
      software.
      The
      current
      filament
      is
      polymaker
      pla.
      The
      extruder
      seems
      to
      clog
      about
      .250"
      above
      the
      table
      every
      time,
      despite
      different
      temp
      and
      speed
      settings.
      The
      first
      thing
      I
      did
      was
      clean
      the
      extruder
      and
      feed
      mechanisms.
      When
      that
      didnt
      work
      I
      swapped
      out
      complete
      heads
      but
      have
      the
      same
      problem.
      One
      thing
      I'm
      wondering
      is
      if
      the
      extruder
      feed
      is
      getting
      too
      hot
      and
      the
      filament
      is
      getting
      jammed,
      but
      the
      small
      extruder
      fan
      is
      running
      at
      100%
      the
      entire
      time.
      Please
      help.
      I've
      attached
      a
      link
      to
      several
      photos
      showing
      past
      and
      present
      print
      quality.

      Thank
      you,
      ill
      go
      look
      for
      that.
      I
      honestly
      havent
      touched
      the
      printer
      in
      6
      months
      because
      I
      became
      so
      frustrated
      with
      it.
      I
      miss
      printing
      though
      so
      I
      need
      to
      figure
      it
      out.

      My
      college
      dorm
      had
      an
      abandoned
      and
      blocked
      off
      top
      (4th)
      floor.
      The
      stairs
      were
      spiral
      stair
      cases
      and
      a
      fire
      hazard
      so
      the
      doors
      were
      welded
      shut.
      You
      could
      go
      into
      the
      bathroom,
      remove
      an
      access
      panel
      and
      climb
      up
      the
      pipes.
      It
      was
      spooky
      as
      hell
      up
      there
      but
      really
      cool
      at
      the
      same
      time.
      Automatic
      expulsion
      if
      caught.
      Totally
      worth
      it.

      I
      have
      an
      everlast
      200dv.
      First
      one
      killed
      itself
      about
      6
      months
      from
      when
      i
      got
      it.
      It
      took
      everlast
      about
      2
      weeks
      to
      actually
      admit
      something
      was
      wrong
      with
      it
      (wouldnt
      make
      an
      arc)
      before
      they
      sent
      a
      replacement.
      Friend
      bought
      the
      same
      machine
      and
      the
      high
      frequency
      has
      stopped
      working,
      he
      has
      to
      scratch
      start
      tig.
      My
      new
      (probably
      refurbished)
      machine
      is
      starting
      to
      act
      weird
      on
      AC.
       #8203;
      Another
      friend
      bought
      an
      AHP
      alphatig
      that
      broke
      6
      seconds
      in
      the
      first
      weld,
      no
      joke.

      Im
      assuming
      my
      new
      one
      was
      a
      refurb.
       #8203;
      AHP
      sent
      out
      a
      new
      main
      board
      which
      my
      friend
      swapped
      and
      it
      promptly
      fried
      too.
      He
      then
      said
      fuck
      it
      and
      sent
      the
      machine
      back.
      These
      things
      seem
      to
      be
      really
      hit
      or
      miss.
       #8203;
      I
      bought
      my
      everlast
      because
      a
      friend
      had
      one
      and
      it
      works
      well
      still
      to
      this
      day,
      but
      its
      not
      used
      very
      often.

      Nope,
      this
      motor
      is
      basically
      done.
      Bad
      rod
      knock
      and
      using
      oil.
      I
      have
      an
      85
      vw
      golf
      with
      the
      original
      motor
      though,
      odometer
      shows
      800k+
      miles
      but
      was
      broken.
      It's
      well
      over
      1
      million
      now.
      Unfortunately
      a
      tree
      fell
      on
      the
      car
      not
      too
      long
      ago.

      Depends
      on
      a
      number
      of
      factors.
      The
      fz
      is
      lacking
      in
      many
      areas
      like
      the
      swingarm
      pivot
      is
      to
      narrow
      and
      the
      pivot
      bolt
      is
      is
      too
      small.
      The
      only
      real
      advantage
      to
      a
      single
      sided
      arm
      is
      wheel
      removal
      takes
      about
      10
      seconds
      and
      you
      dont
      have
      to
      touch
      the
      chain
      or
      rear
      brake.
      You
      also
      cannot
      mis
      align
      the
      chain.

      Within
      3
      hours
      from

      I

      Barber

      park,
      little
      Talledega,
      and
      National
      Corvette
      Museum
      track.
      All
      of
      the
      tracks
      host
      affordable
      track
      days
      and
      all
      tracks
      are
      excellent
      for
      cars.
      Little
      talledega
      is
      flat
      but
      the
      rest
      are
      complex
      and
      have
      huge
      elevation
      changes.
      Barber
      is
      the
      nicest
      track
      I've
      ever
      been
      to.
      I

      Hey
      guys,
      just
      purchased
      this
      pretty
      rough
      1125r.
      Bike
      was
      running
      badly
      so
      first
      thing
      I
      did
      was
      adjust
      the
      cable
      to
      the
      TPS
      and
      it
      helped
      a
      ton.
      Bike
      is
      a
      2008.
      First
      question,
      what's
      the
      cold
      start
      idle?
      This
      revs
      at
      3k-4k
      for
      a
      few
      minutes
      before
      finally
      settling
      down
      to
      around
      1500rpm.
      Is
      this
      normal
      or
      do
      i
      have
      a
      problem
      like
      an
      air
      leak?
      Second
      question,
      what's
      the
      PIN
      number
      for
      in
      the
      gauge
      cluster?
      Previous
      owner
      knew
      nothing
      about
      it.
      My
      plans
      are
      to
      turn
      it
      into
      a
      race
      bike.
      I'll
      build
      a
      full
      race
      exhaust,
      front
      facing
      radiators,
      custom
      seat
      and
      subframe,
      rearsets
      etc.
      Thanks
      for
      the
      help.
