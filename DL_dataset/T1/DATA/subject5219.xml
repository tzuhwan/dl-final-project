      When
      steam
      released
      it.
      Last
      year,
      I'm
      not
      sure
      why
      but
      i
      was
      absolutely
      terrible
      at
      it
      and
      i
      made
      no
      progression
      after
      playing
      for
      a
      while,
      still
      pick
      it
      up
      here
      and
      there.

      can
      make

      back

      with
      my

      We

      I
      got
      breakfast
      and
      they
      got
      sandwiches.
      At
      the
      end
      of
      the
      meal
      my
      sister
      wanted
      some
      bacon,
      so
      I
      sat
      my
      side
      plate
      of
      bacon
      down
      in
      the
      middle
      of
      the
      table.
      When
      I #8217;m
      lookin
      Down
      to
      count
      my
      money,
      I
      hear
      a
      glass
      scraping
      sound
      and
      in
      the
      corner
      of
      my
      eye
      I
      see
      the
      plate
      moving.
      Nobody
      touched
      it,
      nothing
      was
      under
      the
      table.
      Slid

      looked

      laying

      fully
      clothed.
      After
      the

      I
      kindly
      told

      Slept

      a
      friends
      house
      early
      in
      the
      high
      school
      years.
      Probably
      freshman
      year,
      I
      slept
      on
      there
      couch.
      Being
      young
      and
      having
      a
      couple
      beers
      the
      night
      before
      I
      was
      KO.
      I
      was
      woken
      up
      by
      his
      little
      sister
      (around
      5yr)
      peeing
      on
      my
      face.
      Lucky
      for
      me,
      she #8217;s
      a
      jokester
      and
      poked
      a
      hole
      in
      a
      water
      bottle.
      I
      was
      still
      mortified
      when
      I
      wokeup
      tho,
      thinking
      I
      was
      being
      pissed
      on.

      Damn.
      That
      sucks.
      Kind
      of
      happened
      to
      me
      before,
      a
      childhood
      friend
      reached
      out
      to
      me
      after
      I
      moved.
      Didn #8217;t
      see
      nor
      hear
      from
      him
      in
      like
      8
      years.
      He
      was
       #8220;interested
      in
      my
      gym
      routine #8221;
      and
       #8220;wanted
      to
      see
      the
      progress
      I #8217;ve
      made #8221;
      one
      toolbag
      mirror
      pic
      later,
      I
      opened
      my
      childhood
      friends
      penis
      in
      a
      Snapchat.
      Guess
      he #8217;s
      gay
      now.

      Probably
      made
      with
      a
      cheaper
      metal
      and
      a
      non-aggressive
      knurling
      since
      its
      for
      softer
      hands,
      not
      body
      builders.
      Will
      wear
      away
      wayyyy
      faster.

      very
      interesting.
      I
      like
      how
      its
      been
      so
      worn
      its
      almost
      polished
      now,
      instead
      of
      the
      brushed
      look
      they
      have.

      my
      best
      friends
      brother
      tried

      failed,
      found
      a

      touched
      it
      up
      in

      shop
      and
      made
      it
      look
      real,
      framed
      it,
      and
      gave
      it
      to
      me.(my
      parents
      brought
      it
      up
      at
      a

      and
      he
      offered

      I #8217;ve
      done
      basically
      the
      same
      thing.
      Brand
      new
      steel
      serious
      headset
      and
      it
      just
      wouldn #8217;t
      play
      discord
      at
      a
      comfortable
      level.
      It
      was
      so
      quite.
      Spent
      weeks
      barely
      hearing
      my
      friends
      and
      going
      back
      and
      fourth
      with
      customer
      support.
      My
      windows
      volume
      was
      turned
      down
      to
      5%
