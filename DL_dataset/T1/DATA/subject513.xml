      This
      is
      an
      art
      toy
      by
      Alex
      Pardee.
      This
      Is
      "Harm"
      the
      Lunatic
      Edition,
      and
      were
      sold
      as
      a
      Spencer's
      exclusive
      in...2006?
      I
      think.
      Each
      of
      these
      came
      with
      a
      tag
      with
      an
      individual
      number
      out
      of
      3000
      made.
      mine
      is
      number
      279.
      I
      saw
      Alex
      Pardee
      at
      an
      art
      show
      a
      couple
      weeks
      ago,
      he
      said
      he
      himself
      no
      longer
      has
      the
      Lunatic
      Edition.
      Take
      care
      of
      that
      plush,
      he
      is
      worth
      a
      bit
      of
      money.

      I
      got
      my
      Sphynx
      Ghost
      from
      a
      similar
      situation.
      The
      previous
      owner
      had
      two
      Maine
      coons
      that
      essentially
      bullied
      Ghost
      and
      wouldn't
      let
      her
      near
      the
      food
      etc.
      She
      was
      her
      first
      owners
      pride
      and
      joy,
      but
      being
      a
      business
      woman,
      things
      got
      out
      of
      hand
      for
      her.
      Ghost
      was
      mostly
      emaciated
      when
      I
      took
      her
      home.
      I
      work
      in
      a
      cat
      specific
      business,
      so
      she
      trusted
      me
      to
      adopt
      her.
      Since
      having
      Ghost,
      I
      have
      never
      had
      a
      problem
      with
      out-of-the-box
      elimination,
      I
      believe
      it's
      because
      she's
      finally
      comfortable.
      She
      sleeps
      next
      to
      me
      every
      night
      and
      is
      my
      breathing
      teddy
      bear.
      Based
      on
      what
      I've
      read
      about
      Sphynx's
      being
      more
      intelligent
      than
      other
      breeds,
      I
      think
      they
      are
      highly
      aware
      of
      their
      'belonging'
      in
      a
      family.

      Hi,
      I'm
      a
      cat
      care
      professional.
      Cats
      that
      board
      at
      our
      facility
      often
      exhibit
      these
      behaviors
      1-3
      days
      after
      arrival.
      Most
      frequently
      cats
      will
      not
      eat
      for
      their
      first
      24
      hours
      with
      us.
      Anything
      over
      72
      hours
      raises
      our
      concerns.
      Defecating
      in
      the
      open
      can
      be
      a
      result
      of
      the
      adjustment,
      but
      if
      it
      persists
      you
      may
      have
      to
      train
      the
      kitten
      yourself.
      Be
      sure
      to
      NOT
      be
      anxious
      or
      worried
      with
      your
      cat,
      they
      seem
      to
      pick
      up
      on
      our
      emotions
      very
      easily
      and
      can
      become
      worried
      or
      nervous
      themselves.
      Spend
      enough
      time
      playing
      with
      your
      kitten,
      but
      also
      give
      the
      kitten
      enough
      space
      to
      explore
      it's
      new
      territory
      and
      familiarize
      with
      its
      surroundings.
      If
      there
      are
      other
      animals
      in
      the
      house
      it
      is
      best
      to
      separate
      them
      until
      the
      kitten
      acclimates.

      Sometimes
      I
      thought
      maybe
      I
      imagined
      them
      having
      water
      and
      bubbles
      in
      them,
      because
      I
      can't
      find
      ANY
      pictures
      or
      documentation
      of
      them
      ever
      being
      this
      way.
      Thanks
      for
      at
      least
      proving
      I
      didn't
      imagine
      it.

      It's
      likely
      you
      need
      a
      bigger
      litter
      box
      for
      your
      cat,
      one
      that
      he
      can
      easily
      turn
      around
      in
      and
      avoid
      stepping
      in
      it.
      Cats
      don't
      like
      being
      covered
      in
      excrement,
      so
      if
      the
      box
      is
      too
      small
      or
      dirty
      it
      might
      cause
      the
      cat
      to
      'hurry'
      to
      be
      done.
      My
      sphynx
      gets
      sloppy
      if
      her
      litter
      box
      isn't
      clean
      each
      time.
      Sphynx's
      usually
      don't
      cover
      up
      their
      feces
      either
      and
      have
      naturally
      stinkier
      poops
      than
      other
      cats.
      Sphynx's
      need
      help
      with
      clean
      up
      sometimes,
      I
      use
      warm
      water
      on
      a
      paper
      towel
      in
      between
      baths.
      As
      for
      the
      shoulder
      jumping,
      a
      client
      of
      mine
      had
      the
      same
      problem
      so
      we
      made
      her
      sort
      of
      wearable
      shoulder
      pads
      out
      of
      an
      upside
      down
      plastic
      carpet
      protector
      (spikey
      plastic).
      Once
      your
      cat
      associates
      shoulders
      as
      unpleasant,
      he
      won't
      do
      it
      anymore.
      Upside
      down
      carpet
      protectors
      are
      a
      great
      way
      to
      keep
      a
      cat
      away
      from
      any
      area.
      There's
      also
      a
      product
      called
      X-Mats
      that
      are
      spiked
      plastic,
      but
      actually
      made
      for
      that
      purpose.

      This
      cat
      was
      covered
      in
      matts,
      also
      had
      loads
      of
      fleas
      and
      flea
      dirt.
      Some
      cats
      actually
      need
      grooming,
      believe
      it
      or
      not.
      This
      particular
      breed
      needs
      regular
      baths
      to
      keep
      them
      from
      getting
      dander
      and
      matts.
      Marshmallow
      here
      is
      very
      calm
      and
      seems
      to
      enjoy
      the
      warm
      water.

      Hi,
      Sunland-Tujunga
      resident
      here.
      What
      this
      article
      doesn't
      explain
      is
      that
      the
      residents
      of
      the
      wash
      were
      and
      still
      are
      (most
      of
      them)
      violent
      meth
      addicts.
      I
      don't
      like
      how
      this
      article
      makes
      it
      seem
      like
      a
      terrible
      inconvenience
      that
      they
      have
      nowhere
      to
      live
      now,
      because
      most
      of
      them
      were
      there
      voluntarily.
      I
      know
      plenty
      of
      people
      my
      age
      (22-26)
      who
      were
      down
      there
      that
      had
      homes
      to
      go
      to,
      but
      chose
      the
      'rebel'
      life.
      These
      are
      the
      ones
      that
      are
      refusing
      housing.
      One
      particular
      dude
      was
      there
      because
      his
      parents
      wouldn't
      let
      him
      have
      a
      dog!
      I
      do
      feel
      bad
      for
      the
      people
      who
      actually
      have
      nowhere
      to
      go,
      but
      this
      had
      to
      be
      done.
      The
      violence
      and
      peace
      disturbances
      were
      getting
      out
      of
      control:
      cars
      broken
      into
      every
      night,
      property
      being
      stolen,
      high
      people
      assaulting
      anyone
      who
      looks
      at
      them,
      and
      one
      lady
      was
      even
      killed
      in
      the
      wash
      over
      a
      drug
      dispute.
      Also,
      the
      Tujunga
      watershed
      has
      been
      known
      to
      flood,
      so
      this
      El
      Nino
      year
      we
      may
      have
      seen
      tons
      of
      trash
      and
      pollution
      being
      washed
      away,
      and
      even
      death,
      if
      not
      for
      the
      cleanup.

      What
      is
      with
      people
      who
      cling
      so
      tightly
      to
      cultural
      habits
      like
      this,
      when
      it
      seems
      they
      immigrated
      to
      America
      to
      escape
      such
      practices?
      Why
      even
      bother
      moving
      from
      Palestine
      to
      Illinois
      if
      you
      intend
      to
      perpetuate
      the
      same
      shit
      with
      your
      children?
      I
      just
      can't
      wrap
      my
      head
      around
      a
      parent
      wanting
      her
      children
      to
      experience
      the
      life
      she
      herself
      managed
      to
      escape.
      What
      is
      wrong
      with
      humans?

      In
      my
      line
      of
      work
      I
      am
      required
      to
      have
      an
      extensive
      knowledge
      of
      dog
      and
      cat
      nutrition.
      I've
      found
      that
      there
      is
      a
      brand
      of
      food
      sold
      at
      Wal-Mart
      and
      I
      think
      target
      stores
      called
      Goodlife.
      The
      ingredients
      are
      simple
      and
      there
      is
      no
      corn
      or
      fillers,
      it
      compares
      well
      and
      it
      costs
      about
      half
      as
      much
      as
      the
      big
      name
      brands
      such
      as
      Nutro.
      ~$25.00
      per
      bag.
      I've
      tried
      many
      foods
      with
      my
      sphynx
      from
      expense
      Orijen
      and
      veterinary
      brands
      like
      Royal
      Canin,
      and
      the
      Goodlife
      is
      the
      only
      one
      that
      prevents
      her
      from
      vomiting
      occasionally
      (she
      has
      a
      VERY
      sensitive
      stomach!).
      For
      the
      price
      it
      is
      the
      best
      quality
      for
      cost
      I've
      found.

      Hi,
      I
      work
      for
      a
      dog
      training
      professional
      who
      has
      had
      35+
      years
      training
      experience.
      This
      is
      a
      video
      I
      found
      that
      explains
      very
      accurately
      what
      is
      happening
      with
      your
      dog
      and
      how
      to
      correct
      the
      behavior.
      Like
      he
      says,
      timing
      an
      patience
      are
      essential.
      Please
      watch
      [this
      video]
      (https://youtu.be/bTmc6fjM_y4),
      feel
      free
      to

      me
      any
      questions
      as
      well.

      My

      I
      kept
      looking
      at
      this
      and
      feeling
      slightly
      nostalgic,
      but
      something
      wasn't
      quite
      right.
      I
      remember
      a
      moon
      extruder
      shape.
      After
      a

      There

      furniture
      store
      in
      my
      small
      Los

      suburb
      that
      has
      had
      the

      two
      lamps,
      couch

      I
      was
      a
      kid
      in
      the
      90's.
      The
      store
      is
      open
      every
      day
      but
      I
      have
      never
      seen
      anyone
      go
      in
      or
      out.
      I
      seem
      to
      be
      the
      only
      one
      who
      has
      noticed
      the
      furniture
      has
      never
      changed.

      Yeah

      there's
      no
      photos!
      I
      also
      remember
      them
      bubbling,
      like
      an
      aquarium
      but
      that
      might
      be
      my
      imagination.
      It's
      just
      bizarre
      to
      me
      that
      no
      one
      has
      even
      photographed
      one
      refilled
      years
      later
      for
      demonstration.

      together,
      it's
      flour,
      Italian
      herbs,
      pepper,
      adobo
      chicken
      seasoning,
      and
      garlic
      salt.
      I
      roll
      the
      chicken
      in
      it
      and
      then
      cook
      it
      in
      a
      Pyrex
      dish
      with
      lots
      of
      butter
      for
      40
      mins,
      then
      flip
      and
      baste
      for
      another
      15.
      It
      always
      comes
      out
      juicy
      and
      delicious

      There
      are
      lots
      of
      posts
      about
      this,
      but
      I
      have
      tried
      many
      companies
      and
      have
      found
      actual
      symptom
      relief
      for
      a
      decent
      price
      with
      oil
      from
      CBDistillery.com.
      Their
      oil
      is
      about
      half
      the
      price
      of
      comparing
      companies
      and
      twice
      as
      potent.
      It
      has
      significantly
      helped
      my
      pain
      with
      only
      1/4
      a
      dropper
      a
      day.

      In
      case
      anyone
      from
      the
      San
      Fernando
      Valley
      is
      wondering,
      all
      of
      these
      brightly
      colored
      vans
      that
      say
      "Topless
      Maids"
      "Massage"
      etc
      are
      owned
      by
      one
      man.
      There
      was
      a
      news
      investigation
      video
      I
      can't
      find
      anymore
      where
      they
      called
      him
      and
      hired
      someone
      of
      his
      "Maids."
      He's
      extremely
      mean
      on
      the
      phone,
      and
      of
      course
      the
      Maids
      are
      just
      middle
      aged
      Hispanic
      women
      in
      bras
      doing
      a
      shit
      job
      of
      cleaning.
      Last
      I
      heard
      the
      owner
      was
      suing
      the
      city
      of
      Los
      Angeles,
      probably
      something
      to
      do
      with
      all
      his
      parking
      tickets
      and
      tow
      aways.

      I
      work
      in
      the
      pet
      industry
      and
      nothing
      rustles
      my
      jimmies
      like
      a
      dog
      who
      gets
      praised
      and
      coddled
      for
      negative
      behavior.
      By
      talking
      to
      him
      that
      way
      she
      is
      telling
      him
      she
      agrees
      with
      his
      behaviors.
      I've
      trained
      many
      dogs.
      Rescue
      or
      not,
      with
      the
      right
      training
      this
      food
      aggression/owner
      protection
      could
      easily
      become
      a
      thing
      of
      the
      past.
      I
      have
      been
      told
      however
      that
      some
      owners
      encourage
      this
      with
      their
      dogs
      as

      protection,
      especially
      female
      owners
      which
      I
      get.
      I
      don't
      think
      it's
      an
      excuse
      though,
      because
      my
      dog
      knows
      who
      is
      friendly
      and

      to
      some
      lady
      in
      a
      BeBe
      tank
      top
      with
      two
      Chihuahuas
      in
      store
      bought
      Ewok
      costumes.
      I
      decided
      to
      never
      enter
      a
      costume
      contest
      again.

      I
      owned
      one
      for

      She
      had
      regular
      dentals,
      vet
      visits
      and
      care.
      She
      ate
      like
      this
      too.
      I
      honestly
      just
      put
      it
      down
      to
      Sphynx
      weirdness.

      Well,
      I
      guess
      that's
      because
      cat
      food
      prices
      are
      so
      wildly
      variant,
      it
      depends
      on
      what
      the
      cat
      is
      eating.
      Sphynx
      do
      have
      a
      higher
      metabolism
      from
      having
      no
      hair
      so
      they
      tend
      to
      'run
      hot,'
      a
      little
      warmer
      than
      an
      average
      cat
      to
      make
      up
      for
      no
      insulation.
      My
      cat
      Ghost
      ate
      a
      grain
      free
      food
      that
      cost
      about
      26$
      for
      a
      20lb
      bag
      at
      a
      rate
      of
      I'm
      guessing
      2
      cups
      a
      day.
      She
      also
      ate
      high
      protein
      wet
      food
      from
      Weruva
      that
      would
      cost
      about
      1$/can,
      half
      a
      can
      a
      day.
      I
      don't
      know
      what
      all
      that
      math
      comes
      out
      to
      but
      each
      sphynx
      is
      going
      to
      need
      or
      reject
      it's
      own
      special
      diet
      so
      who
      knows?
      Lol

      It's
      a
      common
      misconception
      that
      they
      are
      hypoallergenic,
      they
      still
      produce
      the
      oils,
      dander
      and
      saliva
      that
      cause
      allergies,
      but
      I
      do
      know
      others
      who
      own
      them
      with
      allergies
      and
      do
      fine
      if
      they
      keep
      up
      with
      the
      bathing.
      They
      get
      crusty
      if
      you
      don't
      wash
      them,
      the
      skin
      oils
      have
      no
      hair
      to
      absorb
      into
      so
      it
      just
      builds
      up
      as
      a
      brown
      sludge
      and
      stains
      your
      furniture.
      Mine
      needed
      a
      bath
      every
      2
      or
      3
      days,
      but
      some
      sphynx
      I've
      met
      need
      it
      like
      every
      other
      day.
      If
      you
      get
      one
      from
      a
      dedicated
      breeder
      they
      should
      spend
      the
      time
      with
      the
      cats
      as
      kittens
      getting
      them
      used
      to
      bathing,
      so
      the
      owner
      will
      be
      able
      to
      do
      it
      with
      ease.
      They
      are
      high
      maintenance,
      especially
      with
      the
      cleaning,
      and
      sometimes
      their
      poops
      smell
      like
      someone
      set
      fire
      to
      a
      garbage
      heap
      in
      the
      middle
      of
      a
      barnyard.
      I
      think
      that
      comes
      from
      the
      high
      metabolism
      thing.
      For
      me
      the
      effort
      was
      worth
      it
      because
      my
      sphynx
      was
      extremely
      lovable,
      cuddly
      and
      sweet.
      I
      adopted
      her
      because
      I
      had
      experience
      from
      my
      career
      in
      the
      pet
      industry,
      and
      her
      original
      owner
      didn't
      realize
      what
      she
      signed
      up
      for
      with
      the
      care.
      Hope
      that
      I
      helped
      explain
      it
      all
      ok,
      haha

      I've
      had
      a
      portion
      of
      a
      song
      from
      Nick
      Jr.
      stuck
      in
      my
      head
      since
      childhood,
      from
      sometime
      between
      1994-1998
      likely.
      I
      seem
      to
      remember
      an
      animation
      of
      a
      little
      girl
      in
      a
      garden
      singing
      to
      her
      tomatoes.
      The
      line
      I
      always
      think
      of
      when
      making
      salad
      is
      "Tiny
      tomato,
      you're
      looking
      green
      today,
      but
      in
      a
      little
      while
      you'll
      be
      juicy
      red..."
      And
      that's
      all.
      It
      wasn't
      a
      full
      length
      show
      but
      maybe
      a
      skit
      during
      commercials?
      If
      anyone
      else
      even
      remembers
      this,
      I'll
      be
      happy.

      Once
      my
      mom
      told
      me
      her
      husband
      (also
      an
      alcoholic)
      had
      purchased
      like
      $100
      worth
      of
      TV
      porn
      over
      a
      month
      and
      she
      didn't
      understand
      why
      I
      was
      laughing.
      I
      said
      "There's
      endless
      free
      porn
      on
      the
      internet
      but
      your
      husband
      is
      afraid
      of
      computers
      and
      removes
      the
      battery
      from
      his
      cellphone
      at
      night
      so
      it
      can't
      listen
      to
      him."
      She
      ended
      up
      just
      kind
      of
      staring
      straight
      ahead
      blankly,
      slack
      jawed
      for
      about
      15
      minutes.
      I
      think
      the
      idea
      amazed
      her
      as
      much
      as
      it
      pissed
      her
      off.
      Unrelated,
      but
      my
      step
      dad
      is
      a
      very
      weird,
      alcoholic
      man.
      He's
      not
      a
      threat
      though
      since
      he
      is
      mostly
      crippled
      on
      one
      side
      of
      his
      body
      and
      is
      very
      non-violent,
      but
      he's
      still
      a
      prick
      and
      I've
      got
      stories.
      He
      had
      an
      alcohol
      fueled
      melt
      down
      one
      day
      where
      he
      got
      naked
      and
      bobbed
      around
      half
      drowning
      in
      the
      pool
      for
      SIX
      HOURS.
      At
      my
      mom's
      request,
      I
      filmed
      him
      choking
      on
      water
      and
      yelling
      "ooooohhhhhhhhhHHHHHHHH!"
      for
      about
      15
      minutes.
      I
      guess
      at
      some
      point
      my
      mom
      told
      him
      about
      this
      video
      after
      she
      pretended
      to
      forget,
      *ahem*
      I
      mean
      forgave
      him,
      and
      for
      about
      3
      months
      he
      would
      pull
      me
      aside
      quickly
      when
      he
      saw
      me
      and
      ask
      if
      I
      had
      deleted
      the
      video.
      Eventually,
      instead
      of
      saying
      no
      I
      said
      "Well,
      I
      could
      say
      yes
      but
      I
      could
      also
      be
      lying.
      I
      could
      have
      deleted
      it
      from
      my
      phone
      but
      it
      could
      also
      be
      stored
      somewhere
      on
      the
      internet
      waiting
      for
      someone
      to
      hack
      in
      and
      get
      it.
      Everybody's
      looking
      for
      the
      video
      of
      the
      naked
      middle-aged
      janitor
      drunkenly
      floating
      like
      an
      idiot.
      I
      sure
      hope
      my
      password
      is
      strong
      enough."
      I
      said
      all
      of
      this
      very
      sarcastically.
      Since
      then,
      my
      mom
      has
      ugly
      cried
      to
      me
      about
      this
      at
      least
      three
      times.
      I
      said
      this
      to
      my
      stepdad
      4
      or
      so
      months
      ago,
      and
      apparently
      he
      asks
      my
      mom
      about
      me
      and
      the
      video
      and
      "the
      hackers"
      DAILY.
      She
      woke
      up
      one
      time
      and
      found
      him
      STANDING
      NEXT
      TO
      HER
      BED
      (Yes
      his
      paranoia
      makes
      him
      sleep
      in
      a
      different
      room
      so
      he
      can
      see
      the
      front
      yard
      at
      night)
      at
      5:00AM,
      staring
      at
      my
      mom
      sleeping.
      When
      she
      woke
      up
      he
      said
      "Do
      you
      think
      that
      video
      was
      high
      enough
      quality
      that
      you
      could
      recognize
      my
      face?"
      That
      was
      pretty
      recent.
      So
      we
      are
      going
      on
      about
      7
      or
      8
      months
      since
      I
      actually
      filmed
      the
      video.
      I've
      been
      told
      he
      sees
      a
      psychiatrist
      and
      goes
      to
      AA
      meetings
      which
      is
      fine,
      but
      I
      guarantee
      he
      isn't
      telling
      his
      shrink
      about
      his
      obsession
      with
      this
      video.
      I
      think
      my
      mom
      excuses
      and
      brushes
      aside
      this
      insane
      behavior
      because
      she
      lives
      for
      someone
      showing
      her
      affection
      with
      flowers,
      gifts
      etc.
      The
      fact
      that
      he
      has
      never
      harmed
      a
      fly
      is
      the
      exact
      opposite
      of
      my
      differently
      insane
      father
      who
      is
      super
      into
      communicating
      with
      his
      fists
      so
      I
      guess
      I
      get
      it.
      It's
      when
      she
      says
      shit
      like
      "See,
      he
      really
      is
      a
      good
      guy
      deep
      down!"
      That
      I
      get
      physically
      ill.
      Anyway,
      alcoholic
      dads
      are
      weird
      is
      my
      point
      I
      guess.
      I
      think
      I'll
      tell
      him
      about
      this
      post
      next
      time
      I
      need
      to
      shake
      things
      up
      with
      him.
      He
      is
      genuinely
      a
      racist
      bigot
      and
      deserves
      it.

      This
      whole
      conversation
      was
      strange.
      Aside
      from
      asking
      general
      shit
      like
      about
      music,
      I
      asked
      why
      his
      profile
      was
      empty.
      He
      said
      "You
      got
      to
      look
      at
      it
      from
      my
      end
      there
      is
      so
      many
      escorts
      fake
      profile
      trannys
      and
      catfish,
      so
      I
      won't
      waste
      my
      time."
      I
      said
      "Most
      fake
      profiles
      are
      empty
      like
      yours."
      And
      you
      can
      see
      his
      response
      of
      "You
      are
      right."
      It
      was
      just
      a
      strange
      interaction
      I
      wanted
      to
      share,
      lol.
      I
      don't
      think
      he
      made
      a
      typo
      at
      all
      with
      can/can't,
      my
      reaction
      would
      have
      made
      him
      realize
      his
      mistake.
      Just
      a
      very
      deadpan
      neg,
      I
      agree.
      Anyway
      it
      fizzled
      after
      this
      because
      I
      made
      sure
      to
      set
      my
      phone
      down
      and
      not
      respond
      for
      over
      an
      hour.

      Hey,
      diagnosed
      with
      UC
      10
      years
      ago.
      I
      know
      that
      UC
      symptoms
      and
      people's
      reactions
      to
      kratom
      can
      both
      be
      wildly
      different,
      and
      I
      am
      far
      from
      an
      expert
      on
      kratom,
      but
      I've
      had
      excellent
      results
      with
      Chocolate
      Bentuangie
      from
      Gothic
      Kratom.
      I
      tried
      a
      couple
      other
      strains
      and
      this
      one
      does
      it
      for
      my
      pain
      and
      cramping.
      Hope
      whatever
      you
      choose
      works
      for
      you!

      What
      a
      coincidence.
      I
      am
      a
      lifelong
      aquarium
      enthusiast
      and
      I
      saw
      a
      post
      my
      friend
      made
      on
      Facebook.
      I
      politely
      raged
      in
      a
      paragraph
      I
      spent
      10
      minutes
      typing
      explaining
      why
      this
      is
      absolutely
      horrible
      and
      heartbreaking
      and
      the
      response
      I
      got
      was
      just
      "Ya
      they
      died
      already."

      Bettas
      will
      usually
      live
      harmoniously
      in
      a
      tropical
      tank,
      if
      it's
      big
      enough
      and
      it's
      not
      overstocked.
      Had
      one
      in
      my
      60
      gallon
      that
      was
      quite
      happy.
      They
      CAN
      live
      in
      small
      bowls
      with
      no
      oxygen
      or
      heater,
      but
      it's
      really
      not
      right
      as
      they
      will
      die
      prematurely.
      They
      really
      thrive
      in
      an
      aquarium
      setting.

      Filters
      are
      just
      one
      thing,
      they
      are
      important
      for
      more
      reasons
      than
      cleaning
      a
      fish's
      poop
      but
      there's
      so
      much
      more
      to
      keeping
      an
      aquarium
      than
      a
      filter.
      Most
      fish,
      including
      goldfish
      need
      a
      specific
      temperature,
      so
      a
      heater
      is
      needed.
      Most
      freshwater
      fish
      are
      tropical
      so
      the
      tanks
      should
      be
      somewhere
      between
      72-78
      F #176;
      on
      average
      at
      all
      times.
      Next,
      water
      that
      doesn't
      move
      loses
      all
      it's
      oxygen,
      and
      disease/algae
      will
      take
      foot.
      Without
      an
      air
      stone
      they
      will
      usually
      suffocate.
      Lastly
      water
      in
      aquariums
      needs
      to
      "cycle"
      and
      build
      up
      bacteria,
      creating
      an
      ecosystem
      essentially.
      The
      healthy
      bacteria
      resides
      in
      the
      filter
      media,
      so
      that's
      why
      during
      cleaning
      you
      never
      rinse
      the
      filter
      in
      tap
      water,
      instead
      rinse
      with
      water
      from
      the
      tank
      so
      you
      don't
      destroy
      your
      ecosystem.
      None
      of
      this
      is
      possible
      in
      a
      bowl,
      and
      constantly
      changing
      the
      water
      and
      killing
      the
      cycle
      will
      shock
      your
      fish,
      make
      it
      sick,
      etc.
      Water
      also
      needs
      to
      be
      treated
      with
      certain
      chemicals
      like
      dechlorinator,
      pH
      balancers,
      nitrite
      and
      nitrate
      balancers,
      and
      on
      and
      on.
      The
      point
      of
      aquariums
      (at
      least
      what
      I
      believe)
      is
      to
      replicate
      your
      pet
      fish's
      natural
      environment
      as
      best
      as
      you
      can.
      I
      know
      a
      lot
      of
      people
      don't
      consider
      them
      to
      be
      on
      the
      same
      "level"
      of
      pet
      as
      a
      dog
      or
      a
      cat,
      but
      they
      definitely
      aren't
      for
      decoration
      either.
      Hope
      that
      helps
      explain
      why
      bowls
      are
      like
      locking
      a
      human
      in
      an
      airtight
      port-a-potty

      I
      was
      having
      a
      conversation
      with
      a
      friend
      when
      we
      took
      her
      children
      to
      a
      park.
      In
      the
      90's,
      parks
      were
      legit.
      We
      had
      these
      spiral
      poles
      (installed
      correctly.)
      The
      parks
      near
      my
      house
      had
      straight
      rails
      with
      a
      sliding
      handle
      so
      you
      could
      push
      yourself
      off
      the
      ledge
      and
      slide
      to
      the
      other
      ledge.
      One
      park
      had
      a
      huge
      segmented
      bridge
      where
      if
      two
      kids
      jumped
      in
      time,
      it
      would
      bounce
      you
      into
      the
      air.
      We
      had
      really
      awesome
      sand
      playgrounds
      where
      you
      could
      pour
      sand
      into
      bowls
      and
      it
      would
      run
      through
      a
      hole
      like
      a
      water
      feature,
      and
      do
      a
      bunch
      of
      other
      cool
      stuff
      with
      sand.
      I
      remember
      getting
      sick
      on
      a
      giant
      sideways
      tire
      swing
      from
      spinning.
      I
      loved
      playing
      with
      my
      mom
      on
      the
      giant
      rolling
      tic
      tac
      toe
      board.
      The
      riding
      animals
      on
      springs
      were
      always
      fun
      and
      occasionally
      you
      could
      even
      find
      a
      teeter
      todder.
      While
      I
      was
      at
      this
      park
      with
      my
      friend
      and
      her
      kids
      last
      month,
      I
      looked
      around.
      This
      "playground"
      had
      a
      staircase
      up
      to
      a
      platform,
      a
      ramp,
      a
      3
      foot
      slide,
      some
      kind
      of
      lame
      "find
      the
      hidden
      shapes"
      game,
      swings
      for
      babies
      only,
      and
      another
      ramp.
      Where
      the
      hell
      is
      the
      good
      shit?
      The
      fun
      shit?
      All
      of
      the
      kids
      would
      go
      up,
      slide
      down,
      then
      RUN
      OFF
      to
      see
      the
      skate
      park,
      out
      of
      sight,
      anywhere
      else
      but
      the
      playground.
      The
      point
      of
      the
      playground
      is
      to
      entertain
      your
      kids
      so
      you
      can
      keep
      an
      eye
      on
      them.
      I
      constantly
      saw
      mom's
      running
      after
      toddlers
      headed
      towards
      the
      street.
      This
      park
      sucks
      and
      I've
      been
      noticing
      as
      equipment
      from
      my
      childhood
      is
      ripped
      out,
      it's
      replaced
      by
      this
      "kid
      in
      a
      safety
      bubble"
      type
      playground.
      People
      need
      to
      realize
      getting
      hurt
      while
      playing
      is
      part
      of
      growing
      up
      and
      nothing
      to
      sue
      the
      fucking
      city
      over.
      I'd
      rather
      my
      child
      get
      a
      scrape
      and
      learn
      a
      lesson
      than
      see
      them
      get
      hit
      by
      a
      car.
