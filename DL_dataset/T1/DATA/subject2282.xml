      I'm
      getting
      considerably
      more
      money
      on
      my
      tax
      return
      than
      I
      expected
      and
      have
      always
      wanted
      to
      go
      out
      west.
      I
      spent
      some
      time
      searching
      flights
      today
      and
      SLC
      is
      one
      of
      the
      cheaper
      flights
      I
      could
      find.
      I'm
      a
      practicing
      Catholic
      but
      I've
      very
      recently
      become
      interested
      in
      the
      LDS
      movement
      on
      an
      academic/general
      interest
      level
      and
      thought
      it'd
      be
      interesting
      to
      see
      where
      the
      church
      is
      headquartered.
      However,
      I
      don't
      want
      to
      just
      see
      church
      related
      stuff
      if
      I
      go.
      I
      love
      getting
      into
      a
      city,
      doing
      non-touristy
      things,
      eating
      where
      the
      locals
      eat,
      so
      I'd
      like
      to
      get
      some
      advice
      on
      the
      city
      itself.
      Are
      there
      fun
      activities
      for
      non-Mormons?
      I'm
      hopefully
      planning
      to
      travel
      in
      May
      or
      July.
      I
      have
      a
      pretty
      decent
      budget
      to
      work
      with
      and
      I'm
      a
      history
      teacher
      so
      museums
      and
      historic
      sites
      are
      a
      win-win.
      Anything
      relating
      to
      food
      too,
      and
      maybe
      some
      bars
      (I
      know,
      bars
      in
      Utah
      are
      weird
      but
      figured
      I
      try).
      Feel
      free
      to
      suggest
      church
      related
      stuff
      too.
      Thanks!

      The
      Dalai
      Lama
      has
      said
      in
      the
      past
      that
      he
      himself
      (the
      14th
      of
      course)
      might
      be
      "The
      last
      Dalai
      Lama."
      Could
      you
      expand
      a
      bit
      on
      the
      sentiments
      behind
      this
      statement
      and
      how
      you
      think
      Tibet
      itself
      would
      react
      if
      this
      centuries-old
      institution
      were
      suddenly
      to
      end?

      The
      origin
      of
      the
      meal
      itself
      is
      murky.
      But
      the
      word
      "brunch"
      was
      coined
      by
      Guy
      Beringer
      in
      1895
      in
      an
      article
      entitled
      "Brunch:
      A
      Plea"
      in
      a
      periodical
      called
      Hunter's
      Weekly.
      He
      claimed
      it
      as
      a
      meal
      for
      "Saturday
      night
      carousers."

      I've
      researched
      WWII
      pretty
      extensively,
      but
      have
      never
      really
      delved
      into
      the
      ins
      and
      outs
      of
      the
      military
      administration
      in
      France
      (I'm
      more
      interested
      in
      the
      Russian
      front).
      I
      know
      about
      the
      blitz
      and
      the
      subsequent
      fall
      of
      the
      third
      republic,
      but
      what
      was
      the
      impact
      on
      the
      French
      people
      in
      their
      day
      to
      day
      lives?
      Was
      collaboration
      widespread?
      Why
      wasn't
      there
      a
      larger
      resistance
      effort?
      Feel
      free
      to
      recommend
      books
      and
      articles
      as
      well.

      I'm
      fairly
      new
      to
      reddit
      and
      to
      this
      sub
      in
      general,
      but
      just
      want
      to
      say
      I'm
      really
      enjoying
      it
      so
      far!
      Anyway,
      I've
      been
      obsessed
      with
      Mormonism
      recently.
      I
      finished
      up
      with
      Matthew
      Bowman's
      *The
      Mormon
      People:
      The
      Making
      of
      an
      American
      Faith*
      and
      I'm
      currently
      working
      on
      Richard
      Lyman
      Bushman's
      *Joseph
      Smith:
      Rough
      Stone
      Rolling*.
      I
      have
      to
      say
      it's
      one
      of
      the
      more
      engaging
      biographies
      I've
      come
      across
      in
      quite
      some
      time.
      It's
      one
      of
      the
      few
      volumes
      you're
      likely
      to
      find
      on
      a
      professional
      historian's
      shelf
      as
      well
      as
      a
      practicing
      member
      of
      the
      LDS
      church.
      Bushman
      does
      an
      excellent
      job
      of
      weaving
      Joseph's
      story
      into
      the
      larger
      fabric
      of
      religious
      experience
      in
      the
      early
      1800's
      and,
      in
      doing
      so,
      describes
      the
      development
      of
      early
      Mormon
      doctrine.
      If
      anybody
      else
      has
      read
      it,
      I
      welcome
      your
      thoughts.
      I'd
      also
      like
      to
      request
      any
      other
      recommendations
      on
      LDS
      history,
      biography
      or
      otherwise.

      There's
      a
      particularly
      great
      firsthand
      account
      called
      *My
      Reminiscences
      of
      East
      Africa*
      by
      Lt.
      Col.
      Paul
      Emil
      Von
      Lettow-Vorbeck,
      who
      led
      the
      German
      East
      African
      Campaign.
      It's
      not
      an
      overall
      study
      of
      the
      African
      theatre,
      but
      if
      you
      want
      to
      read
      about
      how
      a
      few
      thousand
      Germans
      and
      Africans
      led
      one
      of
      the
      most
      successful
      guerrilla
      campaigns
      of
      all
      time
      then
      I
      highly
      recommend
      it.

      A
      while
      back
      I
      did
      a
      study
      on
      the
      historiography
      of
      the
      Russian
      Revolution.
      Unsurprisingly,
      during
      the
      Cold
      War,
      you
      had
      the
      pro-Soviet
      camp
      and
      the
      pro-Western
      camp.
      More
      recently,
      there've
      been
      the
      revisionist
      historiographers
      who
      try
      to
      view
      the
      revolution
      through
      different
      analytical
      approaches.
      Since
      I've
      been
      away
      from
      it
      for
      a
      while,
      I
      was
      wondering
      if
      anybody
      could
      explain
      or
      list
      some
      newer
      approaches
      or
      authors?

      So
      I'm
      curious
      and
      really
      really
      want
      to
      go
      to
      my
      first
      Latin
      mass.
      Luckily,
      I
      live
      in
      central
      PA
      and
      the
      diocese
      of
      Harrisburg
      has
      a
      Latin
      mass
      community
      that
      celebrates
      high
      mass
      every
      Sunday.
      But
      the
      more
      I
      look
      into
      it,
      the
      more
      daunting
      it
      seems.
      Are
      there
      any
      resources
      on
      what
      to
      do/say
      during
      the
      course
      of
      the
      mass?
      A
      step
      by
      step
      guide?
      If
      I
      can't
      completely
      understand
      it,
      is
      it
      going
      to
      be
      as
      spiritually
      fulfilling?

      Harrisburg
      is

      bit
      ignorant
      in
      terms
      of
      the
      Crusades.
      As
      a
      catholic
      I
      feel
      like
      I
      should
      rectify
      this
      immediately,
      so
      I'd
      like
      some
      recommendations
      on
      books,
      articles,
      etc.
      on
      the
      crusades
      OVERALL.
      Not
      just
      the
      first,
      second
      crusade,
      etc.
      Even
      if
      the
      sources
      are
      rather
      large,
      I
      don't
      much
      mind.
      I'd
      rather
      have
      more
      recent
      works
      but
      if
      there's
      a
      particular
      work
      that
      is
      older
      and
      you
      feel
      it
      necessary
      to
      list,
      go
      right
      ahead.

      Just
      for
      background,
      I
      grew
      up
      around
      chew.
      My
      dad
      does
      it,
      my
      bro,
      few
      of
      my
      frat
      brothers.
      So
      it
      was
      always
      around.
      First
      tried
      when
      I
      got
      into
      managing
      my
      HS
      baseball
      team.
      Apart
      from
      that,
      I
      do
      theatre,
      love
      anime,
      write
      poems,
      and
      I
      currently
      teach
      religion
      at
      a
      catholic
      high
      school.
      I
      also
      look
      like
      a
      red
      headed
      long
      lost
      member
      of
      weezer:
      thick
      black
      glasses,
      mostly
      dress
      in
      button
      up
      shirts,
      skinny
      corduroys/jeans.
      The
      whole
      "stereotype"
      thing
      came
      in
      when
      I
      went
      this
      past
      week
      for
      a
      bachelor
      party
      in
      Kentucky
      and
      went
      to
      a
      corner
      store
      in
      Louisville.
      I
      swear
      the
      cashier
      started
      reaching
      for
      American
      Spirits
      before
      I
      said
      "No
      I
      want
      a
      can
      of
      Cope
      Mint."
      He
      just
      looked
      at
      me
      haha.
      Just
      wondering
      if
      anybody
      else
      doesn't
      fit
      the
      script.
      If
      you
      do,
      that's
      fine
      but
      I
      never
      really
      thought
      it
      was
      so
      prevalent!

      So
      being
      a
      typical
      millennial,
      I
      was
      laid
      off
      and
      am
      still
      exploring
      options
      at
      27
      years
      old.
      I've
      always
      thought
      I'd
      make
      a
      decent
      TV
      critic.
      I
      studied
      AP
      Lit
      in
      high
      school,
      went
      on

      lit
      in
      college,
      took
      some
      film
      courses
      but
      ended
      up
      a
      social
      science
      education
      major
      so
      I
      feel
      like
      that
      background
      would
      help
      me
      a
      bit
      in
      analyzing
      human
      behavior
      in
      TV.
      I'm
      just
      wondering
      if
      there
      are
      any
      critics
      on
      here
      (amateur
      or
      pro)
      who've
      had
      experience
      in
      writing
      for
      publications?
      If
      so,
      I'd
      appreciate
      advice/info!
      Thanks!

      Hi,
      I'm
      a
      total
      Latin
      amateur
      so
      I
      was
      wondering
      if
      someone
      could
      translate
      this
      phrase
      for
      me:
      "With
      a
      new
      world
      in
      our
      hands."
      It's
      a
      possible
      tattoo
      for
      me
      so
      I
      just
      want
      to
      see
      if
      I
      like
      the
      Latin
      version
      which
      I'd
      like
      to
      have
      more.
      My
      translation
      app
      gave
      me
      this:
      "Cum
      in
      novum
      orbem
      terrarum
      manus."
      Which
      translated
      to
      "since
      the
      new
      world
      around
      them."
      Sooooo,
      yeah
      need
      some
      help!
      Thanks!

      So
      I'm
      trying
      to
      introduce
      my
      friend
      to
      the
      glory
      of
      CBB
      with
      but

      click
      of
      a
      mouse,
      my
      dear
      boy!
      I
      just
      need
      some
      advice
      on
      which

      first.
      I
      wanted
      to
      send
      150,
      Time
      Bobby
      but

      behind
      the
      paywalllllll.
      So
      recommend
      an
      episode
      available
      through
      iTunes,
      Spotify,
      YouTube,
      wherever.

      he's

      That'd

      A
      friend
      of
      mine
      have
      a
      bit
      of
      a
      pact
      this
      new
      year.
      We
      both
      work
      at
      a
      book
      store
      and
      while
      preparing
      a
      leading
      list
      for
      the
      coming
      months
      we
      said
      we #8217;d
      pick
      a
      book
      for
      each
      other.
      She
      reads
      mostly
      fiction
      so
      that #8217;ll
      be
      my
      lot
      but
      she
      knows
      very
      little
      about
      WWI
      and
      that
      happens
      to
      be
      one
      of
      my
      favorite
      areas
      of
      study
      and
      I
      need
      a
      recommendation
      on
      a
      WWI
      book
      to
      sort
      of
       #8220;introduce #8221;
      the
      war
      to
      my
      friend.
      My
      only
      limitations
      are
      that
      it
      can #8217;t
      be
       #8220;too
      academic #8221;
       #8220;not
      real
      real
      thick. #8221;
      I

      maybe
      a

      popular
      history,
      written
      for
      general

      Just
      to
      be
      clear,
      I #8217;m
      a
      lifelong
      Catholic.
      I
      went
      to
      catholic
      school
      all
      my
      life
      and
      abstaining
      from
      meat
      was
      portrayed
      as
      an
      old
      thing
      that
      Vatican
      II
       #8220;got
      rid
      of. #8221;
      I #8217;ve
      read
      US
      bishops
      statements,
      this
      and
      that
      church
      document,
      and
      I #8217;m
      no
      more
      clear
      to
      understanding
      if
      the
      abstention
      from
      meat
      on
      Friday #8217;s
      should
      still
      be
      practiced.
      It #8217;s
      something
      I #8217;d
      LIKE
      to
      do
      outside
      Lent
      but
      is
      there
      anything
      out
      there
      that
      definitively
      supports
      it?

      I
      believe
       #8220;the
      mountains #8221;
      refers
      to
      Spain
      actually.
      I #8217;ve
      gathered
      that
      the
      Philip
      mentioned
      in
      the
      middle
      part
      is
      Philip
      IV
      of
      Spain,
      who
      was
      known
      to
      be
      quite
      religious.

      I
      follow
      a
      lot
      of
      Catholic
      pages
      on
      Facebook,
      Twitter
      etc.
      and
      a
      good
      many
      seem
      to
      be
      run
      by
      Trads.
      I #8217;ve
      noticed
      a
      whole
      heck
      of
      a
      lot
      of
      criticism
      and
      outright
      bashing
      of
      the
      Jesuits
      on
      such
      platforms,
      especially
      James
      Martin.
      I
      consider
      myself
      a
      bit
      of
      a
      Trad
      (I
      prefer
      Latin
      mass,
      I #8217;m
      a
      stickler
      for
      tradition,
      etc.)
      but
      the
      criticism
      of
      the
      Jesuits
      perplexes
      me.
      Any
      ideas
      on
      why
      this
      is?

      I #8217;m

      old
      CyberNatuons
      guy
      from
      way
      back
      when.
      Was

      was

      has
      been
      dying
      for
      some
      time.
      Read
      that
      a
      lot
      of
      the
      old
      CN
      community
      moved
      over

      this

      I #8217;m
      just
      curious
      about
      how
      it
      is
      set
      up.
      Can
      everything
      be
      done
      in
      game
      or
      is
      alliance
      building,
      etc
      still
      done
      through
      offsite
      forums?
      Any
      kind
      of
      summary/breakdown
      is
      appreciated!

      It
      sounds
      a
      bit
      cliche
      but
      I #8217;ve
      found
      my
      interfaith
      experiences
      to
      be
      highly
      enriching.
      Full
      background/disclosure,
      I
      consider
      myself
      a
      bit
      of
      a
      trad
      liturgically
      (I
      like
      my
      Latin,
      my
      incense,
      etc.)
      but
      identify
      strongly
      with
      the
      Catholic
      Worker
      and
      volunteer
      with
      them
      extensively.
      But
      getting
      back
      on
      subject,
      I #8217;ve
      been
      to
      a
      synagogue,
      mosque,
      even
      a
      Buddhist
      thing
      and
      leaving
      all
      of
      them
      found
      myself
      more
      dedicated
      to
      the
      faith
      than
      ever.
      Just
      curious
      on
      hearing
      about
      your
      interfaith
      experiences.
      (Funny
      enough,
      have
      never
      had
      the
      same
      experience
      at
      any
      Protestant
      places
      of
      worship.)

      Thank
      you
      so
      much
      for
      posting
      this!
      I
      love
      learning
      about
      Christianity
      in
      Japan.
      I
      did
      a
      bit
      of
      digging
      on
      this
      rebellion
      and
      surprisingly
      there #8217;s
      only
      one
      decent
      scholarly
      study
      on
      it
      titled
      [Christ #8217;s
      Samurai:
      The
      True
      Story
      of
      the
      Shimabara
      Rebellion](https://www.amazon.com/Christs-Samurai-Story-Shimabara-Rebellion-ebook/dp/B012E3LPM2/ref=nodl_)
      by
      Jonathan
      Clements.
      Had
      to
      buy
      a
      copy
      ASAP!
      It #8217;s
      amazing
      the
      amount
      of
      attention
      given
      to
      the
      stories
      of
      Christians
      in
      Japan
      and
      the
      rest
      of
      the
      Far
      East
      in
      the
      last
      couple
      of
      years.
      Even
      when
      I
      took
      History
      of
      Japan
      at
      college
      (in
      2008),
      it
      was
      only
      lightly
      mentioned
      and
      the
      historiography
      left
      a
      lot
      to
      be
      desired.
      I
      wonder
      if
      they #8217;ve
      been
      considered
      for
      canonization
      as
      martyrs?

      So
      while
      I
      was
      watching
      last
      night,
      I
      took
      in
      all
      the
      craziness,
      and
      stewed
      with
      it
      for
      a
      bit.
      I #8217;m
      a
      grad
      student
      of
      history
      and
      thought
      back
      to
      my
      Euro
      courses.
      Did
      ANYBODY
      else
      notice
      Tyrion
      essentially
      created
      the
      Polish-Lithuanian
      Commonwealth?
      Which
      was
      basically
      an
      elective
      monarchy?
      And
      that
      the
      history
      of
      said
      commonwealth
      is....
      not
      great?

      Have
      either
      of
      you
      ever
      visited
      a
      Catholic
      school?
      It #8217;s
      not
      just
       #8220;rich
      kids #8221;
      I
      can
      attest.
      My
      parents
      worked
      their
      asses
      off
      because
      they
      wanted
      to
      send
      us
      to
      a
      school
      that
      taught
      both
      skills
      for
      life
      and
      morality.
      We #8217;re
      far
      from
       #8220;rich #8221;
      but
      they
      made
      it
      happen
      and
      it
      was
      far
      from
       #8220;thousands
      of
      dollars #8221;
      All
      this
      tax
      credit
      lessening
      does
      is
      take
      away
      school
      choice
      from
      parents
      and
      that #8217;s
      not
      right.
      We
      shouldn #8217;t
      be
      forced
      into
      the
      public
      school
      system
      just
      because
      they #8217;re
      failing.

      First
      off,
      I #8217;m
      unmarried.
      But
      my
      brother
      was
      married
      in
      the
      church
      over
      a
      year
      ago.
      His
      wife
      left
      him
      after
      a
      few
      months.
      He #8217;s
      moved
      on
      and
      is
      doing
      fine
      but
      he #8217;s
      applied
      for
      an
      annulment.
      He #8217;s
      been
      going
      back
      to
      mass
      and
      I #8217;m
      overjoyed
      at
      this.
      I #8217;ve
      been
      a
      faithful
      son
      of
      the
      Church
      for
      my
      entire
      life
      but
      annulments
      remain
      a
      point
      of
      confusion.
      They
      never
      really
      came
      up
      in
      my
      theology
      classes
      at
      university
      either.
      Are
      there
      any
      resources
      to
      learn
      more
      about
      this
      according
      to
      Canon
      Law
      in
      plain
      terms?
      Does
      every
      annulment
      really
      go
      all
      the
      way
      to
      the
      Rota?
      Anything
      is
      appreciated.

      I #8217;m
      recovering
      and
      have
      always
      practiced,
      going
      to
      mass
      every
      Sunday
      for
      a
      long
      time.
      I #8217;ve
      had
      a
      drinking
      problem
      for
      a
      while
      and
      really
      only
      abstained
      on
      Sundays.
      My
      therapist
      recommended
      I
      go
      to
      an
      AA
      meeting,
      and
      I #8217;ve
      been
      sober
      for
      a
      few
      months
      now.
      But
      does
      the
      Church
      look
      favorably
      on
      AA?
      If
      there #8217;s
      other
      avenues
      more
      in
      line
      with
      the
      Church
      I #8217;ll
      check
      them
      out,
      but
      it
      seems
      ok
      at
      this
      point.
      Just
      seeing
      if
      there
      are
      others
      out
      there
      that
      are
      Catholic
      and
      have
      gone
      to
      meetings.

      of
      Poznan
      said
      in
      a
      statement
      on
      August
      8.
       #8220;But
      respect
      for
      specific
      people
      cannot
      lead
      to
      accepting
      an
      ideology
      which
      aims
      at
      a
      revolution
      in
      social
      norms
      and
      interpersonal
      relations.
      This
      revolution
      in
      custom
      and
      morals,
      as
      Pope
      Francis
      stresses,
      often
      brandishes
      a
      flag
      of
      freedom,
      while
      in
      reality
      inflicting
      spiritual
      and
      material
      devastation, #8221;
      he
      said
      in
      response
      to
      ongoing
      disputes
      between
      church
      leaders
      and
      LGBTQ
      groups. #8221; #8221;
      This
      is
      LITERALLY
       #8220;hate
      the
      sin
      love
      the
      sinner #8221;
      embodied.
      The
      mental
      gymnastics
      these
      people
      do
      to
      think
      that
       #8220;tolerance #8221;
      and
       #8220;endorsement #8221;
      are
      the
      same
      thing
      is
      amazing.

      Understood!
      I
      just
      think
      the
       #8220;left-right #8221;
      paradigm
      is
      really
      damaging.
      Catholicism
      is
      neither
      a
      liberal
      nor
      conservative
      denomination
      so
      I
      just
      try
      to
      avoid
      classifying
      issues
      as
      such!
      All
      that
      matters
      is
      uniting
      people
      to
      Jesus,
      His
      Body,
      the
      Church,
      and
      His
      people
      guided
      by
      the
      Holy
      Spirit!

      I
      completely
      agree
      with
      you
      on
      those
      points,

      a

      wanted

      move
      there
      for
      a
      few
      years,
      see
      the
      historic
      sites,
      get
      to
      the
      first-hand
      sources
      in
      the
      libraries
      and
      write
      a
      book.
      There
      are
      things
      there
      I
      just
      can #8217;t
      access
      here
      in
      the

      Please
      come
      back
      to
      the
      Church.
      Catholicism
      is
      the

      branch
      of
      Christianity
      that
