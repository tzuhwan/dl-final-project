      I've
      had
      feelings
      of
      time
      distortion
      a
      lot
      on
      lsd.
      Just
      chill
      and
      let
      it
      happen
      man,
      its
      going
      to
      be
      fine.

      its
      fresh
      bro,
      id
      sync
      the
      heartbeats
      and
      the
      melody
      at
      the
      beginning
      if
      i
      were
      you.
      also
      the
      drum
      patterns
      feel
      a
      bit
      lacking;
      if
      you
      boosted
      that
      kick
      and
      put
      a
      fattenner
      on
      it,
      the
      track
      might
      feel
      more
      full.
      also
      if
      you
      added
      some
      snare
      variation
      and
      more
      perc
      variation
      it
      might
      make
      the
      patterns
      feel
      more
      natural
      and
      warm.
      thats
      just
      my
      2
      cents
      tho,
      its
      pretty
      dope.

      great
      stuff,
      i
      love
      how
      energetic
      the
      song
      sounds,
      especially
      with
      the
      abrupt
      stops
      and
      starts.
      also
      your
      samples
      are
      on
      point,
      quality
      sounding
      instruments
      put
      together
      for
      a
      fresh
      song.

      im
      not
      hip
      to
      the
      genre
      but
      that
      was
      pretty
      fresh,
      i
      liked
      the
      clean
      samples
      and
      vocals.
      it
      got
      a
      bit
      repetitive
      at
      times
      but
      i
      might
      just
      not
      be
      sensitive
      to
      the
      genre.
      love
      the

      man
      i

      edit:
      the

      you
      used
      your

      gives

      yo
      i
      fuck
      with
      the
      style,
      i
      checked
      out
      your
      other
      song
      and
      the
      flow
      on
      that
      one
      sounds
      more
      natural.
      you
      sound
      kind
      of
      nervous
      to
      be
      on
      the

      try
      and
      smoke
      a
      blunt
      and
      just
      chill
      out
      on
      it.
      dont
      give
      up
      just
      rapping
      and
      eventually
      you
      will
      get
      to

      you
      can
      control
      your

      Both
      tracks
      feel
      very
      full
      and
      warm,
      if
      a
      little
      repetitive.
      Try
      adding
      parts
      to
      the
      song
      that
      sound
      more
      empty
      and
      it
      will
      make
      the
      stronger
      parts
      stand
      out
      better,
      as
      well
      as
      give
      the
      song
      more
      structure
      so
      it
      sounds
      more
      like
      a
      cohesive
      piece
      rather
      than
      an
      isolated
      section.
      I
      do
      like
      the
      vibe
      and
      the
      samples,
      it
      feels
      very
      lively
      and
      alive.

      wow
      dude!!!
      holy
      shit
      love
      the
      samples,
      reminds
      me
      of
      some
      old
      chill
      shit.
      I
      really
      dig
      it,
      the
      use
      of
      vocals
      keeps
      the
      track
      from
      getting
      stale,
      and
      the
      switch
      up
      near
      the
      end
      is
      too
      fresh.
      i
      really
      fuck
      with
      the
      style,
      hit
      me

      your
      high
      frequencies
      sound
      alittle
      sharp,
      you

      the
      808s
      +
      boosting
      low
      band
      but
      manage
      the
      cutoff
      so
      that
      it
      doesnt
      muddy

      makes

      louder.

      make
      any

      thanks
      for
      the
      feedback!
      I
      do
      tend
      to
      keep
      things
      very
      spaced
      out,
      ill
      try
      bringing
      out
      the
      melody
      more.
      I'm
      trying
      to
      get
      better
      at
      making
      my
      own
      melodies
      instead
      of
      relying
      on
      samples,
      do
      you
      have
      any
      advice
      for
      how
      the
      melody
      itself
      sounds?

      yo
      even
      tho
      you
      say
      you
      arent
      a
      rapper,
      i
      think
      you
      killed
      it.
      you
      got
      natural
      ability,
      hone
      that
      shit

      woo!!!!
      sheesh!!!
      that
      went
      in
      in
      a
      real
      way,
      but
      mellow.
      I
      like
      it
      dude,
      i
      really
      dig
      the
      synths
      personally
      the
      shit
      that
      comes
      in
      kinda
      near
      the
      halfway
      point
      is
      super
      duper
      chill.
      i
      like
      how
      subtle
      the
      808s
      are

      i
      like
      the
      mix,
      those
      horns/hits
      really
      went
      hard,
      the
      kick
      is
      a
      little
      bit
      weak,
      try
      adding
      some
      HEAVVVVY
      ASS
      808s!!!!!!!
      that
      shit
      would
      COMPLETE
      this
      song
      mane.

      its
      fresh
      dog,
      i
      like
      the
      delay
      on
      those
      vocals.
      like
      someone
      else
      said
      its
      dissonant
      but
      i
      like
      that
      and
      think
      it
      fits
      personally.
      the
      808s
      could
      use
      some
      beef
      and
      flavor
      (lmao)
      but
      i
      think
      overall
      it
      goes
      hard.
      and
      speaking
      on
      the
      rapping,
      i
      honestly
      fucking
      LOVE
      the
      style,
      its
      so
      fresh

      its
      a
      cool
      concept
      and
      sounds
      pretty
      nice,
      issues
      with
      the
      mixing
      aside,
      but
      it
      gets
      very
      repetitive
      (to
      me
      at
      least).
      try
      adding
      more
      variance
      in
      the
      song
      to
      give
      it
      a
      flow
      and
      to
      change
      up
      what
      the
      listeners
      are
      hearing.
      trying
      raising
      or
      lowering
      volume
      with
      an
      envelope
      to

      buildup
      try
      putting
      EQs
      mix
      envelopes
      that
      change
      the
      eq
      periodically
      to
      give
      the
      song
      a
      'varied'
      feel..
      change
      patterns
      and
      shit
      to
      sound
      more
      varied

      it
      just
      feels
      very
      'in
      your
      face',
      in
      the
      end
      its
      all
      just
      a
      matter
      of
      preference
      but
      i
      would
      have
      used
      more
      compression
      and
      eqing
      to
      mellow
      out
      some
      of
      the
      sharper
      ends.
      Its
      definitely
      good,
      i'm
      just
      saying
      it
      could
      be
      a
      bit
      better.

      unique
      and
      i
      fuck
      with

      maybe
      cop
      izotope
      maximizer
      or
      something
      and
      learn
      to
      mix
      it
      louder
      and
      more
      fully

      its

      good
      looks.
      yea
      that
      cowbell
      is
      kinda
      corny,
      i
      have
      a
      soft
      spot
      for
      cowbells
      haha.
      im
      still
      learning
      to
      mix
      in
      vocals,
      and
      i
      appreciate
      your

      damn
      this
      sounds
      so
      full
      and
      fleshed
      out,
      it
      bursting
      with
      energy
      and
      very
      effectively
      conveys
      a
      mood.
      the
      vocals
      were
      interesting.
      i
      liked
      how
      you
      had
      kind
      of
      a
      break
      from
      the
      808s
      and
      drums
      in
      the
      middle,
      and
      alternation
      between
      the
      full
      out
      melody
      and
      the
      calmer
      melody
      that
      retained
      the
      drums.
      its
      a
      g
      reat
      song

      i
      like
      your
      voice
      and
      i
      can
      see
      potential
      for
      the
      flow
      but
      you
      dont
      sound
      very
      comfortable
      on
      the
      track.
      thats
      just
      something
      that
      is
      fixed
      with
      practice.
      you
      just
      need
      to
      get
      used
      to
      your
      'mic
      voice'
      i
      guess.
      also
      try
      adding
      some
      very
      subtle
      delay
      to
      the
      vocals
      and
      detune
      the
      echo.
      maybe
      try
      mixing
      the
      vocals
      differently
      too.
      but
      it
      has
      potential

      very

      its

      id

      808
      line
      in

      made

      have

      and
      more
      'body'
      to
      the
      song.
      edit:i
      cant
      tell
      if
      it
      has
      a
      subtle
      808
      already
      or
      if
      that
      is
      just
      a
      beefy
      kick.
      either
      way
      i
      think
      its
      cool
      but
      defining
      the
      808s
      role
      would
      make
      it
      feel
      more
      complete.

      your
      kicks
      sound
      like
      you
      could
      let
      through
      just
      alittle
      bit
      more
      higher
      frequencies
      to
      make
      it
      pop
      a
      bit
      more.
      i
      guess
      in
      the
      end
      its
      all
      just
      a
      matter
      of
      preference.
      i
      think
      its
      very
      well
      mixed
      already
      tbh

      the
      synth.
      it
      feels
      a
      bit
      too
      'sweet'
      for
      me
      but
      thats
      all
      just
      personal
      preference.
      i
      think
      its
      very
      well
      made
      edit:
      i
      listened
      to
      it
      again
      and
      i
      actually
      liek
      it
      more
      today
      than
      i
      did
      yesterday
      haha.
      i
      think
      it
      was
      just
      the
      frame
      of
      mind
      i
      was
      in
      before.

      fan
      of
      this
      style,
      it
      reminds
      me
      a
      lot
      of
      beats
      my
      irl
      friend
      makes.
      i
      like
      the
      whole
      chiptune
      lofi
      chirpy
      style,
      for
      lack
      of
      better
      words
      haha.
      great
      stuff,
      i
      wish
      i
      could
      tell
      you
      how
      the
      mix
      is
      but

      find
      my
      headphones,

      give
      it

      my
      sweet
      spot
      with
      a
      space
      themed
      beat.
      i
      love
      it,
      its
      real
      chill
      and
      mellow,
      warm
      and
      well
      mastered.

      yo
      i
      found
      my
      headphones.
      i
      think
      it
      sounds
      very
      'bright'
      in
      the
      mix
      which
      isnt
      a
      bad
      thing
      but
      i
      would
      try
      put
      an
      eq
      on
      an
      envelope
      that
      blocks
      out
      some
      of
      those
      higher
      more
      abrasive
      frequencies
      and
      have
      it
      come
      in
      at
      certain
      points
      to
      give
      the
      listeners
      a
      'break'
      from
      the
      very
      bright
      melody.
      it
      could
      use
      some
      more
      compression
      too
      i
      think,
      at
      your
      discretion.

      I
      would
      just
      go
      to
      her
      directly
      if
      you
      want
      help.
      It
      may
      sound
      hard
      but
      i
      would
      highly
      recommend
      directly
      confronting
      your
      SHing
      as
      soon
      as
      possible,
      because
      it
      will
      only
      get
      more
      difficult
      the
      longer
      you
      do
      it.
      I
      wish
      you
      the
      best
      of
      luck
