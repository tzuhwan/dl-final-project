      Covering
      self-injury
      scars?

      I've
      been
      a
      self-injurer
      for
      about
      seven
      years.
      For
      a
      long
      time
      I
      worked
      very
      hard
      to
      cover
      up
      the
      scars
      and
      cuts.
      But
      recently
      it's
      become
      too
      difficult
      to
      cover
      up
      every
      inch
      of
      my
      skin
      so
      I've
      become
      pretty
      lax
      with
      it.
      I've
      even
      gone
      out
      in
      short
      sleeved
      shirts
      with
      cuts
      open
      and
      visible
      on
      my
      arm.
      But
      I
      feel
      a
      little
      guilty
      about
      doing
      this
      sometimes.
      And
      I
      know
      people
      have
      criticized
      self-injurers
      who
      don't
      cover
      up
      as
      irresponsible
      or
      something.
      And
      I
      know
      it
      makes
      some
      people
      uncomfortable
      to
      see
      them.
      I've
      kind
      of
      reached
      this
      point
      where
      I
      don't
      give
      a
      lot
      of
      fucks
      about
      who
      sees
      them
      or
      what
      they
      think
      but
      there
      are
      times
      where
      I
      feel
      like
      I
      should
      cover-up.
      Basically
      am
      I
      under
      any
      oblation
      to
      hide
      them,
      or
      should
      I
      continue
      to
      not
      give
      any
      fucks
      about
      who
      sees
      them?
      (And
      please
      don't
      preach
      at
      me,
      I
      have
      a
      therapist,
      I'm
      getting
      help,
      But
      I'm
      not
      ready
      to
      stop,
      as
      of
      yet,
      I
      don't
      know
      if
      I
      will
      be
      or
      not
      but
      please,
      just
      don't
      preach
      at
      me,
      lets
      just

      on

      I've
      been
      a
      SIer
      for
      about
      seven
      years.
      And
      the
      idea
      of
      quitting
      really
      scares
      the
      hell
      out
      of
      me.
      Just
      the
      thought
      of
      putting
      it
      down
      and
      never
      ever
      harming
      again
      puts
      me
      in
      a
      panic
      thinking
      about
      it.
      But
      I'm
      just
      wondering
      what's
      really
      wrong
      with
      doing
      it.
      I'm
      not
      hurting
      anyone
      else.
      I'm
      safe
      about
      it.
      I'm
      just
      not
      sure
      why
      I
      should
      stop.
      I'm
      sorry,
      I'm
      not
      trying
      to
      be
      a
      dick,
      I'm
      just
      wondering
      why
      I
      should
      stop.

      I
      need
      to
      deal
      with
      my
      life.
      School,
      work,
      relationships.
      But
      there
      are
      so
      many
      days
      where
      I
      just
      don't
      feel
      like
      I
      can
      deal
      with
      anything.
      Even
      things
      I
      like.
      I
      just
      don't
      feel
      like
      doing
      anything
      much
      less
      the
      things
      I
      have
      to
      do.
      I've
      missed
      a
      few
      days
      of
      school
      and
      work
      because
      of
      this.
      And
      today
      was
      one
      of
      those
      days.
      All
      I
      want
      to
      do
      is
      crawl
      back
      to
      bed
      and
      never
      wake
      up.
      I
      just
      don't
      know
      if
      I
      can
      handle
      anything
      today?
      How
      am
      I
      supposed
      to
      live
      like
      this?
      How
      can
      I
      pass
      my
      classes?
      Or
      keep
      my
      job?
      Or
      my
      friends?
      I'm
      so
      fucking
      tired
      of
      everything,
      I
      just
      don't
      know
      how
      I'm
      going
      to
      make
      it
      through
      today.
      Or
      god
      forbid
      any
      other
      bad
      days.
      I
      just
      want
      to
      be
      okay.

      I'm
      on
      20
      mgs
      of
      Citalopram.
      The

      be
      helping
      somewhat.
      What

      are

      My

      I've
      been
      free
      for
      a

      after

      And
      I'm

      ways
      to
      help
      me
      fight
      the
      urges.
      I
      write
      and
      exercise,
      but
      I'm
      looking
      for
      more.
      The
      urges
      where
      awful
      today.
      I
      even
      got
      a
      new
      pack
      of
      razors.
      I
      was
      out
      shopping
      for
      some
      things
      I
      needed
      and
      I
      couldn't
      help
      but
      just
      look
      and
      ended
      up
      taking
      the
      pack.
      I
      need
      more
      ways
      to
      deal
      with
      them,
      they
      get
      pretty
      bad.
      I'm
      thinking
      about
      taking
      some
      of
      your
      guys'
      ideas
      and
      making

      my
      meds
      to
      40
      mg
      of
      celxa
      and
      1
      mg
      of
      risperdal(for
      anxiety)
      I've
      also
      been
      a
      cutter
      for
      seven
      years
      and
      I'm
      trying
      to
      quit.
      Was
      2
      weeks
      free(not
      including
      the
      hospital
      stay)
      and
      slipped
      up.
      Now
      I've
      been
      free
      a
      week.
      I'm
      still
      struggling
      with
      some
      of
      the
      symptoms.
      Still
      feel
      depressed
      sometimes,
      think
      about
      suicide,
      low
      energy.
      I've
      was
      on
      20
      mg
      for
      celxa
      for
      about
      three
      months
      before
      the
      suicide
      attempt
      in
      early
      February
      then
      they
      put
      me
      on
      40.
      I've
      also
      been
      having
      issues
      sexually
      after
      i
      was
      discharged.
      I
      haven't
      had
      any
      desire
      whatsoever.
      Now
      I
      know
      celxa
      can
      cause
      that
      but
      I
      was
      on
      40
      mg
      in
      the
      hospital
      and
      when
      my
      gf
      would
      visit
      the
      hardest
      part
      was
      we
      couldn't
      have
      sex.
      Could
      it
      be
      the
      risperdal?
      Should
      I
      talk
      to
      my
      doctor
      about
      changing
      anti-depressents?
      Because,
      as
      I
      said
      before
      I'm
      still
      struggling
      with
      the
      symptoms.
      And
      what
      about
      my
      sex
      drive
      will
      it
      come
      back
      or
      should
      I
      talk
      to
      my
      doctor
      about
      that
      as
      well?
      Thank
      you
      so
      much
      in
      advance
      I
      really
      need
      some
      advise.

      I'm
      trying
      to
      look
      more
      androgynous.
      I
      identify
      as
      a
      woman
      and
      I
      look
      pretty
      feminine.
      I'm
      also
      very
      busty
      and
      want
      to
      bind,
      but
      I
      don't
      want
      to
      be
      totally
      flat.
      Just
      so
      I
      can
      pull
      off
      a
      more
      androgynous
      look.
      Here's
      a
      picture.
      Any
      advice?

      First
      off
      I'm
      sorry.
      I'm
      sorry
      for
      all
      thing
      things
      I
      put
      you
      through.
      I
      know
      how
      much
      of
      a
      screw
      up
      I
      am,
      believe
      me
      I
      know.
      I'm
      sorry
      for
      all
      the
      secrets
      I
      kept
      and
      the
      lies
      I
      told,
      but
      you
      have
      to
      understand
      that
      I
      did
      it
      because
      I
      had
      to.
      The
      hardest
      things
      to
      say
      are
      the
      words
      that
      mean
      the
      most.
      I
      didn't
      know
      how
      to
      tell
      you
      what
      I
      was
      feeling,
      I
      didn't
      know
      how
      to
      explain
      it.
      And
      there
      are
      still
      some
      things
      that
      I
      can't
      tell
      you.
      You
      found
      out
      about
      all
      the
      things
      I've
      been
      struggling
      with
      for
      years
      in
      a
      day.
      I
      was
      self
      harming
      at
      13.
      And
      my
      first
      thought
      of
      suicide
      was
      11.
      But
      I
      hid
      it
      all
      for
      almost
      10
      years,
      becasue
      I
      had
      to.
      How
      to
      you
      tell
      someone
      those
      thing.
      I
      was
      so
      afraid
      that
      if
      you
      found
      out
      you
      would
      lock
      me
      away.
      Now
      that
      you
      know
      you
      don't
      trust
      me
      with
      anything,
      you
      treat
      me
      like
      a
      crazy
      person
      that
      has
      to
      be
      checked
      in
      on
      every
      few
      moments.
      I
      still
      have
      to
      hide
      my
      eating
      disorder
      from
      you,
      becasue
      I'm
      so
      afraid
      you
      won't
      trust
      me
      with
      food.
      You'll
      worry
      everything
      I
      eat
      or
      don't
      eat,
      every
      time
      I
      go
      to
      the
      bathroom.
      I
      just
      don't
      want
      you
      to
      know,
      and
      I'm
      sorry
      for
      keeping
      it
      from
      you.
      I'm
      sorry
      to
      say
      that
      I
      still
      think
      about
      killing
      myself,
      I
      mean
      10
      years
      of
      planning
      my
      own
      death
      doesn't
      really
      go
      away
      in
      a
      few
      months.
      I
      just
      feel
      like
      that's
      my
      ending.
      That's
      the
      way
      things
      have
      to
      be.
      There's
      just
      no
      place
      in
      this
      world
      for
      me.
      And
      that's
      the
      way
      things
      have
      to
      go.
      Just
      please
      know,
      that
      I
      love
      you
      both,
      and
      I
      never
      wanted
      to
      hurt
      you.
      I
      never
      saw
      you
      as
      the
      enemy,
      I
      just
      didn't
      have
      the
      courage
      or
      the
      words
      to
      tell
      you
      these
      things.
      And
      I'm
      so
      afraid
      to
      tell
      you
      becasue
      I
      don't
      want
      you
      to
      worry,
      and
      I
      want
      you
      to
      know
      that
      this
      is
      the
      only
      way
      I
      can
      ever
      be
      okay.
      So
      just
      don't
      be
      sad,
      just
      know
      it's
      what
      I
      needed
      and
      wanted.
      I
      love
      you.
      Good-bye.

      been
      free
      for
      6
      months,
      almost

      I

      do
      it
      again.
      I
      just
      miss
      the
      feeling.
      Nothing
      is
      really
      wrong.
      I'm
      not
      even
      really
      depressed
      anymore.
      But
      I
      still
      deal
      with
      suicidal
      thoughs,
      cutting
      used
      to
      help,
      for
      lack
      of
      a
      better
      word,
      quiet
      those
      thoughts.
      I
      know
      eventually
      I
      will
      kill
      myself.
      I
      just
      want
      to
      keep
      level
      for
      a
      while,
      I
      have
      to
      live
      my
      life
      until
      then.
