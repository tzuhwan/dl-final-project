      I've
      been
      reading
      this
      sub
      for
      so
      long,
      and
      never
      posted,
      but
      this
      made
      me
      want
      to
      finally
      jump
      on
      and
      tell
      my
      story.
      I
      met
      this
      girl
      my
      last
      year
      of
      law
      school,
      and
      just
      fell
      hard
      for
      her.
      For
      a
      reason
      I
      can't
      explain,
      I
      proposed
      to
      her
      three
      months
      after
      meeting
      her,
      about
      a
      month
      before
      graduation.
      I
      should
      have
      known
      that
      something
      was
      up
      when
      she
      kept
      blowing
      up
      and
      giving
      me
      the
      ring
      back,
      saying
      that
      "she's
      not
      good
      enough
      for
      me."
      Looking
      back
      now,
      there
      were
      so
      many
      signs
      of
      borderline
      personality
      disorder.
      She
      was
      also
      a
      Type
      1
      diabetic
      with
      an
      insulin
      pump.
      It
      was
      Memorial
      Day
      weekend
      2008,
      so
      it's
      been
      6
      years
      almost
      to
      the
      day.
      We
      went
      out
      to
      this
      bar
      because
      one
      of
      her
      friends
      was
      moving
      away.
      I
      offered
      to
      be
      the
      designated
      driver,
      since
      it
      was
      her
      friend,
      even
      though
      she's
      not
      supposed
      to
      drink
      with
      an
      insulin
      pump.
      So
      she's
      drinking
      and
      drinking,
      and
      finally
      I
      get
      her
      to
      leave.
      We're
      driving
      in
      my
      car
      back
      to
      her
      place,
      and
      she
      starts
      arguing
      with
      me
      in
      the
      car.
      Then
      out
      of
      nowhere,
      she
      starts
      punching
      me
      in
      my
      face
      while
      I'm
      driving,
      giving
      me
      a
      bloody
      nose.
      I
      tell
      her
      that's
      it,
      I'm
      done,
      and
      finally
      arrive
      at
      her
      apartment,
      drop
      her
      off,
      and
      drive
      home.
      About
      5
      minutes
      after
      arriving
      at
      my
      home,
      I
      hear
      the
      doorbell.
      I
      go
      to
      the
      door,
      and
      it's
      the
      ex-fiance',
      saying
      "I
      dropped
      my
      phone
      in
      your
      car.
      Give
      it
      back
      to
      me
      now."
      I
      tell
      her
      that
      I'm
      not
      in
      the
      mood
      for
      doing
      any
      favors
      for
      her,
      and
      that
      I
      will
      drive
      by
      the
      next
      morning
      to
      drop
      it
      off.
      She
      then
      pushes
      her
      way
      past
      me
      into
      my
      apartment,
      and
      says
      she's
      not
      leaving
      until
      I
      give
      her
      phone
      back.
      I
      tell
      her
      again,
      to
      please
      leave,
      because
      she
      had
      just
      given
      me
      a
      bloody
      nose
      while
      driving
      her.
      She
      responds
      to
      this
      by
      punching
      me
      repeatedly
      in
      my
      face,
      closed
      fist,
      to
      the
      point
      that
      she
      knocks
      my
      contact
      lenses
      out
      of
      my
      eyes.
      I
      retreat
      back
      to
      my
      bedroom
      and
      sit
      down
      at
      my
      desk,
      hoping
      that
      perhaps
      if
      I'm
      in
      a
      sitting
      position,
      it
      may
      stop
      the
      violence.
      She
      follows
      me
      into
      my
      bedroom,
      and
      starts
      throwing
      things
      off
      my
      shelf.
      She
      goes
      to
      my
      nightstand,
      pulls
      the
      drawer
      out,
      dumps
      the
      contents
      on
      the
      floor,
      then
      throws
      the
      drawer
      at
      my
      head,
      where
      it
      cuts
      my
      head
      open,
      and
      I
      begin
      to
      bleed
      profusely.
      At
      this
      point,
      I
      lose
      it
      emotionally,
      and
      start
      bawling,
      telling
      her
      "I
      don't
      understand
      what
      I
      have
      done
      to
      you
      to
      make
      you
      do
      this
      to
      me."
      She
      then
      gets
      up,
      walks
      out
      of
      my
      bedroom
      and
      to
      my
      kitchen.
      I
      begin
      thinking
      "okay,
      maybe
      the
      sight
      of
      all
      that
      blood
      has
      made
      her
      finally
      realize
      what
      she's
      done."
      NOPE!
      She
      grabs
      a
      large
      kitchen
      knife
      from
      the
      kitchen,
      first
      walks
      to
      my
      living
      room
      wall,
      and
      starts
      stabbing
      the
      wall
      with
      the
      kitchen
      knife,
      saying
      "There
      goes
      your
      security
      deposit!"
      She
      then
      walks
      right
      up
      to
      me
      with
      it,
      and
      starts
      swinging
      it
      back
      and
      forth
      with
      it,
      slicing
      my
      leg
      in
      the
      process.
      She
      finally
      throws
      it
      off
      to
      the
      side,
      and
      I
      go
      to
      grab
      my
      cell
      phone
      to
      call
      the
      police.
      Well,
      I
      had
      one
      of
      those
      flip
      phones,
      since
      it
      was
      2008,
      so
      as
      I'm
      trying
      to
      call
      the
      police,
      she
      grabs
      it,
      and
      breaks
      it
      in
      half.
      She
      then
      sits
      down
      on
      my
      bed
      and
      says:
      "If
      you
      want
      me
      gone,
      all
      you
      have
      to
      do
      is
      give
      me
      my
      cell
      phone
      back."
      So
      I
      starting
      crawling
      on
      the
      ground
      of
      my
      bedroom,
      trying
      to
      feel
      for
      my
      car
      keys,
      because
      I'm
      legally
      blind
      without
      my
      contacts,
      so
      I
      can't
      see
      them.
      I
      finally
      find
      the
      car
      keys,
      walk
      to
      the
      car,
      open
      it,
      and
      yes,
      her
      cell
      phone
      was
      under
      the
      passenger
      seat.
      I
      hand
      it
      to
      her,
      she
      takes
      it,
      doesn't
      say
      a
      word,
      and
      then
      drives
      off.
      At
      this
      point
      I
      collapse,
      and
      the
      next
      morning
      when
      I
      wake
      up,
      I
      drive
      to
      a
      friend,
      use
      their
      phone
      to
      call
      the
      police,
      and
      meet
      the
      officer
      back
      at
      my
      apartment.
      The
      officer
      is
      sitting
      in
      his
      car,
      not
      wanting
      to
      be
      there.
      I
      start
      telling
      him
      the
      story,
      then
      I
      stop
      and
      say
      "you
      might
      want
      to
      come
      inside
      and
      see
      it
      for
      yourself."
      He
      comes
      along,
      walks
      inside,
      and
      the
      first
      thing
      he
      says
      when
      he
      sees
      the
      dried
      blood
      all
      over
      the
      place
      is
      "don't
      move
      anything,
      don't
      touch
      anything,
      this
      is
      a
      crime
      scene."
      She
      was
      arrested,
      and
      the
      police
      captain
      asks
      me:
      "you
      have
      two
      choices:
      1)
      you
      can
      throw
      the
      book
      at
      her,
      because
      she's
      committed
      several
      felonies,
      and
      she'll
      spend
      the
      night
      in
      jail,
      or
      2)
      you
      can
      just
      teach
      her
      a
      lesson,
      charge
      her
      with
      a
      misdemeanor,
      and
      she'll
      be
      released
      later
      today.
      I
      go
      with
      option
      2,
      and
      she
      wound
      up
      without
      any
      criminal
      conviction.
      Within
      the
      next
      30
      days,
      I
      move
      to
      NYC,
      about
      2.5
      hours
      away.
      And
      the
      most
      messed
      up
      thing?
      I
      invite
      her
      to
      come
      down
      and
      spend
      a
      night
      with
      me.
      But
      I
      haven't
      had
      contact
      with
      her
      since
      the
      end
      of
      2008,
      I'm
      now
      happily
      married
      to
      someone
      much
      more
      sane,
      but
      I
      always
      take
      allegations
      by
      my
      clients
      of
      domestic
      violence
      by
      women
      very
      seriously
      because
      of
      my
      experiences.
      tl;dr:
      borderline
      personality
      ex-fiance'
      goes
      all
      Friday
      the
      13th
      on
      me,
      which
      isn't
      enough
      to
      stop
      me
      from
      sleeping
      with
      her.

      I
      was
      waiting
      for
      the
      Washington
      DC
      metro,
      wearing
      my
      green
      IDF
      shirt.
      IDF
      being
      short
      for
      Israeli
      Defense
      Forces.
      I
      had
      recently
      returned
      from
      a
      trip
      to
      Israel
      and
      wanted
      to
      show
      off
      the
      fact
      that
      I
      had
      a
      shirt
      with
      Hebrew
      on
      it.
      So
      I'm
      waiting
      there
      and
      this
      guy
      in
      his
      mid
      20s
      comes
      up
      to
      me
      and
      says
      "So
      you
      like
      killing
      babies?"
      Well,
      yes,
      but
      that's
      none
      of
      his
      business.
      I
      look
      at
      him
      confused
      and
      he
      continues
      "you
      support
      killing
      babies.
      You
      zionist
      asshole."
      And
      then
      proceeds
      to
      spit
      on
      me.
      I
      say
      "ok
      obviously
      you're
      dealing
      with
      a
      lot
      of
      problems
      in
      your
      life,
      so
      I'm
      sorry
      about
      that,
      but
      spitting
      just
      seems
      a
      bit
      crude."
      He
      tells
      me
      that
      Israelis
      killing
      babies
      is
      his
      problem,
      and
      spits
      on
      me
      again.
      The
      train
      arrives
      at
      that
      point,
      I
      turn
      to
      board
      the
      train,
      and
      he
      then
      spits
      on
      me
      a
      third
      time
      on
      my
      back.
      Tl:dr
      :
      I
      wear
      an
      IDF
      t-shirt,
      kid
      flips
      out
      and
      literally
      lets
      loose
      a
      fury
      of
      spit.

      A
      lot
      of
      these
      may
      be
      repeats
      but
      here
      is
      what
      came
      to
      mind
      reading
      through
      this
      thread:
      1)
      Learn
      how
      to
      be
      independent.
      Learn
      how
      to
      do
      your
      own
      laundry,
      cook,
      clean,
      and
      be
      responsible
      for
      everything
      in
      your
      life.
      My
      sister
      is
      30
      (I'm
      33)
      and
      she
      never
      learned
      how
      to
      do
      that.
      She
      still
      lives
      at
      home
      with
      my
      parents,
      who
      clearly
      are
      enabling
      her
      dependence.
      2)
      Financial
      prioritizing
      is
      important
      to
      learn,
      but
      most
      likely
      you
      won't
      until
      you
      are
      the
      only
      source
      of
      income
      to
      pay
      all
      your
      bills.
      When
      it's
      coming
      close
      to
      the
      end
      of
      the
      month,
      and
      rent
      is
      due,
      you
      should
      think
      twice
      about
      buying
      a
      new
      game,
      cigarettes,
      alcohol,
      or
      anything
      that
      isn't
      vital
      to
      keep
      you
      alive.
      3)
      Sometimes
      the
      best
      way
      to
      learn
      how
      to
      truly
      be
      an
      adult,
      and
      a
      better
      person,
      is
      to
      hit
      rock
      bottom.
      4)
      You
      never
      really
      "feel"
      like
      an
      adult
      until
      you
      have
      a
      conversation
      with
      someone
      much
      younger,
      and
      realize
      that
      you
      have
      nothing
      in
      common.
      When
      I
      was
      in
      my
      late
      20's
      I
      remember
      dating
      girls
      right
      out
      of
      college
      and
      having
      nothing
      in
      common
      or
      to
      talk
      about.
      I
      only
      become
      aware
      of
      how
      old
      I
      am
      when
      I
      see
      or
      hear
      kids
      in
      their
      late
      teens
      or
      early
      20s,
      and
      realize
      that
      they
      are
      a
      generation
      away.
      5)
      Don't
      rush
      into
      marriage
      or
      think
      that
      you
      have
      to
      start
      a
      family
      immediately
      after
      college.
      Don't
      let
      the
      fact
      that
      many
      of
      your
      friends
      from
      high
      school
      are
      getting
      married
      and
      having
      gets
      pressure
      you
      into
      just
      settling
      or
      winding
      up
      with
      someone
      that
      you
      really
      shouldn't
      be
      with.
      I
      luckily
      have
      never
      had
      to
      go
      through
      a
      divorce,
      but,
      I'm
      a
      divorce
      attorney,
      and
      it's
      scary
      how
      many
      divorces
      I'm
      performing
      for
      people
      in
      their
      mid
      20's.
      Just
      remember
      that
      it's
      significantly
      easier
      and
      cheaper
      to
      get
      married
      than
      it
      is
      to
      get
      divorced.
      And
      if
      you
      have
      a
      kid
      with
      this
      person?
      You're
      going
      to
      have
      to
      deal
      with
      this
      person
      that
      you
      now
      hate
      until
      your
      child
      is
      18.
      6)
      And
      finally,
      for
      those
      of
      you
      off
      to
      college
      in
      the
      fall,
      here
      is
      a
      bit
      of
      conflicting
      advice:
      enjoy
      yourself,
      but
      don't
      major
      in
      partying.
      Cherish
      the
      last
      few
      years
      of
      your
      life
      without
      significant
      responsibilities.
      But
      while
      you're
      in
      college,
      take
      advantage
      of
      the
      fact
      that
      you
      will
      never
      again
      have
      the
      opportunities
      to
      learn
      so
      much
      about
      everything.
      Don't
      just
      take
      your
      "required"
      classes
      or
      what
      you
      need
      to
      graduate.
      Go
      through
      the
      course
      book
      each
      semester,
      and
      highlight
      classes
      that
      actually
      sound
      interesting
      to
      you.
      And
      guess
      what:
      if
      the
      majority
      of
      classes
      that
      sound
      really
      interesting
      to
      you
      are
      not
      in
      your
      major,
      maybe
      you
      just
      discovered
      what
      you
      are
      really
      into.

      Hello,
      my
      name
      is
      Seth,
      and
      I'm
      a
      recovering
      Warcrack
      addict.
      I
      have
      spent
      more
      than
      140
      days
      of
      my
      life
      just
      playing
      my
      main
      character
      (180
      x
      24
      hours
      =
      4,320
      hours
      of
      my
      life),
      and
      more
      than
      half
      of
      that
      time
      playing
      alts.
      I
      am
      admittedly
      farther
      behind
      in
      my
      career
      than
      I
      would
      have
      been
      if
      I
      had
      not
      spent
      so
      much
      of
      my
      life
      playing
      this
      game.
      I
      have
      not
      played
      this
      game
      since
      2011,
      and
      every
      day
      I
      look
      back
      and
      wonder
      what
      my
      life
      would
      have
      been
      like
      if
      I
      had
      not
      spent
      so
      much
      of
      it
      playing
      this
      game
      for
      so
      many
      years.

      Cats.
      I
      grew
      up
      with
      two
      dogs
      and
      was
      essentially
      brainwashed
      by
      my
      mother
      to
      believe
      cats
      are
      terrible
      pets.
      Then
      my
      girlfriend
      at
      the
      time
      while
      I
      was
      in
      law
      school
      adopted
      a
      cat.
      I
      fell
      in
      love.
      Ten
      years
      after
      that
      realization
      that
      cats
      are
      awesome,
      my
      wife
      and
      I

      Other
      men
      who
      have
      ruined
      it
      for
      the
      rest
      of
      us.
      For
      example,
      I'm
      a
      fast
      walker.
      So
      if
      I'm
      booking
      it
      and
      come
      up
      behind
      a
      woman
      she
      will
      instinctively
      grab
      her
      pocketbook
      and
      take
      a
      defensive
      stance.
      I'm
      not
      going
      to
      rape
      you,
      I'm
      just
      to
      get
      around
      you
      because
      you
      walk
      too
      slow.
      But
      because
      of
      all
      the
      gropers
      and
      rapists,
      and
      fast
      walking
      guy
      is
      presumed
      to
      be
      attempting
      a
      sexual
      assault.

      I'm
      a
      child
      support
      attorney
      in
      Manhattan.
      I
      often
      get
      clients
      who
      ask
      me
      how
      they
      can
      avoid
      paying
      for
      child
      support.
      So
      I
      tell
      them
      I
      have
      a
      secret
      that
      most
      people
      don't
      know
      :
      all
      they
      have
      to
      do
      to
      avoid
      paying
      child
      support
      is
      to
      go
      home,
      invent
      a
      time
      machine,
      go
      back
      in
      time
      and
      not
      have
      unprotected
      sex
      with
      the
      woman.
      They
      usually
      respond
      with
      a
      look
      of
      crushed
      hopes.

      Adderall
      and
      a
      wife.
      I
      went
      from
      an
      out
      of
      work
      attorney
      who
      had
      become
      complacent
      just
      bartending
      for
      two
      years
      to
      running
      my
      own
      successful
      family
      law
      firm
      in
      New
      York
      city.
      The
      only
      difference
      was
      the
      addition
      of
      Adderall
      and
      a
      wife
      to
      support.

      My
      most
      interesting
      case
      had
      nothing
      to
      do
      with
      my
      client
      hating
      his
      spouse,
      and
      just
      about
      him
      being
      a
      bit
      psycho.
      Negotiated
      a
      pretty
      good
      settlement
      for
      my
      client,
      an
      out
      of
      work
      sixty
      something
      husband
      who
      was
      just
      a
      terrible
      person.
      Opposing
      counsel
      who
      represented
      wife
      agreed
      to
      do
      all
      the
      paperwork
      post
      inquest.
      First
      sign
      something
      was
      wrong
      with
      my
      client
      is
      he
      was
      emailing
      me
      while
      Hurricane
      Sandy
      was
      hitting
      NYC
      how
      he
      wanted
      me
      to
      file
      an
      order
      to
      show
      cause
      because
      his
      wife
      did
      not
      make
      a
      bank
      transfer
      that
      day.
      I
      pretty
      much
      told
      him
      that
      there
      were
      bigger
      things
      going
      on
      around
      us
      at
      the
      moment.
      Fast
      forward
      a
      few
      months,
      still
      no
      paperwork
      submitted
      by
      counsel,
      I
      receive
      two
      letters
      by
      courier,
      one
      to
      me
      and
      one
      addressed
      for
      my
      wife.
      My
      client
      writes
      that
      he
      has
      hired
      an
      executor
      to
      kill
      me
      and
      my
      wife
      if
      the
      divorce
      isn't
      finished
      in
      sixty
      days.
      Can't
      hate
      him
      too
      much
      because
      he
      also
      wrote
      that
      our
      cats
      would
      be
      okay.
      Guy
      can't
      be
      found
      by
      the
      police
      who
      cared
      for
      a
      week
      and
      then
      stopped.
      This
      past
      winter
      he
      sends
      an
      email
      asking
      for
      me
      to
      get
      his
      winter
      coat
      from
      his
      wife.
      I
      ask
      him
      why
      I
      would
      do
      that
      after
      he
      threatened
      to
      kill
      me
      and
      my
      wife.
      He
      says
      be
      he's
      cold.
      Tl;dr:
      crazy
      client
      threatens
      to
      kill
      me
      and
      my
      wife
      but
      protect
      my
      cats,
      later
      asks
      me
      to
      get
      a
      winter
      coat
      for
      him.

      Some
      of
      the
      most
      memorable
      years
      of
      my
      life
      were
      spent
      playing
      WoW.
      Attorneylaw,
      MT
      and
      GM
      of
      Bellum
      Gero
      on
      Hyjal.
      I
      met
      so
      many
      people
      who
      I'm
      still
      Facebook
      friends
      with
      even
      though
      I
      pretty
      much
      stopped
      playing
      around
      winter
      2011.
      Ironically,
      I
      only
      met
      my
      wife
      because
      the
      Hyjal
      servers
      were
      down
      one
      evening
      in
      August
      of
      2011.
      Many
      people
      talk
      about
      the
      hours
      and
      years
      of
      my
      life
      wasted
      playing
      this
      game,
      and
      I
      have
      avoided
      every
      temptation
      to
      rejoin,
      but
      I
      have
      no
      regrets
      over
      the
      amazing
      people
      and
      raids
      I
      experienced
      in
      WoW.

      There
      are
      times,
      days,
      nights,
      even
      now
      having
      spent
      my
      day
      nonstop
      for
      14
      hours
      on
      being
      a
      lawyer
      that
      I
      have
      asked
      myself:
      "Wouldn't
      you
      be
      happier
      being
      a
      bartender
      again?"
      Admission
      -
      I
      was
      admitted
      to
      practice
      in
      January
      2008,
      spent
      a
      good
      deal
      of
      post-crash
      employment
      as
      a
      full
      time
      bartender.
      And
      although
      I
      never
      had
      any
      wishes,
      desires,
      or
      even
      the
      slightest
      urge
      to
      be
      a
      Family
      Law
      attorney,
      some
      days
      I
      get
      clients
      who
      come
      to
      tears,
      give
      me
      a
      hug,
      and
      tell
      me
      that
      I
      was
      awesome,
      and
      then
      it
      all
      becomes
      worthwhile.
      So
      my
      best
      answer
      is
      this:
      become
      a
      lawyer
      if
      you
      are
      doing
      so
      not
      just
      for
      the
      money,
      but
      because
      you
      can
      go
      home
      at
      the
      end
      of
      the
      night
      and
      say
      "I
      did
      something
      positive
      with
      my
      life
      today."

      Child
      custody
      dispute
      where
      no
      state
      had
      exclusive
      jurisdiction.
      Child
      was
      born
      in
      New
      York,
      had
      spent
      about
      200
      days
      in
      New
      York,
      non
      consecutive,
      100
      days
      in
      Florida,
      mostly
      consecutive,
      mother
      in
      New
      York
      and
      father
      in
      Florida.
      Father
      gets
      a
      Florida
      judge
      to
      award
      immediate
      custody,
      child
      taken
      from
      mother's
      arms
      by
      nypd.
      I
      filed
      motion
      in
      New
      York
      to
      gain
      jurisdiction
      but
      the
      New
      York
      judge
      didn't
      want
      the
      case.
      But
      Florida
      judge
      then
      declined
      jurisdiction,
      case
      sent
      to
      New
      York.
      Was
      quite
      the
      drain
      on
      me
      emotionally
      and
      time
      wise
      just
      to
      get

      Dear

      which
      is
      a

      not
      a
      fictional
      film.
      But
      never
      before
      have
      I
      seen
      a
      movie
      that
      you're
      just
      hoping
      for
      a
      happy
      ending
      for
      75%
      of
      the
      movie,
      and
      then
      suddenly
      you
      get
      a
      big
      tall
      glass

      It's

      The

      growing

      of
      saying

      to
      parts
      of
      your
      childhood.
      I

      I
      felt
      very
      similar
      while
      watching
      Inside
      Out.
      You
      lose
      these
      parts
      of
      being
      a
      child,
      and
      will
      never

      them
      again.

      Been

      attorney
      for
      five
      years
      now
      in
      NYC.
      I
      have
      to
      deal
      with
      so
      much
      emotion
      and
      unbridled
      feelings
      for
      12
      hours
      a
      day
      (I
      have
      a
      home
      office
      which
      doesn't
      help),
      that
      by
      the
      time
      my
      wife
      gets
      home
      around
      8
      PM
      there
      are
      only
      two
      things
      I
      want
      to
      do
      :
      drink
      a
      third
      of
      a
      bottle
      of
      scotch
      and
      play
      computer
      games.
      It's
      so
      hard
      to
      actually
      listen
      to
      my
      wife
      about
      her
      day
      because
      all
      I've
      listened
      to
      throughout
      the
      day
      is
      how
      terrible
      the
      other
      parent
      is.
      I
      imagine
      that
      family
      therapists
      or
      psychologists
      don't
      have
      anywhere
      the
      level
      of
      alcoholism
      and
      broken
      marriages,
      because
      when
      the
      hour
      is
      up
      with
      the
      client,
      that's
      all
      until
      next
      week.

      From
      my
      Freshman
      year
      of
      college,
      August
      1999
      through
      present
      day,
      I
      have
      told
      everyone
      I
      meet
      who
      never
      knew
      me
      in
      middle
      school
      and
      high
      school
      that
      I
      was
      on
      "Where
      in
      the
      world
      is
      Carmen
      San
      Diego?"
      Even
      told
      them
      that
      I
      won.
      My
      last
      map
      was
      Africa.
      And
      the
      trip
      we
      took
      was
      to
      Seattle
      for
      winning
      the
      show.
      I
      even
      told
      this
      lie
      to
      my
      wife
      and
      only
      recently
      admitted
      the
      lie.
      She
      asked
      me
      why
      I
      would
      lie
      about
      this.
      I
      have
      no
      rational
      explanation.

      I
      have,
      but
      I
      was
      the
      one
      who
      was
      abusing
      it.
      It
      became
      a
      real
      issue
      in
      our
      marriage
      because
      of
      the
      abuse.
      Initially
      I
      was
      taking
      2
      30mg
      tabs
      a
      day.
      Started
      to
      take
      extra
      when
      needed.
      So
      she
      confronted
      me
      about
      it
      saying
      it
      has
      to
      stop.
      I
      started
      seeing
      a
      different
      psychiatrist
      who
      switched
      me
      over
      to
      the
      XR,
      which
      helped.
      The
      only
      downside
      was
      that
      my
      Rx
      was
      upped
      to
      3
      30mg
      of
      XR
      a
      day,
      all
      in
      the
      morning.
      But
      you
      know
      what
      helped
      more
      than
      anything
      else?
      I
      gave
      my
      pills
      to
      my
      wife.
      That's
      right.
      When
      I
      filled
      a
      Rx,
      I
      would
      give
      it
      to
      her
      immediately.
      She
      would
      then
      give
      me
      one
      day's
      Rx
      at
      a
      time
      so
      there
      was
      no
      chance
      to
      abuse
      it.
      She
      kept
      it
      locked
      up
      as
      well
      in
      her
      saxophone
      case
      which
      had
      a
      numeric
      lock
      to
      it,
      making
      it
      impossible
      for
      me
      to
      break
      in.
      Well,
      fast
      forward
      to
      6
      months
      later,
      and
      I
      am
      now
      25
      days
      straight
      without
      any
      Adderall.
      I
      started
      seeing
      a
      new
      psychiatrist
      who
      switched
      me
      over
      immediately
      to
      straterra.
      And
      now
      here
      I
      am,
      on
      0
      mg
      of
      adderall
      after
      being
      at
      90mg
      a
      day
      at
      one
      point.
      And
      my
      wife
      couldn't
      be
      happier.

      Hey
      Jerry
      -
      I
      walk
      by
      the
      diner
      on
      the
      upper
      west
      side
      in
      NYC
      almost
      every
      day
      and
      can't
      help
      but
      think
      of
      the
      show.
      Question
      -
      have
      you
      stayed
      close
      to
      Julie
      Louis-Dreyfus
      and
      her
      success
      on
      Veep?
      Any
      chance
      of
      a
      cameo
      on
      Veep?

      Here's
      the
      thing
      -
      if
      you're
      going
      from
      a
      high
      does
      of
      Adderall,
      like
      I
      did,
      to
      no
      amphetamines
      at
      all,
      there's
      going
      to
      be
      a
      couple
      of
      hard
      days.
      I
      remember
      that
      I
      was
      pretty
      worried
      about
      how
      it
      would
      affect
      me
      during
      the
      week,
      as
      I
      went
      from
      90mg
      of
      Adderall
      on
      Monday
      to
      0
      mg
      of
      Adderall
      on
      Tuesday,
      but
      80mg
      of
      Straterra.
      I
      won't
      lie:
      Tuesday,
      Wednesday
      and
      Thursday
      were
      some
      very
      hard
      days
      to
      get
      through,
      but
      my
      Monday
      the
      following
      week,
      I
      hardly
      felt
      any
      withdrawal
      symptoms.
      As
      a
      side
      note:
      straterra
      had
      some
      bad
      heart
      burn
      side
      effects
      for
      me.
      And
      alcohol
      just
      exacerbated
      the
      heart
      burn.
      So
      within
      30
      days
      going
      off
      of
      the
      Adderall,
      I
      quit
      drinking
      as
      well.
      It's
      amazing
      how
      much
      more
      energy
      you
      have
      when
      you
      get
      a
      good
      night's
      sleep.

      I

      a
      day
      or
      two
      without
      any
      Adderall.
      I
      still

      a

      down,
      and
      overall

      When
      a
      client
      called
      me
      this
      past
      memorial
      day
      and
      I
      asked
      why
      she
      was
      calling
      me
      on
      a
      holiday,
      she
      replied
      that
      she
      didn't
      think
      Jews
      celebrated
      Memorial
      day.
      Never
      thought
      that
      I
      would
      have
      to
      explain
      that
      to
      anyone.
      Edit
      :
      to
      answer
      some
      of
      the
      questions,
      yes
      I
      am
      Jewish,
      no
      I
      never
      told
      her
      I
      was
      Jewish.
      I
      have
      an
      answering
      service
      which
      took
      her
      call
      and
      emailed
      me
      the
      message
      which
      was
      that
      it
      was
      very
      urgent
      that
      she
      speak
      with
      me
      that
      day.
      Given
      that
      the
      courts
      were
      closed
      and
      her
      case
      was
      a
      paternity
      and
      child
      support
      matter,
      I
      thought
      it
      had
      to
      be
      quite
      the
      emergency.
      It
      was
      not.
      She
      just
      wanted
      to
      ask
      whether
      the
      suspected
      father
      was
      required
      to
      take
      the
      DNA
      test
      ordered
      by
      the
      court.
      I
      then
      had
      to
      explain
      what
      paternity
      meant.

      Jewish,
      but
      never
      told
      her
      I
      was
      Jewish.
      Although,
      to
      her
      credit,
      there
      is
      a
      mezuzah
      on
      the
      doorway
      to
      my
      office.

      I
      have
      an
      answering
      service
      which
      was
      turned
      on,
      but
      I
      get
      emails
      sent
      when
      a
      message
      is
      left.
      The
      message
      left
      was
      that
      it
      was
      urgent
      that
      she
      speak
      with
      me
      that
      day
      about
      her
      case
      (paternity
      and
      child
      support).
      So
      I
      called
      her
      back
      with
      the
      assumption
      that
      it
      was
      an
      emergency.
      It
      was
      not,
      and
      certainly
      could
      have
      waited
      until
      the
      next
      day.

      She
      said
      that
      she
      had

      who
      didn't

      on

      so
      it
      was

      that
      Jews
      don't

      Well,
      I
      was
      already
      retained
      to
      represent
      her
      and
      had
      already
      appeared
      in
      court
      on
      her
      behalf
      on
      several
      occasions.
      I
      politely
      corrected
      her
      and
      represented
      her
      for
      2
      months
      when
      she
      fired
      me
      because
      I
      told
      her
      that
      I
      was
      taking
      my
      first
      one
      week
      vacation
      since
      my
      honeymoon
      in
      July
      2013
      and
      therefore
      would
      not
      be
      reachable
      for
      that
      week.
      It
      was
      a
      welcome
      relief.

      Meanwhile,
      when
      NYC
      schools
      are
      closed
      for
      Rosh
      Hashanah
      and
      Yom

      everyone

      I'll
      be
      available
      to
      meet
      or
      call.
      But
      if
      it
      makes
      you
      feel
      better,
      I've
      had
      a
      number
      of
      clients
      who
      guessed
      that
      I
      was
      Greek

      Sigh...
      So
      I'm
      a
      family
      law
      attorney.
      Although
      I
      bill
      hourly
      for
      divorce
      representation,
      I
      only
      charge
      by
      the
      appearance
      for
      family
      court.
      Which
      means
      she
      didn't
      have
      to
      pay
      me
      for
      the
      phone
      call.
      Why
      do
      I
      do
      this?
      Well,
      here
      in
      NYC
      there's
      a
      large
      number
      of
      people
      who
      make
      too
      much
      to
      qualify
      for
      a
      free
      lawyer
      (as
      they
      would
      on
      a
      child
      custody
      matter)
      but
      too
      little
      to
      afford
      an
      expensive
      $500
      per
      hour
      attorney.
      Because
      of
      how
      I
      charge,
      it's
      much
      more
      affordable
      for
      these
      people
      to
      afford
      my
      services
      and
      have
      legal
      representation
      when
      they
      otherwise
      wouldn't.
      But
      I
      will
      admit
      that
      clients
      like
      this
      make
      me
      seriously
      reconsider
      my
      business
      model.

      Except
      I'm
      fairly
      certain
      she
      would
      think
      I
      was
      serious.
      By
      the
      way,
      this
      same
      client
      had
      previously
      called
      to
      ask
      me
      which
      court
      appearance
      she
      should
      go
      to.
      I
      asked
      her
      what
      other
      court
      appearance
      she
      had
      besides
      the
      one
      she
      had
      retained
      me
      for.
      She
      said
      she
      had
      a
      criminal
      court
      appearance.
      I
      asked
      her
      why.
      She
      stated
      because
      she
      had
      destroyed
      the
      suspected
      father's
      BMW
      with
      a
      bat
      because
      he
      stopped
      paying
      her
      child
      support.
      I
      explained
      that
      it
      was
      probably
      more
      important
      that
      she
      appear
      in
      her
      criminal
      court
      case
      and
      asked
      her
      politely
      to
      not
      destroy
      the
      property
      of
      the
      party
      who
      we
      were
      taking
      to
      court
      for
      paternity
      and
      child
      support.

      First,

      preface

      I'm
      curious
      about
      why
      some
      people
      rank
      mastery
      above
      versatility
      and
      others
      the
      reverse.
      I
      understand
      the
      general
      mechanics
      and
      that
      for
      physical
      damage
      fights
      mastery
      is
      superior
      and
      versatility
      for
      magic
      damage.
      But
      is
      there
      one
      that,
      on
      average,
      is
      better
      than
      the
      other?
      For
      example,
      if
      I
      don't
      want
      to
      keep
      switching
      gems
      and
      enchants
      depending
      on
      an
      encounter,
      which
      is
      simply
      more
      utilitarian?
      I
      would
      imagine
      it's
      versatility
      as
      it
      mitigates
      all
      damage
      as
      well
      as
      makes
      healing
      more
      effective
      but
      I'm
      open
      to
      arguments
      stating
      otherwise.

      Any
      recommendations
      on
      what

      Honestly,
      my

      I
      remember
      listening
      to
      it
      when
      I
      was
      in
      middle
      school
      because
      I
      was
      constantly
      bullied
      and
      picked
      on,
      and
      felt
      like
      one
      of
      the
      lonely
      people.

      My
      main
      is
      a
      protection
      warrior
      which
      was
      the
      easiest
      thing
      to
      level,
      never
      dying.
      I
      then
      leveled
      two
      alts,
      an
      enhancement
      shaman
      and
      a
      BM
      hunter.
      Both
      are
      864
      and
      863
      respectively.
      And
      although
      BM
      hunter
      has
      been
      cake
      to
      play,
      I've
      never
      had
      as
      much
      fun
      dpsing
      enhancement
      ever
      before.
      There
      are
      more
      things
      to
      keep
      track
      of
      than
      the
      hunter,
      such
      as
      constantly
      keeping
      frostband
      and
      flametounge
      active,
      stormstrike
      always,
      and
      sometimes
      off
      healing
      when
      needed.
      And
      since
      I'm
      an
      altaholic,
      I'm
      trying
      to
      decide
      who
      gets
      to
      110
      as
      my
      fourth.
      I
      have
      a
      101
      DH,
      an
      85
      lock
      and
      80
      death
      Knight.
      I'm
      torn
      about
      what
      to
      level
      and
      whether
      to
      use
      a
      boost,
      because
      doing
      emissaries
      on
      3
      each
      day
      starts
      to
      make
      broken
      isles
      a
      little
      repetitious.

      So,
      I
      took
      a
      break
      from
      a
      few
      months
      after
      Cata
      until
      mid
      October
      after
      Legion.
      So
      I
      missed
      WoD
      when
      it
      was
      out.
      My
      main
      had
      no
      problem
      completing
      the
      pathfinder
      for
      Legion,
      but
      I'm
      having
      trouble
      with
      Draenor.
      I
      have
      everything
      complete
      except
      the
      exalted
      requirements.
      I
      even
      have
      a
      trade
      post,
      to
      get
      the
      rep
      buff
      at
      level
      3,
      but
      I
      still
      haven't
      had
      an
      easy
      time
      just
      getting
      1
      faction
      to
      exalted.
      So,
      do
      you
      have
      any
      recommendations
      on
      the
      best
      way
      to
      hit
      exalted
      on
      the
      jungle
      factions,
      besides
      grinding
      the
      same
      dailies?
      Do
      running
      solo
      dungeons
      help
      at
      all?
      For
      reference,
      I
      have
      a
      868
      prot
      warrior
      so
      I
      don't
      think
      I'll
      have
      many
      problems
      soloing
      lower
      level
      instances.

      Question
      for
      mythic
      +
      tanks....
      Which
      dungeon
      stresses
      you
      out
      the
      most
      or
      causes
      the
      most
      anxiety?
      I've
      ran
      everything
      up
      to
      +3,
      and
      did
      a
      +5
      brh
      this
      past
      week
      and
      I
      don't
      know
      if
      it's
      just
      my
      graphics
      card
      or
      what,
      but
      I
      could
      never
      see
      the
      sanguine
      when
      it
      dropped.
      I
      just
      had
      to
      remember
      to
      move
      after
      a
      mob
      died.
      Also,
      any
      advice
      on
      gearing
      etc
      would
      be
      appreciated.
      If
      only
      I
      could
      figure
      out
      how
      to
      link
      my
      armory
      from
      my
      phone....
      But
      it's

      to
      make
      sure
      I'm
      not
      wasting
      money
      on
      a

      That

      the

      I

      it
      overtake
      my
      life.
      I
      was
      addicted
      before
      between
      late
      vanilla
      to

      met

      and
      didn't
      play
      again
      until
      this
      October.
      And
      even
      though
      I'm
      not
      a
      hardcore
      raider,
      I'm

      which
      my
      wife
      is
      not
      pleased
      about.
      So,
      I
      want
      to
      start
      the
      new
      year
      by
      resolving
      to
      play
      less
      and

      everyone
      feels
      regarding
      class
      changes,

      and
      then
      again
      now
      with
      7.1.5
      approaching.
      I've
      been
      mostly
      satisfied
      with
      the
      improvements
      for
      protection
      warriors,
      having
      more
      aoe
      options
      than
      tab
      devastate.
      Seems
      much
      easier
      to
      master
      than
      before.
      Demo
      lock
      seems
      to
      be
      significantly
      more
      boring
      to
      play
      and
      it's
      why
      I
      haven't
      leveled
      further.

      happy
      with
      what
      they
      did.
      BM
      hunter
      I'm
      mixed.
      I
      love
      the
      mobility
      improvements
      as
      well
      as
      the
      hunter
      pet
      synergy,
      but
      I
      feel
      that
      they've
      made
      the
      class
      a
      4
      button
      play.
      Curious
      as
      to
      what
      others
      have
      to
      say
      regarding
      improvements
      or
      lack
      there
      of
      since
      the
      start
      of
      Cata.

      I've
      looked
      around
      but
      have
      had
      difficulty
      locating
      trinket

      Anyone
      have
      a
      good
      link?
      I'm
      using
      shock
      rod
      and
      tiny
      jar
      of
      ooze
      as
      both
      have
      nature
      damage
      that
      scales
      with
      mastery
      but
      I'm
      curious
      how
      other
      trinkets
      stack
      up
      against
      each
      other.

      Maybe
      it's
      just
      the
      market
      I'm
      in
      (NYC),
      but
      these
      days
      people
      don't
      really
      advertise
      with
      a
      business
      card,
      they
      do
      it
      through
      online
      advertising.
      90%
      of
      the
      business
      cards
      I
      hand
      out
      are
      to
      opposing
      counsel,
      and
      yes
      I'm
      a
      family
      law
      attorney.
      But
      it's
      not
      like
      attorneys
      are
      hanging
      out
      around
      courthouses
      just
      waiting
      to
      give
      their
      business
      cards
      out
      to
      prospective
      clients.

      Unfortunately,
      since
      7.1.5
      I've
      been
      having
      real
      trouble
      with
      my
      rotation,
      prioritizing
      and
      just
      putting
      out
      the
      numbers
      I
      should
      be
      putting
      out
      with
      my
      gear.
      I
      don't
      have
      any
      tier
      pieces
      but
      I
      do
      have
      the
      legendary
      helmet,
      belt
      and
      boots.
      I've
      been
      running
      the
      helm
      and
      boots
      most
      of
      the
      time.
      Should
      I
      only
      take
      hot
      hands
      with
      a
      tier
      bonus?
      And
      what
      about
      tempest?
      When
      does
      lightning
      bolt
      prioritize
      over
      lava
      lash?
      I've
      been
      playing
      around
      with
      different
      weak
      aura
      set
      ups
      but
      having
      difficulty
      keeping
      track
      of
      when
      I'm
      60+
      maelstrom.

      I
      had
      mixed
      opinions
      of
      the
      prequel.
      Abilities
      were
      good,
      the
      space
      added
      some
      new
      elements,
      the
      claptrap
      dl
      was
      pretty
      stellar,
      and
      I
      can't
      get
      enough
      Jack.
      But
      overall,
      the
      gameplay
      was
      way
      too
      linear
      and
      too
      cumbersome
      to
      farm
      bosses
      or
      to
      have
      much
      replay
      value.
      Borderlands
      1,
      if
      played
      after
      borderlands
      2,
      just
      seems
      too
      ancient
      and
      needs
      a
      bit
      of
      a
      graphics
      reboot.
      Borderlands
      2
      stands
      alone
      as
      one
      of
      the
      few
      single
      player
      games
      that
      I
      can
      play
      over
      and
      over
      again
      just
      like
      Fallout
      3
      or
      New
      Vegas.
      The
      only
      thing
      I
      would
      change
      is
      to
      bring
      some
      more
      balance
      to
      the
      legendaries
      and
      classes
      (I
      feel
      like
      I'm
      in
      /wow
      when
      I
      write
      this).
      The
      first
      class
      I
      played
      was
      Sal
      which
      made
      the
      other
      classes
      2nd
      rate
      when
      compared
      to
      Gunzerker
      with
      the
      DPH
      and
      Grozzle.
      It
      made
      OP
      8
      pretty
      easy.

      An
      apology
      to
      two
      Pugs.

      So
      I
      want
      to
      apologize
      to
      two
      separate
      groups
      last
      night.
      First
      to
      the
      group
      that
      accompanied
      my
      hunter
      Attorneyhunt
      on
      a
      depleted
      CoS
      +13
      run.
      My
      DPS
      was
      subpar
      and
      as
      one
      of
      you
      pointed
      out,
      I
      shouldn't
      be
      doing
      mythic
      +
      with
      15
      fps.
      Although
      to
      be
      fair
      I'm
      usually
      between
      30
      to
      40
      fps
      and
      that's
      with
      graphics
      at
      1.
      Second
      apology
      to
      the
      Mythic
      EN
      group
      that
      was
      waiting
      for
      me
      to
      finish
      the
      above
      CoS
      13,
      so
      I
      could
      come
      on
      my
      tank
      Attorneylaw
      and
      lead
      the
      raid.
      Unfortunately
      by
      the
      time
      I
      came
      it
      was
      already
      930
      pm,
      and
      I
      was
      only
      able
      to
      stay
      on
      for
      an
      hour
      before
      wife
      aggro.
      Because
      I
      left,
      you
      were
      down
      a
      tank
      and
      the
      raid
      leader
      and
      my
      understanding
      from
      my
      friends
      who
      stayed
      is
      that
      the
      group
      fell
      apart
      shortly
      after
      I
      left.
      So
      all
      in
      all,
      I
      made
      about
      19
      +
      4
      of
      you
      spend
      almost
      3
      hours
      of
      your
      evening
      with
      nothing
      to
      show
      for
      it.
      I've
      been
      feeling
      bad
      about
      it
      all
      morning
      and
      wanted
      to
      put
      this
      out
      there
      on
      the
      off
      chance
      that
      some
      of
      you
      are
      on
      reddit.

      Michael
      Moore.
      For
      the
      entire
      election
      he
      kept
      saying
      that
      Trump
      really
      can
      win
      and
      that
      the
      polls
      were
      under
      reporting
      the
      support
      Trump
      had.
      He
      went
      on
      Bill
      Maher
      and
      really
      looked
      convinced
      that
      Trump
      was
      going
      to
      win.
      And
      he
      was
      right.

      Problem
      is,
      I'm
      limited
      by
      my
      mother
      board
      to
      how
      much
      operable
      ram
      I
      can
      actually
      utilize.
      I
      tried
      putting
      16
      gigs
      in
      there
      and
      it
      still
      only
      utilized
      a
      max
      of
      2.
      So
      to
      get
      more
      ram
      I
      need
      a
      new
      motherboard.
      And
      if
      I'm
      getting
      a
      new
      motherboard,
      I
      might
      as
      well
      just
      get
      a
      new
      computer.
      And
      if
      I'm
      getting
      a
      new
      computer,
      I
      might
      as
      well
      get
      a
      quasi
      top
      gaming
      computer.
      And
      those.....
      Those
      are
      not
      cheap.

      question....
      So
      my
      close
      group
      of
      friends
      are
      in
      a
      guild
      and
      we're
      very
      casual.
      Although
      I'm
      on
      almost
      every
      day
      on
      my
      4
      toons
      some
      of
      my
      friends
      can
      only
      log
      on
      for
      an
      hour
      every
      other
      day.
      And
      even
      though
      there's
      6
      of
      us
      it's
      very
      rare
      to
      have
      all
      6
      at
      the
      same
      time.
      So
      we
      all
      spoke
      to
      our
      wives
      and
      have
      about
      an
      hour
      to
      an
      hour
      and
      a
      half
      on
      Monday
      evening
      that
      we
      all
      set
      aside.
      Most
      of
      the
      time
      we'll
      run
      mythic
      +
      or
      Kara.
      But
      tonight
      we're
      considering
      some
      PvP.
      So
      my
      first
      question
      is
      can
      someone
      explain
      how
      the
      war
      games
      setup
      is?
      I.e.,
      if
      the
      5
      or
      6
      of
      us
      just
      want
      to
      PvP
      against
      each
      other
      how
      exactly
      is
      that
      set
      up?
      Also
      on
      a
      more
      general
      level,
      what
      would
      you
      all
      do
      with
      an
      hour
      to
      an
      hour
      and
      a
      half
      of
      WoW
      once
      a
      week
      with
      your
      closest
      friends
      of
      5
      or
      6
      to
      maximize
      your
      time
      together?

      I
      often
      see
      people
      who
      post
      "link
      AOTC"
      or
      something
      of
      the
      like.
      What
      exactly
      does
      it
      mean
      or
      stand
      for?
      Normally
      I
      just
      apply
      to
      the
      group
      and
      don't
      link
      anything
      and
      usually
      it's
      not
      a
      problem,
      but
      if
      it's
      something
      I
      should
      aim
      to
      have
      it
      would
      be
      helpful
      to
      know.

      BM
      Hunter
      trying
      to
      be
      the
      best
      I
      can
      be.
      Legendaries

      Boots

      Additional
      questions
      :
      I
      do
      PUG
      raids
      during
      the
      week
      but
      also
      try
      to
      get
      in
      my
      Mythic
      +.
      I
      know
      for
      raids
      to
      definitely
      use
      MoC
      since
      it's
      ST
      but
      is
      it
      worth
      it
      to
      have
      on
      mythic
      +
      when
      you
      are
      pushing
      10
      and
      above?
      And
      does
      MoC
      count
      as
      a
      beast
      for
      the
      first
      tier
      cobra
      talent
      (I
      have
      a
      hard
      time
      remembering
      the
      names
      of
      most
      of
      the
      talents,
      so
      please
      excuse
      me.)
      Also,
      just
      from
      my
      own
      testing
      it
      appears
      that
      the
      cobra
      last
      tier
      talent
      is
      almost
      always
      better
      than
      stampede
      so
      is
      there
      ever
      a
      situation
      where
      you
      would
      use
      stampede
      over
      the
      other
      talents?
      Thanks
      in
      advance
      for
      any
      assistance.

      So
      I
      recently
      got
      my
      4
      tier
      piece
      although
      it
      was
      from
      raid
      finder.
      I
      know
      that
      the
      response
      to
      the
      following
      question
      is
      usually
      to
      simcraft
      it,
      but:
      how
      much
      of
      a
      benefit
      is
      the
      4
      piece
      for
      BM?
      I
      have
      2
      pieces
      which
      are
      10
      ilevel
      decreases
      from
      the
      non
      tier
      pieces
      I
      had,
      so
      is
      the
      benefit
      in
      dps
      between
      2
      piece
      and
      4
      piece
      big
      enough
      to
      make
      up
      a
      loss
      of
      stats
      from
      a
      drop
      in
      10
      ilevel
      in
      2
      pieces?
      Along
      those
      same
      lines,
      for
      ST,
      how
      much
      of
      a
      difference
      is
      there
      between
      dire
      frenzy
      and
      stomp?

      Wait,
      does
      haste
      decrease
      the
      CD
      on
      meta?
      Or
      does
      haste
      increase
      procs
      from

      I
      have
      the

      ring
      and
      Cof
      plus
      1
      meta

      and
      I'm
      also
      running
      with
      ursoc
      trinket.
      I
      notice
      that
      sometimes
      everything
      lines
      up
      perfectly
      but
      in
      other
      fights
      there
      may
      be
      a
      20
      to
      30
      sec
      wait
      to
      line
      everything
      up.

      I'm
      sure
      there
      is
      an
      easy
      answer
      for
      this
      but
      how
      do
      I
      stop
      my
      action
      bars
      from
      scrolling?
      For
      example,
      I
      have
      some
      spells
      hotkeyed
      to
      shift
      f.
      But
      I
      also
      have
      my
      most
      used
      abilities
      keyed
      to
      mouse
      scroll
      up
      or
      mouse
      scroll
      down.
      So
      I
      go
      to
      use
      my
      shift
      f
      but
      I'm
      also
      scrolling
      down
      to
      use
      that
      ability
      right
      after.
      And
      then
      it
      scrolls
      to
      action
      bar
      2
      which
      is
      completely
      empty.
      So
      I
      then
      have
      to
      scroll
      back
      to
      main
      action
      bar
      to
      use
      the
      abilities.
      I've
      started
      to
      just
      fill
      out
      the
      same
      abilities
      to
      each
      of
      the
      4
      action
      bars
      so
      that
      there's
      no
      issue
      if
      I
      scroll
      to
      a
      different
      action
      bar.
      But
      I'm
      guessing
      that
      there
      is
      a
      much
      easier
      way
      to
      fix
      this.

      How
      do
      I
      add
      a
      legacy
      armor
      set
      to
      my
      transmog
      available
      items?
      For
      example,
      my
      warrior
      is
      still
      holding
      onto
      the
      original
      tier
      1
      Valor
      set.
      It's
      all
      sitting
      in
      my
      bank
      along
      with
      a
      ton
      of
      other
      pieces
      from
      vanilla,
      TBC
      and
      Wrath.
      But
      when
      I
      go
      to
      the
      transmog
      vendor
      none
      of
      these
      items
      are
      available
      to
      be
      transmogged.
      So
      how
      exactly
      do
      I
      make
      these
      items
      available
      to
      be
      transmogged
      so
      I
      can
      finally
      get
      rid
      of
      them
      from
      my
      bank?

      I
      would
      consider
      myself
      the
      type
      of
      person
      that
      mythic
      +
      was
      designed
      for.
      Back
      in
      the
      day,
      I
      was
      a
      hard
      core
      raider
      and
      raid
      leader
      for
      almost
      all
      of
      Wrath.
      I
      stopped
      halfway
      through
      Cata
      because
      real
      life
      demands
      became
      too
      much
      to
      keep
      to
      any
      sort
      of
      raiding
      schedule.
      I
      didn't
      come
      back
      again
      until
      the
      end
      of
      October.
      I
      very
      rarely
      have
      more
      than
      a
      consecutive
      hour
      free
      at
      any
      given
      time.
      But
      I
      like
      challenging
      myself
      and
      I
      really
      look
      forward
      to
      the
      weekly
      chest.
      So
      I
      have
      enough
      time
      to
      run
      mythic
      +,
      and
      finally
      hit
      KSM
      two
      days
      ago.
      My
      guild
      is
      made
      up
      of
      7
      of
      my
      close
      friends.
      Only
      one
      of
      them
      plays
      consistently
      throughout
      the
      week.
      As
      an
      example,
      Monday
      nights
      are
      our
      guild
      run
      nights.
      And
      last
      night
      two
      of
      my
      friends
      had
      to
      go
      check
      their
      weekly
      chest
      because
      they
      had
      not
      been
      on
      since
      Monday
      last
      week.
      Mythic
      +
      offers
      constant
      evolving
      challenges
      with
      the
      chance
      and
      opportunity
      to
      still
      gear
      up
      close
      to
      900.
      If
      this
      didn't
      exist,
      if
      it
      was
      just
      heroics
      and
      raids
      there
      wouldn't
      be
      much
      of
      a
      reason
      for
      me
      to
      play.
      On
      a
      similar
      note,
      I'm
      also
      glad
      that
      LFR
      exists,
      because
      how
      else
      would
      I
      be
      able
      to
      see
      Guldan?
      And
      how
      else
      would
      I
      have
      the
      opportunity
      to
      raid
      with
      less
      than
      an
      hour
      available
      and
      the
      chance
      for
      set
      pieces?

      So
      last
      week
      I
      finally
      got
      my
      KSM
      on
      my
      hunter.
      I
      currently
      play
      4
      toons,
      a
      protection
      warrior,
      an
      enhancement
      shaman,
      my
      BM
      hunter
      and
      havoc
      DH.
      All
      4
      toons
      are
      between
      888
      and
      902.
      As
      many
      of
      you
      know,
      a
      lot
      of
      group
      leaders
      ask
      to
      link
      your
      KSM
      for
      an
      invite
      for
      a
      higher
      level
      mythic.
      But
      I
      noticed
      that
      when
      I
      link
      to
      the
      KSM
      on
      a
      toon
      other
      than
      my
      hunter,
      the
      tool
      tip
      still
      says
      that
      the
      achievement
      was
      accomplished
      by
      the
      toon
      that
      linked
      it.
      Recently,
      I
      linked
      the
      achievement
      from
      my
      tank,
      who
      had
      not
      actually
      accomplished
      the
      KSM
      himself.
      I
      was
      invited
      to
      the
      group.
      And
      after
      everyone
      had
      been
      summoned
      I
      was
      removed
      from
      the
      group.
      I
      whispered
      the
      leader
      who
      said
      that
      I
      had
      not
      actually
      accomplished
      the
      achievement
      according
      to
      my
      armory.
      So,
      thoughts?
      Does
      the
      ability
      to
      accomplish
      KSM
      on
      one
      toon
      hold
      any
      weight
      for
      skill
      on
      other
      toons?
      Would
      you
      remove
      a
      player
      if
      they
      had
      done
      what
      I
      did?

      How

      you
      make
      an
      old
      legacy
      set
      available

      that's

      How
      can
      I
      get
      rid
      of
      it
      and
      still
      make
      the
      appearance
      available?

      I
      can
      thank
      these
      downtimes
      for
      helping
      me
      meet
      my
      wife.
      Story
      :
      I
      was
      a
      guild
      leader
      and
      raid
      leader
      through
      all
      of
      WOTLK.
      Around
      mid
      August
      2010
      there
      was
      evening
      server
      maintenance
      for
      one
      reason
      or
      another.
      So,
      I
      figure
      I
      might
      as
      well
      take
      a
      look
      at
      the
      online
      dating
      pool,
      specifically
      jdate.
      This
      girl
      sends
      me
      a
      message,
      we're
      chatting
      and
      then
      go
      to
      the
      phone
      for
      the
      next
      3
      hours.
      Arrange
      a
      date
      for
      2
      days
      later.
      First
      date
      is
      7.5
      hours
      long.
      I
      move
      in
      3
      months
      later.
      My
      raiding
      substantially
      decreases,
      leave
      the
      game
      about
      halfway
      through
      Cata.
      Get
      married
      November
      3,
      2012.
      My
      close
      friend
      said
      Legion
      has
      been
      sounding
      good
      back
      in
      October,
      I
      rejoin.
      Now,
      I
      play
      until
      my
      wife
      gets
      home.
      The
      moral
      of
      the
      story
      is
      server
      downtime
      can
      help
      get
      you
      married.

      Piggybacking
      off
      some
      of
      the
      other
      questions
      and
      just
      trying
      to
      get
      a
      better
      understanding...
      I
      have
      ring,
      shoulders,
      bracers
      and
      KJBW.
      I
      also
      have
      CoF
      so
      I've
      been
      running
      a
      demon
      blades
      chaos
      blades
      build
      with
      shoulders
      and
      ring.
      But
      reading
      through
      the
      comments
      it
      seems
      that
      until
      the
      41st
      trait
      bloodletting
      and
      bracers
      are
      making
      a
      comeback
      instead
      of
      ring
      and
      first
      blood.
      But
      what
      about
      shoulders,
      CoF
      and
      ring
      plus
      bloodlet?
      Or
      bracers
      but
      keeping
      demon
      blades?
      I
      know
      the
      easiest
      thing
      is
      to
      sim
      but
      I
      want
      a
      spec
      that
      I
      don't
      have
      to
      change
      in
      the
      middle

      I
      recently
      finished
      the
      draenor
      pathfinder
      on
      my
      tank
      and
      a
      few
      words
      of
      advice
      :
      1)
      get
      the
      trading
      post.
      Upgrade
      to
      3
      ASAP.
      2)
      get
      a
      toon
      that
      can
      rip
      through
      mobs.
      For
      the
      elites
      in
      tanaan
      jungle,
      my
      tank
      was
      taking
      forever.
      3)
      if
      you
      can
      afford
      it,
      buy
      the
      medallion
      of
      the
      legion
      off
      the
      AH.
      I
      wound
      up
      doing
      this
      to
      finish
      the
      rep
      requirement
      for
      pathfinder.
      It
      was
      getting
      to
      the
      point
      that
      doing
      the
      dailies
      were
      less
      fun
      and
      more
      work.
      If
      you
      do
      buy
      the
      medallions
      make
      sure
      you
      are
      in
      draenor
      before
      using
      them!

      Is
      it
      72
      hours
      from
      when
      it
      was

      I

      I
      woke
      up
      this
      morning
      around
      5
      AM
      EST
      it
      was
      completed
      so
      I'm
      wondering
      if
      it's
      a
      straight
      72
      hours
      or
      3
      resets.

      Wow
      I
      think
      you're
      the
      first
      person
      from
      Hyjal
      I've
      seen
      on
      reddit.
      I've
      been
      on
      Hyjal
      since
      Vanilla.
      Horde
      or
      Alliance?
      I'm
      happy
      to
      run
      some
      mythic
      +
      with
      you.
      My
      guild
      is
      made
      up
      entirely
      by
      my
      close
      friends,
      with
      6
      of
      us
      total,
      3
      of
      whom
      only
      play
      1
      night
      a
      week.
      But
      being
      in
      a
      guild
      or
      not
      being
      in
      a
      guild
      shouldn't
      affect
      your
      ability
      to
      run
      +.
      Since
      7.2
      there
      are
      a
      lot
      more
      mythic
      +
      options
      which
      you
      can
      be
      carried.
      Just
      get
      your
      keystone
      and
      you'll
      get
      a
      group.
      Just
      as
      an
      example,
      yesterday
      I
      started
      off
      with
      a
      DHT
      3.
      Formed
      a
      group
      on
      my
      own
      as
      a
      dps
      and
      advertised
      it
      as
      an
      intention
      to
      keep
      pushing.
      Find
      4
      randos
      for
      the
      PUG
      and
      we
      obliterate
      it
      with
      a
      3
      chest.
      Key
      upgraded
      to
      NL
      6.
      Ran
      with
      same
      group
      and
      we
      3
      chested
      again.
      Key
      upgraded
      to
      CoS
      9.
      Lost
      our
      healer
      and
      tank,
      but
      quickly
      replaced
      them.
      3
      chested.
      Key
      upgraded
      to
      CoS
      12.
      I
      needed
      a
      break
      but
      logged
      on
      again
      this
      morning
      and
      saw
      a
      carry
      group
      looking
      for
      10+
      cos
      keys.
      I
      signed
      up
      and
      we
      missed
      the
      3
      chest
      by
      3
      seconds
      but
      still
      comfortably
      got
      our
      2
      chest.
      That's
      4
      mythic
      +
      I
      was
      able
      to
      run
      without
      the
      help
      of
      any
      guildie.
      I
      will
      agree
      with
      you
      that
      the
      ilevel
      floor
      seems
      to
      have
      increased
      since
      7.2
      but
      just
      keep
      trying.

      Did
      they
      finish
      all
      that
      construction?
      I
      stopped
      by
      for
      the
      first
      time
      since
      I
      graduated
      ('03)
      back
      in
      August
      and
      there
      was
      construction
      all
      over
      the
      mall.
      But
      I
      agree....
      It
      is
      surreal
      to
      see
      UMD
      on
      the
      first
      page
      and
      top
      in
      Sweden.

      I
      had
      a
      good
      feeling
      this
      would
      happen.
      It
      does
      appear
      to
      have
      an
      18
      hour
      timer.
      I
      usually
      wake
      up
      around
      515
      am
      EST
      and
      will
      play
      a
      little
      while
      having
      breakfast.
      I
      wake
      up,
      check
      the
      app
      and
      see
      I
      have
      45
      minutes
      left.
      I
      have
      4
      toons
      at
      110
      between
      888
      and
      901
      ilevel.
      So
      it
      became
      a
      race
      to
      try
      and
      finish
      4
      plus
      the
      scenario
      before
      6
      am.
      Got
      about
      1.5
      done.
      At
      least
      it's
      no
      longer
      required
      for
      flying...

      Here's
      the
      best
      way
      to
      get
      blood
      once
      you
      hit
      the
      isles
      and
      already
      have
      a
      toon
      at
      110
      revered
      with
      wardens
      :
      take
      the
      heirloom
      shoulders,
      add
      the
      blood
      shoulder
      enchant
      to
      it
      on
      the
      110
      then
      just
      mail
      the
      shoulders
      to
      the
      alt.
      You'll
      get
      blood
      quarry
      from
      mobs.
      The
      only
      downside
      is
      that
      the
      heirloom
      shoulders
      cap
      at
      100
      so
      the
      stats
      will
      be
      pretty
      low
      as
      you
      move
      towards
      110.
      But
      with
      all
      the
      bloods
      I
      got
      from
      leveling
      I
      had
      enough
      in
      resources
      by
      110
      to
      take
      care
      of
      all
      my
      order
      hall
      research.

      Within
      a
      24
      hour
      period
      I
      got
      the
      legendary
      ring
      for
      my
      enhancement
      shaman
      (completing
      my
      collection
      for
      all
      class
      specific
      enhancement
      legendaries),
      Call
      of
      the
      Wild
      for
      my
      BM
      hunter
      (just
      missing
      the
      shoulders
      now)
      and
      Prydyz
      for
      my
      DH.
      Also,
      with
      drops
      from
      H
      NH,
      my
      hunter
      and
      DH
      are
      now
      above
      900
      and
      my
      shaman
      and
      prot
      warrior
      are
      between
      895
      and
      899.
      Now
      I
      just
      need
      500
      more
      rep
      for
      my
      flying
      and
      then
      I'll
      have
      4
      toons
      zooming
      over
      Azeroth.

      BM
      Hunter
      here
      -
      so
      I've
      been
      trying
      to
      see
      what
      the
      best
      combination
      of
      legendaries
      are
      at
      the
      moment
      in
      light
      of
      the
      recent
      nerf
      and
      the
      discussed
      upcoming
      changes
      to
      nerf
      the
      shoulders.
      First,
      armory:
      http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/hyjal/Attorneyhunt/simple
      I
      have
      the
      bracers,
      helm,
      belt,
      legs,
      BM
      ring
      and
      boots.
      I
      recently
      ran
      with
      bracers/belt
      and
      I
      seemed
      to
      be
      doing
      worse
      than
      I
      was
      previously
      with
      the
      belt/ring
      combination.
      So
      I'm
      not
      sure
      if
      that's
      what
      is
      normally
      simmed,
      or
      if
      I'm
      just
      doing
      things
      wrong.
      Also,
      I
      understand
      one
      of
      the
      biggest
      benefits
      of
      the
      belt
      is
      using
      Killer
      Cobra
      to
      its
      max
      potential.
      But
      I've
      also
      read
      that
      if
      you
      run
      with
      the
      boots,
      you
      spec
      in
      BoB
      instead.
      So,
      if
      I'm
      not
      getting
      the
      same
      level
      of
      benefit
      of
      lower
      focus
      costs
      by
      using
      the
      boots,
      would
      it
      make
      sense
      to
      go
      with
      boots/ring
      or
      boots/bracers?
      All
      replies
      are
      much
      appreciated
      -
      I
      always
      look
      forward
      to
      Friday's
      to
      see
      what's
      discussed
      here
      for
      BM
      hunters.

      You
      mean
      thunderslash?
      Yeah
      I'm
      already
      45
      talents
      in,
      with
      my
      4th
      points
      in
      pack
      leader,
      Jaws
      of
      thunder
      and
      unleash
      the
      beast
      so
      far.
      I
      have
      everything
      I
      need
      except
      the
      shoulders.
      But
      icy
      veins
      says
      that
      if
      you
      go
      with
      the
      boots
      you
      get
      more
      use
      from
      Aspect
      of
      the
      beast
      than

      I'm
      a
      902
      BM
      hunter
      and
      I
      just
      spent
      the
      past
      week
      since
      Monday
      evening
      not
      logging
      on
      once.
      My
      wife
      and
      I
      came
      to....
      An
      agreement.
      So
      now
      I'm
      just
      playing
      once
      a
      week
      with
      my
      friends.
      I've
      been
      using
      the
      app
      pretty
      consistently
      though.
      So
      logging
      on
      today,
      all
      the
      AP
      I
      got
      from
      the
      past
      week
      of
      follower
      missions
      leveled
      up
      my
      artifact.
      Btw,
      I
      finished
      through
      the
      new
      gold
      leaf
      plus
      4
      additional
      traits.
      I
      also
      have
      3
      alts
      all
      between
      890
      and
      902.
      Each
      of
      them
      leveled
      through
      follower
      mission
      ap.
      I'm
      probably
      going
      to
      continue
      this
      for
      a
      while,
      but
      I
      see
      a
      few
      potential
      issues
      :
      order
      resources
      and
      full
      bags.
      I
      had
      about
      100k
      in
      OR.
      But
      not
      doing
      emissary
      or
      invasions
      mean
      I'm
      still
      spending
      way
      more
      than
      I'm
      making.
      I
      also
      had
      the
      problem
      that
      when
      I
      finished
      my
      last
      AK
      my
      bags
      were
      full
      so
      I
      didn't
      have
      the
      option
      to
      use
      it
      from
      the
      app.
      But
      my
      overall
      sense
      is
      that
      if
      you
      just
      use
      the
      app
      here
      and
      there
      you
      won't
      fall
      behind.

      I'm
      a
      bit
      of
      an
      altaholic
      as
      well.
      Until
      legion
      I
      had
      mained
      a
      protection
      warrior.
      Now
      my
      main
      is
      a
      bm
      hunter.
      Protection
      warrior
      is
      more
      fun
      than
      in
      the
      past
      but
      can
      still
      get
      a
      little
      boring.
      BM
      hunter....
      I'm
      really
      enjoying
      although
      sometimes
      it
      seems
      too
      easy.
      But
      I
      like
      the
      variety
      of
      builds
      and
      pets.
      Enhance
      shaman
      is
      very
      rng.
      I
      can
      have
      some
      fights
      where
      I'm
      just
      furying
      away,
      proc
      after
      proc.
      I
      have
      others
      where
      I'm
      barely
      above
      the
      tank.

      solo
      content
      can
      be
      challenging
      because
      of
      how
      squishy
      they
      seem.
      Havoc
      DH.
      Man,
      it
      has
      been
      fun.
      Before
      flying
      was
      available,
      just
      being
      able
      to
      jump
      off
      a
      bridge
      in
      stormheim
      and
      glide
      to
      the
      destination
      is
      great.
      Honestly
      I
      enjoy
      playing
      all
      except
      my
      protection
      warrior
      right
      now.
      My
      play
      time
      has
      decreased
      to
      3
      hours
      a
      week
      so
      I'm
      often
      torn
      on
      which
      toon
      to
      play
      for
      banging
      out
      WQ
      and
      broken
      shore.
      I
      want
      to
      share
      the
      sentiment
      that
      others
      have
      written
      by
      saying
      that
      I
      constantly
      feel
      that
      there's
      something
      that
      I
      should
      be
      doing
      on
      my
      BM
      hunter,
      who
      is
      902
      to
      prepare
      for
      ToS.
      And
      that
      every
      minute
      I
      spend
      on
      an
      alt
      is
      time
      I
      could
      be
      using
      to
      grind
      AP
      on
      my
      main.
      The
      game
      is
      considerably
      more
      alt
      friendly
      than
      ever
      before,
      where
      it's
      very
      easy
      to
      bring
      alts
      on
      par
      with
      mains
      gear
      and
      AP
      wise.
      My
      DH
      is
      900,
      my
      shaman
      is
      899
      and
      my
      warrior
      is
      895.
      All
      4
      toons
      have
      the
      new
      gold
      trait
      plus
      at
      least
      1
      additional
      trait.
      But
      because
      there
      is
      so
      much
      content,
      LFR
      for
      3
      raids,
      normal
      and
      heroic
      for
      the
      raids,
      invasions
      and
      WQ
      plus
      broken
      shore
      you
      never
      really
      feel
      finished
      with
      a
      toon
      for
      the
      week.

      That

      I'm
      pretty
      confident
      that
      if
      there's
      a
      child
      support
      order
      in
      plain,
      new
      wife
      will
      be
      pushing
      dad
      to
      lower
      it.
      I'm
      a
      family
      law
      /
      child
      support
      attorney
      and
      I
      can't
      keep
      count
      of
      the
      number
      of
      downward
      modification
      petitions
      filed
      because
      the
      father
      has
      a
      new
      baby.
      But
      I
      tell
      you
      them
      :"you
      can
      have
      20
      more
      children
      with
      20
      different
      mothers
      and
      each
      of
      them
      could
      take
      you
      to
      court
      for
      child
      support,
      but
      you
      would
      still
      be
      obligated
      to
      pay
      the
      same
      amount
      to
      mother
      #1."

      What
      really
      stuck
      out
      to
      me
      was
      the
      sadness
      Jimmy

      before
      pointing
      out
      the

      in

      Chuck

      the

      of
      the

      phone
      without

      And
      Jimmy
      knows
      he
      has
      him,
      but
      not
      with
      the
      look

      But
      the
      look

      sadness
      that
      he
      has

      the

      Has
      there
      been
      any
      testing
      with
      the
      changes
      to
      the
      legendary
      shoulders
      which
      results
      in
      a
      different
      ranking?
      For
      example,
      Icy
      veins
      ranks
      tier
      1
      legendaries
      as
      belt,
      bracers,
      and
      shoulders.
      I
      have
      belt
      and
      bracers
      (and
      all
      the
      other
      tier
      2
      and
      3
      legendaries)
      in
      addition
      to
      about
      40k
      nethershards.
      I
      was
      considering
      just
      spamming
      my
      5k
      on
      targeting
      shoulders
      until
      I
      get
      the
      legendary,
      but
      with
      all
      the
      changes
      coming
      out
      in
      the
      next
      patch
      and
      what
      appears
      to
      be
      a
      huge
      nerf
      to
      the
      shoulders,
      I'm
      curious
      as
      to
      whether
      there
      is
      any
      new
      emerging
      ranking
      of
      the
      current
      legendaries.

      I'm
      a
      BM
      hunter.
      I'm
      ranged.
      And
      every
      single
      spell
      /
      attack
      is
      instant
      cast.
      My
      simmed
      DPS
      stays
      fairly
      constant
      between
      a
      static
      fight
      and
      high
      mobility
      fight.
      I
      can
      solo
      almost
      all
      content
      on
      the
      broken
      isles.
      And
      most
      of
      my
      damage
      comes
      from
      my
      AI
      controlled
      pet
      that
      I
      just
      tell
      to
      do
      higher
      DPS
      every
      so
      often.

      So
      I've
      started
      running
      the
      crit/stomp/owtp
      with
      belt
      and
      new
      ring.
      Been
      having
      a
      blast.
      But
      I'd
      like
      to
      know
      much
      more
      about
      the
      weights
      /
      stats
      for
      the
      build.
      I
      have
      about
      30%
      crit
      and
      77%
      mastery.
      Why
      is
      crit
      so
      much
      better
      in
      this
      build
      than
      mastery?
      Is
      there
      a
      tipping
      point
      where
      crit
      no
      longer
      is
      the
      most
      important
      stat?
      Also,
      side
      question,
      is
      there
      any
      way
      to
      modify
      simcraft
      to
      account
      for
      the
      ring?
      I
      can't
      see
      any
      way
      to
      include
      both
      talents
      when
      simming
      it
      and
      I'm
      really
      trying
      to
      figure
      out
      whether
      I
      should
      run
      the
      new
      ring
      or
      CotW
      /
      convergence
      trinket.
      Thanks
      in
      advance
      for
      any
      help.

      Also,
      I
      was
      reminded
      of
      something
      this
      weekend
      :
      Don.
      Jr.
      is
      now
      running
      Trump
      Co.
      Because
      supposedly
      Trump
      had
      to
      divest
      his
      ownership.
      And
      yet
      here
      is
      an
      overlap
      of
      the
      now
      head
      of
      the
      Trump
      business,
      communicating
      on
      behalf
      of
      the
      Trump
      campaign,
      related
      to
      a
      business
      tie
      in
      Russia
      that
      Trump
      had
      previously
      dealt
      with.
      The
      fact
      that
      there
      is
      so
      much
      blurring
      of
      the
      lines
      here
      between
      politics
      and
      business
      in
      an
      effort
      to
      collude
      with
      a
      foreign
      government
      for
      both
      political
      and
      secretly
      business
      purposes,
      astounds
      me.

      I'm
      a
      child
      support
      lawyer
      in
      New
      York.
      I'm
      against
      and
      there's
      a
      good
      reason
      why.
      The
      custodial
      parent
      is
      not
      waiting
      for
      the
      child
      support
      check
      to
      pay
      rent.
      They're
      not
      waiting
      for
      the
      check
      to
      buy
      food.
      They
      are
      not
      waiting
      for
      it
      to
      buy
      clothes.
      Child
      support
      is
      in
      essence
      the
      non
      custodial
      parent
      reimbursing
      the
      custodial
      parent
      for
      money
      already
      spent
      on
      the
      child
      or
      children.
      To
      require
      accounting
      of
      how
      the
      money
      is
      spent
      completely
      ignores
      the
      reality
      of
      taking
      care
      of
      a
      child
      from
      day
      to
      day,
      week
      to
      week
      or
      month
      to
      month.

      addition
      is
      my

      knight.
      The

      4
      toons
      were
      all
      leveled
      pre

      My

      I

      1

      ago.
      And
      playing

      I
      took

      a

      and
      have

      Also,
      because
      I
      have
      flying
      already
      it
      was

      This
      I
      agree
      with.
      I'm
      a
      family
      law
      attorney
      here
      in
      NYC.
      I
      charge
      about
      half
      of
      what
      my
      colleagues
      charge
      and
      regularly
      beat
      them
      in
      court.
      Recently
      had
      a
      case
      where
      I
      won
      a
      change
      of
      custody
      case
      for
      the
      father.
      Mom's
      attorney
      was
      paid
      about
      10x
      more
      than
      I
      was.
      I'm
      also
      36
      and
      the
      majority
      of
      the
      other
      lawyers
      I
      deal
      with
      are
      10
      to
      15
      years
      older.

      Okay
      now
      I'm
      curious.
      I
      am
      a
      family
      law
      attorney
      who
      handles
      child
      custody
      cases....
      And
      when
      we
      say
      a
      parent
      has
      every
      other
      weekend
      then
      it
      also
      means
      that
      the
      other
      parent
      has
      custody.
      So
      does
      Amanda's
      ex
      have
      primary
      custody
      and
      Amanda
      just
      sees
      them
      every
      other
      weekend?

      If
      he
      doesn't
      have
      custody,
      I'm
      surprised
      that
      after
      all
      the
      events
      over
      the
      3
      seasons
      that
      he
      hasn't
      filed
      for
      some
      modification
      or
      primary
      custody.
      Or
      at
      the
      least
      filed
      for
      a
      right
      of
      first
      refusal
      so
      that
      he
      would
      have
      a
      right
      to
      have
      the
      children
      if
      Amanda
      was
      unavailable
      during
      her
      time.

      I
      loved
      the
      Handmaid's
      tale.
      And
      I
      loved
      Elizabeth
      Moss.
      And
      then,
      last
      week,
      I
      learned
      that
      Elizabeth
      Moss
      is
      a
      scientologist.
      Which
      I
      really
      wish
      I
      didn't
      know.
      Because
      now
      the
      entire
      series
      has
      been
      soured
      for
      me.
      At
      least
      I
      didn't
      find
      out
      until
      after
      watching
      all
      of
      season
      1
      so
      I
      could
      enjoy
      it
      when
      I
      watched
      it.

      Has
      there
      been
      confirmation
      that
      any
      of
      the
      910
      relinquished
      tokens
      will
      give
      tier
      pieces?
      I
      have
      6
      110s
      all
      of
      whom
      have
      done
      multiple
      turn
      ins
      and
      I
      still
      have
      yet
      to
      see
      a
      tier
      piece.
      In
      fact
      I
      don't
      think
      I've
      ever
      seen
      a
      tier
      piece
      drop
      from
      any
      weekly
      cache
      or
      any
      other
      place
      except
      for
      the
      raid
      itself.
      What
      sucks
      is
      that
      my
      main
      is
      a
      933
      bm
      hunter
      in
      my
      bags,
      but
      my
      best
      simming
      has
      me
      in
      924
      gear
      because
      none
      of
      my
      tier
      20
      is
      above
      905.
      I
      rarely
      have
      time
      for
      full
      heroic
      ToS
      run
      so
      I'm
      looking
      for
      any
      other
      way
      to
      upgrade
      my
      tier
      pieces.

      Hey
      all,
      long
      time
      lurker
      first
      time
      poster.
      Installed
      TSM
      a
      week
      ago
      and
      already
      made
      about
      500k
      profit.
      Question
      :
      how
      do
      I
      set
      up
      TSM
      to
      correlate
      with
      bloods
      and
      sargerite?
      For
      example
      is
      there
      a
      way
      to
      set
      up
      pricing
      so
      I
      can
      see
      what
      is
      the
      best
      trade
      in
      for
      dollar
      for
      bloods
      or
      sargerite?
      Also,
      are
      prices
      for
      TSM
      updated
      regularly
      for
      both
      overall
      and
      regional?

      Two

      Can

      search
      for
      reset
      is

      shopping

      Also,
      there
      are
      a
      number
      of
      items
      in

      BM
      is
      easy
      to
      learn
      the
      basics
      and
      is
      very
      accessible
      to
      a
      casual
      player
      to
      still
      pull
      ok
      numbers
      in
      a
      mythic
      +
      or
      raid.
      But
      as
      stated
      by
      another
      poster,
      it
      still
      takes
      skill
      to
      be
      good
      at
      it.
      I
      main
      a
      953
      BM
      hunter
      and
      I've
      seen
      a
      number
      of
      pugs
      where
      another
      BM
      hunter
      is
      pulling
      a
      third
      of
      the
      dps
      that
      I
      am.
      I
      don't
      consider
      myself
      hardcore
      by
      any
      means
      since
      I
      don't
      have
      Argus
      AOTC
      yet.
      But
      I'm
      constantly
      constantly
      simming
      my
      character
      every
      time
      I
      get
      a
      new
      piece
      of
      gear.
      And
      I
      stay
      on
      top
      of
      the
      updates
      on
      a
      daily
      basis
      for
      icy
      veins.
      I
      saw
      a
      fair
      number
      of
      BM
      hunters
      pre
      Argus
      who
      were
      just
      equipping
      their
      highest
      ilevel
      gear
      and
      ignoring
      the
      fact
      that
      2
      piece
      t19
      was
      still
      better
      than
      gear
      20
      to
      30
      levels
      higher.
      Think
      about
      BM
      hunters
      this
      way
      :
      you
      can
      pick
      Sal
      in
      Borderlands
      2
      and
      have
      little
      problem
      breezing
      through
      uvhm.
      But
      without
      the
      proper
      skills
      and
      the
      right
      talent
      build
      they
      won't
      get
      above
      OP
      1.

      You
      must
      be
      my
      long
      lost
      sibling
      that
      was
      separated
      from
      me
      at
      birth.
      I'm
      the
      only
      one
      I
      knew
      who
      has
      green
      eyes.
      My
      parents
      and
      sister
      have
      brown
      eyes.
      All
      my
      grandparents
      had
      brown
      eyes
      except
      my
      paternal
      grandfather
      who
      had
      blue
      eyes.
      So
      I
      guess
      it's
      settled
      that
      we
      have

      I
      take
      80
      MG
      of
      Strattera
      daily.
      And
      0
      Adderall.
      I
      was
      up
      to
      90
      MG
      daily
      with
      Adderall
      until
      I
      realized
      that
      it
      was
      time
      to
      stop.
      So
      I
      was
      immediately
      put
      on
      Strattera,
      and
      now
      I
      have
      no
      desire
      to
      be
      back
      on
      Adderall.
      Strattera
      has
      all
      the
      benefits
      of
      treating
      the
      same
      issues
      that
      Adderall
      has
      without
      the
      need
      to
      be
      on
      an
      amphetamine.

      I'm
      a
      family
      court
      lawyer
      in
      NYC.
      I
      can't
      tell
      you
      how
      many
      times
      I
      have
      represented
      fathers
      who
      had
      custody
      but
      never
      sought
      child
      support,
      often
      times
      because
      of
      pride.
      And
      then,
      many
      years
      down
      the
      road,
      the
      child
      goes
      to
      live
      with
      the
      mother
      she
      immediately
      files
      to
      put
      the
      father
      on
      child
      support
      who
      then
      complains
      that
      he
      never
      put
      her
      on
      support
      and
      should
      be
      given
      credit
      for
      not
      doing
      so.
      Also,
      I
      want
      to
      point
      out
      that
      the
      law
      itself
      is
      gender
      neutral.
      Whomever
      has
      primary
      physical
      custody
      is
      the
      parent
      that
      can
      seek
      child
      support.
      It's
      just
      that
      the
      majority
      of
      the
      time
      it's
      the
      mother
      who
      has
      physical
      custody.
      And
      I
      believe
      this
      is
      because
      when
      the
      relationship
      ends,
      the
      father
      takes
      the
      view
      that
      he
      doesn't
      want
      to
      take
      the
      child
      away
      from
      their
      mother,
      so
      the
      father
      leaves
      and
      the
      child
      re
      with
      the
      mother.
      And
      then
      when
      he
      doesn't
      provide
      financial
      sup
      bev
      he
      buys
      things
      instead
      of
      provide
      money
      he's
      then
      surprised
      and
      angry
      that
      he's
      being
      taken
      to
      court
      for
      child
      support.

      This
      really
      varies
      from
      state
      to
      state.
      There
      are
      some
      which
      will
      automatically
      order
      support
      as
      part
      of
      a
      custody
      proceeding.
      There
      are
      others,
      such
      as
      New
      York,
      where
      a
      parent
      has
      to
      take
      the
      affirmative
      step
      of
      filing
      for
      child
      support.
      And
      they
      have
      to
      take
      a
      separate
      step
      of
      opening
      an
      account
      with
      the
      child
      support
      collection
      unit
      if
      they
      want
      it
      garnished
      from
      a
      check.

      So
      here
      are
      some
      things
      that
      I
      tell
      my
      clients
      (based
      on
      NY
      law):
      whether
      she
      earns
      $0
      a
      year
      or
      $50k
      a
      year,
      the
      amount
      you
      pay
      stays
      the
      same.
      How
      the
      child
      support
      is
      spent,
      does
      not
      matter.
      You
      can
      have
      a
      video
      of
      the
      other
      parent
      taking
      your
      child
      support
      check,
      cashing
      it,
      and
      buying
      a
      bottle
      of
      champagne,
      and
      the
      court
      won't
      care.
      And
      why
      not?
      Because
      at
      the
      end
      of
      the
      day,
      the
      custodial
      parent
      is
      not
      waiting
      for
      your
      money
      to
      pay
      rent.
      They're
      not
      waiting
      for
      your
      money
      to
      buy
      food.
      They're
      not
      waiting
      for
      your
      money
      when
      they
      need
      to
      purchase
      clothes
      for
      the
      child,
      or
      supplies
      for
      the
      child,
      or
      any
      of
      the
      basic
      day
      to
      day
      necessities
      required
      to
      keep
      a
      child
      alive.
      And
      so
      the
      purpose
      of
      child
      support
      is
      not
      that
      the
      other
      parent
      take
      your
      money
      and
      then
      spend
      it
      on
      the
      child,
      but
      rather
      the
      view
      that
      both
      parents
      are
      financially
      responsible
      for
      raising
      a
      child,
      and
      you
      are
      in
      essence
      reimbursing
      the
      custodial
      parent
      for
      money
      that
      has
      already
      been
      spent
      on
      the
      child.
      And
      the
      fact
      that
      a
      parent
      would
      not
      ask
      for
      child
      support
      if
      they
      had
      custody
      doesn't
      change
      anything
      the
      court
      orders.

      I
      have
      one
      huge
      complaint
      about
      messenger
      bags
      that
      eventually
      forced
      me
      to
      change
      to
      tumi
      professional
      backpacks.
      A
      messenger
      back
      strap
      will
      rub
      against
      whatever
      you
      are
      wearing
      underneath
      it
      since
      most
      of
      the
      weight
      and
      pressure
      is
      put
      on
      the
      one
      strap.
      So
      I
      had
      3
      suits
      that
      eventually
      were
      ruined
      because
      the
      material
      on
      my
      suit
      jacket
      front
      collars
      was
      rubbed
      down
      to
      an
      unrepairable
      point.
      I
      mentioned
      this
      issue
      when
      went
      to
      purchase
      my
      next
      suit
      and
      the
      salesman
      at
      Nordstroms
      was
      fantastically
      helpful
      and
      suggested
      that
      I
      switch
      to
      a
      backpack.
      Been
      doing
      it
      for
      the
      entire
      past
      year
      and
      so
      far
      no
      damage
      to
      my
      suits.

      Judge
      Judy
      used
      to
      be
      a
      Judge
      in
      the
      same
      building
      I
      currently
      practice
      law
      :
      Manhatten
      family
      court.
      I'd
      say
      there
      is
      a
      growing
      trend
      to
      view
      parents
      as
      equals
      and
      not
      have
      a
      preference
      for
      the
      mother.
      What
      depresses
      me,
      however,
      is
      most
      fathers
      assume
      the
      system
      is
      against
      them,
      that
      they
      have
      no
      shot
      at
      full
      custody
      and
      then
      they
      never
      try.
      And
      there
      are
      plenty
      of
      people
      fathers
      who
      I
      see
      file
      for
      joint
      custody
      immediately
      after
      being
      ordered
      to
      pay
      child
      support,
      motivated
      solely
      by
      the
      desire
      to
      not
      pay
      support.
      But
      there
      are
      plenty
      of
      fathers
      I
      represent
      who
      are
      willing
      to
      fight
      to
      the
      end
      because
      they
      truly
      believe
      that
      it
      is
      in
      their
      child's
      best
      interest,
      regardless
      of
      whether
      their
      chances
      of
      succeeding
      are
      1%
      or
      99%.

      Few
      questions
      :
      1)
      what
      use
      will
      class
      halls
      have
      after
      110
      and
      BfA?
      Will
      there
      be
      any
      reason
      to
      visit
      them
      after
      BfA?
      2)
      it
      appears
      that
      prepatch
      hits
      the
      17th.
      Besides
      the
      prepatch
      scenario
      for
      the
      mount,
      what
      else
      will
      there
      be
      to
      do?
      We
      lose
      our
      artifact
      traits
      after
      prepatch
      correct?
      So
      we
      will
      probably
      be
      weaker
      comparatively
      until
      BfA
      hits.
      I'm
      guessing
      that
      mythic
      +
      will
      be
      more
      difficult
      as
      well.
      So,
      what
      should
      we
      be
      doing
      for
      the
      30
      days

      I.e.,
      I

      If

      I
      have
      a
      light

      paladin
      at

      I'm
      trying
      to
      get
      all
      36
      appearances
      before
      prepatch.
      Could
      I
      boost
      a
      pally
      to
      110
      now
      to
      get
      the
      challenge
      completed
      in
      the
      next
      week
      and
      then
      transmog
      the
      appearance
      once
      I
      level
      my

      **This
      is
      a
      hard
      question
      to
      answer,
      because
      I'm
      unsure
      of
      to
      what
      extent
      I
      will
      be
      using
      this
      and
      how.
      I
      am
      a
      trial
      lawyer,
      and
      I
      already
      have
      a
      good
      Alienware
      desktop
      that
      I
      use
      for
      my
      gaming
      as
      well
      as
      my
      home
      office
      work.
      But...for
      most
      of
      the
      day
      I'm
      not
      in
      my
      home
      office
      as
      I
      tend
      to
      spend
      most
      of
      the
      day
      at
      court
      with
      use
      of
      the
      attorney
      lounge
      in
      between
      court
      appearances.**
      **I
      already
      have
      a
      feeling
      that
      I'm
      going
      to
      need
      a
      screen
      larger
      than
      13".
      My
      eyesight
      is
      bad,
      and
      I've
      found
      myself
      squinting
      when
      using
      a
      13"
      laptop.
      The
      one
      I
      used
      back
      in
      law
      school
      was
      17",
      but
      that
      might
      be
      difficult
      to
      carry
      in
      a
      backpack
      easily.**
      **I
      also
      prefer
      to
      be
      able
      to
      have
      more
      than
      1
      window
      up
      at
      once.
      A
      lot
      of
      times
      I
      need
      to
      refer
      to
      e-mails
      or
      PDF
      while
      I'm
      typing
      in
      Word,
      so
      I
      need
      something
      to
      be
      able
      to
      fit
      a
      vertical
      split
      screen
      for
      work.**
      **I'm
      unsure
      as
      to
      whether
      or
      how
      I
      would
      get
      use
      out
      of
      the
      2-1
      at
      the
      moment.
      I
      could
      see
      myself
      taking
      it
      to
      the
      podium
      to
      lay
      down
      in
      front
      of
      me
      to
      read
      questions
      while
      in
      a
      trial
      setting,
      or
      quickly
      opening
      it
      to
      refer
      to
      my
      calendar
      or
      some
      quick
      notes,
      but
      I
      don't
      know
      how
      I
      would
      use
      it
      beyond
      that.**
      **In
      terms
      of
      gaming,
      I
      already
      use
      my
      home
      desktop
      for
      all
      my
      gaming,
      but
      since
      I'm
      an
      addict,
      I
      wouldn't
      mind
      something
      I
      could
      easily
      play
      WoW
      on
      if
      I
      have
      an
      hour
      break
      without
      much
      work
      to
      do.**
      \*
      \*\*How
      important
      is
      weight
      and
      thinness
      to
      you?\*\*
      **Probably
      the
      least
      important,
      to
      be
      honest.
      I
      used
      a
      monster
      17"
      heavy
      Toshiba
      through
      all
      of
      law
      school,
      and
      I'm
      already
      used
      to
      carrying
      a
      large
      amount
      of
      weight
      on
      my
      back
      with
      all
      my
      files.
      So
      the
      difference
      to
      me
      for
      5
      to
      7
      lbs
      really
      won't
      change
      much.**
      \*
      \*\*Which
      OS
      do
      you
      require?
      Windows,
      Mac,
      Chrome
      OS,
      Linux.\*\*
      **Windows
      operating
      system
      .**
      \*
      \*\*Do
      you
      have
      a
      preferred
      screen
      size?
      If
      indifferent,
      put
      N/A.\*\*
      **See
      above
      -
      bad
      eyesight
      and
      the
      need
      to
      be
      able
      to
      multitask
      and
      multiwindow
      but
      still
      be
      able
      to
      fit
      it
      into
      a
      backpack.**
      \*
      \*\*Are
      you
      doing
      any
      CAD/video
      editing/photo
      editing/gaming?
      List
      which
      programs/games
      you
      desire
      to
      run.\*\*
      **I
      sometimes
      do
      PDF- gt;word
      and
      word- gt;pdf
      for
      office
      needs,
      but
      nothing
      major
      graphical.
      I
      probably
      won't
      use
      it
      for
      gaming
      beyond
      WoW.**
      \*
      \*\*If
      you're

      do
      you

      At

      settings

      FPS
      do
      you
      want?\*\*
      **Well,
      I've
      gotten
      used
      to
      playing
      WoW
      at
      80
      FPS,
      but
      I
      wouldn't
      mind
      something
      that
      was
      50
      to
      60
      FPS
      for
      WoW.**

      **Would
      like

      A

      keyboard
      is
      a

      **Before
      discovering
      this
      sub
      today,
      I
      had
      done
      a
      fair
      amount
      of
      research
      online,
      and
      found
      that
      there
      was
      a
      fair
      amount
      of
      overall
      consent
      on
      the
      Dell
      XPS
      13,
      but
      less
      so
      for
      the
      15
      for
      some
      reason.
      I
      also
      saw
      good
      reviews
      for
      the
      Spectre
      360.
      Started
      to
      customize
      an
      Alienware
      laptop
      before
      I
      decided

      We
      have
      been
      watching
      it
      every
      day
      since
      the
      birth
      of
      Taj.
      We
      put
      on
      our
      laptop
      and
      our
      cat
      Otto
      likes
      to
      sit
      and
      watch
      the
      giraffes.
      I
      often
      encourage
      him
      by
      telling
      him
      that
      it's
      his
      best
      fried
      Tajiri.
      Last
      fall
      my
      wife
      and
      I
      drove
      to
      the
      animal
      park
      so
      we
      could
      meet
      the
      giraffes
      in
      person.
      I
      got
      to
      feed
      April
      and
      Tajiri
      carrots.
      It
      was
      fantastic.

      This
      is
      the
      first
      meme
      I
      ever
      shared
      with
      my
      wife
      when
      we
      first
      began
      dating.
      We
      then
      handmade
      a
      Christmas
      ornament
      that's
      just
      his
      face
      mid
      singing
      that
      we've
      put
      up
      every
      year
      for
      the
      past
      8
      years.
      I
      just
      played
      it
      for
      my
      2
      month
      old
      baby
      girl
      and
      will
      ensure
      that
      it
      is
      her
      first
      meme
      as
      well.

      We
      were
      driving
      back
      to
      our
      apartment
      on
      the
      highway
      when
      the
      car
      sputters
      and
      stalls.
      My
      wife
      was
      driving
      and
      said
      something
      along
      the
      lines
      of
      "damn,
      I'm
      out
      of
      gas.....
      again".
      I
      asked
      if
      this
      had
      happened
      before.
      She
      said
      this
      was
      the
      4th
      time.
      (we
      had
      only
      been
      dating
      for
      about
      a
      year
      at
      this
      point.
      The
      3
      prior
      times
      had
      all
      been
      before
      me.)
      I'm
      the
      type
      where
      if
      I
      see
      it
      at
      a
      quarter
      of
      a
      tank
      I
      start
      freaking
      out.
      So
      I
      can't
      imagine
      running
      out
      of
      gas
      at
      any
      time.
      She
      had
      previously
      ran
      out
      of
      gas
      on
      3
      separate
      occasions,
      and
      apparently
      none
      of
      them
      triggered
      any
      difference
      in
      her
      behavior,
      leading
      to
      us
      running
      out
      if
      gas
      for
      this,
      her
      4th
      time.

      S10+
      trade
      in
      for

      So
      up
      until
      the
      s10+
      I
      had
      never
      pre
      ordered
      a
      phone
      and
      used
      a
      phone
      until
      it
      became
      unusable.
      But,
      I
      was
      loving
      everything
      I
      saw
      for
      the
      s10+and
      was
      still
      using
      a
      s7
      edge
      so
      I
      grabbed
      it.
      Now
      I
      received
      an
      email
      from
      Verizon
      about
      a
      pre-order
      for
      the
      s10
      5G.
      I
      live
      in
      NYC
      at
      the
      moment
      which
      doesn't
      have
      a
      5G
      roll
      out
      yet
      but
      I
      believe
      it
      will
      be
      in
      the
      near
      future.
      But
      down
      to
      the
      main
      question
      :
      is
      it
      worth
      it
      to
      trade
      in
      the
      s10+
      for
      the
      s10
      5G?
      I
      don't
      care
      too
      much
      about
      the
      camera,
      but
      I
      care
      about
      a
      superior
      computing
      device
      since
      I
      do
      a
      huge
      amount
      of
      my
      daily
      work
      and
      communications
      from
      my
      phone.

      Had
      a
      divorce
      client,
      husband
      and
      father,
      who
      disowned
      his
      autistic
      son,
      tried
      to
      argue
      that
      he
      should
      get
      all
      of
      his
      wife's
      retirement
      having
      not
      worked
      for
      12
      years,
      contacted
      me
      during
      the
      height
      of
      hurricane
      Sandy
      (he
      was
      in
      the
      Bronx
      and
      me
      in
      Manhattan)
      saying
      he
      wanted
      to
      hold
      his
      wife
      in
      contempt
      for
      not
      paying
      him
      that
      day
      while
      the
      storm
      slammed
      NYC,
      told
      me
      I
      was
      making
      a
      huge
      mistake
      getting
      married
      (my
      wedding
      date
      was
      November
      3rd,
      4
      days
      after
      Sandy)
      saying
      that
      I
      was
      going
      to
      be
      miserable
      and
      regret
      it....
      I
      could
      go
      on.
      But,
      the
      worst
      was
      when,
      several
      months
      later,
      since
      his
      divorce
      was
      taking
      a
      long
      time,
      he
      sent
      death
      threat
      letters
      to
      myself
      and
      my
      wife
      saying
      that
      he
      had
      hired
      an
      "executor"
      to
      kill
      the
      two
      of
      us
      if
      his
      divorce
      wasn't
      finalized
      in
      60
      days.
      Called
      the
      police
      and
      they
      said
      he
      left
      his
      premises
      one
      day
      earlier.
      I
      heard
      nothing
      from
      him
      until
      February
      2014
      when
      he
      emailed
      me
      saying
      he
      needed
      a
      winter
      coat
      from
      his
      wife
      and
      could
      I
      help
      get
      it
      for
      him.
      Ironically,
      the
      divorce
      didn't
      have
      to
      be
      completed
      because
      he
      killed
      himself
      before
      the
      judge
      signed
      the
      judgment
      of
      divorce.
      tl;dr:
      Miserable
      guy
      who
      wanted
      to
      spread
      his
      misery,
      and
      crossed
      the
      line
      when
      he
      threatened
      to
      kill
      my
      wife.
      Edit
      :
      for
      something
      a
      little
      lighter,
      this
      Memorial
      day
      weekend
      reminds
      me
      of
      not
      my
      worst
      client,
      but
      definitely
      my
      dumbest.
      I
      was
      representing
      her
      on
      a
      child
      custody
      and
      child
      support
      matter.
      She
      was
      calling
      me
      on
      Memorial
      day
      saying
      she
      really
      needed
      to
      speak
      to
      me.
      I
      called
      her
      back
      and
      asked
      if
      it
      was
      urgent
      since
      it
      was
      Memorial
      day
      and
      all.
      She
      said:
      "oh,
      I
      didn't
      think
      that
      Jews
      celebrated
      Memorial
      day,
      so
      I
      thought
      you
      were
      going
      to
      be
      available."
      Edit
      2:
      because
      so
      many
      people
      have
      pointed
      it
      out,
      I
      have
      now
      put
      the
      word
      executor
      in
      quotes
      because
      that
      was
      his
      word
      and
      not
      mine.
      Also,
      since
      people
      have
      questioned
      it,
      my
      user
      name
      is
      also
      the
      name
      of
      my
      firm.

      I
      told

      that

      So

      I

      his
      language,
      not
      mine.
      He
      literally
      said
      he
      was
      sending
      an

      I
      guess
      because
      I
      just
      assume,
      being
      a
      family
      law
      attorney,
      there
      are
      going
      to
      be
      some
      pretty
      erratic
      people,
      who
      focus
      the
      insanity
      with
      a
      legal
      dispute
      involving
      their
      ex
      and
      children
      towards
      their
      lawyer.
      But
      my
      wife
      has
      no
      reason
      to
      be
      the
      target
      of
      your
      misery
      nor
      is
      this
      what
      she
      signed
      up
      for
      when
      she
      married
      me.

      I
      actually
      wrote
      back
      to
      him
      and
      asked
      if
      he
      remembered
      how
      only
      8
      months
      earlier
      he
      threatened

      how

      he

      think
      that
      I
      was
      going
      to
      do
      him
      any
      favors.
      He
      wrote
      back
      that
      it
      was
      really
      cold
      out
      so
      he
      needed
      it.

      Yes,
      although
      it
      wasn't
      worth
      it.
      Because,
      let's
      be
      honest,
      there
      really
      isn't
      any
      attorney
      fee
      that
      would
      have
      made
      going
      through
      that
      worth
      the
      money.
      Looking
      back
      now,
      since
      this
      was
      6.5
      years
      ago,
      I
      just
      think
      that
      my
      attenae
      to
      detect
      red
      flags
      wasn't
      totally
      developed
      yet.

      I
      believe
      it
      was

      Ironically,
      his
      one
      positive
      quality
      was
      that
      he
      loved
      cats.
      He
      had
      a

      post
      a
      day
      or
      two
      before

      himself
      where

      had

      I
      should
      have
      put
      the

      because
      this
      was
      the
      exact
      word
      he
      used.
      In

      addressed
      to
      my

      he

      He
      didn't
      even
      have
      any
      assets
      of
      his
      own
      because
      he
      didn't
      really
      work
      for
      12
      years
      leading
      up
      to
      the
      divorce.
      All
      of
      his
      assets
      were
      just
      going
      to
      be
      the
      assets
      he
      was

      be
      awarded
      as
      part
      of
      the
      divorce
      proceeding.
      The
      only
      way
      he
      was
      surviving
      is
      he
      took
      a
      portion
      of
      the
      401k
      he
      was
      entitled
      to
      from
      his
      wife
      and
      asked
      that
      a
      reduced
      portion
      be
      paid
      as
      cash
      up
      front.
      These
      were
      some
      of
      the
      funds
      that
      he
      demanded
      his
      wife
      be
      held
      in
      contempt
      for
      not
      paying
      in
      the
      middle
      of
      hurricane
      Sandy.

      Yeah
      but
      considering
      he
      was
      going
      to
      receive
      about
      $130k
      from
      her
      401k
      as
      part

      settlement,
      the

      expenses
      more

      outweighed
      what
      she
      was
      able
      to
      keep.
      By

      I
      could
      never
      understand
      how
      this
      woman
      was
      married
      to
      this
      asshole.
      She
      was
      a
      genuinely
      sweet
      person
      who
      even
      baked
      cookies
      for
      her
      lawyer's
      office
      during
      the
      case.

      Well
      don't
      forget
      about
      prenups.
      I
      draft
      one
      about
      every
      2.5
      weeks
      these
      days.
      And
      about
      75%
      of
      them
      agree
      to
      waive
      alimony
      in
      any
      divorce
      proceeding.
      Ironically,

      law
      and
      divorce
      attorney,

      consistently
      had
      soul
      crushing
      student
      loan
      debt
      that

      any

      I
      spent
      a
      lot
      of
      time
      during
      the
      divorce
      trying
      to
      calm
      him
      down
      and
      stop
      seeing
      his
      wife
      as
      an
      enemy.
      She
      was
      being
      very
      amicable
      with
      her
      settlement
      proposals
      and
      all
      he
      wanted
      to
      do
      was
      ruin
      her.
      Thankfully
      I
      was
      able
      to
      serve
      as
      a
      buffer
      and
      able
      to
      convince
      him
      to
      settle
      before
      he
      could
      ruin
      his
      wife's
      life
      any
      further.
      But
      yes,
      there
      were
      so
      many
      signs
      of
      depression,
      but
      nothing
      strong
      or
      visible
      enough
      to
      prevent
      him
      from
      knowingly
      and
      voluntarily
      entering
      into
      the
      divorce
      settlement.
      If
      I
      could
      have
      asked
      for
      a
      GAL
      to
      be
      assigned,
      I
      certainly
      would
      have.

      clients
      since
      family
      law
      and
      divorce
      are
      such
      emotional
      practice
      areas.
      But
      it
      was
      so
      hard
      to
      have
      any
      sympathy
      for
      him
      even
      before
      the
      death
      threat
      letters.
      When
      I
      found
      out
      that
      he
      killed
      himself
      it
      was
      a
      real
      sigh
      of
      relief
      for
      our
      family,
      and
      I
      really
      do
      hate
      to
      say
      it,
      but
      this
      was
      probably
      the
      best
      case
      scenario
      after
      everything
      he
      had
      done
      up
      to
      that
      point.

      The
      thing
      is...
      A
      lot
      of
      family
      law
      clients
      believe
      that
      the
      only
      way
      I
      can
      understand
      what
      they
      are
      going
      through
      is
      if
      I
      too
      am
      married
      and
      have
      a
      child.
      Almost
      every
      single
      one
      of
      my
      child
      custody
      clients
      has
      asked
      if
      I
      have
      any
      children,
      thinking
      that
      the
      only
      way
      I
      can
      really
      represent
      them
      is
      if
      I
      too
      have
      children.
      It's
      a
      ridiculous
      presumption,
      but
      all
      of
      these
      people
      are
      going
      through
      a
      really
      emotional
      process
      and
      are
      looking
      for
      some
      reassurance
      that
      their
      lawyer
      is
      looking
      out
      for
      their
      interests.

      As
      I
      responded
      to
      in
      another
      comment,
      I
      should
      have
      put
      executor
      in
      quotes,
      because
      those
      were
      his
      words,
      not
      mine.
      He
      specifically
      said
      to
      my
      wife
      that
      "because
      of
      your
      husband's
      incompetence,
      I
      have
      hired

      you

      he

      in
      60
      days."

      Like
      many
      of
      you,
      I
      played
      a
      lot
      of
      Legion.
      And
      also
      like
      many
      of
      you,
      I
      play
      a
      lot
      of
      alts.
      To
      the
      point
      that
      I
      obtained
      all
      the
      legendaries
      available
      for
      all
      but
      3
      classes.
      And
      by
      the
      time
      you
      hit
      120
      they
      are
      all
      useless
      and
      can't
      be
      destroyed
      or
      sold
      so
      they
      just
      take
      up
      space
      in
      your
      bank.
       #8203;
      I
      hardly
      have
      long
      periods
      of
      consistent
      time,
      so
      I
      haven't
      been
      spending
      much
      time
      on
      raiding
      or
      mythics,
      and
      instead
      have
      been
      leveling
      allied
      races.
      Which
      means
      that
      at
      a
      certain
      point,
      I
      wind
      up
      leveling
      classes
      that
      I
      have
      already
      leveled
      to
      120
      and
      previously
      unlocked
      all
      the
      legendaries
      during
      Legion.
      For
      example,
      I
      leveled
      a
      Dark
      Iron
      shaman
      and
      had
      already
      obtained
      all
      the
      legendaries
      for
      my
      Draenei
      shaman.
      I
      am
      now
      leveling
      an
      Orc
      Death
      Knight
      for
      the
      Double
      Agent
      achievement
      and
      to
      start
      playing
      the
      allied
      races
      on
      Horde.
      I
      had
      previously
      leveled
      a
      Human
      Death
      Knight
      and
      obtained
      all
      the
      legendaries
      on
      him
      during
      Legion.
       #8203;
      Blizzard
      knows
      that
      we
      still
      have
      some
      interest
      in
      legendaries
      or
      they
      wouldn't
      have
      so
      many
      world
      quest
      rewards
      or
      mission
      table
      rewards
      that
      award
      essences
      for
      legendaries.
      And
      although
      legendaries
      only
      are
      usable
      from
      101
      to
      116,
      it's
      still
      fun
      to
      use
      them
      for
      that
      period
      of
      leveling.
       #8203;
      So,
      why
      not
      change
      it
      so
      all
      legendaries
      are
      Bind
      on
      Account,
      so
      I
      can
      use
      legendaries
      on
      alts,
      instead
      of
      having
      them
      sit
      in
      all
      of
      my
      alt
      banks?

      True,
      and
      honestly
      I
      could
      use
      any
      of
      my
      120
      alts
      to
      just
      blow
      through
      a
      bunch
      of
      world
      quests
      to
      get
      1000
      essences
      for
      the
      random
      loot
      box.
      But
      why?
      When
      I
      leveled
      my
      dark
      iron
      shaman
      I
      still
      had
      a
      bunch
      of
      essences
      on
      my
      120s
      that
      I
      could
      spend
      on
      the
      random
      loot
      boxes
      but
      now
      that
      I'm
      leveling
      my
      second
      death
      knight,
      it
      just
      made
      me
      wonder
      why,
      if
      I
      had
      already
      obtained
      the
      legendary
      on
      my
      first
      death
      knight?
      As
      was
      said,
      it
      may
      be
      purposeful
      to
      have
      you
      spend
      more
      time
      to
      grind
      and
      stay
      subbed....
      It
      just
      seems
      like
      there
      can
      be
      an
      easier
      system
      that
      would
      make
      it
      more
      fun
      to
      level
      alts
      for
      15
      levels
      that
      would
      do
      nothing
      to
      break
      the
      game.

      Wife
      and
      I
      recently
      had
      a
      baby,
      now
      9
      months.
      Been
      reading
      about
      starting
      a
      529
      recently
      in
      this
      sub
      which
      I
      did
      over
      the
      weekend
      with
      fidelity.
      After
      a
      long
      long
      trek,
      I've
      gone
      from
      defaulting
      on
      $30k
      of
      student
      loans
      in
      2009
      to
      a
      757
      credit
      score
      and
      0
      credit
      card
      debt
      but
      still
      about
      $73k
      in
      student
      loans.
      I
      feel
      that
      my
      investing
      and
      future
      planning
      is
      all
      over
      the
      place.
      I've
      set
      up
      an
      Acorns
      account
      and
      Acorns
      later
      account
      which
      have
      about
      $1200
      in
      it.
      I
      have
      a
      Qapital
      account
      with
      about
      $1k.
      I
      recently
      started
      a
      Wealth
      front
      account
      which
      has
      about
      $500
      in
      it
      and
      I
      have
      the
      529
      account
      and
      general
      investing
      account
      with
      Fidelity.
      I
      live
      in
      NYC
      so
      a
      Google
      search
      for
      a
      financial
      advisor
      gets
      me
      nowhere
      but
      I'm
      also
      not
      sure
      how
      to
      find
      one
      and
      what
      to
      look
      for.

      enough
      to
      potentially
      purchase
      an
      apartment
      in
      the
      next
      5
      to
      7
      years
      in
      NYC.
      2)
      save
      enough
      to
      pay
      for
      college
      for
      my
      daughter
      in
      17
      years.
      3)
      pay
      off
      the
      remaining
      $70k
      of
      student
      loans.
      4)
      start
      putting
      away
      more
      than
      $1k
      for
      retirement.
      I
      know
      these
      seem
      like
      lofty
      dream
      goals
      but
      for
      a
      long
      time
      my
      finances
      were
      so
      bad
      that
      my
      wife
      was
      an
      inch
      away
      from
      filing
      for
      divorce
      and
      this
      is
      the
      first
      time
      I
      feel
      in
      charge
      of
      my
      finances
      and
      with
      the
      potential
      to
      start
      looking
      at
      a
      future.
      I've
      never
      had
      more
      than
      4
      figures
      in
      a
      bank
      account
      until
      this
      year
      and
      now
      I
      have
      about
      $40k
      in
      my
      business
      bank
      account,
      which
      is
      ultimately
      my
      own
      income
      since
      I
      run
      a
      one
      man
      law
      firm.
      So
      now
      that
      I
      actually
      have
      assets
      I
      don't
      want
      to
      screw
      anything
      up.
      Thanks
      in
      advance
      to
      all.

      So
      has
      anyone
      else
      watched
      the
      limited
      series
      Years
      and
      Years?
      The
      first
      thought
      I
      had
      when
      I
      heard
      they
      were
      not
      going
      to
      vaccinate
      anyone
      against
      the
      flu
      while
      intending
      to
      detain
      them
      indefinitely
      is
      that
      this
      is
      literally
      the
      Erstwhile
      Camps,
      with
      the
      difference
      being
      that
      they
      are
      out
      in
      open
      instead
      of
      some
      big
      government
      secret.
      Private
      bidders
      to
      run
      the
      camps,
      deplorable
      conditions,
      indefinite
      holding
      and
      purposeful
      acts
      to
      have
      them
      all
      die.

      Also,
      I
      learned
      you
      shouldn't
      try
      posting
      while
      on
      the
      subway
      because
      it
      will
      keep
      posting
      without
      acknowledging
      the
      post,
      so
      I'm
      sorry
      mods.
