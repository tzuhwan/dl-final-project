      Why
      do
      the
      things
      I
      used
      to
      love
      doing
      seem
      like
      a
      chore?

      I
      used
      to
      love
      riding
      my
      bike
      and
      could
      literally
      spend
      the
      day
      listening
      to
      the
      engine
      and
      the
      wind
      and
      just
      spend
      the
      day
      on
      the
      road
      but
      now
      I
      can
      barely
      bring
      myself
      to
      start
      the
      engine
      and
      it
      just
      seems
      like
      a
      chore.
      Plus
      when
      I #8217;m
      out
      on
      the
      road
      I #8217;m
      reminded
      just
      how
      easy
      it
      would
      be
      to
      end
      everything
      and
      make
      it
      seem
      like
      an
      accident.
      I #8217;m
      scared
      to
      be
      alone
      but
      I
      live
      alone.
      If
      it
      wasn #8217;t
      for
      work
      my
      life
      would
      have
      no
      meaning.
      I
      have
      no
      friends
      my
      family
      abandoned
      me
      to
       #8220;live #8221;
      life
      but
      I
      dont
      know
      if
      o
      can
      take
      much
      more
      of

      This
      happened
      literally
      half
      an
      hour
      ago
      as
      I
      type
      this.
      Regular
      shift
      at
      work
      (fast
      food
      place)
      phone
      rings
      and
      answer
      with
      the
      usual
      script
      to
      get
      the
      lovely
      response

      if
      I
      order
      now
      you #8217;re
      gonna
      give
      me
      the
      ride
      home
      yea #8221;
      This
      took
      me
      by
      surprise
      and
      as
      we
      dont
      take
      passengers
      in
      the
      delivery
      car
      (safety,
      security
      and
      insurance)
      I
      simply
      said
      that
      the
      driver
      wasn #8217;t
      able
      to.
      I
      was
      then
      told
      the
      address
      this
      lovely
      human
      specimen
      wanted
      to
      get
      to
      and
      knew
      instantly
      who
      it
      was.
      They #8217;re
      your
      typical
       #8220;do
      this
      and
      I #8217;ll
      be
      sure
      to
      leave
      a
      nice
      review #8221;

      The

      This

      by
      a

      Hell
      of
      a
      lot.
      Up
      to
      the
      age
      of
      15
      the
      only
      money
      I
      got
      was
      birthday/Christmas
      so
      for
      birthdays
      I #8217;d
      get
      a
      total
      of
       #163;50
      (50x15= #163;750)
      Christmas
      would
      receive
      about
       #163;150
      (150x15=2250)
      Since
      15
      Ive
      worked
      and
      for
      the
      first
      3
      years
      earned
       #163;500
      per
      month
      (500x12=6000.
      6000x3=18000)
      From
      18
      till
      now
      (21)
      I #8217;ve
      earned
       #163;1100
      per
      month
      (1100x12=13200.
      13200x3=39600)
      So
      to
      add
      them
      all
      together
      750+2250+18000+39600=60,600
      So
      in
      21
      years
      Ive
      had
      on
      average
       #163;60,600

      would
      have
      a
      tea
      and
      pick
      at
      a
      series
      of
      scabs
      on
      his
      head.
      He
      would
      line
      them
      up
      on
      the
      table
      until
      they
      where
      all
      off
      his
      head.
      Can #8217;t
      get
      worse.
      WRONG.
      Oh
      so
      very
      wrong.
      He
      would
      then
      take
      out
      a
      medium
      size
      ziplock
      bag
      and
      put
      all
      the
      scabs
      inside.
      He
      had
      the
      same
      bag
      every
      time
      he
      came
      in.
      And
      he
      filled
      the
      bag
      after
      about
      8
      months
      and
      then
      he #8217;d
      have
      another
      bag.
      This
      went
      on
      for
      about
      3
      years
      and
      he
      filled
      a
      fair
      few
      bags.
      What
      he
      did
      with
      them
      we
      never
      found
      out

      2
      years
      ago
      I
      told
      my
      ex
      that
      I
      still
      had
      feelings
      for
      her
      to
      be
      told
      that
      she
      needed
      to
      think
      about
      it.
      I
      didn #8217;t
      push
      the
      matter
      and
      didn #8217;t
      bring
      it
      up
      for
      nearly
      2
      months.
      At
      this
      time
      I
      was
      told
      that
      she
      wasn #8217;t
      sure
      that
      she
      still
      loved
      me
      like
      that.
      Sure
      it
      hurt
      but
      I
      could
      live
      with
      that.
      What
      I
      can #8217;t
      live
      with
      is
      the
      fact
      that
      last
      year
      I
      attempted
      to
      try
      dating
      again
      only
      to
      be
      verbally
      attacked
      by
      my
      ex
      about
      how
      I #8217;d
      said
      I
      loved
      her
      and
      she
      thought
      she
      would
      test
      how
      much
      by
      seeing
      if
      I
      dated
      again.
      So
      I
      called
      it
      off
      thinking
      that
      she
      wanted
      to
      get
      together
      to
      be
      told
       #8220;not
      yet #8221;
      again.
      And
      now
      suddenly
      I
      find
      out
      via
      social
      media
      that
      she #8217;s
      now
      in
      a
      relationship
      with
      someone
      else
      and
      she
      hasn #8217;t
      spoken
      to
      me
      in
      over
      4
      months.
      And
      now
      I
      don #8217;t
      trust
      people.
      I
      can #8217;t
      even
      trust
      the
      people
      closest
      to
      me.
      I #8217;m
      a
      shell
      of
      who
      I
      used
      to
      be
      and
      the
      dark
      thoughts
      interrupt
      several
      times
      a
      day.
      I
      smoke
      weed
      to
      numb
      them
      when
      I #8217;m
      not
      working
      but
      I
      don #8217;t
      know
      how
      much
      longer
      I
      can
      deal
      being
      stuck
      in
      my
      head

      I
      grew
      up
      in
      an
      incredibly
      unsettled
      and
      abusive
      environment
      never
      staying
      anywhere
      more
      than
      a
      year.
      I #8217;m
      21
      now
      and
      the
      town
      I
      currently
      live
      in
      is
      the
      longest
      I #8217;ve
      lived
      anywhere
      (8
      years)
      because
      of
      this
      I
      struggle
      to
      make
      friends
      and
      spend
      each
      day
      just
      trying
      not
      to
      end
      it
      all
      .
      I
      can #8217;t
      commit
      to
      relationships
      and
      generally
      suck
      at
      dealing
      with
      people.
      My
      boss
      at
      work
      has
      become
      a
      close
      friend
      and
      knows
      about
      my
      childhood
      and
      tries
      to
      help
      but
      I
      feel
      that
      I
      cause
      her
      endless
      amounts
      of
      extra
      stress
      which
      in
      turn
      makes
      me
      feel
      guilty
      and
      even
      more
      depressed.
      So
      yea
      having
      Nparents
      has
      royaly
      screwed
      with
      me
      and
      had
      made
      me
      hate
      life
      to
      the
      point
      that
      my
      last
      thought
      each
      night
      is
      wishing
      I
      don #8217;t
      have
      to
      wake
      up
      again

      Sorry
      if
      none
      of
      this
      makes
      sense
      but
      I
      just
      gotta
      declutter
      and
      this
      is
      the
      only
      way
      I
      can
      die
      to
      having
      nobody
      I
      can
      talk
      to
      without
      feeling
      guilty
      for
      burdening
      them
      with
      my
      issues
      So
      with
      the
      big
      21
      coming
      up
      my
      head
      is
      filled
      to
      bursting
      point
      and
      have
      spent
      many
      a
      sleepless
      night
      thinking.
      And
      suddenly
      realised
      that
      every
      birthday
      I
      can
      remember
      the
      wish
      I
      made
      whilst
      blowing
      out
      the
      candles
      has
      always
      been
      the
      same.
      I #8217;ve
      always
      wished
      to
      be
      happy.
      Of
      course
      the
      fact
      that
      I #8217;m
      struggling
      to
      survive
      each
      day
      means
      that
      wishes
      really
      don #8217;t
      come
      true.
      I
      honestly
      feel
      like
      life
      isn #8217;t
      even
      worth
      it
      anymore.
      And
      the
      cherry
      on
      top
      is
      that
      every
      time
      I
      think
      about
      death
      I
      feel
      guilty.
      Not
      for
      my
      family
      they
      left
      me
      long
      ago.
      But
      I
      feel
      guilty
      that
      if
      I
      die
      I #8217;m
      gonna
      leave
      my
      boss
      with
      no
      cover
      simply
      because
      I #8217;m
      the
      2IC
      and
      work
      the
      most
      shifts
      per
      week
      in
      a
      small
      team
      of
      4
      people
      with
      2
      people
      working
      on
      any
      given
      day.
      This
      means
      that
      if
      I
      end
      it
      my
      boss
      is
      stuck
      trying
      to
      find
      a
      new
      staff
      member
      on
      top
      of
      her
      life.
      It
      feels
      as
      if
      everything
      I
      do
      good
      or
      bad
      just
      goes
      wrong
      in
      every
      possible
      way.
      I
      tried
      to
      get
      a
      dog
      to
      help
      with
      the
      loneliness
      but
      can #8217;t
      pass
      a
      house
      check
      due
      to
      living
      in
      shared
      accommodation
      and
      I
      can #8217;t
      afford
      to
      buy
      a
      puppy.
      Yea
      I
      know
      there
      are
      other
      pets
      to
      have
      but
      I
      e
      had
      smaller
      pets
      and
      cats
      but
      they
      all
      seemed
      to
      hate
      me
      whereas
      a
      dog
      can
      cuddle
      up
      to
      you
      and
      you
      can
      go
      out
      and
      do
      stuff
      together.
      Death
      sounds
      so
      easy
      and
      tempting
      But
      I
      will
      say
      100%
      the
      only
      thing
      that
      helps
      in
      every
      situation
      is
      a
      massive
      spliff
      and
      music.
      This
      has
      been
      a
      rant
      by
      ME
      Thank
      you
      very
      much

      Last
      time
      I
      snuck
      up
      in
      someone
      was
      at
      the
      petrol
      station
      and
      saw
      a
      car
      that
      without
      seeing
      the
      plate
      looked
      like
      theirs
      and
      saw
      inside
      a
      person
      that
      looked
      just
      like
      them.
      So
      being
      the
      idiot
      I
      was
      just
      crept
      up
      behind
      and
      proceeded
      to
      scare
      the
      crap
      out
      of
      a
      complete
      stranger
      the
      guy
      on
      the
      till
      almost
      wet
      himself
      and
      I
      just
      wanted
      the
      ground
      to
      swallow
      me
      up.

      Death.
      Quite
      literally.
      As
      a
      baby
      I
      suffered
      sleep
      apnoea
      and
      on
      one
      occasion
      whilst
      in

      had
      all
      the
      machines
      beeping
      but
      a
      dumb
      doctor
      claiming
      that
      it
      was
      just
      bad
      technology.
      If
      it
      wasn #8217;t
      for
      a
      random
      nurse
      passing
      by
      the

      coming
      to

      me
      I
      wouldn #8217;t
      be
      here
      to
      type
      this
      story.
      I
      would
      like
      to
      clarify
      that
      I
      was
      told

      3
      takeaway
      cappuccinos
      and
      just
      as
      I
      was
      finishing
      pouring
      the
      3rd
      i
      dropped
      the
      milk
      jug
      with
      hot
      milk
      in
      it
      which
      bounced
      off
      the
      first
      full
      coffee
      cup
      and
      in
      my
      bid
      to
      catch
      the
      jug
      I
      knocked
      the
      other
      2
      coffees
      which
      ended
      up
      all
      down
      my
      front
      and
      the
      splashes
      even
      managed
      to
      get
      in
      my
      hair

      I #8217;m
      usually

      Honestly
      the
      best
      things
      to
      go
      for
      are
      the
      less
      popular
      items.
      Where
      I
      work
      the
      more
      popular
      items
      are
      usually
      cooked
      in
      huge
      batches
      and
      re
      heated
      but
      less
      common
      stuff
      if
      prepared
      too
      soon
      will
      go
      off
      so
      generally
      they
      just
      go
      from
      scratch.
      They
      want
      it
      fast
      and
      some
      foods
      don #8217;t
      cook
      fast
      enough

      Not
      sure
      on
      the
      laws
      where
      you
      are

      in

      uk
      if
      you
      was
      to
      get
      caught
      the
      car
      would

      by
      the

      insurance
      is
      invalidated
      if
      they
      drive
      without
      supervision.
      Also
      if
      you
      was
      to
      crash
      (even
      if
      your

      insurance
      would
      point
      blank
      refuse
      to
      it
      out.
      But
      as

      My
      Year
      11
      English
      teacher,
      who
      was
      hated
      by
      every
      student
      I
      knew,
      and
      me
      had
      a
      running
      fued
      that
      started
      after
      she
      accused
      me
      of
      being
      on
      drugs
      in
      her
      lesson.
      Bit
      of
      context...
      My
      entire
      life
      of
      struggles
      with
      sleep
      averaging
      about
      1-2
      hours
      per
      night.
      This
      lesson
      was
      last
      period
      on
      a
      Friday
      after
      a
      particularly
      rough
      week
      (exam
      prep).
      Anyway
      after
      I
      took
      (and
      passed)
      the
      drug
      test
      I
      made
      a
      point
      to
      bring
      it
      up
      to
      her
      as
      it
      was
      one
      of
      those
      moments
      that
      you
      can
      use
      to
      show
      the
      teacher
      they #8217;re
      wrong.
      This
      led
      to
      me
      being
      seated
      in
      the
      computer
      alcove
      in
      the
      classroom.
      Being
      in
      this
      alcove
      meant
      I
      couldn #8217;t
      see
      the
      white
      board
      or
      the
      work
      I
      was
      supposed
      to
      be
      doing
      so
      as
      anyone
      would
      I
      shuffled
      my
      chair
      back
      a
      bit
      to
      see
      the
      board
      and
      was
      told
      to
      face
      my
      work
      so
      I
      asked
      how
      I
      was
      supposed
      to
      do
      the
      work.
      This
      wasn #8217;t
      met
      with
      a
      response
      so
      again
      I
      shuffled
      back
      to
      see
      the
      board
      to
      again
      be
      told
      to
      look
      at
      my
      work
      at
      this
      point
      I #8217;ve
      had
      enough
      and
      with
      my
      temper
      rising
      I
      loudly
      stated
      that
       #8220;at
      least
      my
      works
      better
      than

      to
      say
      this
      led
      to
      an
      hour
      after
      school
      detention
      and
      a
      weeks

      up
      for
      either
      as
      in

      at
      school
      I
      was
      taken
      straight

      the
      head
      teachers
      office
      from
      Form
      (Homeroom)
      and
      searched
      by
      the
      police
      for
      a
      weapon
      as
      apparently
      I #8217;d
      made
      threats
      to
      stab
      the
      deputy
      head
      teacher.
      Needless
      to
      say
      I
      wasn #8217;t
      welcome
      to
      stay
      at

      It
      may
      or
      may
      not
      be
      disappointing
      to
      some
      people
      to
      know
      that
      I
      have
      decided
      to
      leave
      this
      group,
      but
      I
      am
      sick
      and
      tired
      of
      the
      constant
      criticisms
      and
      purile
      remarks
      about
      things
      that
      have
      nothing
      to
      do
      with
      anyone
      else
      but
      me.
      Okay...
      So
      I
      like
      dressing-up
      in
      ladies
      clothes.
      So
      what?
      And,
      my
      culinary
      tastes
      might
      seem
      strange
      to
      some
      people...
      but
      I
      have
      particular
      penchant
      for
      cucumbers.
      Which
      brings
      me
      to
      the
      matter
      of
      my
      sexual
      preferences,
      which
      I
      know
      might
      seem
      strange
      to
      some
      people,
      but
      group
      sex
      with
      dwarfs,
      midgets,
      and
      pygmies
      is
      only
      a
       #8216;small #8217;
      perversion
      compared
      to
      the
      other
      matter...
      And
      the
      magistrate
      was
      particularly
      understanding
      when
      I
      explained
      that
      running
      naked
      through
      our
      local
      park
      wearing
      my
      wife #8217;s
      underwear
      on
      my
      head
      and
      brandishing
      a
      dildo
      in
      each
      hand
      is
      an
      ancient
      pagan
      custom
      and...
      Oh
      shit!
      Wrong
      group!
      Please
      ignore
      all
      of
      the
      above...

      I
      understand
      where
      your
      coming
      from.
      When
      I
      still
      lived
      at
      home
      with
      my
      hoarder/clean
      freak
      mother
      any
      post
      would
      have
      to
      be
      opened
      by
      her
      and
      anything
      that
      fell
      out
      such
      as
      money
      from
      birthday/Xmas
      cards
      would
      be
      hers.
      And
      as
      for
      the
      hoarding
      she
      rarely
      chucked
      stuff
      away
      and
      yet
      if
      there
      was
      the
      smallest
      bit
      of
      dust
      or
      dirt
      I #8217;d
      receive
      a
      slap
      (as
      a
      minimum)
      and
      have
      to
      stand
      in
      the
      corner
      for
      an
      hour
      after
      having
      scrubbed
      everything
      clean
      again.
      So
      if
      you
      need
      to
      talk
      I
      always
      try
      my
      best
      to
      answer
