      [In
      Brazil
      in
      1966,
      two
      young
      male
      electronic
      technicians
      were
      found
      dead
      in
      a
      field,
      lying
      on
      their
      back
      with
      their
      hands
      behind
      their
      neck
      in
      a
      relaxing
      position.
      They
      were
      lying
      on
      a
      bed
      of
      leaves
      that
      seemed
      to
      have
      been
      hand-trimmed
      by
      scissors.
      They
      were
      wearing
      matching
      elegant
      suits
      and
      heavy
      raincoats.
      Beside
      them
      were
      2
      small
      sheets
      of
      lead
      cut
      into
      the
      shape
      of
      sunglasses,
      and
      an
      empty
      water
      bottle.
      The
      bartender
      who
      was
      found
      to
      have
      sold
      them
      the
      same
      bottle
      of
      water
      recalled
      that
      they
      looked
      nervous
      and
      kept
      checking
      their
      watch.
      This
      was
      the
      last
      person
      who
      saw
      them
      alive,
      although
      they
      most
      likely
      took
      a
      train
      to
      their
      destination.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_Masks_Case)

      That
      was...
      deep.
      It
      can
      lead
      to
      many
      different
      interpretations
      of
      what
      these
       #8220;real
      vampires #8221;
      are,
      but
      the
      title
      kinda
      make
      it
      self-explanatory.
      But
      the
      best
      of
      your
      poem
      is
      its
      lyricism,
      the
      sentimentalism
      in
      it.
      That #8217;s
      the
      meaning
      of
      poetry,
      in
      my
      opinion:
      it
      is
      a
      way
      of
      put
      everything
      off
      of
      your
      chest.
      And
      the
      theme
      chosen,
      depression,
      was
      the
      best
      possible:
      the
      way
      you
      described
      the
      feeling
      of
      a
      depressive
      accurately
      (I
      know
      this,
      since
      I #8217;m
      one)...
      Everything
      on
      this
      is
      just
      great.
      Just
      keep
      writing,
      man!

      The
      human
      beings
      (homo
      sapiens,
      as
      they
      call
      themselves)
      are
      the
      most
      intriguing
      species
      I,
      in
      my
      entire
      life,
      had
      the
      opportunity
      to
      analyze.
      If
      there
      was
      a
      word
      which
      could
      define
      them
      perfectly,
      that
      word
      would
      be
       #8220;contradiction #8221;.
      First,
      let
      us
      talk
      about
      their
      planet,
      which
      they
      call
       #8220;Earth #8221;,
      or
       #8220;Terra #8221;,
      despite
      it
      being
      70%
      made
      of
      water.
      It
      is
      a
      rocky
      planet,
      the
      third
      planet
      of
      its
      planetary
      system,
      with
      atmosphere
      and
      weather
      relatively
      pleasant,
      perfect
      for
      the
      life
      it
      contains.
      Earth
      is
      an
      vanishingly
      small
      planet
      (in
      the
      very
      same
      planetary
      system,
      there
      is
      another
      planet
      hundreds
      of
      times
      bigger).
      Thus,
      we
      could
      expect
      the
      humans
      to
      use
      their
      resources
      carefully,
      once
      they #8217;re
      extremely
      finite.
      But,
      as
      I
      said
      before,
      humans
      are
      very
      intriguing.
      For
      the
      sake
      of
       #8220;money #8221;,
       #8220;progress #8221;
      and
       #8220;industry #8221;,
      words
      they
      invented
      to
      represent
      things
      they
      invented,
      they
      destroy
      and
      pollute
      their
      small
      planet,
      which
      they
      call
       #8220;home #8221;.
      As
      a
      virus,
      that
      kills
      its
      host.
      Oh,
      but
      even
      a
      virus
      is
      more
      harmonic
      than
      this
      species
      which
      I
      was
      designated
      to
      observe!
      Their
      wars
      and
      spoliations
      are
      the
      vilest
      of
      all
      I #8217;ve
      seen
      before;
      they
      have
      no
      mercy
      towards
      their
      fellow
      men.
      Because
      of
      that
      culture
      of
      war
      and
      excessive
      battles,
      their
      technology
      grew
      exponencially;
      in
      two
      thousand
      years,
      they
      evolved
      in
      a
      way
      no
      other
      species
      in
      the
      Universe
      ever
      did.
      Not
      even
      ourselves.
      However,
      they
      don #8217;t
      know
      how
      to
      use
      that
      advancement
      properly:
      They
      could
      be
      travelling
      across
      the
      galaxy,
      forcing
      their
      place
      before
      all
      other
      species,
      but
      they
      just
      can #8217;t
      unite,
      not
      even
      when
      it
      is
      for
      the
      sake
      of
      their
      very
      planet.
      The
      Homo
      Sapiens #8217;s
      fate
      is
      to
      self-destruct.
      Either
      ending
      the
      resources
      of
      their
      planet,
      or
      using
      their
      massive
      destruction
      weapons
      (that
      would
      surprise
      even
      Your
      Excellency)
      against
      themselves.
      Such
      a
      shame,
      since
      they
      have
      so
      much
      potential
      to
      achieve
      what
      they
      want.
      But
      they
      are
      warriors
      by
      nature,
      and,
      without
      a
      common
      enemy,
      they
      shall
      use
      that
      hateful
      instinct
      against
      themselves.

      Ademir
      Antonio
      de
      Carli,
      a
      brazilian
      priest
      known
      for
      his
      cluster
      ballooning
      performances.
      On
      April
      20,
      2008,
      after
      taking
      off
      in
      a
      chair
      attached
      to
      1,000
      balloons,
      he
      was
      able
      to
      reach
      an
      altitude
      of
      19,700
      ft
      before
      losing
      contact

      disappearing
      from
      sight,
      never
      to
      be
      seen
      again.

      John
      Walkman
      was
      on
      his
      chair,
      at
      his
      home,
      just
      waiting
      for
      my
      arrival.
      I
      was
      just
      one
      of
      the
      few
      reporters
      that
      interviewed
      Walkman,
      or,
      as
      he
      is
      known
      in
      the
      scientific
      community:
      The
      Photographer
      of
      the
      Dead.
      That
      nickname
      is
      just
      because
      he
      has
      no
      more,
      no
      less
      than
      307
      pictures
      with
      extinct
      species.
      From
      hyacinth
      macaws
      to
      bald
      eagles,
      every
      single
      animal
      that
      he
      photographed
      become
      extinct
      not
      so
      long
      after
      the
      photo
      was
      taken.
      He
      soon
      become
      a
      legend
      on
      the
      artistic
      world:
      everyone
      would
      talk
      to
      the
      man
      who
      saw
      307
      extinct
      species
      before
      they
      went
      extinct.
      And,
      that #8217;s
      where
      I
      came
      in.
      A
      reporter
      from
      BBC,
      to
      whom
      was
      gave
      the
      opportunity
      of
      interviewing
      the
      Photographer
      of
      the
      Dead.
      John
      Eleanor
      Walkman.
      A
      living
      legend.
      The
      first
      thing
      I
      noted
      when
      I
      just
      entered
      his
      living
      room
      was
      a
      little
      bed
      table
      in
      the
      corner
      of
      the
      room,
      with
      five
      photos
      on
      it.
      Four
      of
      them
      was
      of
      endangered
      species,
      but
      one...
      One
      of
      them
      was
      of
      a
      little
      girl.
      I
      recognized
      it
      from
      the
      newspapers.
      She
      went
      missing
      about
      two
      years
      ago.
      When
      I
      asked
      him
      about
      that,
      he
      just
      said
       #8220;Yeah,
      I
      took
      a
      photo
      of
      her
      at
      request
      of
      her
      mother.
      I
      took
      two
      photos:
      one
      I
      gave
      to
      her,
      and
      this
      one
      stayed
      with
      me,
      specially
      after
      she
      went
      missing #8221;.
      I
      found
      that
      very
      suspicious,
      that
      she
      went
      missing
      the
      year
      he
      took
      the
      photo,
      and
      in
      my
      brain
      a
      link
      was
      formed
      between
      the
      endangered
      species
      and
      the
      girl...
      What
      if...
      I
      shook
      my
      head,
      throwing
      that
      idea
      away.
      That
      wasn #8217;t
      even
      possible.
      But
      I
      couldn #8217;t
      help
      thinking
      about
      that,
      when,
      after
      we
      finished
      our
      interview,
      he
      came
      to
      me,
      grinning,
      and
      said:
       #8220;Would
      you
      mind
      if
      I
      take
      a
      photo
      of
      you?
      Just
      for
      remembering,
      one
      of
      the
      few
      reporters
      to
      even
      come
      to
      this
      house #8221;.
      I
      just
      hope
      my
      thoughts
      are
      wrong.

      Think

      Okay,
      this
      needs
      some
      backstory.
      When
      I
      was
      in
      High
      School,
      I
      had
      a
      very
      close
      friend.
      So
      close
      I
      considered
      him
      a
      brother,
      since
      he
      knew
      my
      parents
      and
      virtually
      all
      my
      family.
      He
      was
      that
      kind
      of
      guy
      on
      High
      School
      that
      knows
      everyone,
      talks
      to
      everyone
      and
      makes
      friends
      with
      everyone.
      So,
      we
      met
      this
      girl
      when
      we
      were,
      like,
      Freshman
      or
      so,
      and
      he
      hated
      her
      from
      the
      first
      second
      he
      put
      his
      eyes
      on
      hers.
      He
      talked
      to
      me
      everyday
      about
      how
      she
      was
      a
      wanker,
      and
      something
      like
      that.
      We
      finished
      school,
      and
      I
      went
      to
      College
      on
      Germany,
      and
      ended
      up
      losing
      contact
      with
      him.
      Last
      month,
      about
      fifteen
      years
      later,
      I
      received
      an
      invite
      to
      his
      marriage.
      With
      that
      girl
      from
      High
      School.
