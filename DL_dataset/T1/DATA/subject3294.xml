      So,
      I'm
      a
      bisexual
      girl.
      I
      recently
      got
      out
      of
      a
      relationship
      with
      a
      girl,
      due
      to
      my
      crush
      on
      this
      one
      dude.
      This
      crush
      sprang
      out
      of
      nowhere,
      but
      it's
      pretty
      intense.
      I
      kind
      of
      want
      to
      pursue,
      but
      not
      yet
      as
      it's
      only
      been
      a
      few
      days
      since
      I've
      started
      crushing
      on
      him.
      I'm
      kind
      of
      afraid
      he
      won't
      like
      me
      or
      thinks
      I'm
      only
      attracted
      to
      girls.
      My
      friends
      tease
      him
      saying
      "Oh,
      Crush
      likes
      OP!"
      They
      don't
      know
      I
      like
      him
      though.
      I
      share
      4
      periods
      with
      him,
      and
      I
      sit
      in
      front
      of
      him
      during
      lunch.
      Do
      I
      just
      keep
      talking,
      trying
      to
      get
      closer
      with
      him?
      I
      want
      to
      get
      to
      know
      him
      better.
      But...
      There's
      also
      a
      chance
      I
      might
      move
      over
      the
      summer.
      What
      do
      I
      do?

      i
      agree.
      i
      was
      constantly
      harassed
      online
      when
      i
      was
      9
      (i
      know,
      9
      year
      olds
      shouldn't
      be
      online
      but
      i
      was)
      because
      i
      liked
      things
      that
      people
      considered
      cringy.

      So
      I'm
      take
      one
      bi
      girl
      from
      earlier.
      We
      just
      got
      new
      schedule
      at
      school.
      Now
      I
      have
      5
      out
      of
      7
      periods
      with
      him.
      At
      lunch,
      we
      talked
      together
      a
      little.
      I
      thought
      it
      was
      really
      nice
      because
      I
      sit
      in
      front
      of
      him
      normally,
      and
      we
      have
      the
      same
      friends,
      but
      we
      talk
      to
      each
      other
      more
      than
      the
      others.
      I
      try
      my
      best
      to
      wave
      at
      him
      or
      initiate
      conversations,
      which
      I'm
      proud
      of,
      since
      with
      earlier
      crushes
      I
      have
      not
      been
      that
      confident.
      I
      have
      had
      like
      2
      different
      experiences
      with
      crushes.
      One
      was
      when
      I
      crushed
      on
      my
      best
      friend,
      then
      one
      of
      my
      other
      friends
      told
      him,
      and
      I
      found
      out
      he
      liked
      me
      too.
      After
      summer
      break,
      he
      was
      gonna
      ask
      me
      out,
      then
      decided
      he
      wasn't
      into
      me
      anymore,
      so,
      yay.
      Another
      was
      with
      this
      dude.
      I
      had
      this
      after
      school
      thing,
      and
      we
      were
      split
      into
      groups
      for
      this.
      He
      and
      my
      best
      friend
      to
      this
      day
      were
      apart
      of
      this
      group.
      My
      best
      friend
      helped
      me
      confess
      to
      him
      one
      day,
      and
      near
      the
      last
      days
      of
      the
      school
      year,
      he
      gave
      me
      a
      rose
      and
      told
      me
      he
      kind
      of
      liked
      me
      too.
      Then
      we
      grew
      apart
      in
      middle
      school.
      So
      I've
      had
      mediocre
      luck
      with
      crushes.
      They've
      liked
      me
      back,
      but
      we've
      never
      actually
      gotten
      into
      a
      relationship.
      Kind
      of
      makes
      sense,
      since
      I
      was
      in
      elementary,
      but
      now
      I
      think
      it'll
      work
      out
      better
      since
      I'm
      older
      or
      whatever.
      I've
      been
      trying
      to
      talk
      to
      him
      more
      or
      interact
      with
      him.
      He's
      pretty
      funny,
      and
      he's
      a
      good
      guy
      to
      talk
      to.
      Maybe
      I'll
      keep
      you
      guys
      posted
      haha.

      Sometimes
      I
      wish
      I
      didn't
      have
      a
      crush
      on
      him.
      Other
      times
      I
      love
      having
      a
      crush.
      But
      no
      matter
      what
      I
      want,
      for
      now
      I'll
      really
      like
      him.
      We've
      been
      talking
      a
      lot
      more
      now,
      which
      I'm
      happy
      about
      because
      I'm
      actually
      trying
      to
      get
      closer
      with
      him.
      He's
      really
      funny,
      and
      a
      little
      negative
      at
      times
      haha.
      We
      also
      tend
      to
      make
      eye
      contact
      quite
      a
      bit
      when
      we
      talk.
      I
      actually
      told
      someone
      about
      my
      crush,
      because
      she
      said
      she
      was
      going
      to
      watch
      him
      to
      see
      of
      he
      likes
      me.
      There's
      a
      rumor,
      or
      joke
      that
      he
      likes
      me.
      Today,
      she
      told
      her
      friends
      too,
      which
      I
      was
      cool
      with.
      Her
      friend
      was
      speaking
      really
      loud
      though,
      and
      said
      "I
      knew
      Crush
      liked
      OP!"
      Which
      my
      crush
      heard,
      lol.
      Her
      friends
      also
      said
      we
      would
      be
      a
      good
      couple
      because
      we're
      both
      funny.
      Apparently
      I
      was
      blushing
      a
      lot,
      since
      my
      friend
      asked
      me
      why
      my
      cheeks
      were
      so
      red.
      Anyway,
      that's
      all
      for
      today,
      lol.

      But
      my
      friends
      don't

      I
      like
      him
      so

      I
      feel
      I've
      gotten
      a
      crush
      only
      because
      it's
      like
      a
      coping
      mechanism.
      Recently
      I've
      been
      incredibly
      anxious
      and
      depressed,
      and
      I've
      been
      feeling
      really
      empty.
      Having
      a
      crush
      has
      been
      giving
      me
      hope,
      a
      reason
      to
      go
      to
      school
      everyday.
      It
      gets
      me
      through
      daily
      tasks
      and
      everything.
      I
      don't
      have
      as
      many
      dark
      thoughts
      now
      as
      I
      did
      just
      a
      few
      weeks
      ago.
      That's
      not
      to
      say
      that
      my
      problems
      have
      gone
      away,
      but
      I've
      been
      given
      a
      distraction.
      It's
      kind
      of
      the
      best
      thing
      to
      happen
      to
      me
      as
      of
      late.
      Does
      anyone
      else
      think
      or
      is
      going
      through
      this?

      homophobe,
      it'll
      better
      for
      since
      you'd
      have
      dodged
      a
      bullet.
      I'm
      a
      bi
      girl
      too,
      so
      I
      do
      understand
      where
      you're
      coming
      from.

      I've
      never
      been
      the
      negative
      type.
      Even
      when
      I
      was
      going
      through
      a
      deep
      depression,
      my
      hopes
      survived,
      though
      it
      was
      really
      hard
      to
      keep
      them
      up.
      A
      lot
      of
      my
      friends
      are
      the
      types
      that
      hate
      everything,
      or
      just
      see
      no
      point.
      They
      always
      say
      stuff
      like
      how
      life
      has
      no
      meaning,
      but
      I
      think
      it's
      more
      you
      create
      your
      own
      meaning.
      Life
      is
      so
      different
      for
      everyone,
      not
      everyone
      will
      have
      the
      same
      meaning.
      That
      doesn't
      mean
      life
      isn't
      hard,
      but
      that
      there
      is
      something
      for
      everyone.
      I
      don't
      know
      if
      this
      is
      an
      INFP
      thing,
      but
      I
      just
      feel
      this
      belongs
      here.
      Maybe
      some
      of
      you
      will
      agree.

      My
      Thanatophobia
      (Might
      be
      Triggering)

      I've
      always
      had
      this
      dread,
      this
      horrible
      fear
      of
      the
      inevitability
      and
      eternity
      of
      death.
      My
      father
      is
      an
      atheist,
      so
      he
      never
      promoted
      any
      idea
      of
      a
      god
      or
      heaven.
      Anytime
      I
      had
      a
      moment
      of
      fear
      and
      told
      him,
      he
      told
      me
      to
      think
      of
      as
      sleeping.
      I
      know
      he
      was
      trying
      to
      help,
      but
      it
      only
      made
      the
      thoughts
      worse.
      Would
      death
      just
      be
      a
      darkness
      forever?
      Never
      able
      to
      experience
      anything
      again?
      Never
      be
      able
      to
      speak,
      have
      fun,
      do
      what
      I
      want?
      It
      brings
      me
      so
      much
      panic
      sometimes
      I
      can't
      sleep.
      It's
      been
      like
      this
      since
      I
      was
      6
      years
      old.
      I've
      always
      felt
      so
      abnormal
      about
      my
      fear.
      Everyone
      seems
      content
      with
      the
      idea
      of
      death.
      Sometimes
      they
      even
      desire
      it.
      I
      had
      a
      period
      of
      time
      where
      I
      was
      suicidal,
      but
      this
      was
      the
      only
      time
      my
      fear
      actually
      helped
      me,
      saving
      me
      from
      killing
      myself.
      But
      that
      time
      is
      over
      now.
      Now
      it
      only
      affects
      me
      negatively.
      I
      hate
      learning
      about
      space.
      It's
      so
      funny;
      I'm
      afraid
      of
      the
      sun
      exploding,
      despite
      the
      fact
      that
      I'll
      be
      long
      gone.
      I
      remember
      nearly
      crying
      during
      science
      class
      because
      I
      was
      so
      scared.
      I
      wish
      this
      fear
      would
      go
      away,
      but
      it's
      not
      like
      I
      can
      ever
      face
      my
      fear,
      not
      unless
      I
      can
      come
      back
      to
      life.
      That's
      my
      experience
      with
      thanatophobia.
      I
      hope
      to
      reach
      a
      point
      where
      this
      is
      finally
      behind
      me.
      I
      wish
      everyone
      else
      luck
      with
      getting
      over
      this
      dreadful
      fear.

      I've
      never
      been
      diagnosed
      with
      dermatillomania,
      but
      I
      feel
      pretty
      confident
      I
      may
      have
      it,
      or
      at
      least
      some
      skin
      issue.
      I
      have
      keratosis
      pilaris,
      so
      I
      get
      bumps
      all
      over
      my
      arms
      and
      a
      little
      on
      my
      legs.
      I
      don't
      really
      pick
      at
      my
      arms,
      more
      like
      squeezing.
      It
      always
      leaves
      my
      skin
      red
      and
      irritated.
      Recently,
      I
      guess
      I've
      been
      squeezing
      it
      harder
      since
      it's
      redder.
      I
      also
      pick
      at
      chest,
      face,
      and
      back.
      They
      all
      have
      multiple
      scars
      on
      it
      from
      excessive
      picking.
      Since
      I'm
      still
      a
      teen,
      I
      get
      lots
      of
      acne
      normally.
      I
      try
      really
      hard
      to
      stop.
      But
      I
      just
      can't
      stop.
      I
      don't
      even
      realize
      I'm
      doing
      it
      sometimes,
      I
      just
      get
      so
      into
      it.
      It's
      really
      impacting
      my
      self
      esteem.
      I've
      had
      self
      esteem
      issues
      related
      to
      my
      skin
      before,
      as
      I
      have
      scars
      from
      self
      harm
      that
      are
      very
      apparent.
      My
      family
      don't
      help
      either.
      They've
      called
      my
      arms
      ugly
      as
      well
      as
      my
      beat
      friend.
      My
      dad
      just
      thinks
      of
      it
      as
      a
      bad
      habit,
      and
      guilt
      trips
      me
      to
      try
      to
      stop.
      He
      doesn't
      think
      of
      it
      as
      an
      issue
      I
      guess,
      because
      he
      doesn't
      care
      enough
      to
      try
      and
      understand
      why
      I
      pick.
      My
      aunt
      was
      more
      understanding,
      but
      still,
      no
      matter
      how
      emotional
      or
      powerful
      of
      a
      talk
      you
      give
      me,
      I
      won't
      be
      able
      to
      stop.
      I've
      tried
      so
      many
      times
      with
      no
      success.
      I
      was
      wondering
      about
      scar
      healing
      cream
      or
      ways
      to
      stop
      picking
      when
      I'm
      bored
      at
      home.
      Does
      anyone
      have
      any
      advice?
      Please,
      I
      hate
      picking
      at
      my
      skin,
      I
      don't
      want
      my
      body
      to
      be
      scarred.

      Thank
      you!
      I
      have
      been
      trying
      to
      take
      care
      of
      myself
      more,
      so
      I
      hope
      it'll
      play
      into
      helping
      me
      stop.
      Though,
      I
      think
      a
      big
      step
      for
      me
      would
      telling
      my
      parents,
      so
      I
      can
      get
      professional
      help
      too.
      I
      have
      some
      other
      problems
      regarding
      anxiety,
      and
      I
      hear
      dermatillomania
      stems
      from
      that.
      Again,
      thank
      you!
      I
      really
      appreciate
      these
      methods
      because
      using
      a
      fidgeting
      tool
      never
      really
      works
      as
      a
      relapse
      just
      comes
      out
      of
      the
      blue.

      Same.
      My
      mom
      would
      joke
      that
      I
      had
      a
      brain
      tumor
      if
      I
      had
      a
      headache,
      but
      I
      took
      that
      seriously
      and
      didn't
      sleep
      that
      day.

      For
      me
      it's
      probably
      hair
      and
      eyes
      for
      physical.
      I
      love
      all
      color
      hair
      and
      eyes.
      For
      mental,
      I
      like
      humor
      and
      being
      understanding.
      I
      never

      the

      I

      are

      haha.
      I
      guess
      I
      like
      the
      more
      nerdy
      types
      too.

      This
      dude
      is
      just
      too
      cute
      sometimes!
      I
      almost
      squealed
      in
      class
      because
      of
      that.
      He
      did
      this
      weird
      shaking
      thing
      with
      his
      hands
      to
      get
      some
      people
      to
      move
      out
      of
      the
      way,
      and
      it
      was
      the
      most
      adorable
      thing
      I've
      ever
      seen.
      Anyway,
      that's
      beside
      the
      point.
      I
      told
      his
      friend
      (Some
      of
      his
      friends
      are
      my
      friends
      too)
      that
      I
      liked
      him
      and
      now
      that
      dude
      won't
      stop
      grinning
      everytime
      I'm
      around
      my
      crush.
      My
      crush
      also
      sat
      pretty
      close
      to
      me
      today
      when
      my
      2nd
      period
      teacher
      was
      gone,
      so
      we
      had
      to
      go
      to
      the
      lunch
      area.
      He
      sat
      right
      in
      front
      of
      me,
      when
      there
      were
      multiple
      other
      seats
      farther
      away.
      We
      also
      worked
      on
      a
      science
      project
      together,
      since
      he
      asked
      me
      if
      I
      wanted
      to
      work
      together!
      Heck
      yeah!
      We
      did
      decent
      work,
      even
      if
      the
      computer
      was
      barely
      functioning.
      We've
      been
      talking
      a
      lot
      lately,
      and
      I'm
      glad.
      Hope
      that
      there'll
      be
      more
      progress
      soon!

      Definitely
      agree.
      I
      have
      naturally
      dark
      and
      thick
      eyebrows,
      even
      been
      insulted
      for
      them.
      But
      even
      so
      I
      don't
      want
      to
      make
      this
      a
      trend
      as
      it's
      so
      unattractive.

      I
      see
      what
      you
      mean.
      It
      could
      look
      good
      on
      certain
      people
      with
      certain
      faces,
      but
      that's
      not
      always
      the
      case
      with
      the
      people
      who
      make
      their
      eyebrows
      fuller
      or
      thicker.

      Me
      too!
      I
      made
      a
      post
      about
      this.
      I
      used
      to
      not
      care
      about
      my
      acne,
      my
      hair,
      what
      I
      wore,
      how
      I
      acted,
      just
      didn't
      care
      about
      how
      I
      presented.
      Now
      I
      always
      take
      time
      to
      look
      good,
      and
      it
      has
      risen
      my
      self
      esteem
      quite
      a
      bit.
      I
      talk
      more
      and
      have
      made
      more
      friends,
      and
      I've
      started
      going
      for
      walks
      and
      just
      have
      been
      a
      lot
      happier
      lately.
      Before
      I
      was
      lonely,
      depressed,
      nearly
      suicidal,
      and
      wanted
      to
      run
      away
      from
      home.
      Definitely
      an
      upgrade
      haha.

      Same,
      and
      people
      think
      I'm
      weird
      because
      I
      wanna
      go
      back
      to
      school
      and
      because
      I
      don't
      want
      spring
      break.

      What
      I've
      done
      is
      scroll
      through
      my
      phone
      and
      find
      something
      interesting,
      then
      bring
      it
      up
      or
      show
      it
      to
      them.
      It
      can
      spark
      a
      little
      chat
      and
      maybe
      learn
      more
      about
      them.
      Idk,
      depends
      how
      close
      you
      are
      to
      them.

      I
      told
      my
      crush's
      friend
      I
      liked
      his
      friend.
      Now
      he's
      always
      teasing
      lol.
      He
      keeps
      saying
      I
      should
      tell
      him
      or
      asking
      my
      crush
      to
      ask
      me
      out.
      So
      this
      was
      like
      before
      we
      were
      released
      to
      go
      home.
      I
      was
      talking
      to
      the
      dude,
      and
      he
      was
      saying
      to
      tell
      him.
      Like
      really
      loudly
      I
      guess,
      because
      another
      friend
      came
      over
      and
      asked
      what
      we
      were
      talking
      about
      and
      why
      we
      said
      "Should
      I
      tell
      him?"
      Well,
      it
      just
      so
      happened
      my
      crush
      came
      over
      at
      the
      same
      time
      too.
      He
      was
      like
      "Ooh
      tell
      me
      what
      are
      you
      talking
      about?"
      And
      I
      gave
      his
      friend
      the
      side
      glare
      for
      talking
      so
      loud.
      I
      just
      said
      nothing,
      but
      obviously
      that
      wasn't
      true.
      Then
      he
      said
      if
      I
      didn't
      tell
      him
      he
      wouldn't
      talk
      to
      me
      forever
      lol.
      Didn't
      tell
      him,
      but
      now
      I
      know
      I
      gotta
      be
      quieter.
      Or
      tell
      other
      people
      to
      be
      quieter
      lol.
      I
      spent
      all
      of
      my
      2nd
      period
      talking
      with
      him,
      he
      always
      makes
      me
      laugh
      lol.
      Anyways,
      that
      was
      today!
      : gt;
      Wish
      everyone
      luck
      with
      their
      crush!

      You
      all
      probably
      know
      the
      typical
      13
      year
      old
      boy
      who
      screeches
      and
      gets
      angry
      while
      playing
      games
      like
      Fortnite.
      Sure,
      they
      exist,
      but
      again,
      they're
      13.
      A
      lot
      of
      my
      guy
      friends
      play
      Fortnite.
      In
      real
      life,
      off
      the
      games,
      they're
      really
      cool,
      funny
      dudes.
      Heck,
      even
      I
      play
      Fortnite.
      Right
      now,
      I
      think
      it's
      just
      trendy
      to
      hate
      on
      Fortnite,
      because
      people
      like
      it.
      Anytime
      anything
      gets
      popular,
      people
      start
      hating
      just
      because
      a
      lot
      of
      people
      like
      it.
      It's
      also
      just
      to
      hate
      on
      little
      kids
      for
      no
      reason.
      Like
      come
      on,
      they're
      teens.
      They're
      barely
      grown.
      They
      just
      wanna
      play
      games.
      Sometimes
      people
      get
      heated
      during
      competitive
      games.
      Fortnite
      as
      a
      game
      isn't
      bad
      either.
      I
      like
      to
      play
      it
      when
      I'm
      bored.
      It's
      a
      fun
      game,
      and
      the
      players
      and
      the
      game
      don't
      deserve
      the
      hate
      it's
      getting
      right
      now.

      Exactly,
      since
      they're
      actually
      supposed

      So
      I'm
      on
      spring
      break,
      and
      I
      really
      wanna
      get
      back
      to
      school,
      to
      see
      my
      crush
      and
      for
      other
      reasons
      too.
      I've
      been
      dreaming
      about
      him
      and
      just
      can't
      stop
      thinking
      about
      him.
      I
      really
      want
      to
      talk
      to
      him
      again.
      The
      days
      feel
      long
      and
      I
      just
      want
      them
      to
      pass
      faster.
      I
      just
      feel
      really
      bored
      and
      wish
      spring
      break
      was
      over
      with
      by
      now.
      School's
      almost
      over,
      so
      I
      hope
      I
      can
      gain
      the
      confidence
      to
      confess
      before
      it's
      too
      late.
      Wish
      everyone
      luck
      with
      their
      crushes
      too!

      So

      face,
      chest,
      and
      arms
      and
      it's
      really
      damaging
      my
      self
      esteem
      lately.
      I
      can't
      wear
      certain
      things
      because
      they're
      too
      revealing.
      Is
      there
      any
      creams
      you
      would
      recommend
      to
      make
      the
      scars
      less
      apparent?
      I've
      tried
      coconut
      oil,
      but
      I've
      find
      that
      it
      makes
      my
      skin
      really
      oily
      and
      makes
      me
      break
      out,
      leading
      to
      more
      picking.
      What
      do
      you
      guys
      recommend?
      What
      has
      worked
      for
      you?

      I
      started
      self
      harm
      at
      around
      10
      or
      11,
      and
      it's
      progressed
      a
      lot
      throughout
      the
      years.
      Cutting,
      for
      me,
      is
      just
      a
      constant
      in
      my
      life.
      It's
      always
      there
      for
      me,
      if
      I
      need
      it.
      It's
      the
      only
      stability
      in
      my
      life.
      I'll
      always
      find
      something
      to
      use.
      Lately,
      I
      haven't
      been
      depressed.
      Not
      the
      happiest
      either,
      but
      I'm
      not
      feeling
      really
      bad.
      But
      even
      so,
      I
      still
      cut.
      Either
      I've
      become
      desensitized
      to
      depression
      that
      I
      don't
      even
      notice
      it,
      or
      cutting
      has
      become
      so
      normal
      that
      I'll
      just
      do
      it
      on
      a
      whim.
      Has
      anyone
      else
      felt
      this?
      I
      feel
      pretty
      normal,
      I'm
      not
      unhappy.
      But
      I
      still
      have
      a
      lot
      of
      urges
      to
      cut,
      sometimes
      I
      even
      subdue
      to
      the
      urges.
      It's
      kind
      of
      weird.
