      My
      boss
      is
      a
      sexist
      pig.
      On
      top
      of
      the
      myriad
      of
      inappropriate
      things
      he
      has
      said
      to
      me
      over
      the
      years,
      he
      lately
      passed
      me
      up
      for
      a
      potential
      promotion
      in
      favor
      of
      one
      of
      my
      male
      employees,
      despite
      the
      fact
      that
      I
      have
      experience
      doing
      this
      job,
      and
      my
      employee
      did
      not.
      When
      I
      confronted
      my
      boss
      about
      it
      his
      literal
      response
      was,
       #8220;The
      hours
      can
      be
      long,
      the
      work
      can
      be
      really
      dirty,
      and
      I
      honestly
      didn #8217;t
      think
      of
      it
      as
      a
      woman #8217;s
      job #8221;.
      What
      year
      did
      this
      happen,
      you
      might
      ask?
      1975?
      Nope!
      2019.
      I
      went
      straight
      to
      HR
      with
      it,
      along
      with
      a
      list
      of
      the
      other
      shit
      he
      has
      said,
      like,
       #8220;School
      shootings
      are
      a
      direct
      result
      of
      the
       #8216;women #8217;s
      movement #8217;.
      Women
      aren #8217;t
      staying
      home
      with
      the
      kids
      anymore
      because
      they
      think
      it #8217;s
      more
      important
      to
      have
      JOBS... #8221;,
      and
       #8220;isn #8217;t
      buying
      flowers
      a
      woman #8217;s
      job? #8221;
      I
      could
      go
      on
      and
      on
      about
      this
      piece
      of
      work.
      (The
      company
      has
      yet
      to
      do
      a
      goddamned
      thing
      about
      this
      guy)

      I
      (F)
      was
      preparing
      to
      replace
      the
      water
      pump
      and
      timing
      belt
      on
      my
      Jetta,
      but
      I
      wanted
      some
      latex
      gloves
      to
      keep
      from
      getting
      too
      much
      grime
      all
      over
      my
      hands.
      I
      go
      to
      my
      local
      hardware
      store
      and
      ask
      the
      first
      man
      I
      see,
       #8220;Where
      can
      I
      find
      your
      latex
      gloves? #8221;
       #8220;What
      for,
      washing
      dishes? #8221;,
      he
      asks.
       #8220;No,
      for
      disposing
      of
      a
      body. #8221;,
      I
      respond
      dryly.

      Another
      one
      I
      (F)
      had
      was
      a
      neighbor
      who
      came
      knocking
      at
      my
      door.
      I
      answer,
      and
      he
      asks,
       #8220;uh,
      is
      the
      man
      of
      the

       #8220;I
      sure

      I
      said.
       #8220;Uh.
      Well.
      I
      wanted
      to
      see
      if
      he #8217;s
      willing
      to
      sell
      his
      truck
      that #8217;s
      parked
      outside. #8221;
       #8220;Well,
      it #8217;s
      my
      truck,
      and
      I #8217;m
      not
      selling
      it. #8221;
      ::awkward

      He
      went
      home
      and
      murdered
      his
      wife

      night

      Yeah...sadly
      it #8217;s
      a
      true
      story.
      While
      at
      our
      door
      the
      guy
      seemed
      like
      he
      was
      tweaking.
      My
      husband
      and
      I
      went
      about
      our
      day,
      and
      after
      dinner
      he
      goes
      out
      back
      for
      a
      smoke
      and
      sees
      flashing
      red
      and
      blues
      everywhere.
      We
      watch
      as
      an
      ambulance
      drives
      off
      slowly,
      without
      its
      lights
      on.
      Husband
      says,
       #8220;maybe
      the
      dude
      was
      mad
      because
      you
      were
      the
      man
      of
      our
      house,
      so
      he
      and
      went
      home
      and
      killed
      his
      wife. #8221;
      I
      figured
      someone
      had
      a
      heart
      attack
      or
      something.
      The
      next
      morning
      I
      get
      a
      text
      from
      my
      dad,
      saying
       #8220;MURDER
      NEXT
      DOOR??? #8221;
      Turns
      out
      my
      husband
      was
      at
      least
      half
      right.
      They
      had
      a
      fight,
      she
      told
      him
      she
      wanted
      a
      divorce,
      and
      he
      shot
      her
      in
      the
      head
      in
      their
      bathroom.
      Then
      he
      called
      her
      parents
      and
      told
      them
      he
      killed
      her.
      They
      didn #8217;t
      believe
      him,
      so
      he
      made
      his
      own
      son
      get
      on
      the
      phone
      to
      confirm.
      Totally
      fucked
      up
      situation.
      Don #8217;t
      do
      meth,
      kids.

      Thanks!
      I #8217;ve
      started
      buying
      the
      thicker
      nitrile
      gloves
      from
      harbor
      freight.
      They
      work
      great
      when
      you
      have
      situations
      that
      require
      a
      bit
      more
      dexterity.
      I
      haven #8217;t
      had
      too
      many
      tears
      with
      them
      so
      far.
      I
      also
      use
      them
      in
      my
      job
      doing
      materials
      testing
      for
      road
      construction,
      and
      they #8217;re
      great
      for
      that
      too.

      Champagne
      Nape.
      Can
      be
      any

      standing,
      sitting,
      lying
      down,

      I
      notice
      them
      in
      the
      mornings
      a
      lot.
      It
      just
      feels/sounds
      like
      tiny
      little
      champagne
      bubbles
      trickling
      up
      the
      nape
      of
      my
      neck.
      It #8217;s
      been
      happening
      as
      long
      as
      I
      can

      When
      I
      was
      about
      12
      my
      dad
      took
      my
      sister
      and
      I
      up
      camping
      in
      the
      mountains
      in
      Colorado.
      We
      took
      a
      drive
      one
      day
      down
      what
      is
      known
      as
      the
      Last
      Dollar
      Road
      in
      his
      old
       #8216;75
      F-250.
      I
      remember
      driving
      through
      a
      Quakey
      Tree-lined
      road
      that
      opened
      to
      a
      very,
      very
      steep
      slope
      with
      about
      a
      200 #8217;
      drop
      on
      the
      downhill
      side.
      We
      started
      to
      traverse
      the
      narrow
      cut
      in
      the
      mountainside
      when
      it
      started
      absolutely
      pouring
      rain.
      I
      mean,
      microburst
      level
      rain.
      This
      is
      a
      dirt
      road,
      mind
      you,
      and
      turned
      into
      slick
      mud
      instantly.
      I
      remember
      feeling
      the
      back
      end
      of
      the
      truck
      start
      to
      slip
      towards
      the
      downhill
      side,
      and
      dad
      telling
      us
      to
      make
      sure
      our
      seatbelts
      were
      on.
      I
      knew
      we
      weren #8217;t
      in
      any
      danger
      because
      dad
      was
      in
      charge,
      and
      I
      was
      sure
      had
      been
      through
      worse.
      He
      stopped,
      locked
      the
      hubs
      and
      put
      it
      in
      4
      low.
      We
      still
      slipped
      and
      slid
      around
      on
      that
      muddy
      track,
      but
      I
      think
      he
      must #8217;ve
      gotten
      one
      wheel
      into
      a
      rut,
      and
      we
      eventually
      and
      made
      it
      to
      the
      other
      side
      where
      the
      slope
      evened
      out.
      Technically
      I
      guess
      this
      story
      is
      a
      situation
      he
      thought
      we #8217;d
      never
      get
      out
      of,
      because
      when
      I
      asked
      him
      about
      it
      recently,
      20
      years
      after
      the
      fact,
      he
      still
      got
      chills,
      his
      hair
      stood
      on
      end,
      and
      his
      eyes
      started
      watering
      just
      talking
      about
      it.
      He
      apparently
      did
      not
      have
      the
      confidence
      in
      his
      abilities
      that
      my
      naive
      ass
      did
      that
      day,
      and
      he
      honestly
      though
      we
      were
      all
      going
      to
      roll
      down
      that
      slope
      and
      die
      that
      day.

      I
      (32)
      got
      my
      tubes
      tied
      and
      uterus
      ablated
      last
      December.
      My
      husband
      now
      endearingly
      calls
      my
      womb
      the
       #8220;ash
      heap #8221;
      (Fallout
      76
      joke.
      We
      are
      nerds)
      Since
      my
      surgery
      I #8217;ve
      been
      just
      waiting
      for
      someone
      to
      ask
      me
      when
      I #8217;m
      having
      kids
      just
      so
      I
      can
      awkwardly
      tell
      them,
       #8220;my
      uterus
      is
      a
      barren
      wasteland,
      thanks
      for
      asking. #8221;
      Sadly,
      not
      one
      single
      goddamned
      person
      has
      had
      the
      gall
      to
      ask
      about
      it!
      I #8217;m
      slightly
      disappointed.
      I
      feel
      worse
      for
      my
      parents,
      because
      neither
      of
      my
      sisters
      want
      to
      pop
      out
      a
      curtain
      climber
      either.
      Thankfully,
      mom
      and
      dad
      are
      A-okay
      with
      that
      decision,
      but
      they
      get
      annoyed
      with
      always
      being
      asked,
       #8220;but
      don #8217;t
      you
      want
      grandchildren?? #8221;

      We
      have
      two
      cats.
      One
      is
      a
      10
      year
      old
      fatty,
      and
      the
      other
      a
      part
      Maine
      coon
      19
      year
      old.
      Fatty
      likes
      to
      cuddle
      at
      bed
      time,
      so
      every
      night
      he
      announces
      his
      presence
      with
      a
      series
      of
      loud
      meows
      as
      he
      scrabbles
      his
      way
      on
      to
      the
      bed.
      We
      all
      go
      to
      sleep.
      A
      few
      hours
      later
      the
      old
      one
      wakes
      up
      and
      wants
      to
      eat.
      However,
      he
      doesn #8217;t
      want
      to
      eat
      alone,
      so
      he
      does
      this
      weird
      cooing
      meow
      he
      ONLY
      does
      when
      summoning
      the
      fatso
      at
      night.
      We
      all
      wake
      up,
      fatty
      goes
      to
      have
      a
      midnight
      snack
      with
      old
      fart,
      and
      we
      go
      back
      to
      sleep.
      20
      minutes
      later
      fatty
      comes
      back
      into
      the
      room
      to
      cuddle
      some
      more,
      but
      absolutely
      must
      announce
      his
      presence
      again.
      This
      cycle
      repeats
      until
      my
      husband
      gets
      up.

      Yeah
      we
      definitely
      do.
      We #8217;ve
      tried
      all
      sorts
      of
      things
      to
      get
      them
      to

      habit,
      but
      nothing
      so
      far
      has
      worked.
      We
      get
      maybe
      1-2
      nights
      a
      week
      where
      they

      do
      that.

      I
      don #8217;t
      typically
      care

      made
      her
      own
       #8220;healthy #8221;
      creamer
      alternative.
      It
      had
      a
      whole
      can
      of
      sweetened
      condensed
      milk,
      heavy
      cream,
      a
      shit
      load
      of
      sugar,
      and
      flavoring.
      She #8217;d
      put
      4
      tablespoons
      of
      that,
      PLUS
      1/4
      cup
      of
      sugar
      in
      her
      travel
      mug
      every
      day.
      Then
      bitch
      about
      not
      being
      able
      to
      lose
      weight.

       #8220;pass

      a
      #10
      and

      Nothing.
      When
      I
      was
      21
      my
      mom
      tried
      to
      discourage
      me
      from
      riding
      motorcycles
      by
      graphically
      describing
      to
      me
      a
      fatal
      accident
      she
      saw.
      She
      was
      directly
      behind
      a
      man
      when
      he
      ran
      into
      a
      jersey
      barrier
      at
      about
      65.
      She
      told
      me
      about
      seeing
      him
      hit
      the
      barrier,
      fly
      over
      it,
      and
      land
      on
      his
      head.
      She
      described
      seeing
      his
      brain
      matter
      on
      the
      pavement.
      Turned
      out
      to
      be
      my
      first
      crush.
      I
      was
      devastated.
      I
      hadn #8217;t
      seen
      him
      in
      a
      decade,
      but
      your
      first
      crush
      always
      holds
      a
      place
      in
      your
      heart.
      I
      think
      about
      him
      every
      July
      31st,
      on
      the
      anniversary
      of
      his
      death,
      and
      in
      December
      on
      his
      birthday.

      My
      husband
      does
      this,
      and
      it
      drives
      me
      bonkers.

      I
      feel
      for
      you.
      During
      times
      of
      extreme
      stress
      mine
      can
      get
      to
      that
      point.
      The
      only
      thing
      that
      has
      worked
      as
      a
      deterrent
      for
      me
      is
      to
      get
      manicures
      on
      the
      reg.
      For
      one
      thing,
      I
      am
      ashamed
      to
      go
      in
      and
      have
      nasty
      looking
      cuticles.
      Two,
      they
      trim
      the
      cuticles
      for
      me,
      evening
      out
      the
      uneven
      bits
      that
      I
      want
      to
      pick
      at.
      Three,
      I
      think
      about
      the
      money
      I #8217;m
      spending
      on
      manicures
      and
      don #8217;t
      want
      to
      make
      it
      go
      to
      waste
      by
      tearing
      my
      hands
      to
      shreds.
      Luckily
      I
      have
      a
      husband
      who
      will
      scold
      me
      when
      he
      catches
      me
      doing
      it,
      and
      force
      me
      to
      go
      out
      on
      gloves
      if
      I
      won #8217;t
      quit.
      Keep
      trying,
      don #8217;t
      stop
      seeking
      help,
      and
      remember
      there
      are
      a
      ton
      of
      people
      out
      there
      who
      suffer
      from
      the
      same
      problem.
      We
      are
      here
      for
      you.

      I
      have
      to
      pop
      both
      my
      ankles
      before
      I
      can
      go
      to
      sleep.

      He

      just
      got
      this
      yesterday
      but
      was
      too
      slow
      to
      get
      a
