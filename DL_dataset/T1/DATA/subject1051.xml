      Hi,
      so
      I've
      been
      using
      Reddit
      for
      a
      couple
      of
      months
      now
      and
      this
      is
      my
      first
      time
      posting
      something
      like
      this.
      So
      I
      had
      just
      received
      an
      email
      from
      a
      company
      that
      I
      sent
      a
      job
      applications
      to
      a
      few
      months
      ago.
      And
      it
      says
      I'm
      hired.
      But
      I
      just
      need
      to
      go
      to
      one
      of
      their
      packet
      sessions
      and
      fill
      all
      the
      legal
      paper
      works.
      Just
      to
      be
      a
      little
      bit
      more
      clear,
      this
      is
      a
      company
      that
      hire
      high
      schoolers
      for
      the
      summer,
      and
      some
      time
      during
      the
      school
      semesters.
      I'm
      a
      fourteen
      years
      old
      high
      schooler,
      and
      I
      wanted
      a
      job
      so
      I
      signed
      up.
      Now
      that
      I've
      been
      accepted,
      I
      have
      to
      give
      them
      my
      bank
      routing
      account,
      so
      it
      can
      go
      thru
      all
      the
      legal
      transactions.
      The
      thing
      is,
      I
      have
      my
      own
      bank
      account
      thru
      my
      school's
      branch
      of
      a
      bank.
      But
      I
      don't
      have
      a
      check
      book
      nor
      my
      account
      number.
      But
      I
      do
      have
      a
      copy
      of
      a
      check
      with
      a
      different
      routing
      number
      for
      the
      bank.
      I
      had
      asked
      the
      staffs
      that
      work
      there,
      how
      this
      work
      and
      they
      told
      me
      that,
      my
      employers
      would
      transfer
      my
      amount
      of
      money
      to
      the
      routing
      number
      which
      would
      then
      transfer
      to
      my
      bank
      account.
      I'm
      not
      sure
      if
      this
      is
      how
      it
      normally
      goes
      but
      I
      want
      to
      try
      and
      prepare
      myself
      for
      my
      senior
      year
      of
      high
      school
      and
      college,
      as
      that's
      when
      I
      will
      be
      moving
      away
      from
      home
      and
      be
      independent.
      Also
      if
      I'm
      breaking
      any
      rules
      of
      this
      subreddit
      please
      tell
      me.

      Bought
      a
      $60
      Amazon
      gift
      card
      to
      try
      and

      a

      didn't
      get
      the
      PlayStation
      gift
      card
      because
      my
      local
      Walgreen
      ran
      out
      of
      them.
      Discovered
      that
      to
      get
      the
      season
      pass
      thru
      Amazon
      you
      need
      a

      card.
      Had
      the
      gift
      cards
      already
      registered
      in.
      Said
      "
      Fuck
      it",
      looked
      for
      different
      game.
      Saw
      witcher
      three.
      Watched
      angry
      Joe
      review
      it,
      bought
      the
      next
      hour
      with
      two
      day
      shipping.
      And
      the
      spent
      the
      next
      two
      days
      learning
      about

      for
      the
      meal?
      If
      not,
      then
      it's
      either
      a
      asian
      and
      western
      fusion
      dish
      or
      anything
      that
      Gordan
      Ramsey
      cooks.
      But
      then
      again
      I
      do
      have
      enough
      skills
      to
      survive
      in
      the
      wild
      and
      gather
      food.
      Plus
      my
      ancestors
      had
      been
      hunting
      in
      jungles
      of
      Lao
      for
      centuries.

      If

      kill

      master,

      and
      padawon.
      Turn

      But
      as
      a
      pokemon
      trainer.
      I'll
      create
      team
      rocket
      and
      take
      over
      the

      Have

      who
      abused
      their
      pokemon
      be
      killed,
      that

      the

      Have

      And
      bring
      don't
      the
      price
      of
      everything.
      Can
      you
      believe
      it
      cost
      over
      100
      poke-dallors
      just

      If
      I
      were
      to
      receive
      $1B.
      I
      don't
      know
      how
      to
      spend
      it.
      I
      can
      imagine
      me
      spending
      like
      2
      or
      3
      mil
      on
      cars
      and
      property
      to
      live
      in,
      store
      the
      cars
      and
      buy
      food.
      But
      that's
      it.
      Maybe
      invest
      a
      couple
      hundred
      millions
      in
      stocks.
      And
      donate
      the
      rest
      to
      either
      charities
      or
      give
      high
      school
      students
      a
      chance
      to
      go
      to
      college
      for
      free.
      Maybe
      help
      people
      who
      had
      a
      criminal
      record,
      people
      who
      fell
      into
      addictions,
      or
      the
      homeless
      get
      back
      on
      their
      feet
      as
      long
      as
      they
      want
      it.
      Also
      don't
      think
      I
      would
      really
      need
      the
      second
      option
      as
      I
      think
      it's
      more
      enjoyable
      when
      your
      partner
      is
      also
      having
      fun.

      Feel
      like
      option
      2
      would
      be
      amazing
      but
      it'll
      probably
      get
      old
      after
      a
      few
      years
      of
      doing
      it.
      As
      you
      don't
      really
      have
      to
      try
      to
      get
      laid.
      With
      option
      1
      sound
      like
      it
      would
      be
      amazing
      sex
      because
      of
      all
      the
      sexual
      build
      up.
      But
      it's
      only
      once
      a
      year.
      Got
      to
      go
      with
      option
      1.

      As
      a
      15
      years
      old,
      I
      just
      started
      working
      this
      summer,
      and
      was
      wondering
      if
      I
      should
      try
      to
      build
      a
      PC
      for
      around
      500
      USD
      including
      monitors,
      mouse
      and
      keyboard.
      Or
      should
      I
      wait
      a
      few
      more
      years
      and
      set
      a
      budget
      around
      1000
      USD.
      Edit.
      For
      more
      information.
      I
      make
      about
      9.50
      an
      hour.
      I
      only
      work
      about
      eight
      hours
      a
      week,
      four
      hours
      a
      day,
      two
      days
      out
      of
      the
      week.
      I'll
      be
      trying
      to
      get
      a
      new
      part
      time
      job
      when
      fall
      comes.

      Funny
      story.
      So
      I'm
      in
      highschool
      and
      at
      my
      school
      there's
      a
      bunch
      of
      students
      who
      go
      around
      selling
      candy
      as
      fundraiser
      for
      school
      trips.
      A
      friend
      if
      mine
      is
      also
      selling
      candy.
      In
      his
      first
      week
      of
      selling,
      he
      nearly
      lost
      all
      of
      the
      cash
      he
      made.
      As
      a
      student
      was
      using
      the
      same
      bill
      as
      this
      post,
      to
      buy
      some
      candy
      and
      asking
      for
      change.
      He
      showed
      me
      the
      bill
      saying
      that
      he
      just
      got
      an
      Asian
      bill.
      After
      seeing
      the
      bill,
      I
      told
      him
      it's
      not
      a
      legit
      $20
      nor
      from
      any
      Asian
      currency.
      He
      then
      tried
      to
      confront
      the
      student
      who
      have
      him
      the
      bill.
      I'm
      pretty
      sure
      he
      never
      got
      the
      money
      back.

      *Whoa
      this
      is
      my
      first
      post
      here
      after
      lurking
      on
      this
      sub
      for
      nearly
      a
      year
      now.
      Now
      I'm
      actually
      fifth
      teen
      so
      I
      don't
      know
      much
      about
      writing
      well.
      And
      there's
      so
      many
      writers
      here
      that
      are
      so
      much
      more
      better
      than
      me
      so
      the
      pressure
      is
      even
      more
      stressful*
      Don't
      know
      why
      I'm
      writing
      this
      out
      but
      no
      one
      would
      believe
      me,
      not
      my
      family,
      not
      even
      my
      friends.
      All
      I
      know
      is
      that
      I
      was
      browsing
      Reddit
      while
      in
      the
      bathroom,
      blinking
      because
      my
      eyes
      are
      too
      dry
      from
      binge
      gaming.
      Next
      thing
      I
      know,
      I
      see
      is
      a
      young
      woman
      carrying
      her
      boxes
      to
      her
      car,
      and
      a
      middle
      aged
      woman
      hugging
      and
      sobbing
      on
      my
      shoulder.
      Scanning
      the
      surrounding
      houses
      and
      trying
      to
      push
      the
      woman
      off
      me.
      Realizing
      this
      isn't
      in
      the
      twin
      cities,
      I
      tried
      to
      to
      make
      my
      way
      into
      the
      house
      I
      was
      standing
      in
      front
      of.
      In
      the
      living
      room
      I
      see
      pictures
      of
      an
      Asian
      guy
      with
      a
      family
      of
      four.
      The
      woman
      tried
      to
      hug
      me,
      thinking
      that
      I
      needed
      some
      time
      to
      be
      alone
      and
      vent
      out
      my
      emotions.
      Still
      confused
      with
      what's
      going
      on,
      I
      tried
      to
      ask
      her,
      who
      is
      she.
      Confused
      too,
      she
      said,
      "Honey,
      it's
      me.
      Your
      wife".
      "What?
      How?
      I'm
      only
      fifth
      teen".
      Chucking
      lightly,
      "Honey
      your
      jokes
      aren't
      funny.
      You're
      turning
      fifty
      one
      later
      this
      year."
      Trying
      to
      look
      for
      a
      phone
      like
      device
      that
      look
      like
      it
      belongs
      to
      me,
      trying
      to
      see
      if
      the
      date
      is
      correct.
      My
      wife
      handed
      me
      my
      phone.
      Checking
      the
      date,
      it
      is
      July,
      2052.
      Trying
      to
      get
      into
      my
      Facebook
      and
      Instagram,
      realizing
      that
      I
      still
      use
      the
      same
      password.
      Scrolling
      through
      my
      Facebook
      time
      line
      I
      see
      that
      I
      started
      posting
      more
      during
      my
      junior
      year
      of
      high
      school.
      I
      got
      with
      my
      crush
      while
      in
      highschool,
      we
      broke
      up
      a
      few
      years
      later.
      I
      joined
      the
      military,
      after
      two
      years
      I
      came
      back.
      Got
      together
      with
      a
      woman,
      we
      broke
      up
      because
      she
      couldn't
      take
      a
      long
      distance
      relationship.
      Once
      out
      of
      the
      military
      I
      started
      a
      company,
      met
      a
      woman,
      got
      married
      in
      my
      thirties,
      had
      two
      kids.
      Retired
      with
      a
      four
      successful
      companies.
      I
      had
      a
      emotional
      break
      down
      as
      I
      had
      just
      lost
      thirty
      six
      years
      of
      my
      life.
      I
      tried
      contacting
      my
      family
      to
      get
      some
      comfort
      and
      told
      them
      what
      had
      happened.
      None
      of
      my
      friends
      from
      highschool
      believed
      what
      I
      told
      them.
      So
      now
      I'm
      writing
      this
      out.

      Well

      I
      tried
      to
      make
      keto
      friendly
      fired
      chicken
      but
      didn't
      realize
      I
      was
      making
      chicken
      nuggets
      until
      I
      was
      coating
      the
      chicken
      in
      my
      flour
      mix.
      For
      those
      of
      you
      who
      are
      interested
      in
      the
      "recipe",
      I
      didn't
      use
      any
      measuring
      cups
      and
      just
      eye
      balled
      everything
      Flour
      mix:
      half
      a
      cup
      to
      one
      cup
      of
      coconut
      flour
      1
      sprinkle
      of
      crushed
      red
      chili
      peppers
      1
      -
      2
      table
      spoon
      of
      garlic
      salt
      1
      hand
      full
      of
      crushed
      chicarrons
      salt
      and
      pepper
      (optional)
      Egg
      mix:
      3
      eggs
      Directions:
      1)If
      you
      wanted
      to
      make
      fried
      chickens
      instead
      of
      chicken
      nuggets,
      try
      getting
      the
      dark
      meats
      and
      don't
      cut
      the
      meat
      unless
      you
      want
      some
      chicken
      nuggets.
      2)Take
      the
      chicarrons
      and
      crush
      it
      either
      into
      a
      fine
      powder
      or
      into
      tiny
      pieces.
      Take
      a
      bowl
      and
      add
      your
      flour
      mix
      together.
      3)Get
      another
      bowl
      and
      crack
      some
      whole
      eggs.
      Beat
      the
      eggs
      until
      the
      yolks
      and
      whites
      are
      mixed
      thoroughly.
      4)
      Take
      the
      chicken
      and
      dip
      it
      into
      the
      eggs.
      Do
      the
      same
      on
      both
      sides.
      5)Place
      the
      chicken
      into
      the
      flour
      mixture
      and
      coat
      both
      sides
      of
      the
      chicken.
      If
      you
      want
      the
      chicken
      to
      be
      a
      little
      bit
      more
      crispy,
      repeat
      step
      4
      and
      5.
      6)
      get
      your
      oil
      ready.
      7)
      cook
      3-4
      minutes
      on
      each
      side
      of
      the
      chicken
      or
      until
      golden
      brown.
      At
      this
      point
      your
      chicken
      is
      still
      a
      little
      raw
      in
      the
      middle.
      Let
      is
      rest
      for
      about
      5-10
      minutes
      this
      should
      let
      the
      heat
      cook
      the
      chicken
      thoroughly
      and
      allow
      the
      chicken
      to
      absorb
      of
      its
      some
      juices
      back.
      Remember
      this
      was
      all
      eye
      balled
      so
      adjust
      whatever
      you
      want
      to
      try
      and
      make
      this
      more
      keto
      friendly.
      I
      also
      had
      a
      lot
      because
      I
      planned
      on
      giving
      some
      to
      my
      family
      who
      are
      not
      on
      keto.

      Heard
      that
      a
      tip
      is
      to
      find
      a
      passion
      and
      improve
      on
      that
      passion.
      For
      me
      being
      15
      and
      not
      having
      a
      lot
      options,
      I've
      been
      trying
      to
      learn
      how
      to
      do
      card
      tricks,
      pen
      spinning
      and
      butterfly
      knife
      tricks
      for
      a
      few
      years
      with
      no
      improvement.
      Now
      I'm
      trying
      to
      just
      focus
      on
      butterfly
      knife
      tricks.
      Might
      just
      remain
      as
      a
      hobby
      but
      at
      least
      I'll
      learn
      a
      new
      skill
      and
      finally
      know
      more
      than
      three
      tricks.

      or
      I
      might
      pass
      my
      fortune
      to
      my

      My
      last
      Reddit
      post
      was
      about
      me
      "venting"
      about
      my
      soon
      to
      be
      girlfriend,
      how
      it
      has
      been
      a
      talking
      to
      her
      and
      hoping
      we
      could
      be
      together.
      My
      last
      picture
      is
      of
      my
      girlfriend
      who
      i
      was
      talking
      about
      in

      post.
      I'm
      going
      with
      the
      picture
      cause
      your
      boy

      My
      girlfriend
      and
      I
      plan
      to
      do
      keto
      together.
      It
      will
      be
      my
      second
      time
      doing
      keto
      after
      a
      summer
      of
      letting
      myself
      go
      for
      Asian
      food
      and
      her
      first
      time
      doing
      keto.
      She's
      210
      right
      now
      and
      want
      to
      be
      at
      ~160.
      If
      you
      look
      that
      good
      at
      160
      then
      I
      can't
      wait
      for
      her
      too.

      I'm
      already
      in
      a
      relationship
      with
      someone,
      she's
      not
      the
      cutest
      in
      the
      world
      but
      she
      is
      more

      perfect
      for

      I'm
      16
      now,
      I've
      found
      nofap
      when
      14
      and
      had
      been
      addicted
      to
      porn
      since
      elementary.
      I
      had
      never
      had
      this
      long
      of
      a
      streak
      since
      I
      started
      nofap.
      It
      was
      all
      due
      to
      me
      pushing
      myself
      so
      get
      with
      my
      now
      girlfriend.
      She
      knows
      about
      me
      and
      supports
      me
      I
      can
      now
      say
      that
      I
      will
      be
      on
      a
      more
      stable
      course.

      Dude
      I
      know
      how
      it
      feels
      man.
      I
      was
      sick
      and
      tired
      of
      not
      being
      good
      enough
      for
      my
      ex
      that
      my
      actions
      eventually
      caused
      her
      to
      break
      up
      with
      me.
      What
      you
      should
      do
      is
      have
      some
      time
      to
      yourself.
      Tell
      your
      SO
      what
      you're
      feeling
      and
      ask
      them
      for
      help
      if
      or
      ask
      for
      a
      break.
      I'm
      not
      saying
      to
      break
      up
      with
      your
      SO
      but
      take
      time
      to
      be
      away
      from
      your
      SO
      and
      reflect
      on
      the
      issues.
      If
      you
      and
      your
      SO
      are
      willing
      to
      help
      you
      out
      get
      through
      this
      then
      they're
      worth
      it.
      But
      if
      you
      still
      feel
      like
      a
      bad
      boyfriend
      then
      I
      don't
      know
      man,
      maybe
      it
      is
      wasn't
      long
      enough
      cause
      what
      you're
      feeling
      right
      now
      will
      change
      with
      time.
      This
      my
      advice
      from
      a
      bad
      boyfriend
      to
      another,
      don't
      fuck
      up
      a
      good
      thing
      you
      have
      over
      something
      small
      that's
      only
      in
      your
      head.
      It's
      not
      easy
      being
      in
      a
      relationship
      with
      so
      many
      skeletons
      in
      our
      closet.

      I've
      been
      friends
      with
      this
      one
      girl
      on
      facebook
      for
      a
      few
      years
      now
      and
      every
      time
      I
      tried
      to
      get
      close
      I
      feel
      like
      a
      creep.
      When
      we
      first
      became
      friends
      I
      was
      seeing
      what
      she
      share
      on
      my
      feed
      way
      too
      much
      and
      felt

      I
      was
      spamming
      her
      notifications.
      We
      started
      talking
      few
      weeks
      ago
      and
      got
      somewhere
      but
      I
      still
      felt
      like
      it
      was
      nowhere
      at
      the
      same.
      It
      was
      probably
      just
      my
      head
      fucking
      with
      me
      while
      I
      was
      emotionally
      unstable
      from
      my
      last
      break
      up.
      We
      stopped
      talking
      about
      a
      week
      ago
      and
      I
      stop
      caring
      or
      at
      least
      tried
      to.
      She
      had
      to
      send
      a
      "Hello"
      text
      to
      me
      a
      couple
      hours
      ago
      and
      we
      had
      a
      short
      conversation
      if
      you
      can
      even
      call
      it
      that.
      It
      was
      just
      us
      exchanging
      hellos
      and
      greetings
      and
      me
      telling
      a
      story
      about
      what
      happened
      the
      last
      time
      we
      spoke.
      Then
      we
      just
      stop.
      She
      stop
      texting
      back
      and
      I
      didn't
      feel
      like
      it
      was
      worth
      my
      efforts
      to
      move
      this
      thing
      if
      I
      can't
      have
      a
      regular
      conversation
      without
      someone
      being
      gone
      for
      10
      minutes
      and
      not
      responding
      back
      because
      that
      was
      how
      she
      would
      be
      when
      we
      started
      talking.
      I
      still
      react
      to
      what
      she
      share
      on
      Facebook
      because
      I
      find
      them
      funny.
      But
      she
      shared
      a
      post
      that
      contradict
      what
      she
      had
      said
      earlier
      today
      and
      I
      commented
      about
      it.
      She
      replied
      back
      saying
      it
      was
      nice
      of
      my
      to
      pay
      attention
      to
      her
      time
      line.
      I
      know
      I
      shouldn't
      care
      because
      I
      don't
      see
      how
      she
      and
      I
      could
      ever
      build
      a
      relationship
      with
      how
      our
      text
      habits
      are.
      But
      that
      fucking
      reply
      made
      my
      skin
      crawled.
      She
      made
      it
      sound
      like
      I
      was
      a
      creep
      and
      was
      obsessed
      with
      her.
      As
      if
      I
      was
      going
      up
      and
      down
      her
      time
      line
      just
      waiting
      for
      her
      to
      share
      a
      post
      from
      somewhere
      and
      be
      the
      first
      to
      respond.
      I
      tried
      to
      live
      as
      a
      decent
      Human
      being.
      I
      do
      what
      I
      do
      and
      I
      don't
      care
      for
      others
      that
      don't
      effect
      me.
      But
      whenever
      I
      let
      my
      emotions
      go
      and
      become
      vulnerable
      to
      someone
      I
      become
      irrational
      and
      stop
      thinking.
      And
      sometime
      borderline
      obsessive.
      But
      I
      would
      never
      become
      a
      creep,
      a
      stalker,
      a
      fucking
      coward.
      I
      don't
      even
      know
      man
      I'm
      sick
      of
      this
      shit.
      I'm
      back
      to
      stressing
      over
      some
      shit
      that
      won't
      even
      be
      relevant
      by
      next
      week
      and
      over
      someone
      whom
      I
      barely
      know.

      Bro
      if
      you
      ever
      save
      up
      enough
      for
      ps+
      and
      want
      a
      friend
      Pm
      me,
      I'm
      on
      sometimes
      and
      mostly
      play
      single
      player
      but
      I
      do
      play
      overwatch
      now
      and
      then.
      I
      would
      recommend
      you
      getting
      the
      Witcher
      3.
      It
      has
      a
      good
      story
      and
      great
      game
      play,
      and
      the
      world
      and
      its
      lore
      is
      worth
      exploring
      and
      experiencing.
      But
      be
      careful
      cause
      you
      can
      easily
      lose
      hours.
      Also
      get
      stardew
      valley,
      it's
      like
      harvest
      Moon
      but
      with
      a
      lot
      more
      features
      and
      ways
      to
      play.
      You
      can
      also
      lose
      hours
      easily.

      Had
      this
      upper
      schoolmate
      that
      would
      keep
      texting
      me
      trying
      to
      keep
      a
      conversation
      going.
      He
      started
      to
      become
      super
      annoying
      and
      pushy
      that
      I
      had
      to
      just
      not
      open
      his
      texts
      ever.
      Eventually
      he
      stopped
      texting
      me
      and
      just
      stop
      being
      active
      on
      Facebook
      in
      general.
      He's
      a
      special
      ed
      kid
      who
      had
      just
      graduated.
      Fuck.
      I
      don't
      know
      what
      happened
      to
      him
      but
      I
      just
      hope
      he
      had
      found
      some
      friends
      who
      are
      actually
      friends
      with
      him
      and
      not
      out
      of
      sympathy.

      I
      know
      this
      isn't
      the
      sub
      to
      vent
      about
      things
      but
      when
      people
      bring
      up
      people
      faking
      depression
      I
      just
      can't
      help
      but
      feel
      like
      I'm
      one
      of
      them.
      I've
      never
      been
      diagnosed
      and
      when
      I
      talk
      to
      my
      counselor
      or
      school
      therapist
      I
      don't
      really
      tell
      them
      the
      whole
      truth
      cause
      it
      just
      feels
      like
      I'm
      wasting
      their
      time.
      I
      don't
      talk
      about
      it
      much
      to
      my
      friends
      and
      family
      much
      either
      because
      I
      used
      to
      post
      and
      vent
      my
      thoughts
      on
      my
      social
      media
      and
      would
      feel
      like
      I'm
      seeking
      attention
      from
      them.
      Now
      I
      just
      try
      to
      keep
      them
      to
      myself
      and
      maybe
      vent
      here
      and
      there
      anonymously.
      During
      the
      day
      time
      I
      behave
      and
      act
      relatively
      normal
      then
      go
      into
      my
      feelings
      late
      at
      night.
      I
      know
      and
      have
      been
      told
      by
      my
      ex
      that
      these
      are
      signs
      of
      depressions
      but
      deep
      down
      I
      just
      can't
      shake
      the
      feeling
      I'm
      just
      faking
      my
      depression.

      I
      feel

      I've
      peaked

      there
      too
      but
      not
      in
      the
      academic
      level.
      I
      was
      in
      the
      boy
      scouts
      and
      it
      was
      some
      of
      the
      most
      fun
      and
      best
      years
      of
      my
      life.
      I
      had
      friends
      who
      I
      was
      close
      with,
      I
      was
      confident
      and
      not
      afraid
      of
      taking
      a
      challenge.

      My
      hand
      wrapping
      behind
      your
      head
      as
      our
      tongues
      dance
      and
      wrestle
      with
      each
      other.
      Our
      spit
      mixing
      into
      an
      aphrodisiac
      cocktail
      rushing
      into
      our
      throat
      and
      spreading
      across
      our
      bodies.
      Our
      fingers
      begin
      to
      explore
      and
      touch
      each
      other
      sending
      waves
      of
      pleasures
      throughout
      our
      skin.
      My
      hands
      sliding
      up
      your
      braless
      chest
      and
      grip
      on
      to
      your
      neck
      as
      I
      firmly
      squeeze
      and
      dominate
      your
      breathing.
      I
      pull
      away
      from
      our
      kiss
      leaving
      a
      trail
      of
      spit
      connecting
      our
      kiss.
      As
      the
      string
      of
      our
      cocktail
      break
      and
      drips
      down
      to
      your
      chin
      I
      reach
      with
      my
      free
      hand
      and
      pull
      your
      dress
      down
      to
      expose
      your
      beautiful
      bare
      chest.
      I
      lean
      down
      and
      gently
      caress
      them
      as
      my
      hand
      still
      grip
      on
      to
      your
      neck.
      I
      pinch
      your
      hard
      sensitive
      nipple
      as
      I
      lean
      in
      to
      give
      it
      a
      soft
      gentle
      kiss
      and
      run
      my
      tongue
      along
      the
      very
      tip
      of
      the
      sensitive
      work
      of
      art.
      I
      open
      my
      mouth
      wider
      as
      I
      take
      in
      your
      nipple
      and
      begin
      to
      gently
      and
      slowly
      suck
      on
      it.
      My
      hand
      loosen
      up
      around
      your
      neck
      as
      you
      let
      out
      a
      soft
      delicate
      moan.
      With
      both
      free
      hands
      I
      continue
      to
      strip
      you
      down
      and
      pull
      off
      your
      dress
      to
      the
      floor.
      I
      look
      at
      the
      silhouette
      of
      your
      chin
      as
      you
      gasp
      and
      moan
      from
      my
      tongue
      flickering
      and
      moving
      around
      your
      nipple.
      I
      smile
      as
      suck
      in
      more
      pressure
      before
      letting
      my
      mouth
      open
      to
      release
      the
      pressure
      and
      cause
      a
      POP
      noise.
      I
      move
      to
      between
      your
      cleavage
      and
      gently
      kiss
      my
      way
      down
      to
      your
      mounds
      making
      sure
      to
      kiss
      your
      jewelweed
      and
      pierced
      belly
      button.
      My
      tongue
      finally
      touches
      your
      lonely
      and
      sensitive
      clit
      I
      hear
      you
      let
      out
      another
      of
      your
      many
      moans
      as
      you
      close
      you
      legs
      around
      my
      head
      and
      pull
      on
      my
      hair
      to
      make
      me
      lick
      through
      your
      laced
      panties.
      I
      close
      my
      lips
      and
      press
      up
      against
      your
      fabric
      as
      I
      move
      and
      rock
      my
      head
      sending
      waves
      of
      pleasure
      across
      your
      body.
      After
      feeling
      your
      wetness
      leak
      through
      and
      touching
      my
      chin
      I
      slowly
      pull
      your
      legs
      apart
      as
      I
      reach
      over
      and
      pull
      your
      panties
      off
      your
      mound.
      Exposing
      a
      drenched
      work
      of
      art
      that
      I've
      created
      but
      this
      piece
      is
      only
      just
      about
      to
      begin.
      I
      pull
      you
      pantie
      off
      your
      legs
      as
      I
      bunch
      it
      up
      and
      push
      it
      into
      your
      mouth
      causing
      your
      continuous
      soft
      moans
      to
      be
      muffled.
      I
      lift
      you
      legs
      over
      my
      shoulders
      as
      mount
      my
      lips
      on
      top
      of
      your
      slit.
      My
      tongue
      slowly
      sticking
      out
      and
      tracing
      around
      your
      sensitive
      clit.
      You
      moan
      through
      your
      panties
      tasting
      yourself
      even
      more
      as
      my
      tongue
      finally
      gives
      you
      the
      pleasure
      you've
      been
      wanting
      for
      so
      long.
      With
      slow
      and
      gentle
      strokes
      I
      slowly
      bring
      you
      to
      your
      first
      orgasm.
      Causing
      your
      body
      to
      tense
      up
      and
      shake
      as
      you
      release
      as
      uncontrollable
      about
      of
      cum
      down
      my
      chin.
      I
      grip
      on
      to
      your
      legs
      as
      you
      gasp
      for
      air
      after
      coming
      down
      from
      your
      orgasm
      continue
      to
      pet
      and
      stroke
      your
      clit
      at
      the
      same
      speed
      as
      if
      nothing
      has
      happened.
      I
      begin
      to
      suck
      and
      kiss
      your
      clit
      bringing
      you
      to
      orgasm
      over
      and
      over
      again
      until
      you've
      wet
      my
      bed
      with
      your
      cum
      and
      cover
      my
      entire
      neck.
      Even
      causing
      my
      shirt
      to
      collect
      your
      sweet
      sweet
      nectar.
      After
      you've
      been
      warned
      out
      and
      barely
      holding
      on
      to
      my
      bed
      sheets
      I
      pull
      away
      from
      your
      engorged
      clit
      and
      quickly
      strip
      down.
      I
      replace
      your
      panties
      with
      my
      shirt
      as
      you
      get
      to
      taste
      how
      sweet
      and
      delicious
      you
      are.
      I
      stroke
      my
      rock
      hard
      uncut
      cock
      as
      precum
      drips
      down
      and
      hit
      my
      carpet.
      I
      look
      down
      at
      your
      defeated
      body
      spread
      your
      legs
      apart
      as
      aline
      my
      rock
      hard
      cock
      with
      your
      ocean
      slit.
      I
      pull
      back
      and
      gently
      push
      inside
      of
      your
      tight
      drenched
      pussy
      as
      I
      get
      out
      a
      soft
      groan.
      My
      knees
      almost
      giving
      out
      from
      the
      wave
      of
      pleasure.
      I
      lean
      down
      and
      press
      my
      body
      against
      yours
      as
      I
      toss
      my
      shit
      aside
      and
      kiss
      your
      lips
      letting
      you
      taste
      yourself
      even
      more.
      I
      slowly
      back
      out
      before
      thrusting
      back
      in
      to
      push
      even
      more
      of
      my
      cock
      inside
      of
      you.
      I
      don't
      last
      long
      as
      after
      a
      few
      strokes
      I
      reach
      for
      you
      hand
      and
      begin
      pouring
      my
      seed
      deep
      inside
      of
      your
      warm
      tight
      womb.
      I
      give
      you
      one
      last
      kiss
      before
      we
      both
      pass
      out
      with
      my
      warm
      seed
      inside
      of
      you
      as
      my
      cock
      slips
      out.

      the
      patch
      of

      soon.
      Then
      today
      I
      saw
      that
      it
      was
      gone

      looked

      over
      the

      Oh
      boy
      do
      I
      have
      a
      create
      story
      for
      you
      to
      read.
      It's
      about
      this
      man
      who's
      been
      shot
      in
      the
      head
      and
      got
      a
      brain
      transplant
      from
      his
      killer.
      It's
      a
      great
      psychological
      manga
      but
      I
      don't
      remember
      what
      it's
      called

      I
      already
      have
      no
      possiblity
      of
      ever
      getting
      a
      gf
      so
      I'll
      take
      number
      1
      although
      I
      am
      talking
      to
      someone
      right
      now,
      it
      might
      just
      end
      up
      with
      me
      disappointed
      after
      I
      got
      too
      excited
      and
      expect
      too
      much
      to
      happen
