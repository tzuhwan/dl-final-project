      So
      I'm
      walking
      down
      the
      street
      and
      this
      girl
      goes
      on
      to
      hail
      an
      auto
      rickshaw
      (form
      of
      transport
      in
      India).
      Now
      normally
      an
      outstretched
      arm
      with
      the
      palm
      facing
      downward
      is
      the
      cue
      for
      the
      auto
      driver
      but
      for
      some
      reason
      this
      girl
      did
      it
      with
      her
      palm
      facing
      towards
      me.
      I
      assumed
      she
      knew
      me
      and
      I
      went
      in
      for
      the
      high
      five.
      She
      was
      surprised
      and
      I
      skeddadled
      before
      everyone
      realised
      what
      a
      fool
      I
      was.

      I
      was
      using
      one
      of
      those
      cheap
      headphones
      that
      kinda
      let
      some
      of
      the
      audio
      leak
      out
      and
      apparently
      in
      a
      closed
      elevator
      it
      turns
      out
      to
      be
      even
      louder.
      I
      was
      listening
      to
      "I
      Just
      Had
      Sex"
      by
      Akon
      and
      my
      professor
      was
      with
      me
      in
      the
      elevator.
      Maybe
      that's
      why
      I
      failed
      her
      subject.

      My
      biology
      teacher
      called
      me
      by
      a
      different
      name
      for
      around
      4
      weeks.
      She
      wasn't
      mixing
      up
      names
      because
      there
      was
      nobody
      by
      that
      name
      in
      the
      class.
      I
      did
      not
      correct
      her
      because
      she
      really
      liked
      me
      as
      a
      student
      and
      I
      wanted
      to
      be
      in
      her
      good
      books.
      My
      classmates
      didn't
      either
      and
      in
      retrospect
      that
      seems
      totally
      bizzare.
      While
      evaluating
      my
      answer
      paper
      to
      one
      of
      the
      test
      she
      saw
      the
      name
      on
      it
      and
      went
      "Oh!".
      She
      cringed
      very
      hard
      and
      was
      pretty
      embarrassed
      about
      it.

      I
      was
      caught
      in
      the
      classic
      "behind
      the
      shoulder"
      method.
      My
      dad
      stood
      behind
      my
      back
      for
      over
      20
      minutes
      while
      i
      unloaded
      my
      filthy
      mind
      onto
      the
      internet.
      He
      watched
      me
      be
      creative
      in
      real
      time
      with
      the
      searches
      before
      he
      tapped
      me
      and
      asked
      me
      to
      move
      for
      him
      to
      check
      the
      history.
      They
      made
      a
      huge
      deal
      out
      of
      it.
      Thank
      god
      i
      hadn't
      discovered
      fapping
      back
      then.

      So
      this
      happened
      a
      few
      days
      ago.
      We
      had
      our
      first
      class
      on
      Enterprenuerial
      skills
      and
      start-up
      fundamentals
      in
      college.
      The
      professor
      though
      it
      was
      a
      good
      idea
      if
      we
      learnt
      through
      role-play
      scenarios.
      Fair
      enough.
      So
      she
      was
      explaining
      us
      idea
      validation
      tools
      and
      blah
      blah
      blah
      and
      then
      she
      moves
      on
      to
      the
      pitching
      to
      an
      investor
      part.
      She
      says
      that
      she
      would
      do
      a
      pitch
      and
      we
      were
      supposed
      to
      be
      the
      angel
      investors
      so
      we
      could
      see
      how
      a
      pitch
      is
      done.
      She
      does
      her
      presentation
      for
      5-7
      minutes
      and
      at
      the
      end
      of
      it
      asks
      "Those
      who
      think
      this
      product(read:
      the
      one
      she
      was
      pitching)
      has
      a
      viable
      market
      out
      there,
      raise
      your
      hands".
      Not
      one
      kid
      put
      their
      hand
      up.
      She
      expectantly
      looked
      around
      the
      class
      for
      a
      whole
      minute,
      hoping
      atleast
      someone
      would
      but
      nobody
      did.
      At
      this
      point
      she
      goes
      ballistic.
      She
      starts
      rambling
      about
      how
      we
      are
      a
      "tough
      crowd"
      and
      how
      "real
      investors
      have
      an
      open
      mind".
      She
      stormed
      out
      of
      the
      class
      with
      an
      hour
      to
      spare.
      This
      wasn't
      especially
      cringy
      until
      what
      we
      found
      out
      today.
      The
      presentation
      she
      did
      was
      her
      and
      an
      another
      professor's
      real
      startup
      that
      they
      are
      going
      to
      pitch
      to
      actual
      investors
      in
      the
      coming
      months.

      Our
      professors
      say
      every
      market
      has
      at
      most
      three
      companies
      that
      do
      better
      than
      the
      rest.
      The
      first,
      the
      best
      and
      the
      cheapest.
      Sometimes
      a
      single
      company
      has
      more
      than
      one
      of
      those
      attributes.
      So
      it's
      not
      necessary
      for
      your
      idea
      to
      be
      unique
      if
      you
      can
      be
      better
      or
      cheaper.

      Unpopular
      opinion
      but
      seems
      to
      me
      like
      this
      dude
      was
      recently
      rejected
      by
      someone
      he
      really
      fancied
      and
      they
      went
      with
      someone
      Daniel
      thinks
      is
      beneath
      them.
      That
      made
      Daniel
      insecure
      about
      himself.
      OP
      just
      got
      caught
      in
      the
      cross
      hairs.
      If
      we
      just
      educated
      the
      nice
      guys
      instead
      of
      berating
      them
      all
      over
      the
      internet
      maybe
      we
      could
      end
      the
      epidemic.
      Also
      before
      you
      guys
      ask,
      No
      I
      am
      not
      Daniel
      or
      any
      one
      his
      alts.
      Also,
      hello
      people
      that
      sort
      by
      controversial.
      Now
      somebody
      teach
      me
      how
      to
      set
      flairs

      the
      only
      thing
      people
      got
      from
      it
      was
      when
      he
      dissed
      hindi.
      Nobody
      could
      make
      the
      connection
      as
      to
      how
      T-Series
      was
      responsible
      for
      open
      defecation.
      All
      the
      other
      humor
      got
      left
      aside
      and
      he
      was
      cemented
      as
      anti-Indian.
      The
      charity
      stream
      was
      poorly
      received
      because
      it
      was
      seen
      as
      a
      publicity
      stunt.
      Remember
      when
      Logan
      Paul
      did
      some
      sort
      of
      charity
      after
      Suicide
      Forest
      and
      Pewds
      dissed
      him.
      Indians
      are
      quite
      happy
      to
      help
      him
      get
      ahead
      and
      keep
      an
      individual
      creator
      on
      top
      but
      they
      won't
      do
      it
      at
      the
      cost
      of
      their
      nationalistic
      sentiments.
      I'm
      happy
      to
      extend
      an
      olive
      branch
      on
      any
      of
      these
      things
      I've
      said
      and
      might
      also
      be
      wrong
      for
      a
      few
      but
      the
      fanbase
      also
      got
      to
      cool
      their
      ballasts
      and
      think
      with
      a
      clear
      mind
      before
      firing
      off.

      I
      received
      an
      internship
      opening
      in
      the
      mail.
      The
      job
      required
      familiarity
      with
      javascript
      frameworks
      and
      NoSQL.
      I
      have
      used
      javascript
      before
      but
      am
      not
      familiar
      with
      Node
      or
      Angular.
      I
      replied
      to
      the
      e-mail
      saying
      that
      I
      do
      not
      meet
      the
      criteria
      but
      I
      am
      looking
      for
      a
      domain
      change
      and
      would
      learn
      if
      given
      the
      opportunity.
      That
      is
      what
      i
      wanted
      to
      say.
      Instead,
      I
      wrote
      this:
      "I
      am
      interested
      in
      the
      opportunity
      however
      I
      lack
      the
      necessary
      experience
      with
      the
      javascript
      frameworks
      and
      NoSQL.
      I
      am
      however
      determined
      to
      learn
      them
      and
      adapt
      suitably
      if
      provided
      the
      opportunity."
      They
      replied
      with
      "No
      issues...
      no
      need
      of
      proficiency..Trainers
      will
      be
      training
      you
      as
      per
      the
      work
      requirement."
      What
      they
      got
      out
      of
      it
      was
      that
      I
      wasn't
      proficient
      but
      was
      atleast
      familiar
      with
      the
      frameworks.
      I
      am
      not.
      Now
      I
      have
      an
      interview
      lined
      up
      for
      a
      job
      I
      have
      zero
      skills
      for.
      TL;DR:
      Will
      be
      appearing
      for
      a
      job
      interview
      without
      having
      any
      of
      the
      necessary
      skills.

      I
      said

      I
      will
      be
      graduating
      soon
      and
      am
      about
      to
      enter
      the
      workforce
      shortly.
      I
      would
      really
      like
      to
      be
      smart
      with
      money.
      Upto
      this
      point
      in
      my
      life
      I
      did
      not
      really
      care
      much
      about
      financial
      literacy
      and
      I
      would
      like
      to
      change
      that
      about
      myself.
      I
      recently
      finished
      Rich
      Dad
      Poor
      Dad
      and
      thoroughly
      enjoyed
      it.
      I
      am
      checking
      out
      Robert
      Kiyosaki's
      other
      books
      but
      would
      also
      like
      to
      get
      to
      know
      how
      you
      guys
      handle
      your
      finances
      and
      get
      some
      good
      reading
      recommendations.
      I
      just
      don't
      want
      to
      be
      a
      slave
      to
      the
      bankers
      and
      the
      government
      for
      the
      next
      40
      years
      of
      my
      life.

      This
      happened
      a
      couple
      hours
      ago.
      I
      was
      having
      dinner
      with
      my
      mother.
      Halfway
      through
      dinner,
      she
      tried
      to
      get
      something
      from
      my
      plate.
      I
      shot
      her
      the
      dirtiest
      look
      ever.
      That
      seemed
      to
      have
      bothered
      her.
      Things
      were
      a
      bit
      awkward
      after
      that
      and
      the
      drive
      home
      was
      a
      silent
      one.
      So,
      AITA
      for
      not
      sharing
      food
      or
      AITA
      for
      reacting
      the
      way
      I
      did?
      Edit:
      We
      were
      having
      pizza.
      She
      tried
      to
      grab
      a
      piece.
      I
      picked
      the
      tab.
      She
      could've
      just
      ordered
      whatever
      she
      wanted
      to
      eat
      and
      I
      wouldn't
      mind.
      Just
      not
      off
      my
      plate.

      Second
      hand
      narration
      here.
      I
      was
      on
      a
      crowded
      metro
      station
      with
      one
      of
      my
      female
      friends
      once
      and
      accidentally
      bumped
      into
      another
      female
      traveller.
      She
      started
      yelling
      and
      creating
      a
      scene.
      My
      friend
      stepped
      in
      and
      said
      something
      along
      the
      lines
      of
      "if
      you
      touch
      him,
      I
      will
      dog
      walk
      you
      to
      the
      police
      station".
      That
      was
      pretty
      badass
      imo.

      I
      once
      managed
      to
      get
      tickets
      to
      a
      motor
      show
      where
      all
      the
      luxury
      brands
      were
      on
      display.
      I
      wore
      a
      shirt
      and
      trousers
      just
      to
      fit
      in.
      This
      dude
      walked
      in
      wearing
      a
      plain
      blue
      t
      shirt
      and
      gray
      shorts
      and
      suddenly
      everyone's
      tending
      to
      him.
      He
      straight
      up
      bought
      a
      812
      superfast
      at
      a
      fucking
      motor
      show.
      In
      his
      defense
      though,
      he
      literally
      radiated
      affluence.
      I
      bet
      he
      gets
      serviced
      every
      place
      he
      goes.

      IMO
      women
      do
      anything
      in
      their
      power
      to
      win
      an
      argument.
      I'm
      assuming
      in
      the
      3-4
      months
      OP
      hasn't
      really
      done
      anything
      bad,
      for
      her
      to
      bring
      up
      in
      a
      completely
      unrelated
      argument.
      That
      is
      why
      she
      brings
      it
      up
      so
      often.
      It's
      the

      she
      has.

      I
      have
      trouble
      opening
      up
      too.
      My
      problem
      stems
      from
      a
      natural
      distrust
      towards
      people.
      What
      I
      would
      like
      is
      someone
      that
      won't
      try
      to
      get
      me
      to
      talk.
      Just
      actions
      that
      show
      that
      they're
      there
      for
      me.
      That'll
      get
      me
      to
      naturally
      open
      up.

      I
      have
      a
      different
      perspective
      on
      this:
      Nobody
      minds
      when
      anybody
      cries
      but
      everybody
      hates
      it
      when
      somebody
      cries
      a
      lot.
      It's
      the
      same
      for
      both
      men
      and
      women.
      If
      a
      man
      or
      a
      woman
      cried
      then
      people
      will
      run
      to
      comfort
      them
      but
      if
      it
      happens
      all
      the
      time,
      everybody
      will
      just
      get
      tired
      of
      their
      shit.

      she

      Damn
      buddy
      I
      feel
      so
      seen
      rn.
      Ever
      only
      had
      1
      girl
      before
      and
      she
      forbade
      me
      from
      telling
      anyone
      about
      us.
      I
      was
      so
      happy
      she
      agreed
      to
      date
      me
      that
      I
      went
      along
      with
      anything
      she
      demanded.
      Cheated
      within
      a
      week
      and
      continued
      to
      do
      so
      and
      I
      didn't
      find
      out
      for
      almost
      a
      year.

      You
      might
      wanna
      consider
      that
      he
      would
      be
      upset
      to
      see
      his
      sister
      barely
      eke
      out
      an
      existence.
      If
      you
      guys
      aren't
      having
      money
      problems
      then
      just
      let
      the
      man
      try
      and
      hold
      his
      dysfunctional
      family
      together.
      If
      only
      the
      act
      of
      being
      taken
      advantage
      of
      is
      the
      problem
      then
      he's
      just
      told
      you
      that
      he
      doesn't
      feel
      that
      way
      and
      knows
      whats
      up.
      So
      let
      it
      be.
      However,
      if
      it's
      going
      to
      likely
      cause
      you
      financial
      troubles
      down
      the
      line
      then
      you're
      completely
      right
      doing
      what
      you
      did.

      Man
      this
      is
      what
      scares
      me
      about
      getting
      married.
      Best
      of
      luck
      to
      you
      though.
      You
      seem
      to
      be
      in
      a
      happy
      place
      now.

      the

      Guys
      I
      have
      a
      legit
      question.
      I've
      never
      watched
      a
      race
      at
      the
      track
      before.
      I
      really
      look
      forward
      to
      going
      later
      this
      year.
      However,
      if
      you
      can
      see
      only
      1
      section
      of
      the
      track
      and
      completely
      miss
      all
      the
      other
      action
      then
      isn't
      it
      better
      to
      watch
      on
      TV?

      This
      happened
      with
      my
      uncle
      but
      at
      home.
      He
      was
      shitting
      when
      the
      whole
      building
      collapsed(structural
      issues).
      Took
      the
      fire
      department
      a
      while
      to
      get
      him
      out
      the
      rubble.
      He
      used
      to
      say
      he
      wishes
      he
      had
      died
      down
      there
      rather
      than
      being
      excavated
      mid-poop.

      Hey
      I'm
      not
      going
      to
      pull
      the
      "there's
      someone
      for
      everyone"
      line
      here
      because
      I
      know
      how
      fake
      that
      feels
      and
      just
      adds
      to
      the
      hopelessness.
      However,
      here's
      JerryRigEverything
      who
      literally
      built
      a
      chariot
      for
      this
      disabled
      girl
      he
      met
      so
      she
      could
      go
      offroad.
      Hope
      this
      makes
      your
      day
      :)

      It's
      crazy
      to
      me
      how
      in
      baseball
      the
      condition
      of
      the
      ball
      has
      no
      effect
      on
      the
      outcome
      of
      the
      match.
      In
      cricket
      the
      effect
      is
      so
      pronounced
      that
      putting
      your
      fingernails
      on
      the
      ball
      is
      illegal
      and
      will
      get
      you
      banned
      for
      life
      and
      disgraced
      publicly.

      I

      if
      they've
      experienced
      the
      same.
      When
      a

      of
      apps
      require
      updating
      and
      you
      hit

      that
      was

      it

      Personally,
      I
      prefer
      you
      tell
      the
      truth
      but
      I've
      read
      experiences
      about
      guys
      not
      being
      able
      to
      handle
      the
      truth.
      So
      assess
      the
      situation
      and
      if
      the
      dude
      seems
      incapable
      of
      handling
      it
      then
      just
      lie
      and
      get
      away
      from
      them
      quickly.

      From
      personal
      experience,
      people
      who
      are
      shy
      and
      modest
      are
      the
      ones
      who
      are
      starved
      the
      most
      for
      a
      conversation.
      There
      is
      a
      REALLY
      high
      chance
      that
      your
      attempt
      at
      a
      conversation
      will
      be
      received
      positively.
      Just
      don't
      a)
      overwhelm
      them
      (start
      slow)
      and
      b)
      put
      them
      in
      a
      spot.
      Don't
      publicly
      compliment
      or
      try
      to
      start
      a
      conversation
      when
      other
      people
      are
      around
      or
      watching.
      Best
      of
      luck.

      Well,
      since
      you
      seem
      to
      be
      an
      expert
      on
      the
      issue
      here's
      some
      numbers:
      -
      At
      the
      United
      States-Mexico
      Border,
      there
      have
      been
      more
      apprehensions
      of
      Non
      Mexicans
      than
      Mexicans
      every
      year
      since
      fiscal
      2016.
      Non-Mexicans
      accounted
      for #160;62%
      of
      apprehensions #160;at
      the
      southwest
      border
      in
      fiscal
      2018,
      marking
      the
      third
      consecutive
      year
      in
      which
      they
      outnumbered
      Mexicans.
      -
      In
      the
      past,
      undocumented
      immigrants
      were
      overwhelmingly
      single
      men
      from
      Mexico
      who
      slipped
      into
      the
      country
      undetected
      to
      find
      work
      and
      send
      money
      home.
      But
      immigration
      from
      Mexico
      has
      plummeted
      in
      recent
      years.
      In
      fact,
      more
      Mexicans
      are
      leaving
      than
      arriving
      in
      the
      United
      States.
      Mexicans
      are
      less
      compelled
      to
      come
      because
      there
      are
      more
      opportunities
      in
      their
      own
      country
      and
      they
      have
      smaller
      families
      to
      support.
      -
      Many
      Central
      Americans
      however,
      live
      in
      fear.
      El
      Salvador,
      Honduras
      and
      Guatemala
      have
      among
      the
      world #8217;s
      highest
      homicide
      rates.
      Arriving
      migrants
      report
      that
      they
      have
      faced
      extortion,
      and
      want
      to
      prevent
      their
      children
      from
      being
      recruited
      by
      street
      gangs.
      More
      than
      90
      percent
      of
      the
      most
      recent
      migrants
      are #160;from
      Gautemala,
      according
      to
      the
      newly
      released
      data.
      The
      majority
      hail
      from
      impoverished
      regions,
      including
      the
      Western
      highlands,
      where
      conflicts
      over
      land
      rights,
      environmental
      changes
      and
      depressed
      prices
      for
      crops
      like
      maize
      and
      coffee
      are
      undermining
      the
      ability
      of
      farmers
      to
      make
      a
      living.
      So
      while
      Mexico
      has
      made
      strides
      forward,
      other
      countries
      are
      still
      lacking.
      So
      lets
      berate
      the
      people
      from
      such
      countries
      that
      fight
      for
      their
      survival,
      amirite?

      who
      don't
      do

      Yes

      I

      heard

      you
      tip
      on
      Uber
      Eats
      via
      the
      app,
      Uber
      gets
      the
      tip
      money
      and
      not
      the
      person

      The

      a

      scam
      that
      offset
      the
      cost
      to

      customers.
      Employers
      are

      So

      yesterday.
      This

      was
      playing
      a

      game
      on
      their
      phone.
      They
      were
      really
      struggling
      for
      a
      good
      30-35
      minutes
      with
      just
      one
      word.
      One
      word
      that
      would
      complete
      this
      level
      and
      get
      them
      to
      the
      next
      one.
      So
      I
      helped
      them
      out.
      They
      got
      super
      defensive
      and
      said
      I
      should
      "stop
      being
      nosy"
      and
      "mind
      my
      own
      business".
      In
      the
      moment
      I
      got
      a
      bit
      defensive
      because
      my
      heart
      was
      in
      the
      right
      place.
      However,
      now
      that
      time
      has
      passed
      I'm
      having
      doubts
      on
      my
      action.
      I'm
      sorry
      this
      is
      tamer
      than
      the
      ones
      where
      someone
      sniffed
      their
      mom's
      panties
      or
      fucked
      a
      dead
      moose
      but
      I
      need
      to
      know
      if
      I
      should
      be
      helpful
      if
      I
      see
      someone
      needs
      help
      and
      I
      can
      provide
      it
      or
      just
      wait
      for
      them
      until
      they
      explicitly
      ask.

      I
      also
      have
      like
      a
      SP
      attack
      every
      other
      week.
      I
      did
      do
      a
      lot
      of
      research
      on
      it,
      now
      I've
      slowly
      begun
      to
      overcome
      it.
      The
      first
      step
      is
      to
      train
      yourself
      to
      identify
      a
      SP
      attack.
      The
      2nd
      step
      is
      to
      try
      and
      wiggle
      your
      toes
      or
      move
      a
      finger.
      It
      takes
      a
      while
      to
      master
      it
      but
      once
      you
      do
      that
      you
      wake
      up
      soon
      after.
      The
      third
      thing
      is
      don't
      go
      back
      to
      sleep
      immediately.
      I've
      had
      though
      very
      rarely
      (2
      times
      i
      guess)
      that
      the
      same
      scenario
      continued
      when
      I
      went
      back
      to
      sleep
      instantly.
      So
      stay
      awake
      for
      a
      while
      and
      calm
      yourself
      down.
      I
      hope
      this
      helps.

      Yes
      this
      is
      so
      relatable.
      I
      still
      remember
      the
      first

      I
      got

      I
      was

      16.
      Woke
      up
      trembling,
      sweating,
      couldn't
      go
      back
      to
      sleep.
      These
      days
      after
      the
      first
      15
      seconds
      that
      it
      takes
      to
      identify
      that
      it's
      happening
      it's
      like
      "Ah
      shit
      here
      we
      go
      again"

      I
      think
      you
      should
      check
      with
      him
      first
      what
      he
      uses..
      some
      guys
      use
      a
      trimmer
      and
      if
      he
      does
      too,
      he's
      probably
      gonna
      bring
      his
      own.
      However,
      if
      he
      does
      use
      a
      razor
      then
      you
      can
      make
      a
      little
      gift
      basket
      as
      a
      welcome
      gift

      a
      razor
      b)
      razor
      blades
      c)
      shaving
      cream
      and
      d)
      after
      shave.
      That's
      all
      the
      stuff
      I
      use,
      but
      other
      guys
      can
      add
      if

      Five.
      My
      grandfather
      is
      84
      now.
      Ever
      since
      he
      hit
      80
      he's
      lost
      all
      control
      of
      his
      body.
      He
      has
      to
      wear
      adult
      diapers
      and
      I
      can
      see
      the
      shame
      that
      washes
      over
      him
      each
      time
      he
      soils
      himself.
      He's
      lost
      all
      emotions
      and
      is
      dead
      on
      the
      inside
      now.
      I
      hate
      to
      see
      him
      like
      this
      because
      he
      is
      the
      only
      true
      friend
      I
      have.

      my
      leg.
      Doc
      asked
      me
      where
      it
      hurt?
      Then
      pressed
      that
      part
      hard.
      Wanted
      to
      kick
      that
      mf
      with
      all
      my

      couldn't
      move
      leg.

      e-learning
      is
      the
      learning
      based
      on
      the
      alphabet
      E.
      In
      1943,
      researchers
      at
      UC
      Berkley
      realised
      that
      a
      lot
      of
      metaphysical
      theorems
      fell
      apart
      based
      on
      our
      current
      knowledge
      of
      the
      alphabet.
      To
      tackle
      this
      problem
      they
      devised
      a
      new
      scheme
      called
      e-learning.
      It
      aims
      to
      resolve
      the
      differences
      between
      Einstein's
      General
      Relativity
      and
      the
      modern
      String
      Theory.
      It's
      called
      e-ducation.

      I
      recently
      interviewed
      at
      a
      company.
      The
      HR
      openly
      said
      to
      me
      that
      they
      were
      going
      with
      a
      female
      candidate
      simply
      because
      they
      wanted
      to
      encourage
      more
      diversity.
      It's
      not
      LGBT
      per
      se
      but
      all
      this
      woke
      shit
      in
      general.
      It
      shouldn't
      matter
      what
      your
      sexual
      orientation
      or
      gender
      is.
      The
      hardest/most
      capable
      person
      should
      be
      able
      to
      get
      ahead.

      This
      happened
      in
      high
      school.
      I
      took
      my
      parents
      to
      the
      place
      me
      and
      my
      friends
      usually
      hang
      out.
      The
      waiter
      hands
      over
      the
      bar
      menu
      to
      me.
      *Cue
      suspicious
      looks
      from
      family*
      I
      play
      it
      off
      as
      the
      waiter's
      mistake.
      I'm
      on
      first
      name
      basis
      with
      this
      dude.
      I
      panicked
      and
      acted
      like
      I
      was
      there
      the
      first
      time
      and
      he
      confused
      me
      for
      someone
      else.
      The
      waiter
      is
      thick
      as
      fuck.
      He
      says
      "u/gaenji
      are
      you
      taking
      the
      regular?".
      I
      gave
      up
      at
      that
      point.
      It
      was
      a
      very
      quiet
      dinner
      and
      an
      even
      quieter
      drive
      back
      home.
      That
      night,
      my
      dad
      gave
      me
      an
      earful.

      High:
      The
      oxygen
      level
      up
      there
      decreases
      and
      you
      can't
      breathe
      after
      a
      certain
      height.
      For
      that
      reason,
      defining
      a
      high
      altitude
      is
      necessary
      Low:
      Planes
      need
      to
      fly
      at
      a
      certain
      minimum
      altitude
      to
      stat
      afloat.
      Also,
      skydivers
      need
      to
      know
      the
      minimum
      altitude
      before
      which
      the
      must
      deploy
      their
      parachute.
      Thus,
      defining
      a
      low
      becomes
      important.
      Depth:
      Everything
      (almost?)
      precarious
      underwater
      has
      to
      do
      with
      the
      weight
      of
      the
      water
      above
      you
      (aka
      pressure).
      So
      defining
      depth
      is
      the
      only
      real
      requirement
      underwater.

      He

      I'm
      gonna
      give
      this
      guy
      the
      benefit
      of
      doubt
      and
      say
      He's
      probably
      just
      busy.
      If
      you're
      genuinely
      interested
      in
      the
      guy
      then
      go
      back
      to
      the
      store
      and
      make
      a
      joke
      about
      it.
      It
      could
      even
      end
      up
      being
      a
      long
      term
      joke
      in
      your
      relationship.
      "Why
      can't
      you
      ever
      pick
      the
      restaurant
      for
      a
      change?"
      "Idk
      babe,
      remember
      that
      time
      I
      took
      initiative
      and
      you
      snubbed
      me"
      He
      could
      also
      be
      a
      player.
      No
      way
      to
      tell.
      I
      hope
      it
      turns
      out
      for
      you
      well
      OP.
      Best
      of
      luck.

      No
      it
      is
      different
      in
      the
      looks
      department.
      When
      you
      see
      yourself
      in
      the
      mirror
      you
      see
      an
      inverted
      picture
      of
      yourself.
      This
      makes
      more
      sense
      to
      our
      brains
      and
      *appears*
      to
      be
      more
      attractive.
      In
      photographs
      however,
      you
      see
      the
      actual
      image.
      That
      is
      what
      you
      look
      like
      to
      other
      people.
      That
      is
      why
      you
      might
      find
      that
      you
      look
      attractive
      in
      the
      mirror
      but
      not
      so
      much
      in
      pictures.
      It
      is
      also
      why,
      professional
      photographers
      mirror
      flip
      the
      images
      of
      their
      models.

      does
      it
      take
      to
      fully
      prepare?

      I'm
      starting
      my
      preparation
      from
      LinuxAcademy
      for
      my
      Linux+.
      CompTIA
      says
      that
      it
      takes
      9-12
      months
      to
      fully
      prepare.
      I
      am
      a
      beginner
      in
      Linux.
      I
      am
      also
      a
      student
      currently,
      so
      I
      might
      be
      able
      to
      spend
      more
      time
      on
      prep
      than
      maybe
      someone
      with
      a
      full-time
      job.
      The
      downside
      is
      that
      apart
      from
      my
      personal
      usage,
      I
      really
      don't
      have
      any
      connection
      with
      Linux.
      I
      am
      moderately
      intelligent
      and
      do
      understand
      concepts
      fairly
      quickly.
      How
      long
      do
      you
      reckon
      it
      would
      take
      me
      to
      be
      fully
      prepared?

      I'll
      speak
      from
      experience
      here.
      I
      lost
      50lbs
      last
      year
      and
      since
      a
      year
      my
      body
      has
      plateaud.
      I
      spend
      2
      hours
      in
      the
      gym
      daily
      but
      am
      not
      seeing
      any
      effects.
      I
      do
      monitor
      my
      nutrition
      as
      well.
      It
      is
      really
      hard
      to
      keep
      yourself
      motivated
      AND
      justify
      the
      money
      you're
      spending
      when
      the
      scales
      don't
      even
      tip
      a
      single
      degree
      for
      a
      year.
      Some
      days
      it
      feels
      like
      pure
      torture
      what
      I
      put
      myself
      through.
      No
      hate
      though.
      I
      can
      absolutely
      understand
      why
      you
      might
      think
      of
      us
      this
      way
      but
      there's
      a
      lot
      more
      to
      it
      than
      meets
      the
      eye
      haha.
      It's
      like
      saying
      stop
      whining
      about
      the
      1%
      and
      go
      earn
      money.

      So
      my
      friend
      Amy
      (23F)
      called
      me
      up
      yesterday
      and
      sounded
      super
      morose.
      Turns
      out
      she
      got
      scolded
      by
      her
      boss
      who
      btw
      totally
      resents
      her,
      for
      something
      that
      wasn't
      Amy's
      fault.
      The
      boss
      says
      to
      Amy
      that
      she
      will
      ensure
      that
      she
      gets
      fired
      despite
      Amy
      doing
      everything
      she
      was
      asked
      to
      do.
      Also,
      this
      isn't
      the
      first
      time
      she's
      harassed
      her
      like
      this.
      Amy
      is
      venting
      on
      the
      phone
      and
      then
      says
      to
      me
      "I
      should
      feel
      bad
      right?
      I
      don't.
      Why?".
      I
      know
      from
      Reddit
      that
      in
      such
      situations
      I'm
      supposed
      to
      just
      listen
      and
      not
      chime
      in
      with
      solutions,
      so
      I
      just
      went
      "Mmhm".
      I
      don't
      think
      that
      was
      the
      right
      answer.
      What
      do
      you
      think
      I
      should've
      said
      instead?
      TL;DR:
      Didn't
      know
      what
      to
      say
      when
      friend
      said
      "I
      should
      feel
      bad
      right?
      I
      don't.
      Why?"

      Yeah
      it's
      a
      co-op
      that's
      about
      to
      end
      in
      a
      couple
      weeks.
      So
      you
      think
      I
      should've
      said
      "Because
      you
      have
      nothing
      to
      feel
      bad
      for."
      I'm
      sorry
      if
      it
      feels
      like
      I'm
      making
      this
      about
      myself
      and
      not
      her
      but
      I've
      known
      her
      for
      almost
      10
      years
      now.
      I
      have
      never
      seen
      her
      sounding
      so
      upset
      before.
      I'm
      trying
      to
      do
      everything
      in
      my
      power
      to
      make
      her
      feel
      better.

      It
      comes
      down
      to
      culture
      I
      guess.
      Where
      I'm
      from
      we
      keep
      to
      ourselves.
      That's
      why
      I
      find
      the
      American
      culture
      of
      talking
      to
      everyone
      extremely
      fake.
      When
      someone
      says
      to
      me
      "how's
      your
      day
      going?"
      I
      don't
      see
      it
      as
      courteous.
      I'd
      rather
      have
      them
      not
      ask
      at
      all
      and
      if
      they
      do
      I'd
      prefer
      they
      really
      want
      to
      know
      how
      my
      day's
      going.
      Not
      implying
      that
      one's
      better
      than
      the
      other.
      Just

      this

      they're

      don't

      it's

      they're

      It
      might
      seem
      bizzare
      to
      you
      but
      your

      No

      I
      think
      you
      aren't
      relating
      with
      the
      guy.
      OP
      I
      was
      in
      a
      similar
      situation.
      It's
      your
      dick.
      If
      you're
      even
      remotely
      having
      doubts
      on
      the
      veracity
      of
      your
      feelings,
      it's
      your
      dick.
      I
      listened
      to
      the
      tiny
      guy
      and
      hit
      on
      her.
      Ruined
      the
      only
      relationship
      I
      had
      with
      the
      opposite
      sex.
      Don't
      cave.
      You'll
      kick
      yourself
      for
      months
      later.

      I

      think
      he's
      using
      her
      in
      any
      way.
      He's
      contributing
      in
      his
      capacity.
      If
      I
      were
      to
      bet,
      I'm
      pretty
      sure
      he
      hates
      himself
      for
      being
      unable
      to
      pay.

      it
      isn't

      In
      the
      begining
      I
      had
      to
      curb
      my
      urge
      to
      rape
      the
      body
      but
      soon
      I
      learnt
      that
      it's
      better
      to
      gather
      the
      evidence
      first
      and
      then
      sneak
      into
      the
      morgue

      but
      this
      needs
      to
      be
      done
      artfully.

      of
      mhmm
      and
      head

      do
      this
      to
      me
      even
      when
      I
      wasn't

      he
      stared
      me
      straight
      in
      the
      eyes
      and
      there
      was
      complete
      silence.
      No
      i
      did
      not
      talk
      myself
      into
      a
      hole.
      Just
      called
      him
      out.
      He
      never
      did
      it
      again.

      I
      was
      an
      intern
      at
      a
      startup.
      Pushed
      some
      code
      into
      production.
      Crashed
      the
      website

      our
      website
      was
      down
      for
      almost
      a
      day.
      The
      worst
      part
      of
      it
      was
      that
      I
      was
      sat
      there
      like
      a
      child

      done
      some
      mischief
      and
      was
      in
      the
      principal's
      office
      while
      my
      senior
      colleagues
      ran
      helter
      skelter
      to
      undo
      the
      damages
      I'd
      done.

      Had
      to

      anything

      suggests

      (weed

      Nothing
      wrong
      with
      smoking
      up,
      I
      do
      it
      too
      but
      don't
      put
      that

      I
      don't
      need
      to
      know
      your
      mother's
      maiden
      name,
      leave
      some
      stuff
      for
      the
      first
      date
      -
      feminist.
      if
      the
      first
      thing
      they
      bring
      up
      is
      their
      political
      ideology
      you
      know
      that
      they
      let
      whatever's
      hot
      in
      the
      news
      define
      their
      personality.
      This
      applies
      to
      people
      on
      both
      sides
      of
      the
      spectrum
      but
      I've
      seen
      feminist
      written
      more
      than
      anything
      else.

      movie
      where
      he

      marries
      Cameron

      they
      have

      live
      together
      to
      get
      some

      or

      The

      completely
      subjective.
      To
      me
      personally,
      I've
      seen
      that
      women
      who
      feel
      the
      need
      to
      put
      that
      on
      their

      do
      so
      because
      they
      think
      it's
      cool.
      Their
      whole
      personality
      is
      defined
      on
      how
      cool
      and
      edgy
      they
      are.

      Yeah
      I
      was
      thinking
      this
      too.
      I
      have
      written
      up
      my
      own
      HashMap
      in
      C++
      so
      I
      could
      use
      in
      a
      project.
      Now
      that
      might
      be
      extreme
      but
      it's
      important
      to
      know
      how
      those
      DS
      actually
      work.

      of

      friends

            The
            problem
            with
            "fake
            it
            till
            you
            make
            it"
            is
            that
            it
            feels
            like
            I'm
            being
            disingenuous
            to
            myself.
            And
            then
            there's
            the
            other
            advice
            of
            "always
            be
            yourself"
            which
            I
            kind
            of
            agree
            with
            more.
            To
            OP,
            I'm
            exactly
            like
            you.
            I
            literally
            read
            that
            description
            and
            thought
            to
            myself
            "Damn
            this
            dude
            could
            write
            my
            biography".
            Here's
            what
            I'd
            say
            to
            you.
            Make
            peace
            with
            the
            fact
            that
            you
            aren't
            gregarious.
            It's
            okay
            to
            want
            to
            be
            by
            yourself.
            Don't
            get
            anxious
            and
            don't
            chase
            validation.
            I
            wish
            you
            my
            best
            :)

            this
            because
            the
            exam
            changed
            from
            April
            2019.
            I'm
            a
            bit
            financially
            weak
            right
            now
            so
            I'd
            like
            to
            preferably
            get
            recommendations
            on
            free
            material.
            However,
            don't
            hold
            back
            on
            good
            quality
            paid
            material
            either.
            I'll
            maybe
            try
            borrowing
            or
            something
            idk
            right
            now...
            Thank
            you
            guys
            for
            helping
            out!

            is
            very
            uncomfortable
            with
            talking
            financials
            with
            me.
            Also,
            he
            never
            gave
            me
            ANY
            money
            or
            gifts
            in
            my
            childhood
            growing
            up
            (no
            birthdays,
            no
            holidays
            etc).
            I
            don't
            hate
            him
            or
            whatever
            because
            I've
            let
            go
            of
            the
            resentment
            but
            I
            have
            decided
            that
            I
            will
            definitely
            teach
            my
            kids
            about
            savings
            and
            investments.
