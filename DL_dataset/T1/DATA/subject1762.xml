      Hello
      there!
      I
      was
      recently
      inspired
      by
      /u/PedanticTweed's
      forced
      combo
      list
      and
      I
      wanted
      to
      make
      something
      slightly
      more
      morbid.
      I'm
      trying
      to
      put
      together
      a
      deck
      with
      the
      primary
      wincon's
      being
      giving
      people
      cards
      like
      [[Necropotence]]
      and
      then
      using
      [[Mindslaver]]
      to
      drain
      them
      to
      0.
      I
      felt
      like
      going
      5
      color
      would
      be
      the
      best
      way
      to
      channel
      the
      jank
      and
      try
      making
      the
      deck
      happen.
      I
      don't
      expect
      this
      deck
      to
      be
      at
      all
      competitive
      nor
      do
      I
      really
      want
      it
      to
      be.
      I
      will
      probably
      proxy
      the
      whole
      thing
      before
      actually
      buying
      the
      pieces
      since
      the
      deck
      might
      end
      up
      being
      far
      too
      linear
      and
      boring
      over
      time,
      which
      makes
      budget
      a
      non-issue.
      So
      I
      came
      here
      for
      help
      straightening
      things
      out
      and
      seeing
      if
      there
      were
      things
      I
      missed
      since
      it
      was
      kind
      of
      difficult
      getting
      this
      far
      with
      such
      a
      strange
      and
      clunky
      strategy.
      The
      list
      is
      sitting
      at
      95
      cards,
      quite
      a
      few
      of
      which
      are
      just
      janky
      5
      color
      stuffs,
      so
      there
      is
      plenty
      of
      room
      for
      additions
      and
      cuts.
      I
      figured
      instead
      of
      jamming
      in
      5
      more
      random
      cards
      it
      would
      be
      better
      to
      just
      use
      suggestions.
      So
      please
      let
      me
      know
      what
      you
      guys
      think!
      I'd
      appreciate
      any
      and
      all
      input.

      list:**

      I
      had
      previously

      included

      I

      I'm

      to
      try
      and
      make
      that
      happen

      I'm

      my

      will
      love
      having
      that

      That
      would
      be
      a
      hilarious
      match
      up,
      going

      have
      to
      make
      that
      happen
      at

      That

      is
      perfect,
      just
      the
      sort
      of
      thing
      i
      knew
      i
      would
      miss
      when
      putting
      this
      together.
      I
      initially
      left
      impersonator
      off
      but
      it
      is
      too
      flexible
      to
      not
      include.

      The

      is
      fries
      "light

      They
      come
      out
      golden
      and
      crispy
      just
      like

      well

      any

      out
      cooks
      their
      well
      done
      fries
      extra
      crunchy,
      go
      with
      the
      light
      well.

      Good
      advice,
      I
      considered
      going
      down
      one
      Griselbrand
      but
      wasn't
      sure
      if
      it
      was
      better
      to
      keep
      things
      as
      streamlined
      as
      possible
      pre-board.
      I
      play
      against
      a
      lot
      of
      lands
      and
      turbo
      depths
      in
      my
      local
      meta
      which
      has
      probably
      biased
      my
      opinion
      on
      the
      Magus
      but
      it
      has
      been
      an
      instant
      win
      every
      time.
      The
      match
      up
      is
      favored
      so
      it
      may
      very
      well
      be
      win
      more.
      Thanks
      for
      the
      input.

      I've
      really
      like
      the
      lists
      that
      I've
      seen
      running
      Show
      on

      side,
      and
      the
      idea
      of
      dropping
      the
      lootings
      is
      really
      interesting.
      What
      does
      your
      sideboard
      look
      like
      in
      terms
      of
      hate
      piece
      removal

      I
      feel

      this
      is
      something
      I
      will
      try
      after

      since
      I
      wont
      have
      much
      time

      playtest

      First
      of
      all,
      thanks
      for
      the
      input.
      I'm
      glad
      to
      see
      you
      disagree
      with
      a
      number
      of
      my
      choices.
      I'm
      operating
      in
      quite
      a
      vacuum
      with
      this
      deck
      since
      none
      of
      my
      friends
      have
      experience
      with
      it
      and
      I'm
      the
      only
      one
      playing
      it
      at
      my
      LGS.
      So
      most
      of
      these
      choices
      have
      been
      from
      what
      feels
      good
      in
      my
      limited
      play
      time
      and
      looking
      at
      top8's/resources
      online.
      I
      was
      iffy
      on
      moving
      Tidespout
      side
      so
      I'll
      take
      your
      word
      for
      it
      and
      move
      it
      back
      main.
      The
      more
      I
      think
      about
      Iona
      in
      the
      places
      where
      I
      would
      bring
      in
      the
      Norn
      I
      agree
      here
      as
      well.
      I
      see
      a
      lot
      of
      lists
      not
      including
      Sire
      at
      all
      which
      really
      surprises
      me
      and
      could
      be
      a
      result
      of
      my
      limited
      experience.
      Putting
      Sire
      down
      as
      your
      early
      target
      often
      feels
      even
      more
      game
      ending
      than
      Griselbrand
      in
      a
      lot
      of
      matchups.
      For
      that
      same
      reason
      I
      feel
      like
      its
      great
      post
      board
      as
      Surgical
      bait
      since
      if
      it
      does
      stick
      its
      nearly
      always
      GG
      and
      if
      it
      doesn't
      you
      didn't
      have
      your
      reanimate
      targets
      ripped
      out.
      I
      like
      your
      recommendations
      on
      the
      disruption
      suites,
      this
      was
      one
      of
      the
      places
      where
      I
      feel
      the
      most
      inexperienced.
      The
      big
      reason
      why
      I'm
      not
      running
      Therapy
      is
      because
      of
      my
      limited
      meta
      knowledge.
      Obviously
      in
      a
      lot
      of
      match-ups
      you're
      naming
      what
      you
      don't
      want
      stopping
      you
      but
      in
      the
      rest
      you
      need
      more
      understanding
      of
      the
      appropriate
      hits.
      As
      I
      mentioned
      in
      the
      other
      reply
      the
      moons
      felt
      good
      against
      the
      Lands/Depths
      matchups
      but
      that
      could
      be
      win
      more.
      Went
      with
      the
      magus
      since
      it
      can
      be
      reanimated.
      Will
      heavily
      consider
      swapping
      them
      out.
      Archon
      was
      put
      in
      for
      Eldrazi,
      Show
      and
      Tell,
      Depths
      decks
      etc.
      Feels
      like
      a
      solid
      inclusion
      and
      a
      strong
      lock
      out
      against
      those
      decks.
      Considering
      I'm
      taking
      your
      advice
      on
      the
      disruption
      suite
      the
      duress'
      will
      probably
      be
      adjusted.
      Will
      probably
      be
      dropping
      Moons
      for
      a
      needle
      and
      trying
      a
      Firestorm.

      against
      something
      like
      DnT,
      Elves,
      Delver/Pyromancer
      decks.
      While
      Arcon
      brings
      much
      better
      game
      against
      Eldrazi,
      Show
      and
      Tell,
      and
      Lands.
      Not
      really
      sure
      where
      I
      want
      to
      be
      on
      this
      one.

      I
      see,
      and
      to
      make
      sure
      I've
      been
      siding
      properly
      the
      brutality's
      go
      in
      for
      the
      faithless
      looting's
      correct?
      Since
      they
      are
      replacing
      your
      discard
      outlet
      while
      going
      up
      on
      disruption
      to
      protect
      the
      combo.
      I
      may
      keep
      one
      magus
      on
      the
      side
      depending
      on
      how
      the
      list
      develops.

      This
      is
      a
      sweet
      adaptation,
      the
      amount
      of
      variety
      in
      what
      could
      be
      considered
      a
      quite
      linear
      deck
      is
      really
      awesome.
      I'd
      love
      to
      give
      this
      a
      go
      but
      will
      probably
      wait
      until
      after
      the
      GP
      since
      the
      experience
      I
      have
      is
      with
      a
      traditional
      list.
      Excited
      to
      try
      all
      these
      variations
      out
      though.

      Damn,
      thanks
      so
      much
      for
      the
      info!
      Thankfully
      I
      was
      in
      most
      of
      the
      right
      places
      in
      comparison
      to
      your
      advice
      but
      there
      were
      definitely
      a
      lot
      of
      situations
      I
      wasn't
      confident
      on
      and
      this
      will
      surely
      be
      a
      huge
      help.

      Thanks
      for
      all
      the
      info,
      I've
      been
      altering
      the
      list
      as
      people
      have
      been
      making
      recommendations
      so
      it
      has
      become
      more
      reactive.
      I
      do
      agree
      with
      the
      mentality
      of
      keeping
      things
      in
      such
      a
      way
      that
      you're
      forcing
      all
      the
      questions
      as
      opposed
      to
      diluting
      for
      answers.
      So
      I'm
      not
      totally
      sure
      where
      I
      want
      to
      be
      in
      that
      regard,
      given
      the
      differences
      of
      opinions
      in
      just
      this
      thread
      it
      seems
      to
      be
      mostly
      preference.
      The
      unmask's
      in
      particular
      are
      really
      contentious
      for
      me
      since
      they're
      great
      protection
      but
      having
      4
      brutality
      for
      game
      1
      against
      DRS
      is
      equally
      as
      enticing.
      I'll
      probably
      be
      dropping
      the
      moon
      and
      adjusting
      for
      2x
      macabre
      I've
      seen
      that
      primer
      and
      it
      has
      been
      a
      great
      help!

      Love
      your
      work
      and
      would
      happily
      buy
      a
      playmat
      of
      your
      Stasis.
      I
      think
      it
      would
      be
      great
      to
      offer
      stitched
      edge
      playmats
      along
      the
      lines
      of
      what
      Peter
      Mohrbacher
      offers
      for
      some
      of
      his
      limited
      Angelarium
      work.
      The
      difference
      in
      quality
      is
      worth
      the
      cost
      as
      a
      consumer
      in
      my
      opinion
      and
      they'll
      last
      so
      much
      longer.

      Relatively
      straight
      forward
      proactive
      decks

      ESH
      It
      was
      irresponsible
      of
      you
      and
      your
      very
      pregnant
      wife
      to
      get
      a
      puppy
      without
      being
      fully
      prepared
      to
      take
      care
      of
      it
      in
      addition
      to
      an
      infant.
      The
      fact
      that
      your
      wife
      is
      going
      back
      on
      the
      decision
      now
      because
      she #8217;s
      realizing
      just
      how
      much
      work
      a
      baby
      and
      a
      puppy
      can
      be
      shows
      how
      little
      thought
      went
      into
      the
      decision.
      I
      don #8217;t
      think
      you
      should
      be
      blamed
      for
      going
      back
      to
      work
      but
      it
      definitely
      doesn #8217;t
      help
      the
      situation.
      If
      you
      and
      your
      wife
      discuss
      it
      more
      and
      both
      think
      you #8217;re
      willing
      to
      try
      and
      make
      the
      puppy
      work
      you #8217;ll
      likely
      need
      to
      take
      it
      to
      a
      trainer
      so
      your
      wife
      doesn #8217;t
      get
      overwhelmed.
