      Hey
      you
      .
      I
      have
      a
      couples
      tcounselor/therapist
      and
      i
      just
      saw
      a
      new
      therapist
      on
      friday
      because
      i
      desperately
      need
      one
      if
      i #8217;m
      going
      to
      get
      through
      this
      z.
      i
      was
      proactive
      because
      desperation
      called
      for
      a
      pretty
      immediate
      prospective
      therapist.
      i #8217;ve
      thought
      about
      support
      groups
      but
      i #8217;ve
      never
      been
      in
      a
       #8220;group #8221;,
      just
      therapy
      or
      facilities
      and
      specialized
      programs.
      it
      maybe
      would
      be
      nice
      to
      see
      people
      like
      me
      but
      my
      anxiety
      is
      also
      tell
      me
      to
      gtfo
      and
      not
      and
      hopefully
      this
      new
      therapist
      is
      any
      good
      and
      can
      help
      me
      at
      all
      otherwise
      i #8217;m
      not
      sure
      how
      long
      i
      can
      manage
      to
      hold
      out
      i
      wouldn #8217;t
      know
      how
      to
      get
      to
      a
      support
      group
      i
      don #8217;t
      drive,
      and
      that #8217;d
      be
      up
      to
      my
      partner
      if
      she
      has
      the
      free
      time
      and
      i
      t
      sounds
      daunting.
      i #8217;m
      open
      to
      the
      idea
      in
      a
      way
      though
      i
      don #8217;t
      have
      much
      to
      lose
      at
      this
      point
      i
      guess

      I #8217;ve
      been
      in
      this
      situation
      before,
      after
      rape
      i
      snapped
      and
      attempted.
      psych
      wards
      are
      scary
      and
      rough.
      i
      personally
      am
      biased
      and
      i
      wanted
      to
      die
      because
      the
      pain
      was
      so
      much
      anguish
      and
      i
      felt
      token,
      used
      and
      worthless
      so
      i
      understand
      exactly
      why
      she
      wants
      to
      die.
      from
      your
      perspective
      you
      saved
      her
      life,
      from
      hers
      she
      probably
      doesn #8217;t
      know
      what
      to
      think
      and
      may
      be
      randomly
      resentful
      for
      some
      time
      for
      stopping
      her
      so
      to
      speak
      but
      she
      also
      desperately
      needs
      you.
      she #8217;s
      scared,
      i #8217;m
      sorry
      both
      of
      you
      are
      going
      through
      this.
      it
      won #8217;t
      be
      easy
      but
      in
      time
      it
      will
      numb
      some
      and
      that
      may
      be
      enough
      for
      her
      to
      begin
      healing.
      don #8217;t
      expect
      miracles
      and
      she
      may
      never
      return
      to
       #8220;normal #8221;
      but
      give
      her
      love
      and
      support
      and
      don #8217;t
      get
      mad
      at
      her.
      she
      is
      hurting
      beyond
      belief
      and
      felt
      she
      had
      no
      other
      option.
      being
      violated
      is
      the
      worst
      thing
      ever.
      just
      keep
      her
      safe
      and
      remember
      you #8217;ll
      have
      to
      be
      there
      for
      her
      more.
      don #8217;t
      suffocate
      her
      but
      be
      that
      gentle
      support,
      not
      a
      protective
      cage.
      i
      wish
      i
      could
      hug
      you
      both.
      she
      definitely
      will
      need
      a
      therapist,
      i
      needed
      that
      and
      medication.
      a
      friend
      support
      system
      is
      really
      good
      because
      it #8217;s
      hard
      to
      talk
      to
      older
      adults
      abou
      tthese
      things
      even
      in
      desperation.
      thank
      god
      you #8217;re
      visiting
      her
      in
      there.
      when
      i
      was
      visited
      it
      was
      a
      godsend
      and
      my
      only
      grip
      on
      love
      and
      reality.
      you #8217;re
      doing
      great.
      it #8217;s
      hard
      but
      you #8217;re
      obviously
      so
      loving
      and
      want
      to
      help
      so
      much.
      that
      goes
      a
      long
      way.
      also
      i
      was
      hella
      moody
      randomly
      for
      a
      while
      bursts
      of
      anger
      and
      self
      loathing
      will
      absolutely
      happen.
      i
      began
      abusing
      drugs
      and
      alcohol
      and
      self
      harmed
      more.
      don #8217;t
      freak
      out,
      just
      stay
      aware
      and
      don #8217;t
      helicopter
      her.
      don #8217;t
      send
      her
      to
      the
      ER
      for
      basic
      self
      harm.
      it #8217;s
      one
      of
      the
      only
      effective
      coping
      ways
      at
      first
      lt;3
      sorry
      i #8217;m
      not
      good
      at
      collecting
      thoughts.
      //
      psych
      wards
      are
      terrifying
      and
      full
      of
      messed
      up
      people,
      drug
      addicts
      and
      legit
      crazy
      people.
      it
      can
      be
      unsafe
      and
      traumatizing.
      even
      staff
      sometimes
      do
      things
      that
      are
      extremely
      traumatizing
      and
      make
      it
      worse.
      in
      the
      future
      exhaust
      other
      options
      before
      sending
      her
      in
      a
      ward
      or
      hospital.

      It
      gives
      a
      sense
      of
      peace
      knowing
      life
      is
      in
      ones
      hands.
      They
      have
      control
      over
      themselves.
      Its
      soothing.
      Its
      a
      reminder
      they
      have
      a
      safety
      net.
      They
      could
      even
      keep
      it
      at
      their
      desk
      every
      day
      in
      the
      open;
      so
      they
      see
      it
      regardless
      of
      the
      mood
      they
      are
      in.
      They
      know
      its
      there
      during
      the
      panic
      and
      the
      happiness,
      they
      know
      they
      are
      in
      control
      even
      in
      the
      anger
      and
      the
      sadness.
      It
      becomes
      calculated.
      Perhaps
      even
      it
      gives
      a
      sense
      of
      freedom
      to
      do
      things
      they
      wouldnt
      before.
      They
      have
      nothing
      to
      lose
      anymore
      and
      only
      things
      to
      gain.
      I
      hope
      you
      can
      find
      that
      something
      that
      makes
      you
      feel
      better.
      Everyone
      deserves
      happiness
      in
      any
      form.

      is
      it
      wrong
      to
      not
      want
      someone
      to
      worry?
      No.
      You
      dont
      want
      to
      hurt
      anyone,
      ignorance
      perhaps
      is
      bliss.
      If
      you
      told
      him
      the
      truth
      what
      would
      happen?
      Would
      he
      feel
      like
      he
      failed
      and
      beat
      hismelf
      up?
      perhaps
      it
      would
      end
      in
      a
      different
      way.
      but
      you
      dont
      know
      how
      he
      would
      interpret
      the
      intent
      and
      what
      hed
      do
      with
      that
      information.
      youre
      afraid
      its
      a
      burden
      and
      what
      he
      doesnt
      know
      wont
      hurt
      him.
      you
      dont
      want
      other
      people
      to
      be
      in
      suffering
      too
      and
      telling
      them
      puts
      the
      weight
      on
      them
      as
      well
      to
      do
      something
      and
      save
      you,
      or
      failing
      trying
      to
      do
      so
      and
      living
      with
      that.
      is
      it
      wrong
      to
      want
      to
      minimize
      the
      amount
      it
      hurts
      them?
      No.
      You
      already
      know
      this.

      i
      can
      imagine
      most
      poeple
      would
      make
      jokes
      and
      it
      would
      blow
      over
      their
      heads
      and
      not
      even
      register
      but
      even
      if
      it
      is
      annoying
      to
      you,
      other
      people
      in
      the
      crowd
      may
      be
      suicidal

      feel
      it

      even
      if
      its
      stupid,
      maybe
      its
      enough

      give
      someone
      a

      hey
      you.
      sounds
      like
      you
      have
      a
      look
      into
      what
      happens
      to
      the
      "loved
      ones"
      when
      people
      pass
      away.
      That
      can
      definitely
      change
      any
      persons
      view
      of
      life
      and
      death.
      guilt
      or
      sadness
      in
      people
      hurts
      a
      lot
      and
      i
      imagine
      you
      feel
      torn.
      youve
      got
      some
      strong
      will
      to
      handle
      both
      sides
      of
      it
      at
      once.
      i
      dont
      think
      its
      that
      you
      dont
      have
      the
      balls,
      i
      think
      its
      because
      you
      clearly
      love
      your
      family
      and
      friends
      girlfriend
      passionately.
      You
      are
      a
      nice/friendly/good
      person
      to
      them
      even
      if
      you
      have
      dragons
      inside
      you.
      you
      may
      feel
      bad,
      but
      you
      treat
      them
      with
      love.
      That
      has
      nothing
      to
      do
      with
      confidence.
      You
      are
      fighting,
      not
      failing.
      you
      have
      some
      hella
      strong
      armor.
      also
      i
      wont
      tell
      you
      the
      masterful
      secrets
      written
      in
      the
      ancient
      tomes
      because
      those
      are
      forbidden
      spells.
      what
      I
      can
      say
      is
      that
      combo
      you
      said
      is
      totally
      throwup
      worthy
      and
      statistically
      ineffective.
      you
      say
      you
      dont
      want
      to
      wake
      up
      disabled,
      that
      method
      likes
      to
      backfire.

      Hey
      so
      I
      have
      literally
      the
      exact
      same
      issue.
      sh
      on
      the
      face
      is
      something
      i
      used
      to
      ponder
      in
      the
      mirror
      too,
      especially
      cause
      not
      everything
      is
      symmetircal.
      honestly
      the
      reason
      i
      didnt
      actualy
      sh
      is
      because
      i
      didnt
      think
      i
      could
      get
      good
      symmety
      on
      my
      face
      and
      im
      a
      perfectionist
      and
      i
      was
      afriad
      id
      make
      it
      worse.
      so
      like
      i
      obviously
      cant
      tell
      you
      what
      to
      do
      but
      for
      me
      piercings,
      heavy
      eyeshaow
      etc
      helped
      alot.
      having
      piercings
      all
      over
      your
      face
      make
      ppl
      focus
      and
      notice
      pretty
      much
      only
      those
      for
      me
      now.
      i
      have
      a
      million
      on
      mine
      foir
      that
      purpose
      and
      it
      helped
      scar
      urges
      too.
      i
      dont
      think
      scars
      would
      be
      worth
      it
      anymore.
      what
      about
      hairline
      tattos
      or
      piercings?
      ever
      seen
      picture
      of
      people
      with
      like
      pretty
      tattoos
      on
      their
      side
      like
      near
      the
      eye?
      /also
      do
      you
      have
      a
      therapist
      you
      can
      talk
      to?
      or
      a
      doctor?
      getting
      stuff
      off
      your
      chest
      could
      feel
      good
      even
      if
      it
      doesnt
      solve
      it.

      heya.
      i
      thought
      throwing
      in
      something
      silly
      and
      outlandish
      would
      be
      an
      amusing
      and
      noticeable
      way
      to
      deliver
      those
      words.
      even
      a
      smile
      is
      worth
      the
      randomness.
      sometimes
      i
      find
      its
      easier
      to
      compare
      things
      to
      fantastical
      things
      or
      other
      things
      to
      help
      put
      things
      in
      perspective
      in
      a
      lighthearted
      way.
      i
      dont
      know
      any
      actual
      roleplaying
      lingo.
      im
      glad
      i
      could
      touch
      you
      through
      all
      this
      pain
      going
      on
      for
      you.
      youre
      a
      tough
      cookie
      :)

      Opening
      up
      to
      a
      therapist
      is
      daunting
      at
      times,
      but
      it
      can
      be
      so
      rewarding.
      Im
      glad
      youre
      thinking/moving
      towards
      getting
      a
      new
      one.
      also
      piercing
      look
      amazing
      on
      everyone.
      go
      for
      it.
      nose
      piercings
      are
      super
      cute
      and
      "in"
      these
      days.
      piercings
      i
      got
      to
      give
      false
      symmetry
      are
      snake
      bites,
      Largeseptum
      clicker,
      dahlia
      bites
      (corners
      of
      mouth/cheek),
      and
      middle
      of
      my
      cheeks.
      if
      youre
      considering
      scars,
      those
      types
      of
      piercings
      might
      suit
      you
      well.
      you
      could
      even
      think
      of
      it
      as
      professional
      *SH*
      and
      scars
      in
      a
      way.
      Those
      are
      the
      wounds
      people
      see,
      but
      its
      flashy
      and
      accepted.
      and
      pretty.
      it
      might
      be
      a
      good
      cover
      and
      help
      satiate
      those
      urges?
      either
      way
      the
      nose
      piercing
      is
      going
      to
      look
      awesome
      on
      you.

      Have
      you
      exhausted
      all
      ways
      of
      clearing
      your
      debts?
      have
      you
      claimed
      bankruptcy
      yet?
      Im
      sorry
      you
      work
      so
      hard
      and
      it
      doesnt
      seem
      to
      be
      getting
      better.
      your
      boyfriend
      may
      really
      wishes
      the
      debt
      would
      go
      away
      but
      he
      wouldnt
      resent
      *you*.
      he
      may
      resent
      the
      debt
      even
      but
      not
      you.
      he
      loves
      you
      id
      imagine.
      Im
      sorry
      about
      the
      family
      situation.
      not
      having
      supports
      or
      a
      safety
      net
      from
      them
      is
      a
      hard
      one
      not
      going
      to
      lie.
      clearly
      they
      arent
      worth
      your
      time
      if
      they
      could
      just
      cut
      you
      off.
      Whats
      the
      degree?
      I
      dont
      know
      much
      but
      im
      curious
      what
      degreee
      you
      believe
      may
      not
      have
      potential
      when
      you
      get
      it.

      its
      hard
      to
      hear
      that
      your
      family
      is
      partly
      responsible

      your
      pain

      cant

      what
      youre
      going
      through.
      for
      writing
      Id
      imagine
      any
      piece
      you
      wrote
      for

      would
      be
      something
      youd
      leave
      behind
      and
      give
      away.
      its
      a
      sliver
      of
      your
      mind,
      a
      glimpse
      of
      what
      you
      go
      through.
      you
      wont
      experience
      that
      closure
      though
      The
      past
      years
      sound
      like
      theyve
      been
      rough.
      Youve
      been
      fighting.
      or
      surviving.
      im
      glad
      youve
      had
      at
      least
      a
      tiny
      thing
      to
      fight
      for
      and
      motivate
      you.

      or
      you
      cant
      handle
      it
      and
      you
      cant
      find
      happiness
      even
      in
      your
      hobbies
      then
      maybe
      you
      need
      a
      breather
      again.
      nothing
      wrong
      with
      that.
      this
      is
      you
      and
      your
      life.
      your
      partner
      and
      other
      people
      will
      fall
      into
      place
      around
      you.
      focus
      on
      you.
      if
      youre
      going
      to
      live
      and
      try,
      maybe
      rest
      and
      recuperate
      and
      over
      time
      youll
      find
      meds
      that
      help
      you
      stabilize.
      make
      that
      your
      goal
      if
      nothing
      else.
      get
      stable,
      find
      the
      right
      medication.
      do
      it
      as
      many
      times
      as
      you
      need.
      stress
      from
      you
      going
      to
      the
      hospital
      or
      facility
      to
      heal
      isfar
      better
      than
      if
      you
      were
      to
      be
      gone
      entirely
      and
      cutting
      ties
      wont
      change
      that.
      dont
      let
      guilt
      stop
      you
      from
      trying
      to
      heal.

      I
      cant
      use
      Marijuana
      because
      it
      send
      me
      into
      paranoid
      hallucinating
      brain
      loops
      and
      I
      get
      suicidal.
      Ive
      self
      medicated
      using
      prescription
      medications,
      last
      night
      it
      was
      benzos.
      Im
      not
      opposed
      to
      being
      in
      a
      hospital
      other
      than
      i
      hate
      not
      being
      able
      to
      have
      my
      phone,
      Fighting
      with
      them
      to
      keep
      all
      of
      my
      face
      piercings
      and
      my
      clothes
      or
      see
      my
      partner.
      My
      partner
      is
      terrified
      of
      me
      going
      to
      a
      hospital
      and
      definitely
      wants
      to
      exhaust
      every
      other
      option
      first.
      Thats
      nightmare
      fuel
      for
      her.
      i
      do
      desperately
      need
      meds
      and
      i
      do
      feel
      like
      im
      gonna
      snap
      a
      lot.
      I
      have
      been
      trying
      to
      show
      her
      I
      want
      to
      get
      help
      for
      her.
      she
      wanted
      me
      to
      be
      only
      in
      a
      day
      program
      or
      get
      group
      therapy.
      so
      I
      called
      the
      pHP
      people
      and
      they
      said
      theyd
      call
      me
      back
      after
      I
      had
      talked
      to
      them
      on
      the
      phone.
      They
      never
      did,
      nor
      did
      they
      call
      my
      therapist.
      Their
      next
      soonest
      assessment
      if
      they
      wer
      to
      get
      bac
      to
      me
      asap
      would
      be
      up
      to
      about
      2
      weeks
      perhaps.

      Hey
      so
      I
      have
      some
      really
      negative
      experiences
      especially
      in
      inpatient
      treatment
      for
      anorexia.
      I
      dont
      want
      to
      demotivate
      any
      progress
      or
      recovery
      youre
      heading
      towards
      so
      I
      didnt
      just
      post
      it.
      If
      you
      truly
      need
      inpatient
      then
      do
      it,
      but
      I
      personally
      would
      never
      in
      a
      million
      years
      go
      inpatient
      for
      an
      eating
      disorder
      again.
      Ive
      been
      inpatient,
      PHP
      and
      IOP.
      Good
      luck
      xox
      sorry
      youre
      struggling
      love.

      oh
      gosh.
      I
      know
      some
      of
      us
      sare
      a
      handful
      and
      more
      than
      a
      lot
      of
      *normal*
      people
      can
      or
      are
      willing
      to
      handle.
      hopefully
      i
      havent
      pushed
      the
      limit.
      I
      have
      my
      hopes
      once
      I
      get
      meds
      I
      can
      salvage
      this.

      That #8217;s
      not
      a
      bad
      idea
      for
      the
      time
      being.
      My
      current
      PCP
      doesn #8217;t
      ever
      do
      mental
      health
      meds
      and
      my
      Gf
      won #8217;t
      let
      me
      see
      random
      practitioners
      because
      of
      my
      drug
      abuse
      past
      and
      they
      have
      a
      lack
      of
      knowledge
      about
      my
      history
      or
      something.
      I
      can
      call
      and
      see
      if
      I
      can
      be
      put
      back
      on
      my
      last
      one
      if
      there
      are
      no
      med
      conflicts
      with
      my
      PCp.
      I
      guess
      until
      I
      can
      get
      a
      psych
      a
      short
      term
      prescription
      will
      do.
      I #8217;ll
      see
      if
      she
      will
      in
      this
      case
      since
      i #8217;ve
      been
      on
      it
      before.
      i #8217;m
      a
      bit
      desperate,
      and
      thanks
      you

      Seroquel
      is
      a
      fun
      one.
      Hope
      it
      works
      for
      you.
      When
      I
      was
      on
      it
      i
      would
      sleep
      for
      half
      a
      day,
      wake
      up
      and
      be
      awake
      for
      up
      to
      two
      groggy
      hours
      even
      with
      pounding
      energy
      drinks,
      and
      promptly
      pass
      back
      out.
      I
      was
      extremely
      fatigued.
      Also
      my
      appetite
      became
      ravenous
      to
      the
      point
      where
      i #8217;d
      be
      binge
      eating
      so
      hard
      and
      yet
      even
      if
      i
      was
      over
      full
      or
      literally
      throwing
      up
      from
      the
      volume
      of
      food
      i
      felt
      like
      i
      was
      starving.
      That
      being
      said,
      when
      I
      was
      awake
      i
      felt
      detached
      from
      reality
      and
      hazy
      but
      I
      liked
      the
      feeling.
      On
      lower
      doses
      I
      could
      stay
      awake
      a
      little
      longer
      but
      concentration
      was
      a
      no
      go.
      try
      not
      to
      fall
      asleep
      while
      walking
      ;)
      Also
      I #8217;m
      glad
      you
      opened
      up
      about
      your
      delusions.
      It #8217;s
      scary
      to
      admit
      to
      someone
      but
      hopefully
      you
      now
      get
      the
      treatment
      and
      help
      you
      need
      to
      be
      okay!

      Ive
      been
      doing
      it
      for
      11
      years.
      I
      can
      confirm
      it
      becomes
      a
      consuming
      addiction.
