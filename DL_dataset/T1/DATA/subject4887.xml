      Hey
      everyone!
      I #8217;m
      going
      to
      Ren
      Faire
      in
      August.
      Last
      year,
      I
      made
      my
      costume
      and
      it
      was
      okay,
      but
      this
      year
      I #8217;ve
      saved
      up
      some
      money
      so
      I
      can
      buy
      a
      higher
      quality
      costume.
      I
      plan
      to
      spend
      around
      $200
      or
      so.
      I
      totally
      understand
      that
      this
      will
      not
      get
      me
      the
      most
      elegant
      of
      costumes,
      but
      from
      what
      I #8217;ve
      seen,
      the
      costumes
      are
      this
      price
      seem
      decent.
      Other
      than
      Etsy,
      does
      anyone
      know
      any
      good
      websites
      to
      look
      for
      a
      costume/gown?
      I #8217;ve
      found
      a
      couple
      of
      costumes
      from
      medieval
      collector
      that
      I
      liked,
      but
      I #8217;m
      not
      sure
      if
      it #8217;s
      safe
      lol
      Thanks
      for
      your
      help!

      I
      just
      ended
      up
      buying
      a
      dress
      from
      another
      Etsy
      store.
      But
      I #8217;ll
      be
      sure
      to
      keep
      your
      info

      Overall,
      I
      think
      the
      plot
      is
      really
      good.
      If
      it
      didn't
      keep
      me
      engaged,
      I
      would've
      definitely
      have
      deleted
      the
      app
      awhile
      ago.
      However,
      I
      am
      finding
      chapter
      3
      a
      little
      slow
      in
      comparison
      to
      the
      previous
      chapters.
      Also,
      it's
      taken
      me
      months
      to
      get
      to
      where
      I
      am
      in
      the
      game
      despite
      playing
      daily.
      My
      facebook
      disconnected
      with
      the
      game
      once
      and
      reseted
      to
      the
      beginning.
      Luckily,
      I
      just
      logged
      into
      facebook
      again
      on
      the
      app
      and
      it
      had
      saved
      my
      data.
      If
      it
      didn't
      though,
      I
      don't
      think
      I
      would've
      wanted
      to
      start
      again
      because
      it
      takes
      soooo
      long
      to
      progress.
      Games
      that
      generally
      use
      the
      energy
      system
      are
      money
      pits
      and
      super
      slow.
      In
      order
      to
      keep
      playing,
      many
      people
      will
      spend
      a
      couple
      of
      dollars
      here
      and
      there
      to
      get
      more
      energy.
      Between
      classes,
      raising
      friendship
      levels,
      house
      cup,
      and
      the
      too
      cool
      for
      school
      events,
      I
      do
      feel
      like
      gems
      are
      much
      more
      accessible.
      I
      have
      spent
      gems
      on
      energy
      from
      time
      to
      time
      and
      have
      felt
      assured
      that
      I'll
      gain
      them
      back
      quickly.
      The
      clothing
      update
      was
      definitely
      one
      of
      the
      better
      updates.
      For
      the
      amount
      you've
      paid
      for
      the
      pet,
      I
      would
      appreciate
      a
      little
      more
      energy
      than
      just
      one
      energy
      point.
      Nonetheless,
      I
      think
      the
      updates
      are
      really
      just
      there
      to
      keep
      us
      engaged
      with
      the
      game.
      Especially
      because
      many
      are
      waiting
      for
      the
      next
      chapter
      to
      come
      up.
      The
      longer
      we
      have
      the
      app
      downloaded,
      the
      more
      likely
      we'll
      spend
      some
      sort
      of
      money
      on
      it.

      Am
      I
      the
      only
      one
      who
      gets
      events
      late?
      Even
      though
      I
      check
      in
      daily,
      I
      feel
      like
      when
      the
      event
      popped
      up
      for
      me,
      I
      only
      had
      5
      days
      and
      some
      odd
      amount
      of
      hours
      left
      when
      it
      was
      supposed
      to
      be
      7
      days?
      I
      have
      the
      app
      on
      automatic
      update
      on
      iOS,
      but
      I
      also
      often
      check
      into
      the
      App
      Store
      to
      make
      sure
      that
      there's
      not
      an
      update
      waiting
      to
      be
      installed
      despite.

      I
      ended
      up
      buying
      a
      red
      velvet
      and
      brocade
      dress
      from
      MajesticVelvets
      on
      Etsy.
      I
      thought
      it
      was
      super
      regal
      looking
      and
      I
      really
      liked
      that
      it
      came
      with
      sleeves.
      In
      comparison
      to
      some
      of
      the
      other
      more
      regal
      looking
      pieces
      on
      Etsy,
      I
      thought
      that
      the
      price
      seemed
      pretty
      fair
      even
      though
      it
      didn't
      come
      with
      a
      chemise
      and
      I
      had
      to
      pay
      a
      little
      extra
      for
      hemming
      and
      shipping.

      All
      of
      the
      above?
      I
      try
      to
      just
      write
      what
      comes
      to
      mind,
      but
      that's
      something
      that
      feels
      awkward.
      But
      at
      the
      same
      time
      I
      "edit"
      as
      I
      go,
      meaning,
      I
      go
      back
      and
      change
      things,
      add
      things,
      etc.
      However,
      if
      an
      idea,
      image,
      line
      a
      character
      speaks,
      or
      anything
      comes
      into
      my
      mind
      that
      I
      *really*
      want
      to
      incorporate
      in
      whatever
      I'm
      writing,
      whether
      or
      not
      it's
      time
      for
      that
      specific
      thing
      to
      occur,
      I
      hit
      the
      enter
      button
      and
      write
      it
      down.
      Then
      I
      go
      back
      and
      fill
      in
      the
      blanks,
      add
      things,
      take
      things
      out,
      and
      all
      of
      that
      blah.
      It's
      definitely
      all
      over
      the
      place.
      However,
      I
      do
      think
      the
      edit
      as
      you
      go
      method
      doesn't
      mean
      the
      piece
      is
      final.
      My
      pieces
      may
      be
      more
      put
      together
      than
      if
      I
      just
      straight
      up
      word
      vomited
      for
      a
      while,
      but
      they
      definitely
      need
      more
      editing.
      I
      tend
      to
      get
      caught
      up
      with
      minor,
      insignificant
      details
      and
      my
      grammar
      isn't
      fantastic
      at
      all
      times
      considering
      I'm
      normally
      half
      asleep
      while
      I
      write.
      Normally,
      I'll
      step
      away
      from
      the
      computer
      and
      come
      back
      to
      it
      later
      to
      then
      rehash
      it
      out
      and
      change
      anything
      I
      need
      to.

      be
      an
      issue,
      I
      think
      that
      anti-vaxers,
      in
      particular,
      have
      been
      sucked
      into
      thinking
      that
      doctors
      work
      for
      big
      pharma
      and
      are
      interested
      in
      their
      $$$
      more
      than
      the
      well-being
      of
      their
      children.
      If
      you,
      as
      a
      parent,
      mistrust
      doctors,
      you #8217;re
      naturally
      not
      going
      to
      take
      your
      child
      to
      a
      doctor.
      Instead
      you #8217;ll
      do
      the
      next
      best
      thing,
      you #8217;ll
      post
      your
      child #8217;s
      symptoms
      on
      Facebook.
      /s
      Also,
      because
      of
      social
      media
      platforms,
      it #8217;s
      become
      like
      a
      contest
      of
      who
      can
      be
      the
      best
      parent.
      By
      posting
      that
      they
      didn #8217;t
      vaccinate
      jimmy
      or
      used
      EOs
      on
      Johnny #8217;s
      rash
      instead
      of
      taking
      him
      to
      the
      doctor,
      these
      parents
      feel
      like
      they #8217;re
      proving
      that
      they #8217;re
      good
      parents.
      They
      need
      validation
      that
      they #8217;re
      doing
      the
      right
      thing
      for
      their
      child.
      And
      they #8217;ll
      get
      back
      positive
      feedback
      by
      other
      parents,
      who
      are
      just
      as
      delusional
      and
      naive,
      which
      fuel
      other
      attention-seeking,
      misinformed
      parents
      to
      then
      act
      in
      a
      similar
      manner.
      The
      scary
      part
      is
      that
      these
      people
      think
      they #8217;re
      doing
      good
      for
      their
      children
      and
      humanity.
      I
      honestly
      do
      think
      that
      you
      make
      a
      good
      point
      that
      expensive
      healthcare
      may
      fuel
      some
      to
      skip
      doctor #8217;s
      visits.
      But
      I
      truly
      think
      that
      misinformation
      that
      spreads
      too
      quickly
      is
      also
      a
      key
      player
      in
      this
      twisted
      fad

      I,
      too,
      was
      recently
      diagnosed.
      My
      mother #8217;s
      a
      dietitian,
      so
      with
      her
      help,
      I #8217;ve
      started
      to
      lose
      excess
      weight.
      These
      are
      just
      a
      few
      pointers
      that
      have
      helped
      me
      the
      most.
      Try
      to
      limit
      carbs,
      starches,
      and
      sugar
      intake
      and
      increase
      lean
      protein
      and
      veggies.
      You
      don #8217;t
      have
      to
      cut
      them
      out
      completely,
      but
      in
      moderation
      is
      best.
      If
      you
      eat
      the
      recommended
      portion
      size
      of
      any
      food,
      you
      should
      be
      okay.
      This
      may
      require
      you
      to
      measure
      out
      your
      food,
      but
      will
      prevent
      you
      from
      eating
      too
      much
      if
      you #8217;re
      anything
      like
      myself
      lol.
      I
      also
      try
      to
      substitute
      a
      lot
      of
      carbs
      for
      veggies.
      For
      example,
      if
      you
      like
      pasta,
      try
      zucchini
      noodles
      or
      a
      mix
      of
      zucchini
      noodles
      and
      pasta.
      A
      lot
      of
       #8220;healthy #8221;
      products,
      like
      protein
      bars,
      are
      filled
      with
      sugar.
      They #8217;re
      okay
      every
      once
      in
      a
      while,
      but
      if
      you #8217;re
      craving
      something
      sweet,
      it #8217;s
      better
      to
      grab
      a
      piece
      of
      fruit.
      Hard
      boiled
      eggs
      are
      one
      of
      my
      favorite
      go
      to
      snacks
      because
      they #8217;re
      filled
      with
      protein
      and
      are
      actually
      quite
      filling.
      Most
      importantly,
      try
      to
      eat
      three
      meals
      a
      day,
      especially
      breakfast.
      It #8217;ll
      jump
      start
      your
      metabolism
      and
      keep
      you
      more
      satisfied
      through
      out
      the
      day.
      Dizziness
      may
      come
      from
      low
      blood
      sugar.
      Eating
      smaller
      meals
      more
      often
      with
      some
      snacks
      may
      help
      you
      feel
      better.
      Drinking
      lots
      of
      water
      will
      help
      too!
      Hope
      this
      helps!

      I
      experienced
      something
      very
      similar
      before
      I
      was
      actively
      seeking
      treatment
      for
      my
      anxiety
      and
      depression.
      Now
      from
      a
      healthier
      POV,
      I
      know
      it #8217;s
      because
      my
      parents
      were
      in
      denial
      that
      I
      was
      mentally
      ill
      and
      feeling
      helpless
      that
      they
      couldn #8217;t
      do
      anything
      to
      make
      me
      feel
      better.
      My
      mom
      told
      me
      once
      that
      she
      honestly
      thought
      I
      was
      a
      just
      bitch
      and
      didn #8217;t
      realize
      that
      the
      reason
      I
      would
      lash
      out
      or
      isolate
      myself
      was
      due
      to
      my
      anxiety.
      I
      had
      my
      therapist
      explain
      what
      was
      going
      on
      to
      my
      parents,
      and
      that
      helped
      tremendously.
      My
      parents
      couldn #8217;t
      see
      past
      the
      negative
      stigmas
      associated
      with
      mental
      health.
      They
      needed
      to
      hear
      it
      from
      a
      medical
      professional
      in
      order
      to
      understand
      that
      this
      is
      something
      their
      daughter
      was
      impacted
      by
      and
      everything
      would
      be
      okay
      with
      the
      proper
      help.
      My
      parents
      are
      now
      my
      number
      one
      support
      system.
      And
      though
      sometimes
      they
      get
      frustrated
      with
      my
      depression
      and
      anxiety
      when
      I
      just
      can #8217;t
      seem
      to
      push
      past
      it,
      they
      understand
      that
      I #8217;m
      trying
      my
      best.
      They
      want
      to
      provide
      the
      best
      support
      they
      can
      in
      the
      moment,
      even
      if
      they
      don #8217;t
      know
      how
      to
      help.
      I #8217;m
      in
      no
      means
      justifying
      what
      your
      mom
      said,
      but
      just
      know
      that
      she
      might
      be
      lashing
      out
      because
      of
      her
      own
      sense
      of
      helplessness.
      It #8217;s
      hard
      to
      understand
      mental
      illness
      unless
      you
      know
      what
      it
      feels
      like,
      and
      even
      then,
      so
      many
      people
      are
      in
      denial
      because
      they #8217;re
      afraid
      of
      being
      misunderstood
      or
      afraid
      their
      children
      will
      be
      misunderstood.
      Keep
      fighting,
      OP.
      It
      does
      get
      better.
      Don #8217;t
      feel
      guilty
      that
      you
      feel
      the
      way
      you
      do,
      but
      also
      know
      that
      you #8217;re
      capable
      of
      so
      much
      more
      than
      you
      know.

      I
      like
      to
      tell
      my
      students
      that
      singing
      is
      a
      lot
      like
      running
      or
      any
      sport
      for
      that
      matter.
      If
      you
      want
      to
      run
      a
      far
      distance
      and
      well,
      it
      takes
      training
      and
      practice.
      You #8217;re
      not
      going
      to
      be
      able
      to
      run
      a
      marathon
      on
      the
      first
      day
      you
      start
      either.
      The
      fact
      of
      the
      matter
      is
      that
      it
      takes
      time,
      practice,
      and
      proper
      coordination
      of
      the
      muscles
      in
      order
      to
      be
      successful.
      Also,
      do
      NOT
      compare
      yourself
      to
      anyone!
      Everyone #8217;s
      voice
      is
      different
      and
      some
      people
      may
      catch
      on
      quicker
      than
      others.
      But
      that #8217;s
      okay.
      Hard
      work
      does
      and
      will
      pay
      off!
      A
      lesson
      teacher
      would
      be
      a
      great
      fit
      for
      you.
      It #8217;ll
      give
      you
      great
      foundation
      and
      provide
      exercises
      and
      things
      you
      can
      do
      to
      match
      pitch.
      A
      lot
      of
      time,
      singing
      is
      hard
      not
      because
      you
      can #8217;t
      hear
      the
      pitches,
      but
      you #8217;re
      having
      issues
      using
      the
      muscles
      to
      sing,
      and
      that #8217;s
      totally
      fixable.

      post,
      but
      I
      think
      I
      just
      need
      to
      get
      this
      out.
      My
      freshman
      year
      of
      college,
      I
      was
      diagnosed
      with
      anxiety
      and
      depression.
      I
      learned
      how
      to
      cope
      with
      it
      within
      the
      context
      of
      college
      and
      living
      on
      my
      own.
      Now
      that
      I've
      graduated
      and
      have
      moved
      back
      home,
      I
      feel
      like
      I'm
      back
      at
      square
      one.
      My
      parents
      try
      to
      be
      supportive,
      but
      they
      don't
      quite
      understand
      how
      I'm
      feeling
      or
      why
      I'm
      feeling
      the
      way
      I
      do.
      I
      haven't
      had
      this
      many
      bad
      days
      in
      a
      while.
      I'm
      unemployed
      and
      I
      have
      no
      idea
      what
      I
      want
      to
      do
      with
      my
      life.
      I
      graduated
      with
      a
      Music
      Performance
      degree
      for
      voice,
      and
      although
      my
      parents
      are
      super
      supportive
      of
      me
      going
      and
      auditioning
      for
      musicals
      and
      things,
      I
      can't
      shake
      the
      feeling
      that
      I'm
      not
      good
      enough.
      I've
      considered
      just
      getting
      an
      office
      job
      or
      any
      job
      for
      that
      matter,
      but
      I
      don't
      know
      what
      I
      really
      want
      versus
      what
      my
      depression
      is
      preventing
      me
      from
      doing.
      Right
      now,
      all
      I
      really
      want
      to
      do
      is
      sleep
      all
      day,
      spend
      time
      in
      my
      room,
      and
      not
      talk
      to
      anyone.
      If
      no
      one
      wakes
      me
      up,
      I
      can
      easily
      nap
      for
      4+
      hours
      and
      still
      feel
      exhausted.
      I
      only
      have
      one
      good
      friend
      who
      lives
      in
      the
      area.
      We
      hang
      out
      as
      much
      as
      we
      can,
      but
      she's
      often
      out
      of
      town
      to
      visit
      her
      boyfriend.
      My
      friends
      from
      college
      live
      pretty
      far
      away,
      and
      my
      boyfriend
      lives
      about
      two
      hours
      away.
      I
      try
      to
      see
      them
      when
      I
      can,
      but
      it's
      tough.
      Especially
      when
      I've
      convinced
      myself
      that
      no
      one
      wants
      to
      see
      or
      deal
      with
      me.
      My
      boyfriend
      is
      super
      supportive,
      and
      has
      been
      there
      since
      the
      beginning.
      We
      were
      only
      friends
      when
      I
      was
      first
      diagnosed
      early
      on
      in
      college
      so
      he's
      seen
      me
      hit
      rock
      bottom
      and
      pick
      myself
      up.
      It
      was
      nice
      that
      when
      we
      started
      dating
      5-6
      months
      ago,
      I
      didn't
      have
      to
      explain
      that
      I
      have
      depression
      and
      all
      that
      comes
      along
      with
      it.
      Every
      once
      in
      a
      while,
      I'd
      have
      bad
      days
      here
      and
      there.
      Sometimes
      he'd
      come
      up
      to
      see
      me
      (we
      were
      only
      an
      hour
      away
      when
      I
      was
      in
      college)
      or
      he'd
      call
      me.
      He's
      really
      good
      at
      making
      sure
      I
      get
      out
      of
      bed,
      reminds
      me
      that
      my
      depression
      will
      make
      me
      think
      things
      that
      aren't
      true,
      remind
      me
      of
      my
      worth,
      etc.
      He
      always
      makes
      me
      feel
      better.
      However,
      with
      me
      being
      home
      and
      without
      a
      set
      schedule,
      my
      depression
      seems
      to
      have
      spiraled
      out
      of
      control,
      and
      I
      absolutely
      hate
      having
      to
      put
      him
      through
      this
      and
      see
      me
      like
      this.
      I'm
      embarrassed
      when
      I
      break
      down
      over
      silly,
      stupid
      things
      like
      looking
      in
      the
      mirror
      and
      being
      so
      grossed
      out
      by
      the
      way
      I
      look.
      Even
      now,
      he
      says
      just
      because
      I
      have
      bad
      days
      I'm
      not
      a
      miserable
      person,
      but
      I'm
      genuinely
      terrified
      of
      losing
      him.
      He's
      more
      concerned
      about
      my
      well-being
      more
      than
      anything,
      but
      I've
      had
      relationships
      fizzle
      out
      because
      I've
      pushed
      people
      away
      and
      I've
      never
      loved
      anyone
      more
      than
      I
      love
      him.
      He's
      never
      made
      a
      comment
      about
      it
      bothering
      him,
      but
      it
      still
      terrifies
      me.
      I
      definitely
      feel
      like
      I
      don't
      deserve
      him.
      I
      see
      a
      therapist
      and
      a
      psychiatrist
      regularly,
      and
      in
      the
      past,
      I've
      been
      really
      good
      about
      independently
      dealing
      with
      my
      mental
      illness,
      but
      I
      can't
      shake
      feeling
      guilty
      and
      awful
      for
      depending
      on
      him
      when
      no
      one
      else
      is
      around.
      Sorry
      for
      the
      long
      post,
      but
      it
      did
      help
      a
      bit
      just
      to
      get
      it
      out.
      TL;DR:
      I
      graduated
      college
      with
      a
      music
      degree,
      moved
      back
      home,
      and
      don't
      have
      a
      job.
      I
      feel
      depressed
      and
      just
      want
      to
      sleep
      all
      day.
      My
      parents
      don't
      understand
      depression.
      My
      boyfriend
      is
      a
      saint,
      and
      I
      don't
      deserve
      him.

      First,
      Happy
      Cake
      Day!
      Second,
      don't
      be
      sorry
      for
      replying!
      It's
      somewhat
      relieving
      to
      know
      that
      you're
      not
      alone
      in
      feeling
      the
      way
      you
      do,
      especially
      when
      it
      seems
      like
      everyone
      you
      know
      doesn't
      experience
      that.
      When
      I
      was
      younger,
      summer
      months
      were
      definitely
      the
      hardest.
      It's
      easy
      to
      isolate
      yourself
      when
      no
      one's
      going
      out
      of
      their
      way
      to
      make
      plans
      with
      you.

      Just
      know
      that
      you
      probably
      have
      more
      people
      on
      your
      side
      than
      you
      think.
      Depression
      makes
      it
      easy
      to
      isolate
      ourselves,
      think
      everyone
      hates
      us,
      and
      think
      that
      we're
      bothering
      others.
      I'm
      not
      sure
      that
      helps
      any,
      but
      keep
      pushing.
      It
      will
      get
      better,
      and
      don't
      forget
      that
      you
      do
      deserve
      to
      be
      happy
      and
      confident
      with
      yourself.

      Haha
      thanks!
      I
      really
      liked
      it
      too!
      I
      actually
      ended
      up
      buying
      the
      costume
      because
      I
      am
      in
      no
      way
      talented
      enough
      to
      sew
      that,
      but
      the
      crown
      was
      something
      I
      found
      separately
