<TEXT> Imagine Alabama, Ohio State, Oklahoma and Clemson winning out. They would be four really strong conference champions, two of them with only one loss. It's not impossible for the committee to put them in the playoff and leave Notre Dame out.

I'm not saying it would be the right thing to do, but there is a possibility.

 nbsp;

I just simulated this scenario. When all five win out, Clemson and Alabama have 99%, Oklahoma has 70%, Ohio State 68% and Notre Dame 56%.

If Michigan win out instead of Ohio State, Notre Dame's chances go to 81%. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If Michigan, Notre Dame, Alabama, Oklahoma and Clemson win out, the Wolverines will have only a 28% chance of making the playoffs. With the same teams winning out but Notre Dame losing to Northwestern next week, Michigan's chances rise to 87%, which is nice, but there would be a 1 in 8 chance of them missing the playoffs in this situation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He praised the brazilian dictatorship, and I don't agree with that. He is far from being the perfect candidate, but he is better than Haddad. PT supported dictatorships as well, such as the Cuban, Venezuelan, the one from Equatorial Guinea and many other left-wing dictatorships around the world.

And if we compare them on the subjects that matter the most, he's way better than Haddad.

I receive Patrik Laine (RW) and Matt Murray (G)


Scoring is:

Goals (4)

Assists (2)

PIM (0.5)

SOG (0.4)

PPG (1.5)

PPA (1)

HIT (0.2)

BLK (0.4)

For goalies we have:

GS (1)

W (3)

L (-3)

OTL (-1.5)

GA (-3)

SV (0.4)

Every team (16 teams in the league) has to roster 2 goalies. My other one right now is Raanta.

Is the downgrade from Kane to Laine worth the upgrade from Jimmy Howard to Matt Murray? </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's different because you actively tried to hurt someone.

I don't support driving under influence, I don't think he's right, I just think that it shouldn't be a crime since he didn't cause harm to anyone else.

It's the same logic for fining people for not wearing a seat belt. If nobody else is harmed by your actions, if you're not violating their rights (life, liberty and property), there's no crime.

If you drive without paying attention or really tired you also increase the chances of an accident happening, but in this situation you won't be punished unless you actually cause an accident.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Footballers are being paid to generate profit for their employers. If there's nothing in their contracts that says that the team couldn't play official games outside Spain then they haven't any reason to complain.

And it's not like the team is relocating, it's just a couple games that will make the team more money than if they played it in Spain. It also may increase the popularity of the league, bringing more lucrative deals for the teams, and maybe higher salaries for the players.

The most supported team here in Brazil, Flamengo, plays a lot of their home games in other states, some of them more than 2000 miles away from Rio, because they have supporters in other places or because some cities don't have teams in the first division. Those games are amongst the most lucrative for the team.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, first time playing FPL here.  


Changed De Bruyne for Bernardo Silva today and now I have 2.5M in the bank. What do you recommend me to do next? I'm not planning on wildcarding this early but maybe I can do it if I have to make a lot of changes in my team.

Fabianski (Patrcio)  
Mendy, Bailly, Tomkins (Wan-Bissaka, Peltier)  
Salah, Eriksen, Bernardo Silva, Cairney (Hudson-Odoi)  
Aguero, Zaha, Arnautovic  


I was thinking about upgrading Tomkins to Robertson (1.5M) and Cairney to Richarlison (another 1.5M), not necessarily in the same GW. I'd have to find 0.5M elsewhere, probably downgrading Arnautovic or Patrcio, but I'm not sure about that.   


Would changing Tomkins for Lovren (when he's fit) instead of going for Robertson be better? That would leave me with 2M to upgrade one of my midfielders and 0.5M to invest elsewhere. </TEXT>

Fabianski - Patrcio  
Mendy - Bailly - Tomkins - AWB - Peltier  
Salah - Eriksen - De Bruyne - Cairney - Hudson-Odoi  
Aguero - Zaha - Arnautovic  


I'm thinking about downgrading one of Arnautovic/Zaha to a cheaper forward and Patrcio to Stekelenburg in order to upgrade from Tomkins to Robertson, but I'd need another 0.5M. Where else can I downgrade to find money to do that and is it worth it? Also, do you have another advice on how to improve my team? I'm going back and forth on switching Salah for Hazard or Aubameyang but I'm afraid that even with the 2-2.5M more in the bank it'll not be worth it.

<TEXT> First time playing, do you guys tend to plan your wildcards weeks in advance?  I'm not planning to use my wildcard until GW4-5 at least, but I was  looking at what I can do now.  

My current team is:  

Fabianski (Patrcio)  
Mendy, Bailly, Tomkins (Wan-Bissaka, Peltier)  
Salah, Eriksen, De Bruyne, Cairney (Hudson-Odoi)  
Aguero, Arnautovic and Zaha

I was thinking about these transfers:

Aguero - Aubameyang 0M

Cairney - Richarlison +1.5M

Eriksen - Alli -0.5M

Tomkins - Lovren +0.5M

Bailly - Robertson +0.5M

Patrcio - Stekelenburg -0.5M

Hudson-Odoi - Schneiderlin 0M

Salah - Hazard -2.5M

Fabianski - Ederson +1M  

This would leave me with:

Ederson (Stekelenburg)  
Mendy, Robertson, Lovren (Wan-Bissaka, Peltier)  
Eriksen, De Bruyne, Hazard, Richarlison (Schneiderlin or another 4.5M MID)  
Aubameyang, Arnautovic and Zaha  

I wouldn't like to lose Salah, but I feel that this team would be better overall.  

Any thoughts?   </TEXT>

<TEXT> We almost don't have guns here in Brazil. In 2005 we had a plebiscite to decide if the commercialization of firearms and ammunition should be banned. 65% voted No, but the government went ahead and banned it anyway.

If you're not a cop or a judge you won't be allowed to carry guns. In some extreme circunstances they might allow you to have one at home, like if you live in a farm constantly being robbed.

I don't have the data here, but I also suspect that the majority of these murders are drug-related. I live in Natal, the city with the fourth highest murder rate in the world, but I never saw someone being murdered in my neighborhood. On some of them, though, we see around 2 murders each day (900k people living here).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not comparing, I'm just saying something that bothers me a little bit. Every time that we have a lot of games going on at the same time it's almost impossible to find other threads because every single goal has its own, and if you come here after a game like Spain vs. Portugal, you have the game thread, the post-game thread and a thread for each of the six goals. Eight threads to discuss the same game seems a little too much for me.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It depends on your league settings. One thing that works well is to get projections from Steamer or ZiPS, put it in a spreadsheet and look how many points they'll make with a specific scoring system. It works well to find out overvalued and undervalued players, specially since most articles are about roto leagues. Players like Billy Hamilton aren't even on the top 150 in one of my leagues.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> if he wants to play ottoneau - thats a different concept and there are plenty of message boards out there to discuss ottoneau - but this board is for fantasy baseball 

Ottoneu is a type of scoring for fantasy baseball, so it is fantasy baseball. This board is for all kinds of fantasy baseball, not just for 5x5 roto. 

Same would apply for fantasy baseball - all these people want to include QS instead of wins? SO - a guy who pitches 5 2/3 IP with 0ER is less valuable than a guy who pitches 6.0 IP and gives up 3 ER? not to me. 


The problem here in this case is Earned Runs, not W or QS. 

Want to include HOLDS? why

Because pitching in the 9th isn't that much different than pitching in the 8th.


The best thing about OttoNeu is that it removes a lot of the randomness that exists in baseball. There's nothing more infuriating than losing because of bad luck, because of stuff like W-L, hits against your pitcher, RBIs and that stuff. OttoNeu is great because it rewards the ones who evaluate players better, make the best decisions and etc.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi /r/fasting

I discovered this sub three days ago and since sunday night I'm on a water fast. I'm feeling a little bit hungry but nothing that I can't handle, but I'm craving some pizza/pasta like I've never craved before.

 nbsp;

I'm 6'6" tall and 236lbs. My first goal is to lose 20lbs to get my BMI back to 25, but my long term goal is to lose 48lbs.

 nbsp;

Since I'm relatively new to this, I have a few question for you all:

 nbsp;

- I'm living alone but I go to my parents' home almost every weekend. I'm planning on doing 5-day fasts and eating normally on the weekends. If I don't overeat on the weekends, will my fast still be effective?

- Since I'm probably leave ketosis in the weekends, how long will it take for me to go back once I start fasting again on sunday night?

- Do I need to take some vitamins even if I'm eating on the weekends?

 nbsp;

Sorry if these questions are already answered somewhere. Thanks for your help and good luck to you all. </TEXT>

If you want to know if an action is acceptable to libertarians, ask yourself three questions: Is this action taking the life of someone innocent? Is this action restricting someone's freedom? Is this action violating private property? If you answered No to all three questions, then this action is acceptable.



Of course, sometimes you won't agree with some decisions that people make. I'm Jewish, and I'd be offended if someone refused to enter a restaurant because of it. I can boycott this place, tell everyone about what they're doing and so on, but I can't force them to provide me a service that they don't want. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Tolls may be more expensive, but they're fair. If you don't use it, you don't pay for it. I'm in favor of not forcing people to do what they don't want, even if more people stop receiving services from the government. 

The people who own the land will regulate it. Remember that in this hypothetical situation there's no public land, everything is owned by someone and they'll have to enter a contract to do something. The clauses will be decided between them.

 nbsp;

Here where I live this happens all the time and the law enforcement never does anything. But, since security is a service, the company that patrols the street where I was robbed would be responsible to indemnize me.

 There would be no government without taxes

<TEXT> A natural right is soemthing that you can have without violating the rights of others. I have the right to life because it's something that makes me a human being, and my right to life does not interfere with your right to life. I have the right to liberty because as a human being I'm free to pursue a goal that is in my interest, as long as this goal doesn't interfere with the rights of other people. I have the right to property because a property is an extension of my body, and therefore an extension of me. You can't take the result of my work without my consent because that would be slavery.

<TEXT> Think about it as a service that would be provided by private companies. About the roads, just privatize it. We already have a lot of private roads here, just expand it.

 nbsp;

If I mix my work with an unclaimed land, it is mine. If someone did it before me, it's theirs, and the only way I can get it is if the owner decides to give it to me or if I buy it.

 nbsp;

We need less regulations, not more. Deregulate the market and let private institutions regulate it. A private company can make certificates attesting the quality of a product. And some stuff don't need regulations, for example, if I want to hire my neighbor to represent me in court, I'm not allowed (at least here in Brazil). Why do the government have to decide who I can hire to represent me? If he does a bad job, I will be the only one that will suffer for it.

 nbsp;

If you want, you can still have a government responsible for national security and the judiciary system, but it would have to be funded by people who are willing to voluntarily give their money to the government, not forcing people to pay for it and threatening them if they don't pay.

 nbsp;

I have a question for you. Since theft is the act of taking someone's property without consent, threatening the victim if they don't comply, and taxation is when the government demands your money without your consent, threatening to arrest you if you don't comply and possibly killing you if you fight back, how is taxation not theft? You can argue that it has a use, that the society needs it and etc., but I don't see a way of defining taxation that doesn't include the definition of theft inside of it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, reducing taxes isn't enough, you also have to destroy those regulations that harm the free market.

My income is based on an agreement made between me and my employer, I'm selling my work to someone who is willing to pay me for it, and we agreed a price that is beneficial for both of us. Neither the government nor anybody else have to interfere in it. In my contract with my employee I didn't signed anything agreeing to be taxed, and I haven't signed anything for the taxes that I pay. We have "free" healthcare here in Brazil, but I have to pay for private healthcare if I want to have a good service. I'm not using the healthcare provided by the government, so why should I pay for it if I don't want it?

 nbsp;
 Taxes aren't doing shit for others, they are doing shit for the collective, for us all.

 nbsp;

The collective should never come before the individual. If I enter your house, steal your money and give it to the poor, helping hundreds of people, I'm still wrong. It doesn't matter how much people I help, stealing money from others is wrong.

 nbsp;

I'm assuming that you are portuguese. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmSf7Nq2ku4) sums up my beliefs about the social contract and why taxation is always theft (no exceptions).

Killing someone is not something you can do because you're violating the right to life of other people. Spending all your money in cocaine or other drug is ok, as long as you're not forcing anyone else to do drugs. If you want to screw your life, that's ok, because the natural rights of others aren't being violated.

All crimes are covered by those three rights (life, liberty and property). Anything that you do that doesn't violate those rights is totally ok (it doesn't necessarily mean that it's something good or anything). </TEXT>

We are a 20-team league with 50 players per team (at least 25 must be major leaguers). We use the OttoNeu Scoring System and you can give multi-year contracts to the players you want as long as you are under the cap.

<TEXT> The problem with unions is that, at least here in my country (Brazil), they have too much power. They can start strikes and the companies aren't allowed to fire the employees who don't want to work.



Minimum wage laws affect most the people who are currently unemployed. Since these people don't have enough skills to be worth 7 an hour, they won't get a job.



What is better for them, to work for less than the government minimum wage (their true value) or don't work at all? </TEXT>

People need to understand that the real minimum wage is 0, it's what those people who don't have enough skills to be worth the government minimum wage receive since they'll never justify being hired by someone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi!

I'm kinda new to hockey and I've been reading a lot about the sport lately. A few days ago I read something that said that faceoffs aren't nearly as important as people usually think they are, and that losing a faceoff in the offensive zone is better than winning on in your defensive zone.

Are there other examples of stuff like that that aren't true about the sport? In baseball we have a lot of them, I want to know if it's the same in hockey.

Thanks! </TEXT>

I was just offered Nicklas Backstrom for my Aleksander Barkov. Barkov was a better player per game in my league last season, but I'm a little worried with his durability. Also it looks like Backstrom will not play in the same line as Ovechkin, is that a big problem for him or I should ignore it?

It's a H2H Points league, scoring is:

Goals: 6

Assists: 3

+/-: 1.5

PIM: 0.5

PPG: 3

PPA: 1.5

SHG: 6

SHA: 3

GWG: 3

FOW: 0.25

FOL: -0.25

<TITLE> Rules </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-03-22 14:41:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi everyone. We will be using this thread to discuss the rules for our league this year.

 nbsp;

    1. Rosters

Each team should have a minimum of 25 and a maximum of 40 players at any given time. Of those players, a minimum of 25 player should be current major-leaguers, with the remaining 15 being either major or minor-league players. A minimum of $500.000 should be reserved to any free roster spots, which means an owner won't have an extra $7.5M if he decides to keep just 25 players.

 nbsp;

Each starting roster consists of:  
 nbsp;  
1 C  
1 1B  
1 2B  
1 3B  
3 OFs  
1 UTIL  
 nbsp;

5 SPs  
7 RPs

 nbsp;

    2. Scoring

We will be using the OttoNeu scoring system, which uses linear weights to better represent the true ability of a player. The scoring is as follows:

 nbsp;

Hitters:

* AB: -1.0
* H: 5.6
* 2B: 2.9
* 3B: 5.7
* HR: 9.4
* BB: 3.0
* HBP: 3.0
* SB: 1.9
* CS: -2.8

 nbsp;

Pitchers:

* IP: 5.0
* K: 2.0
* BB: -3.0
* HBP: -3.0
* HR: -13.0
* SV: 5.0
* HD: 4.0

 nbsp;

    
    3. Drafts

Our first draft will be an auction draft in order to fill our teams. Owners will have a $200M budget to select the players they want, and the winning bid will be the player's salary for the year. In the first year, nomination order will be random, in the following years the previous season's reverse order of finish will be used. Players can have their contracts extended (more on that later). In June we'll have an amateur draft for the players that weren't on the player pool to start the year. In the first year the draft order will be random, starting in 2017 the draft order will be determined by position on the standings on the previous year (last team picking first and so on).

 nbsp;
    
    4. Contracts

After the draft, owners will be able to extend up to seven players to a 3-year contract and another seven to a 2-year contract. Players' salaries will increase $2M in their second year and $3M in the third year. Players in a 1-year contract can also be resigned for $4M more. If a player is in a 3-year contract (let's suppose it's $10M, $12M and $15M). At the end of the season, he'll have two years left in his contract, but you can already extend him to one more, so after the $15M season his salary would be $18M. Information about minor league contracts in section 9.

    5. Offseason
There will be a period for owners to decide who they want to extend and who they'll cut. All decisions must be made until a week before the free agent auctions begin, otherwise all players not signed will become free agents.

 nbsp;


Cutting players with active deals in the offseason will result in a cap penalty of 20% of their salary in that year. Using the $10M player in a three-year deal as an example, if you cut him after the first year, you'll have a $2.4M penalty for the following year and a $3M penalty for the other year. 

 nbsp;

In a date yet to be determined, the free-agent auctions will begin. Using the reverse standings order, owners will nominate players they want and a 48-hour auction will begin. More than one auction can happen at the same time to ensure the process will be over in time to start the season, probably with an interval of time between their starts. Owners can also submit a maximum bid if they can't be online at the end of the auction (for example, if I want to go to a maximum of $10M in a player whose current bid is $6M, I can bid $6.5M and set the maximum at $10M. If nobody overbid me, I get him for $6.5M, if other people bid on him I can try to beat their offers even if I'm not online. They'll also be allowed to submit conditional bids. In the case above, you can submit a bid of $12M to a player whose auction ends after the first one, and add an instruction like "bid on him only if I don't get the first player".

 nbsp;

There will also be a vote-off in the league. The vote-off system gives each team in the league the ability to vote on a player on each other team. Whichever player receives the most votes collectively is turned into a restricted free agent that can be bid on by other teams during an auction. The team they were voted off from will get an automatic $2.5M discount towards that player, so if they get the player back, they will get the player for $2.5 under what they bid. Players who have been voted into restricted free agency cannot be traded.

    6. Trades

Trades are allowed from the end of the auction draft until the MLB trade deadline. After the conclusion of the season, owners will be able to trade players who are still under contract, and trade players after they re-sign them. 

 nbsp;

Vetoes will only happen if a clear case of collusion happens, something like an owner trading Clayton Kershaw for Kyle Kendrick with them having the same contract or something like that. Keep in mind that different people have different opinions on if a trade is good or not, and that bad trades are different than malicious trades.

    7. Rosters (in-season)

Rosters can be changed everyday. There will be a 162 game maximum for all positional player positions and a 1500 inning maximum limit for pitchers.

 nbsp;


If a player is on the 60 day DL, an additional player can be added to the roster. However, the injured player still counts against the salary cap, and cap penalties will be enforced as normal for any transactions brought about by the player coming off the DL. There is no 15 day DL.

    8. Adding and dropping players

If you wish to add a player to your roster, you must start an auction for the player, and bidding will end 48 hours after the start of the auction.

 nbsp;

If you drop a player, other owners will have 24 hours to claim the player for his current salary. If that happens, no penalty cap is applied. Otherwise, there will be a penalty of 50% of his salary for the year, plus the 20% penalty already described for the following years. Owners cannot nominate players they dropped until the end of the season. After the 24-hour period ends, other owners can nominate the player for an auction.

 nbsp;

If a team changes ownership mid-season, the new owner will be allowed to make penalty-free cuts.

    9. Minor league players

Minor league players will have a base salary of $500,000 and will not be subject to salary increase until they're called up. If they're sent down again they can be resigned for $500,000 more. After they reach 50 ML innings or 130 AB, they're resigned for $1M more and treated like full-time major leaguers even if they're sent down again. Minor leaguers who are selected for more than $500,000 in the auction will still count as a salary of $500,000, and the remaining amount will be considered a "signing bonus" just in the first year.

 nbsp;

For example: Let's suppose you draft player X. He'll have a $500,000 salary in his first season. If he isn't called up this season, you can keep him in your roster for the same $500,000. In his second season, let's suppose he's called up but doesn't reach 50 ML innings or 130 AB. His salary will increase to $1M for the third season. In his third season, he breaks the innings/AB limit. For the fourth season, you'll have the option to resign him again for $1M more, making his salary $2M, and will have to offer him a Major League Contract. If you want him just for one year, his salary will be $2M with the option to resign him for $6M in the following season. You can also give him a 2 or 3-year contract, in which his salaries would be $2M, $4M and $7M.

<TEXT> I always had problems to sleep, but in the last two months it's getting worse day after day. I usually had only 5 hours of sleep a day and felt good, but recently I just can't sleep no matter how tired I am or how many hours of sleep I had the other night.

Last night I couldn't sleep at all, so I went to class and felt ok in the morning. Slept for 90 minutes in the afternoon and felt really tired later, which was expected. Now I'm trying to sleep for more than two hours and I'm about to give up again. I'm feeling really tired and can't even keep my eyes fully opened while I'm typing, but when I close my eyes I just can't fell asleep. Last week I had less than two hours of sleep for three days in a row.

Does anyone here has some advice on how to deal with this problem or has experienced it too? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know about depression but sometimes I don't do some stuff for fear of something. It's an irrational fear, I know it but isn't easy to convince myself of that

It isn't exactly a lack of motivation. I WANT to do stuff, I just can't. I'm usually planning on doing a lot of stuff but I just give up for some reason. Right now there is a job that is perfect for me, a good pay and is something I love to do. Also there is almost nobody else where I live who can/want this job, so I basically need to just send my rsum and I have a good chance of getting this job. I'm telling myself since last Thursday that I'm sending it later, and later I say tomorrow and it goes on and on. 

So basically, at least for me, it doesn't lead to lack of motivation but it makes me procrastinate and give up on a lot of stuff.

About depression I think other people will be able to give you a better answer, but I've seen a lot of people with both depression and anxiety so I guess that maybe there are a relation between the two. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have to wake up relatively early to go to the university (I live ~ 35mi from campus) and recently I'm not getting more than 3-4 hours of sleep a day. I noticed that I'm having more anxiety crisis recently, but I'm going through some other stuff so I don't know if my sleep has anything to do with it.

Does sleeping more and at the same time everyday help you in some way? Also, how do you do to sleep at the right time? Last night I went to bed at 10 PM but picked up my phone five minutes later and stayed up until 1:15 AM. Also, in the weekends when I can sleep some more I usually stay up until 4 or 5 AM and then sleep until 10. In those days I usually feel lazier and don't want to do anything the whole day.

Do you have any tips or experiences you want to share? </TEXT>

I like how a lot of people there almost kill themselves studying while in college, even the ones considered lazy.

There was an event from a local church in my apartment building when I was a freshman at college and they all seemed to be having a lot of fun. I'm not American and I didn't had a lot of friends at the time, so I joined them and they let me play games with them and I ended up making a few friends there.

I'm sure they'd treat me the same if I had approached them without lying, but at the time I was afraid and after that I was too embarrassed to tell them the truth. Good thing is I just said that to a older couple there, so most of the people I met that day don't know this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Markakis never drops any easy flyball, but isn't very good chasing balls and avoiding hits. Errors are not a good way to evaluate a defender. Andrelton Simmons is the best defensive SS in the league, but he has more errors than a lot of other SS just because his range allows him to get to more balls. If you can't reach a ball because of lack of range or bad positioning, you won't be charged with an error, but you're still harming your team's chances to win. </TEXT>

About the pitchers, if you're talking about players with SP elegibility, the best available are Roberto Osuna, Juan Nicasio and Brandon Maurer. If you're talking about players who are really starting... Eddie Butler, John Danks and Tyler Matzek.

With 25 players per roster + 4 DL spots, almost everybody useful is owned right now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My H2H points league has a scoring system quite similar to yours. I think going with the best pitchers early may give you an advantage.

<TEXT> In your league, Kershaw would make around 470 points, while there would be 5 hitters making more points than him.

What you could (and should) do is go to FanGraphs, get their projections, put them into Excel as pmreddick suggested and just add another column in the end called "Points", and then you can calculate how much points each player would give you and compare them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks!

Last year Kershaw had 854 points, and the best batter, Victor Martinez, just 611. 

There are no innings or GS limit. I was thinking about drafting just 6 good pitchers and use my 5 matchup acquisitions each week to get 5 different pitchers and try to win by quantity.

About the batters, should I trust my spreadsheet with Steamer projections more than the ESPN ADPs? I have players like Alonso, Odor, Hosmer and Semien who would, theoretically, give me a good amount of points and I could use a late-round pick to draft them, but ESPN ranks them much lower than I have. </TEXT>

<TITLE> 20-team H2H points league, any advices? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-03-08 06:38:17 </DATE>

<TEXT> Hi, guys.

I'm in a 20-team H2H points league (12 to the playoffs, bottom 6 relegated to the second division (we have three divisions with 20 teams each)) and I would like to ask for a few advices if you don't mind.

Scoring:
Pitchers: W = 6, L = -6, SV = 6. BS = -6, HLD = 3, IP = 3, H = -1, ER = -2, HR = -1, K = 1, BB = -1, HB = -2, QS = 3, CG = 7, Shutout = 15

Hitters: HR = 1, BB = 1, R = 1, RBI = 1, TB = 1, HBP = 1, K = -1, SB = 2, CS = -1, IBB = 1, SAC = 1.

Roster is: 1 C, 1 1B, 1 2B, 1 3B, 1 SS, 3 OF, 1 UTIL, 7 SP, 3 RP and 6 bench spots.

I know it is a weird setup, but I couldn't convince the other members to change it.

I made an excel spreadsheet using Steamer projections and calculated the replacement level for each position, but I have a few questions about it. 

1- Since we start 7 SP, should the replacement level be the 141st SP? I tried it but it inflates the value of SPs a lot.

2- How much should I take those projections into consideration? Some players are ranked by ESPN much lower than I have, does that means that I should reach them?

3- Do you have any other advices you'd like to share?

Thanks! </TEXT>

And for goalies:
Games started: 2
