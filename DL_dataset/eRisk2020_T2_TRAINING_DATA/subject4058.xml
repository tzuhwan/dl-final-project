The fact that every parliament in the world has problems irrespective of voting system is NOT important here.

The fact is that politicians reflect the "Will of the People" in the own way and will never change. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The rise in the Far right has more to do with economic conditions and the internet than the left.

I never mentioned Joe Rogan, why keep bringing him up.

The reason I called you Far right is because you dislike people insulting Far Right speaker, try to force the conversation away from the issue and think everyone opposed to you is a far left "SJW".

I have no problem with people debating each other.

I do have a problem with people trying to downplay what the believe. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So if the Far Left are bad it is ok that the Far Right are. 

I am no friend of Far left idiots.

The working class have not abandoned Labour, just the old people who can't move with the times.

Defending Far Right idiots is not something from the centre. Nobody who holds liberal, open minded ideas looks at these bunch of muppets and thinks that is a cause worth fighting for. The Far Right breeds loser,s angry failures with nothing going from them, because thses people are easily controlled.

I am not calling for these people to be silenced, just let the spotlight hit them. These people should not be able to pretend it's "bantz" or a free speech issue. The Far Right hates any close look as it shows them as the clowns they are.

I have clicked on a link that was about a slightly right wing topic and then recommended videos up the ante. 

Now you can see this from other political groups, but not to the same extent. There is a clear propaganda effort in many countries to normalise far right views. </TEXT>

The conspiracy seems to be a lot of these people are the same as before the overthrow several years ago. It seems that democracy there could still be under threat from people in the shadows.

<TEXT> The calls of beware ww3 always make me laugh.

Russia cannot go to war. The country doesn't have the access to financial markets and an export driven economy. They have an army of conscripts, where anybody who can avoids going. Add to masive corruption in the system. They cannot take on the west.

The idea seems to be let Putin do what he wants or he will get angry and destroy the world. </TEXT>

Germany declared war three times. Against the western allies in 39, agains the soviet union  in summer 41 and finally against the USA in winter 41.

<TEXT> I find this Sub's attitude to this word funny.

Why are people getting so bent out of shape about this?

I called my manager a few years ago a gammon, mainly because he had a very round pink head. He was not amused, but did not find it racist.

People are complaining about insults, but they need to speak to people in real life. You will hear far worse than this about other groups.

If being called a gammon will change their mind on a who they are going to vote for, they are a simple minded fool and any party should not be trying to get their votes.

Why would you want to be beholden to the simple minded, afraid to take difficult challenges because of the fact your base is thick and can't comprehend issues?

<TEXT> Another good part from that text.

But unfortunately the truth about atrocities is far worse than that they are lied about and made into propaganda. The truth is that they happen. The fact often adduced as a reason for scepticism  that the same horror stories come up in war after war  merely makes it rather more likely that these stories are true. Evidently they are widespread fantasies, and war provides an opportunity of putting them into practice. Also, although it has ceased to be fashionable to say so, there is little question that what one may roughly call the whites commit far more and worse atrocities than the reds. There is not the slightest doubt, for instance, about the behaviour of the Japanese in China. Nor is there much doubt about the long tale of Fascist outrages during the last ten years in Europe. The volume of testimony is enormous, and a respectable proportion of it comes from the German press and radio. These things really happened, that is the thing to keep ones eye on. They happened even though Lord Halifax said they happened. The raping and butchering in Chinese cities, the tortures in the cellars of the Gestapo, the elderly Jewish professors flung into cesspools, the machine-gunning of refugees along the Spanish roads  they all happened, and they did not happen any the less because the Daily Telegraph has suddenly found out about them when it is five years too late.

<TEXT> Another good passage.

I have little direct evidence about the atrocities in the Spanish Civil War. I know that some were committed by the Republicans, and far more (they are still continuing) by the Fascists. But what impressed me then, and has impressed me ever since, is that atrocities are believed in or disbelieved in solely on grounds of political predilection. Everyone believes in the atrocities of the enemy and disbelieves in those of his own side, without ever bothering to examine the evidence. Recently I drew up a table of atrocities during the period between 1918 and the present; there was never a year when atrocities were not occurring somewhere or other, and there was hardly a single case when the Left and the Right believed in the same stories simultaneously. And stranger yet, at any moment the situation can suddenly reverse itself and yesterdays proved-to-the-hilt atrocity story can become a ridiculous lie, merely because the political landscape has changed. </TEXT>

Top Minds of Reddit is a sub that laughs and mocks Racist idiots.

Yesterday we had a post about Hitler's birthday and what a good man he was and lots of comments supportting him.

Now if we combine this; a civil rights group, a sub which mocks racists and this sub which devolves into far right propaganda far to often.

<TEXT> Yes they were.

They had a lot of freedom to do what they wanted, but they were on the same side.

The Germans used their naval bases, airstrips and had an SS division running around in the north, which was trained by the Finns. The Germans also gave the Finns armoured vehicles, guns and supplies.

The Finns were attacked by the Soviets twiceduring this period, but to say they weren't on the side of the Nazis is strecthing the truth. There seems to be a lot misinformation taught in Finnish schools, some of the comments above indicate the west left Finland isolated  and without help. I guess the volunteers from across Europe did not exist or the planes the Finns flew were not from the west. Or that the French and British didn't have an expeditionary force ready to go until Norway and Sweden said no (quite rightly to, the allies wanted to seize iron mines in Sweden) or that a bombing mission was planned against Baku.

Sorry for the rant. </TEXT>

Have you ever lived in Russia? 

The military is an army of conscripts and most people avoid it if they can, corruption is epidemic and equipment is decades behind the west. 

China has no love of Russia and still look at the far east as an easy conquest and would have no problem with capturing it. Most Russian people I speak to are far more worried about China than the west.

Putin cares only about himself he has no love from the Russian people. Russians are angry at the corruption they see in their everyday life, the polltuion around them and image which is portrayed to the world.

His "high popularity"? I guess he didn't he cheat in the last election then? I loved the ballon gag the best.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ayglwqw_fo

Syria is a quagmire and Russia is trapped at the moment. They are  pushing back the rebels, but victory is far away and it could drag on for years.

USA to the rescue?

America sends troops in, the Russians pull out and now America is fighting an endless war and spending money.

Russia is free, Trump gets to be anti-Russian, Israel gets to have more protection and influence its' neighbours. Everybody is a winner.( Apart from you, the taxpayer and the civilians just trying to live their lives in peace.)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The thing is you will read lots of Historians saying it was impossible or people spouting or sorts of magic statistics.

But wars are not won on hindsight or numbers, they are won on the battlefield and in the political will of leaders.  

Now lets look at how victory was possible. Two main things needed to happen.

1 The British Government needed to surrender.

2 The USSR needed to be vanquished.

If both these things had happened the war would have ended. The US could not have hoped to beat Japan and Landed forces in Germany by itself. The continual defence of Britain and Russia stopped the Germans and allowed the Allies to roll them back.

So where these two things possible?

The short answer is yes.

But lets look at the big answer. In 1940 the German army faced a force which had roughly equal numbers of troops, more gun,  more tanks and a far better strategic situation. It did have a superiority in a couple of factors, in the air and the use of its' panzers as an strategic force. The allies were dug in, had better tanks and in many cases better troops than the Germans. On paper it was impossible for the Germans to win, but they did. They won and spectacularly so. How did they do it? They had a far better plan and reluctant governments  in Belgium and Holland. 

This is a good example of what was possible in WW2.

So lets look at if the British government could have surrendered. The royal navy protected its shore and made Operation Sealion a pipe dream in many ways, but continually pressure around the world did wear the government down. If Britain had fallen Operation Overlord would never had happened, fresh troops would be free to be sent to the east and factories could produce larger numbers of armaments to fight on.

But the second point is where the war would be won or lost. The Germans deployed most men to the east and lost most men killed there. This was the place where they would have to win and gain victory. Operation Barbarossa caused the Red Army 5 million casualties and even the "endless hordes" as people sometimes try to paint the Russians as, could not take these losses for ever. The Soviet forces Mobilized 35 million men and lost a seventh in the first six months of the war. 

People will say the war was lost when Moscow was not taken in 1941 and the Germans were doomed to be defeated, but this doesn't hold much water. If the German had repeated this success in 1942 they would have been able to keep fighting much longer. Again the Germans had beaten a force much better on paper. So what happened to stop this? Many things the number of armoured forces on the Eastern Front weakened in 1942, many panzer divisions sat around and didn't take part in offensives. The Russian fought harder and didn't lose as many men on the battlefield or in encirclements. The Germans had to keep so many divisions in the West, which meant they were relying on Axis troops to fill in gaps in the line.

Stalingrad was a big defeat and a great Soviet success, but it again didn't doom the Germans. Production of tanks and the numbers of men on the Eastern front increased after it. In 1943 the Germans again could go on the offensive, but the Russians were prepared and after Kursk pushed the Germans back to Germany.  

The fact is as long German could keep winning victories, they could keep winning the war.

We have a Facist group which likes Putin, because why not? They look at a land where truth and freedom are restrained as a good thing.

I have to admit that I am confused why the five star movement want anything to do with Russia. It seems they fall into the same anti Eu pro Russia trap many others do. 

They does seem to be a pattern here though. Any govenment which likes Putin is weak, corrupt and filled with idiots. </TEXT>

I don't support Brexit in any way, but the government seems to be delaying the exit until the majority of people who voted for it are dead and then will cancel it.

It has been two years already and it has not happened and it never will. The government should be honest with Brexiteers and move on with running the country.

This is term created and used by a political group to separate and divide people. It makes people seem like they are n the fringes for disagreeing with media companies.

Why not use a term like Corporate Controlled Media?

It shows the difference between the people and the elite and doesn't make us look like fringe lunatics.  </TEXT>

This article is a good start.

The only country I have been to where people have no trust in what their government says, is Russia ironically.

They believe nothing and question everything. It may sound great, but what you have is an uninformed zombiefied mass of people.

I don't doubt that other countries are on here, but they seem smarter than the Kremlin trolls, who talk such bollocks, that they are clear to spot.

Cheers for a good post in response. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What a difference a month makes. Corbyn goes from dodgy commie traitor, to herald of peace. 

I don't want to become a total paranoid, shouting at the shadows, but there seems to be a connection. Putin, this man seems to be a central figure to so many. Not his actions really, but what he seems to represent.

Hitchens here seems to have completely lost the plot. Nato is bad, nobody knows anything abut Russia and Libya is worse than Syria.

I don't think Hitchens is a Russian Agent, he is an arrogant man who likes to be right and here is an argument where he feels he can make himself seem righteous.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Two jump to mind straight away.

Marinus van der Lubbe.

This Dutch man was a fantasist, who was framed for burning down the reichstag in 1933. He was picked due to his low intelligence and links with communist organisations. The nazis used this to consolidate power and establish a dictatorship.

Leonid Nikolaev

Another patsy this one was a malnourished angry ex communist. Jobless and angry against the world, he was picked to kill one of the most powerful me in the USSR. In 1934 he shot Sergey Kirov head of the communist organisation in Leningrad.

<TEXT> It is annoying that he is destroying Britain's future by keeping the tories in power.

The fact is Cobryn has never said anything bad about Putin. I looked it up last year and there were vague statements, but no real criticism. I don't mind if he meets with groups, who I don't like, but The Kremlin is another matter indeed.

Hopefully they can knock some sense in him soon.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Unfortunately it is not true, although it does always seem to come up in topics.

The soviets had just smashed Manchuria, but a landing was out of the question.

The US and UK had completed multiple landings and knew it would be a bloodbath even with all the right equipment and experience.

The USSR had no equipment or experience and they way of fighting would not have worked in a naval landing. 

This idea seems to have come out of Russia and reflects their view of the world.  </TEXT>

Farming is not econimcally viable anymore, it only exists due to massive subsides.

The government uses that money to cover the costs of Brexit and invest in the country.

<TEXT> A real answer versus what some have written here.

The soviets lost huge numbers of men in 1941. Millions of dead and captured. The equipment was bad, the tactics were dreadful and the strategy was suicidal.

After this it improved, but the soviets lost more men the Germans in every battle. Why? They had bad tactics, the men were badly trained and equipment was in short supply and not up to quality in a lot of cases. The strategic situation had improved though. Men were dying in droves, but the war was being won.

The tories planned the miners strike and the destruction of industry, because it would help them politically. The average guy on the street was happy because he got a dirt cheap house under buy to let.

Black Wednesday was caused by stupid economic policy. Can't blame labour on this one. </TEXT>

Like many of the things in your list list they happened to a small percentage of people, so I didn't think they were relevant.

The miners strike, the de-industrialization of the north and black Wednesday were caused by tory politicians, voted for by a generation of "where is my share" 

The winter of discontent was caused by workers of a generation of "where is my share".

I think you demonstrated my point by knowing a lot of events, but not really understanding what caused them or their effects. </TEXT>

The fact is the tories will have to stick with May, because they can avoid risking the collapse of the government. She is totally useless, but the other choice will either fragment the party and lead to an idiot running the country. </TEXT>

<TEXT> An upvote for making a good measured argument.

Now lets have a look a your points.

Record manufacturing output. This is true. The value of output is higher than ever. Part of a trend which has lasted for well over a hundred years. The weakening of the pound has helped this, but the effects will be balanced out once costs adjust.

New Infrastructure projects. Can you be a bit more specific on this? 

Record Low Levels of Unemployment. The figures have never been fiddled this much before. Any unemployment figures for a long time are not accurate and this only gets worse over time. The figures the government release are worthless.

No sign of exodus. In every single financial business has a plan of how to leave. Not all of them will of course, but to say there are no signs is digging your head in the sand.

The economy has "kept pace" this is buzzword that doesn't actually mean anything. The economy has grown that is true.

Of course of countries want deals. They want their goods here. We don't have much clout with the major players to be honest and we are not going to get amazing deals.

The "CANZUK" Union. It may be popular here, but it will never be accepted by other countries. They have very strict rules on immigration and aren't going to like being flooded by us.

Due you have any figures for increase in wages and what sectors? I have seen nothing about this. </TEXT>

Has this sub been hijacked by a government power or am I just being paranoid?

<TEXT> The reasons for holding another referendum;

1 "The will of the people" This stupid term has been thrown about constantly since the referendum. This is a choice made by the people and at the end of negotiations the people should be able to speak again. If we had voted to stay and the EU changed the goalposts we should have had another referendum.

2 The average leaver will not be happy with what they are getting. There will be lots of this deal they dislike and the should have the choice to balance the benefits in their eyes.

3 If remain had won Farage would have kept piping on for years. This issue will continue to be open for years.

4 Leave know that people have cottoned on to the lies they were sold and are scared about the result. If you are silencing somebody then you are afraid of what they are saying.

5 The choice by brexiteers to devolve into children is awful. "best of three" or "when do we stop" and other stupid remarks. I am not sure remain would win an referendum, but the issue should be up for debate among the British people, not decided in some backroom. </TEXT>

1 Oh my god the germans are invading Europe again. The army would be European it can't go around forcing people to integrate. The army would exist to make Putin wet his pants.

2 While I don't want us to join the Euro, it is not failing by any standard and with Trump in the white house could become a very important currency. The Euro does benefit Germany over other countries, but it does not fuck over the south.

3 Right now we are being ruled over by the most incompetent, useless and untrustworthy bunch of crooks we have had in a long time. How is this different from a democratic European Parliament?

The problem was people tried to silence Farage and UKIP. If you stop someone from speaking it means you are scared of what they are saying.

Brexit seems to be a rebellion into nothingness. People don't like how it works now and will through it all away for something new good or bad. </TEXT>

This problem has always existed in Russia, but it was the same in so many countries which have changed.

Russian people do have a lot of "Old fashioned" view, but aren't so different from you or I. The reason modernism doesn't exist in Russia is because Putin has hindered it. </TEXT>

He became mayor of St Petersburg and then President bacuse people thought he was a Yes man. He didn't get it through guile or intellect.Once he became president he turned on some of his backers and crushed his opponents. He has let the country stagnate and corruption flourish.

I am working class, but I understand why politicians ignore a lot of people. There are huge number of working class people who are thick. They don't understand how life works or the affect of their actions.

Saying that, there huge numbers of stupid middle class people. They barely understand the world, but they integrate and are involved with others which rubs off on them.

Most people on both sides didn't not have a clue what they were voting for. But if Brexit is as bad as I imagine, it will be the folks at the bottom who will pay the price again. </TEXT>

Their solution is to make Britain a tax haven. The whole piece seems to be making the case that these poor innocent bankers have their money trapped abroad and just want to bring it back and invest it. The more is there because of a scam 1 trillion pounds stolen from the people of the UK.

I have a better idea. Tax all money going to tax havens at a flat 5% goodbye deficit.

The fact is we need more people to go Uni, because there are so few other jobs for people. Manufacturing and industry have declined. The government can afford this cost and would benefit from paying it. The reason it doesn't is because it would not benefit this generation of old people.

The voters in the 70s and 80s should have complained or done something to make sure the money was saved. They didn't, nor did they have lots of children so it would be paid for by this. They knew they were a large generation, but didn't care enough to think about the pensions.

I am not one of those people saying cull the old. But they should pay for their mistakes. The government needs to start thinking about the economy in the long term, not just until the next election. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The fact is many resources have been used up to provide this bounty. This situation was caused by many reasons and current generations will be worst off.

Look at university fees. These are a burden and will harm the future prospects of these people.

The economy has been set as a giant ponzi scheme. This generation of old people seem to think it was all their hard hard work and skill.

My grandmother used to trot out the old "I paid my pension so I deserve this". Except she didn't, there is no pension pot. That money is spent on everyday services. These people are using private pension system or generous public pensions. Private pension have benefited from a boost in stock market. Shame this has not been spread to the rest of the economy.

Public pensions are in an awful state due to nobody saving for this issue.  </TEXT>

I don't like the way business is done and sometimes the weather.

My boss is  not the best guy, but along is I do everything ok, I have no problems. My co-workers are excellent, good fun and hard working.

The teaching culture at the school is pretty hands off which is good.

I got hired via an online application.

Pay is not bad. Low compared to previous jobs, but living expenses are pretty negligible and I am saving money.

<TEXT> As much as sometimes I would agree with some of the policies, they always fucked it up by being tories.

For example the bedroom tax makes a bit of sense, until you see that there is a huge shortage of 1 bedroom council flats. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was in a club in Barcelona, just drinking and partying. As I am using the urinal, the seediest looking guy comes over trying to sell me pills. I thought that by the look of him the drugs will be amazing or crap. So I partook and knocked back the mystery pill. Down on the dance floor the world becomes awesome I spot a magical beard working it's way through the crowd. I say to the girl I am with " you recognize him he's Jason Sudekis???" I try to explain with the few brain cells I left who is, but my friends just think I am tripping. So I decided to go talk to him and introduce him to my friends and solve all the confusion.  
With huge pupils I stumble over to him shouting at the top of my lung "Jason Jason Jason" He vainly tries to escape me as I blather on about films he's not in and finally tells me to "fuck off". Which I listened to and comprehend enough so he didn't have to force me.    </TEXT>
