I make more in roughly the same profession and got to keep a lot less percentage wise, not in absolut terms. A Friend who lived in Florida said overall living is a bit more expensive, but it is easily offset by the higher salaries in IT. You will love the fuel and electricity prices. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because it's 3D Xpoint memory.  The 960 uses 3D MLC NAND. 

3D Xpoint memory has many advantage over MLC. The biggest one would be latency and random read/writes.

Those 2600MB/s is peak sequential write speed. 

For the consumer this really doesn't matter, but there are probably some use cases were optane might be worth the extra cash. </TEXT>

The RX 5700 XT can already hit a bandwidth of 448 GB/s. This is higher than all non HBM cards from previous generations including some with a 512bit bus. 

One thing to also keep in mind that the RX5700 XT is still a mid range card with a mid range bus and chip size. The RX5900 xt is still missing. </TEXT>

LED lights=dynamic tail lights/rear dynamic indicator

Matrix LED=dynamic everything/dynamic indicators front and back

<TEXT> Current tanks hold about 5kg of H2 at 690bar.  With this in mind the chemical energy is about 14186Mj. The efficiency of ICE hydrogen engine is about 20%. So this gives you 3940Mj to work with. For comparison the VW ID.R used 89Mj for its run and the 918 evo had a bit over 300Mj. You got a lot of energy to work with for a relatively small energy to weight ratio including the tank(about 5kg of composite material). 

The engines themselves are the problem. 

Everything is higher pressured. You need to make everything sturdier and thus heavier. 

Another problem is cooling. Hydrogen burns much hotter than petrol like engine block melting hot. You need to dump all that heat which adds weight again. 

You can forget about longevity of the engine if you want upwards of 1000hp.

The rest is pretty similar to any other ice car.

Is it doable? Certainly, but it would be a purpose build car more similar to a dragster than a race car. </TEXT>

Two thing changed his mind. 

1. He is a member of the CDU and as he rose up in the ranks. He realized how far removed from reality many were, how lobbyism works(not everything is bad about it though) and how dismissive many were against valid critique from younger generations 
2. Me and my friends. We meet up every friday for our "Stammtisch". We also talk a lot about politics then. Most of us are more left leaning compared to him. Everybody learns a lot during our discussions. He change his view on topics like gay marriage, environmental protection, state and church separation, etc.

He still is in the CDU as he still believes in traditional christian values. But He tries to change the CDU from the inside. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Matrix LED lights are definitely the winner for me. They are less fatiguing than Xenons. The normal visibility is really good maybe not as good as some Laser or Xenon headlights according to some German car magazines but I couldn't really tell a difference. Can't complain about visibility in other conditions either. Maybe fog because more reflection due to their higher brightness?  Auto leveling works great but of course has it's limits. 

Now to the Matrix part. They work great for detecting other vehicles.  Cornering light could be more aggressive but are still good. Turning light are there but could engage sooner. Maybe I'm just driving too fast/breaking too late for turning. 

The best part is the visibility when driving around other vehicle. You can always see what's right next or on the road. Makes you feel a lot safer. And you don't have to engage/disengage the high beams. 

I originally didn't care about them when purchasing my car but now I love them.

I haven't used Mercedes Multibeam LED yet so can't comment on them, but I prefer Matrix LED to BMWs offerings for example. </TEXT>

Crysis series(single player). You can get them really cheap. Each game offers something different.

Graphics still are awesome. 

Battlefield series. Same as crysis just for multiplayer. 

Titanfall 2: short and sweet singleplayer. 

Strategie:

Total War series. Strategic map and massive battles.

Anno. Build your economy

RPG:

Divinity: Original Sin 2. More classic rpg.

Skyrim with mods. It's skyrim, but better.

Racing:

Project Cars 2. SIM with good graphics and VR implementation.

Forza. A bit more casual.

<TEXT> Sry, I confused cobalt with rare earths. 

How is battery tech pulling away? The energy density per volume is by three digits off. If you include the complete weight of the system its still one digit off. Tanks have made and continue to make huge improvements. Materials like platinum are about to replace by better materials. This includes catalysators in normal ICE vehicles and fuel cells. 

The chemical potential of hydrogen is too big to just dismiss. 

Batteries are great as long as they don't have to carry themselves around or need to store gigantic amounts of energy. Maybe we will get another huge jumps for batteries but simply doubling the energy density is not enough to pull away. 

We'll see in a few years how viable hydrogen is. EV's are already viable, but for me not good enough to dismiss hydrogen. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For now It's the better solution but in the future this might not be the case.

<TEXT> Many reasons.

1. Storing. It's very difficult to store it. Hydrogen goes through almost all materials. You also need to pressurize it to make it volume efficient.
2. Production. It costs a lot of energy to produce. With electrolysis it's about 70-80% efficient, worse than lithium ion storage. 
3. Safety. Hydrogen really likes to go boom. That's what is great about it but also dangerous.
4. Scalability. The most effective way to use hydrogen is a fuel cell. But those don't scale well, which is a problem if you want to but them in a fun to drive vehicle. 

Solutions:

1. Many advancements were made in the last decade or so. Most of the best storage solution aren't commercially viable yet.
2. It's more efficient and safe to produce hydrogen at the gas station instead of transporting it. With the rising use of renewable energy source the excess power can be used to produce it.
3. Modern tanks are designed to brake in a certain way so that large explosion don't happen. The hydrogen would burn and the flame would be pointed in one direction.
4. Fuel cells and storage is more mass efficient than modern batteries it would basically replace then. Recuperation is too valuable to loose so batteries will always have a larger part in vehicles. Hydrogen can also be used in an ICE. This us much less efficient but you can have a much bigger power output. 

Hydrogen has still much potential which is why many companies and Japan heavily invest in further development. It also doesn't rely on huge amounts of rare resources like conventional electric vehicles do. Without more clean energy the losses in production and use, hydrogen is much less environmental friendly than fully electric vehicles are. I personally see them as more viable in the future than EVs if batterie technology doesn't have another big breakthrough. </TEXT>

Motherboard: Great board, but do you need the feature of X570 like the PCIe4.0? If no maybe go with b450.

RAM: Nice to have for certain tasks. I personally would keep it. You can always go with 16Gb and upgrade later though.

Storage: NVME isn't that much more expensive than a normal SATA ssd so I would keep it if you don't have to trouble to fit everything in your budget.

GPU: Definitely upgrade from the money you saved on the other components. Either to a Radeon RX5700xt or to a RTX 2070 super depending on budget.

<TEXT> I just bought a MSI Optix MAG271CQR when it was on sale for sub 350.

I was pleasantly surprised how good it was. It has a VA Panel but the pixel response time and motion clarity are really good and even better with blur reduction. Blur reduction doesn't work in conjunction with freesync though.

Black levels are ok but not as good as I expected. The colors are Ok but a bit too blue even after trying to correct it. But I'm spoiled by my Eizo IPS monitor and LG OLED TV, both more than twice your budget.

Contrast and brightness on the other hand were better than expected. Viewing angles are better than a TN but not as good as my IPS or other VAs

Build quality is also a plus.  And for whatever reason it has rgb on the back. From the front it doesn't look too gamery.

For 350 it's awesome value. US pricing should be sub $400 USD, still great value. If I'm primarily gaming this is my monitor of choice now, my Eizo is for work(video, photo editing etc.) and my OLED for movies and certain games. </TEXT>

<TEXT> TRUE all around sub 7ms means that pixels can always reach their target color within 7ms independent from their starting and target color. So if the red value is 10 and needs to be at 200 it can do the change within those 7ms. Same with any other combination. If a monitor has overshoot it means it reaches 200 within the window but reaches a value higher than 200 at one point, for example 220 and then falls back to 190, then 205 and finally 200. Usually the first time it reaches 200 is mentioned as the response time to look good on the spec sheet. 

If a panel hast true 3ms and 144Hz it can hold the complete frame for 3.9ms, meanwhile a 6ms panel only 0.9ms. So a true 6ms panel has more ghosting aso than a true 3ms panel even if both fall within the 144Hz refresh window. 

If you want to see this effect pushed to the extreme put a good OLED which can have true sub 1ms next to a 144Hz VA. The clarity is unreal. Good OLEDs need image processing or really high framerates to make them bearable. 

CRTs are a completely different story. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The misconception that diesels aren't or can't be geared for a high top speed is probably just an American thing. Why would you need to go faster than 85moh in the US?

The important thing for top speed is raw hp and not torque. Many Diesel have a lot torque so they reach peak power with lower rpm. 

Even smaller cars like a Diesel golf are geared to reach over 125mph and they are able to drive this fast with better fuel economy than their gasoline counter parts. 

My car is a diesel with a ZF-8speed automatic and can easily reach 155mph. Most cars which will overtake when you are driving under 100mph on the Autobahn are diesels, because they have a good enough fuel economy to drive this fast for a long period. </TEXT>

The 190PS 2.0 TFSI has the same fuel economy and is all around better. The only drawback is the upfront cost and maybe tax/insurance depending on country. 190PS is enough for every occasion when you don't care about performance. In the city it really does not matter and the 150PS will be fine.

<TEXT> The 2.0 with 110kw has a smaller turbocharger than the 140kw and 190kw engines. Which generation of A5 sportsback is it? The earlier engines had some problems.

Edit: missed the "new". I've driven a Golf and Q2 with this engine. I had no problems with overtaking. The A5 is a bit heavier. I would recomment to testdrive it first. 

Edit 2: Not this exact engine but one with a similar power output... </TEXT>

<TEXT> It depends on the which aspect and car we are talking about.

Interior wise it's B8B8.5B9.5B9, only because of the missing buttons, otherwise B9.5 is best.

Exterior wise I need to differentiate between the A4 and A5.

For the A4 its B8B8.5B9.5B9 as well.

For the A5 its B8B9B8.5. It's more difficult for me to decide when it comes to RS models. 

In terms of driving every generation just got better. 

For me the diesel S4 is just the successor of my car and not the old S4.

 #x200B;

So the B8.5 was a huge improvement all around while the B9.5 is a mixed bag. 

 

I kind of want Audi to do something crazy, make an RS5 a similar drivetrain like the R18, the A models with different plug in hybrid solutions and an S4/5 with a modified 5 cylinder from the RS3/TTRS. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 100k miles seems to be nothing to a 3.0TDI. 38mpg seems to be realistic. When I'm driving normally I get 39mpg. Only regular maintenance is sufficient.

One thing to keep in mind is the 3.0TDI can come with the ZF8-Speed because of the high torque, meanwhile the 2.0T and 3.0T get the S-Tronic.

The 3.0T also seems to be very reliable.

I personally wouldn't go for a 3.0T or 2.0T if it isn't at least an S-Model. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a server CPU with 64 cores. 

It's basically more than twice as fast as intels best offering in most workloads. It also supports much more ram, storage etc. 

It's used for example in datacenters. The biggest customers for those chips are Google, Microsoft, Amazon etc. 

They use those chips for their cloud services. 

One simple example is youtube video encoding. When you upload a video to youtube at 4k, youtube will also encode it to 480p, 720p, 1080p etc. This requires a lot of cpu power. Chips like these can be used for this. 

But this is just one of countles things where they are useful. Almost everything related to the internet uses these chips. </TEXT>

With a budget of 630$ there is almost no reason to get an intel system.

I would go with components similar to this. If you adjust the components a bit or get them for sale they fit right into you budget. The great thing about this build is that can play games at 1080p60 with no problem and you have a great upgrade path.

<TEXT> Nuclear isn't as good as it seems. Storage is a problem for Germany. Besides that the current powerplants would still need to be replaced with newer ones. Gas is quick, easy and a relatively co2 efficient stopgap. I would prefer nuclear over gas as a long-term solution but it's not viable in the short term. Also we are talking about using 20% gas and 80% renewables. If those guys in northern Bavaria would finally allow the high power line to be build we could get there much faster. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Battlefield V has one of the best bullet physic / weapon realism. It's just tweaked for gameplay reasons. It does  things like changing the gravity from 9.81 to 12 and being able to see the bullets travel.

Every weapon model is very realistic and the animations are top notch. In BF1 they tweaked a lot when someone showed them small inaccuracies. And again for Gameplay purposes they smoothed everything a lot and made it faster.

BF3, 4 and Hardline had linear bullet speeds with a constant gravitational pull which varied from weapon to weapon. Between 9 to 18

BF1 also took the air resistance into account and BFV made everything more consistent and realistic.

IMO PUBG doesn't have good weapon mechanics. It's not realistic enough to be a selling point for me and it's not tweaked enough for the gameplay to be enjoyable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it's because Android auto streams everything the car and it doesn't have multi screen support. It only forward some information to the car. The map in the VC isn't a 1:1 google map. To avoid confusion Audi doesn't display it. If you got only got a center screen Android auto gets displayed there. Most cars have two screen and Audi choose to stream it to the central screen only. But that's just my guess. 

I switched between Android Auto and Audi navigation many times and there wasn't any difference in travel time. Some roads are not correct though. Googles time estimate seems to be better to a creepy degree, but Audi is just as fast overall. It estimates a lower time than google and it end up taking as long as googles estimate. So basically I check in Google when I will arrive and then use Audis navigation. My only experience is in Germany and Parts of Austria. </TEXT>

For me it was the wrong BF at the wrong time.

Too similar in gameplay and setting to BF3 and I didn't like most differences.

Even today I would rather play BF3. Still managed to play hundreds of hours in BF4 though.

BF1 is different enough to make it worth playing for me.

So basically the order I play the games isn't necessarily representative for how great those games are.

Edit: play on PC </TEXT>

<TEXT> So you used the World Banks definition. That one doesn't really fit for Germany. 

Let's take a look at the [German School System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Germany#/media/File:German_School_system.svg).

This graph isn't represantative for all German States but it gives you a rough idea.

We split the secondary in Germany in two. The sec II includes part of  our dual system where you go to a vocational school. This is relatively independent from our main school system,  you don't need abitur in the dual system and could start after year 10 of school. 

After finishing you can go further and get your  "Meister"(Master of your trade) for example. Those are likely included under tertiary education. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Depends on what you want from a road.

If high speed is you thing there are some great bits of Autobahn where you can floor it. The A33 has nice new bits for example.

Some have nice curves through a beatiful landscape. I can't remember the names. The southern part of the A7 is really curvy but is not in the best condition.

The Nordschleife is a great road to drive. It's classified as a toll road. The surrounding area(Eifel) is also nice. </TEXT>

Porsche will probably come back with an improved and lighter version of the Taycan and beat tesla and so the arms race continues.

Like the glue on the winglets failing in hot climate, some bugs in the infotainment, the latches to fold down the rear seat failing etc. Most of it should be fixed or is relatively easy to fix. 

Multiple 100,000km test showed no major issues popping up.

<TEXT> The US history was almost always tied to European events.

* Colonization(US as a side note) 
* Slave trade
* Independence was taught in context of the build up to the French revolution  
* The civil war was only mentioned in literally one or two sentences  
* Emigration waves from Germany to the US 
* Little involvement at the end of WW1 
* Great depression   
* WWII involvement mostly in Europe We talked more about imperial Japan itself than US pacific war involvement which came down to Pearl Harbour and dropping nuclear bombs.
* US after war involvement in shaping the BRD 
* Cold war, but the Korean and Vietnam war were only side notes   

We also did few lessons where we talked soon to be historic events which happened during our lifetime. 911 and Iraq War were big ones.

The US was also often used as an example in school and thus also US history. Capitalism, patriotism, racism and genocide come to mind. 

I know a whole lot more than I learned is School partially due to US media.

This was in NRW  around 10 years ago. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They are also compared to the Japanese and South Korean....

The market which is dominated by Japanese manufacturers in the US is much more competetive in Europe.

We got a lot more lower trim cars with diesel engines. Those have a much better track record than the petrol engine cars you mostly find in the US. Same with transmissions. Manual is the default in Europe and automatic in the US.

One good example are the B8 Audis. The petrol engines had major design issues and were unreliable. The diesels on the other hand ate up miles to no end. Those weren't sold in the US. Earlier automatic transmissions also had many problems especially if you didn't change the oil. The manuals didn't.

Audis are seen are very reliable here in Europe and judging by this US dominated subreddit not so much.

Opposite for Japanese cars. I heard several complaints about Nissans and Toyotas with diesel enignes. It's not as extreme as with Audis, but still. </TEXT>

You have little to no expenses and work 50h a weeks. That should make it relatively easy save up for a used 20-25k car.

He's still only 18 and has all opportunities and no debt. He could just sell his car if he want to go back to school/university full time (remember those are almost free over here) if he wants to. Buying a expensive car is always a "poor" decision.

Telling someone that this car is the nicest one he will ever be able to afford when he's this young and worked his ass off to get it while you know nothing about him is just being an asshole. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Both my VW Golf mk5 1.4 and my Audi A4 3.0tdi averaged 6.7l/100km (35mpg).

I mostly drove on the Autobahn and on country roads. The A4 is much much faster at the same fuel consumption. 130km/h vs 180km/h cruising speed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 69 km/h Nice...

Driving 81 while only 70 is allowed..

I generally use Auto mode over efficiency. It's almost as fuel efficient and a better to drive.

On my 140km of daily commute I average around 6.7l/100km with an average speed above 100km/h.

While on a school trip to Munich the tour guide proudly told us how many bikers were around and that we should be careful. We were confused. Bike traffic in Munich makes up around 17% meanwhile in Mnster it's 39%.

<TEXT> My attainable dream car is an Audi S5. I looked at cars with the intend of buying for over a year. Everything had to be perfect, but of course it never was. 

Buying new wasn't an option because it was out of my budget as I have an aversion against financing and leasing. 

So I let dreams be dreams and saved a lot of money especially in terms of running cost and bought an A4 3.0TDI Avant instead. 

I love the car without getting anxious over every imperfection. Maybe in a few years I will get my true dream car. </TEXT>

Do you know if the wastes policies are the same throughout the country?

It slightly differs from region to region how the exactly the household trash disposal is organised.

I think in most reagions you have at least three bins/containers at home. 

I don't know many exact details but there are probably many federal laws.

You said that thrash tracking comes up sometimes but was there any protests regarding this in Germany?

I don't think so. The topic seems to take a back seat to the Coal phase out, diesel NOx emissions, air travel, too much nitrate in our soil and water, too many antibiotics for farm animals, microplastic in our water, plastic in the oceans and plastic in general. There is kind of an out of sight out of mind mentality around the export of plastic, though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We recycle a lot of our waste. 

 Where I live we differentiate between four color coded types which will be picked up. 

Yellow - Plastic 

Blue - Paper 

Brown - Biowaste

Black - The rest(smaller Items) 

 

Then there are recycling container for glass of different kinds. 

For other stuff you there a companies which will dispose of the waste for you.

We probably the world champions when it comes to trash sorting. 

We recycle almost all of our trash. Well in theory. 

Plastic is a completely different story. A lot plastic is converted into energy(up to 53%), another huge part of plastic is exported to Asia with the false hope of it being environmentally friendly recycled and the actual amount of reused material is more like 18%.  

International trash tracking comes up as a topic from time to time because of it. There wouldn't be a change in our daily lives if we would increase our recycling rate. 

Another problem is that we are one of the biggest waste producers per capita. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Diesel engines aren't really made for fast driving

Depends what driving fast means to you. Constantly driving 130+ mph or accelerating from 55 to 130+mph is no problem for a Diesel. 

They are also more efficient under constant load. 

It only comes down to gearing and power.

The fastest non hybrid car in Le Mans is still the Peugeot 908 HDI FAP with 700hp and a top speed of over 217mph. Audi was also planing to make a diesel R8(road car) which would have been fastest R8 at that time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Both Nvidia and AMD had all kinds of different problems over the years. To generally say that Radeon were more faulty and worse is false. 
 
 
 Saying that the blower style cooler on the AMD reference cards is shit and causes overheating on models like the R9 290, Vega and now the 5700XT, to say their stock voltages are to high and their early GCN drivers were bad is true. Most things can be avoided by buying partner cards, which is frustrating because they always launch later.

Nvidia also has an extensive track record of cards dying due to bad design, bad drivers (in one case they were so bad that they literally killed your GPU), overheating, looking at you 480, and so on. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I graduated around the same time. Every classroom had a chalkboard, some had old overhead projectors and 2 or had normal projectors, those were always booked. Till 2011 only 3.6% of pupils had access to a computer in school at once. No WiFi, no cellphone reception. The first computers I used in school still had Windows 95. That was in 2005. During class any kind of electronic devices besides calculators were banned, some teachers ignored it though. During brake nobody gave a fuck. My school was notorious for having really old equipment. But hey, at least you could find racist (biology)books older than WWII in our library and the equipment for our science classes was excitingly dangerous.

My brothers school meanwhile had at least normal projector in every class. And some classes were paperless. everybody just used laptops.

Why the stark contrast? My theory is that the school never got any funding because it was always above average when it came to grades and so on, my brothers was the exact opposite. </TEXT>

But in the games you mentioned Nvidia is better. Over here in Germany you can find really good models for the same price as the RTX 2060s, so 'reasonably' priced. 

I like the feature of AMD driver more than Nvidias. 

AMD always sold less GPUs than Nvidia independent of value. The market share of Vega is pretty small but its still growing so at least some are buying it.

Here on PCMR many have Vega cards in their flair. Mostly Vega 56 though, because that card is awesome value. </TEXT>

<TEXT> According to surveys Germans question the friendship with the US much more. 

Many Germans trust the US government as much as they trust Russia. 

 

There are many good reasons for that. 

Spying on the government, human rights violations, the trade war, pulling away from the Paris agreement etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I play either on a 4k OLED TV or a 1440p 144hz ips monitor. 

If you tweak the settings the RX Vega 64 can play games on 4k just fine. 

In many cases 4k is not worth it over 1440p 90+fps on a 144Hz freesync monitor though.

I wouldn't bother with a cheap 4k monitor. You get a monitor for the picture quality and there is more to it than just resolution and framerate. 

If my TV only had 1080p60 I still would probably still game on it over my 1440p monitor, but the input lag with almost 20ms and burn in stop me from playing all games on it. </TEXT>

In the last year I've driven a lot of new Audis and BMWs and Audi is far ahead when it comes to interiors. 

They feel nicer, are more ergonomic and some features are just better, the virtual cockpit for example.

The exceptions are the plastic shifting paddles. The over reliance on touch screens in the newest A6/7 is also a turn off for many.

<TEXT> The British heavily bombed the area. During that time my (great) grandparents had to hide in a nearby cave or a bunker just like everyone else.

During the war there were 2100 air raid alarms.  

  

During the last days of the war the Volkssturm decided to make their last stand in/close to the village I grew up in. The village itself wasn't something special but it was easier to defend then the town behind, which was valuable. 

  

Nonetheless the British were seen as the liberators in 1945 by the civilians, partly because the Volkssturm wasn't comprised of any locals. 

When they arrived the Volkssturm destroyed all the bridges and took a stand in the nearby hills. The Tommies arrived with some 400 Artillerie pieces and besieged the Volkssturm. 

Then they attacked under heavy losses during easter 1945.  

 

There are still a lot of undiffused bombs and grenades around here. Some farmers can't even be bothered to report them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The main reason I usually do something like this is simple. Gear ration and peak engine performance. If I need to overtake a tractor for example downshifting makes sense, but I don't get much more performance out of my car when I downshift trying to overtake a truck. Engine power output flatlines slightly above 3000rpm and the normal gear at that speed is already close enough. No real need to downshift.
Also you are trying to accelerate and thus basically automatically Rev matching. </TEXT>

<TEXT> While slowing down I stay in gear and try to shift as little as possible, meaning I slow down till almost idle rpm and than schift in neutral for a complete stop or to the corresponding gear. 

I try to drive as smooth as possible, but usually don't rev match. Some examples where I do include downshifting for going up a steep mointain or when I make a fast turn.

My 120k mile clutch still feels like a 10k one.

Almost everyone I now doesn't rev match, but tries to drive/shift as smooth as possible.

That's taught in driving school here in Germany. </TEXT>

My parents got me tested by multiple doctors. But they found nothing and thought I just daydreamed a lot, which I also did. 

In school I had a lot of absence seizures. Teachers got mad at me for ignoring them and daydream instead. 

But then after I finished school I had a bad seizure which broke my back, twice. 

Then we knew what was going on. I have Grand Mal Epilepsie and the trigger for my absence seizures is being tired. I was always tired when I was in school but never when I was tested. </TEXT>

The concept of sharing one big pizza is somehow strange to me. 

When it comes to taste it's all over the place. There seems to be much more variety in all forms good or bad. 

I prefer the classic more simple Italian pizzas.

<TEXT> On the left lane you have those Germans thinking that driving 220 km/h is an expression of freedom.  
  
 I really hope that we finally get a general speedlimit on the Autobahn.

They introduced a daytime speed limit on part of my commute. With the speeding mentality it didn't help. Those guys are still annoying AF. Maybe even more so, because they are always only a bit faster than me while overtaking and force me to brake behind a truck much more often. It doesn't even really matter how fast you go, they are always 5-10 km/h faster, will always overtake you and always have someone with the same mentality behind them.

Only introducing a speed limit isn't enough.

I wish they would remove it.

In my school we never really had students who caused major problems, were violet and so on.

We had peaceful student organized protest against things our school did, which was seen as bad behavior by authoritarian teachers.

We had edge lords who did Nazi salutes just to be edgy. Those guys were actually quite the opposite of Nazis. They still got in a lot of trouble because of it. 

 

The school my brother went to was the opposite. Crimes, constant fights, drugs, actual Nazis who carved swastikas into things where guest workers stayed etc. 

Nobody wanted to send their kid to that school but because it was a 'rural' area they often had no choice. </TEXT>

I drove the Pacific Highway in a 2018 Mustang last year. Hopefully I can do the Atlantic one this summer.

<TEXT> I don't watch much anime and when I do its subbed. Some of the more recent dubs seem to be good from some snippets I've heard. I only come across dubbed ones on Netflix and Amazon. Set your VPN to Germany and browse Netflix for a bit. 

I would avoid the cliche 2000s anime, as their dubs are heavily made for a young audience. Thus many things are Germanized and don't really fit in. I would also avoid dubs for anime which are close to the Japanese culture even when they are not Germanized. 

Not recommended for learning German.

Most dubs done by the same three voice actors. 

Although those three voice actors probably produced better dubs than most English ones. But they are strange because they do things like use the Japanese -sensei,-kun, etc. in combination with a German pronunciation of the Romaji names. For example Sasuke from Naruto has a pronounced u. 

 

I've watched Cowboy Bebop in German, English and Japanese on Netflix and all dubs are great. 

Not an anime(?) but Avatar was great.

The Studio Ghibli movies also have great dubs. 

 

Those also use proper German which is actually used. If you ignore the setting specifics that is.

<TEXT> Sweden. 

My friends and I regularly drive up to a house by a lake in Sweden. 

The house is owned by the family of a close friend. It's only us in the middle of nowhere ( at least compared to anywhere in Germany), no internet etc. No one will bother us and we won't bother anyone. 

Just what I need from time to time. 

 

Camping trips in Scandinavia are also hard to beat.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Disappointed: I recently had a BMW X5 M50d. It basically was everything I expected from a BMW, but not from a diesel. It felt like they just put a powerful diesel engine in there and changed nothing else. The transmission is not suited for it. It's almost impossible to put the torque of the diesel engine to any use. It would always immediately upshift. Also the fake sound is horrible. BMW just made a horrible attempt to hide it is a diesel. Why not embrace it instead?

Impressed: Coming from mainly BMWs I expected Audis like the A5/S5 similar or slightly better comfort and quality. I was surprised how much better it was. The B8 facelift A5/S5 interiors look really outdated on pics but irl they don't feel and look that outdated. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Usually a VW Golf is the typical beginners car. I got one, many of my friends have one. We are only slightly older than you. It is the perfect beginners car here in Germany. We all had your Budget. In the first year I drove 32500km in mine. All the Opels had bigger problems over the years. Most of them startet around 100k km, especially 3 cylinder cars. I don't know about the used car situation in Sweden.

A friend of mine collects old Volvos and we often drive to Sweden.

The cars are cheap, reliable and easy to repair, but they use a lot of fuel.

I've also seen many older Mercedes beater cars in Sweden, those would probably fit in your Budget, but I can't really say much about running costs.

Usually I would recommend a small diesel for you commuter distance, but you will run into problems in the Swedish winters if you don't park your car in a garage. Got first hand experience on that one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, the average speed on the Autobahn is closer to 90mph.

I drive on an  unrestricted 60mile stretch every day. From time to time someone will pass me doing more than 112mph.

 

Almost everyone I know has driven their car at speeds higher than 112mph just to test it. Almost everyone I know has done over 112mph in driving school. It's a thing you do every now and then, but if you want to get somewhere its not economical.

Your question was in English so I thought about it in English. If you would have asked in German I would have thought about it in German. 

It usually depends on the topic I'm thinking about which language is more prevalent. 

In my head it doesn't matter how I use the languages.

Just a general tip. You don't tailgate a truck like I always see. Just fall back a little, look for a gap and accelerate on your lane accordingly to 130. Don't just wait till a gap on the left is big enough for you to directly pull over at 90km/h and then accelerate. </TEXT>

I'm completely with you on that one. I like driving thats why I drive this much. But someone to whom it is just a mode of transportation it should not be the best option. I rather take public transportation into the city than driving into it for example, because there it is just a mode of transportation for me.

<TEXT> Solution for what? 

My opinion as someone who drives over 100km on the Autobahn everyday in cars ranging from an old 75hp Golf to a 400hp BMW is that a general speed limit is not necessary.  

There are some bits I travel frequently where they introduced a speed limit of 120km/h from 6 to 19.

It didn't had any positive effect. As many traffic jams and accident as before. The severity of those didn't change either. There still are as many noticeable bad drivers and assholes as before. I still have to brake as frequent as before. My fuel consumption didn't go down compared to driving at Richtgeschwindigkeit before. 

 

I don't think driving with a speed limit is more relaxing. 

You have to do the same things anyway. Don't use a speed limit as an excuse to not be aware of your surroundings. 

  

I see no point in introducing one. Let the ones who want to drive fast, drive fast on bits which allow it. 

 

If you really want to lower accidents and traffic jams, introduce dynamic speed limits/signs.  

If you want to help the environment, make driving fast more expensive and invest that money to make more environmentally friendly modes of travel more affordable. 

 

A general speed limit is more of a cheap out imo. </TEXT>

I'm a driver and usually only smaller people are sitting in the back of my car. So the headroom is enough. I would be fine with a bigger Coup but those rear doors are really handy. Nobody needs to move if someone in the back wants to exit the car. The ease of access to the cargo with folded seats and through the bigger tailgate is just a must have for me. But I do not need the additional cargospace a station wagon would offer.
So it sacrifices everything I don't need on a station wagon, for a look I love.  </TEXT>

Its the point of Jens Bttiger or my interpretation of the point, not necessarily my opinion.

I've been to the US and I've seen seemingly desperate veterans selling flags and other stuff outside of a Walmart.

You simply wont see stuff like this in Germany. I've also seen plenty of unselfish acts by Americans for other Americans.

The difference being that they are not that well reflected on a legislative and political level. We Germans are mostly exposed to this outwardly proclaimed patriotism. This plus our history and how we are labeled by others leads to our smugness especially to Americans about stuff like this. 

  

Also, nationalism sucks. We all live on the same grain of sand. There is nothing more important.

I think you most likely get one from the newest generation, so 6th generation facelift model. They were introduced in 2017.

At least judging by their parking lot. Haven't seen an older one. That was in California.

That means no V6. So either an 2.3 EcoBoost inline 4 or an 5.0 TI-VCT. Because you don't know I bet you'll get an EcoBoost. On the plus side it has more torque and better fuel consumption than the V6. </TEXT>

Be careful which model you buy and make sure you can rma them, because most cards which fail will do that in the first few weeks. You can change the target temperature in the overclocking menu. If you do not like zero rpm modes, don't buy an Asus Strix model. They have the worst implementation of this feature, at least on their 1080 Strix.

Germany is an overregulated bureaucratic nightmare and is not able to react fast enough to things like the internet, is overprotective towards copyrightholder, has strict laws against unconstitutional behavior and is backwards when it comes to technical implementations. Many things are still this way because of the conservative party(CDU) being in government for the last 14 Years.

There are many other reasons why. 
 

I probably wouldn't be able to find work in my current position in the US. I'm in my mid 20's and by far the youngest. The average age of my colleagues all over the world is double that, which seems typical.

I know that I  wouldn't downshift and work myself to death or don't work at all. Both of which would be unhealthy. 
 
I don't like the work environment.
 
Health reasons. Insurance companies don't like me. 
 
But most importantly I like it here in Germany. 
I like the region I'm responsible for. I like driving up to Scandinavia, the Netherlands or down into the alps. I like the people more for everyday life. 
  
  
I wouldn't be able to stand the outgoing and smalltalk nature of most Americans for more than a month or two. I wouldn't fit in that well. It's great on vacations on the other hand. 
  
 Two of my friends also are happy to move back to Germany after a year abroad. (Florida and Washington DC). I think it would be the same in my case.

<TEXT> I've been to three different states.

 #x200B;

First I was in Florida. I was surprised how clich everything was. Overly friendly and loud people were, Lawyer billboards everywhere, everything was bigger, Walmart people, that people had either totally white teeth or none at all, how divided the country is, how 'casual' everyone was dressed, how boringly planned everything  was(straight roads for example), US Flags everywhere, and so on. I saw a billboard on the highway which read 'The NRA is a terrorist Organisation' and a few meters behind it was one advertising guns. 

 #x200B;

Then I was in California. It felt much more like over here than in Florida. It was much more diverse in every sense. The gap between rich and poor was really big and in SF there were so many homeless people. 

 

And then NYC.  How poor and rich everything was at the same time. Many things were badly maintained, but it almost seemed like this was celebrated. How other cultures displayed as something special.(in a hipster sense). And the typical NYC versus European city stuff, like many skyscrapers and so on.

 #x200B;

But one thing I wasn't expecting and really hate was the chlorinated tab water everywhere. </TEXT>

Sapphire was my got to for builds in the last 10 years:   

HD5870, still running after 9 Years  

HD6950, still running after 8 Years  

HD7970, Dead after 5 Years(I overclocked it to death) 

HD7950, Still running after 7 Years   

HD7870, Still running after 6 Years  

HD7850, Still running after 5 Years  

R9 390, random death after 3 Years    

RX480, still running after 2 Years  

RX480, random death a day before hitting 2 years  

RX580, still running after 3 Month, rma replacement for dead RX480  

RX Vega 64, still running after 1 year

RX Vega 56, still running after 1 year  

 

The cards where pretty much in continues use either by them or younger brothers, cousins aso.

Awesome track record if you consider that almost all cards run with a pretty high OC.  

I never had any QC issues. That's why I was stunned by threads like this and hope the quality didn't drop. 

 

After running into a few problems on Asus, had the exact same issue as op on a 1080 strix, and MSI NVIDIA cards, I switched to EVGA

 My short EVGA track record:

GTX 1080 TI, still running after 8 Month

GTX 1080 TI, dead after 2 Month  

 Not really saying much.

<TEXT> I had a different experience. 

I rma'd a card on the last day of the warranty. The shop refused to take it back because the card would arrive two days later (Sunday in between). I contacted Sapphire one day later showing that I contacted the shop within the period of warranty. After I mailed them the RX480, they send a refurbished RX580 back.   

There were big difference between my and your case though. The GPU was dead without a doubt and I had clear information from the etailer.

Did you show them when you bought the card? They can't pinpoint the end warranty. Maybe someone saw the number of the card and that it was shipped to a retailer way before you got the card and then closed the ticked. Sapphire usually only does rma if the shop refuses it. So maybe if you make the situation with the retailer more clear they will help. 

  

Its still really unprofessional of them to make you go through all of this, especially with that lack of communication on their part.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sapphire is my go to. Best looking, highest quality cards. They are a bit more expensive but totally worth it. I'm a happy customer for 10 years now. I rma'd a card on the last day the warranty expired. The shop refused to take it back because the card would arrive two days later. I contacted Sapphire one day later and after I mailed them the RX480, I got a refurbished RX580 back.(only slight scratches on the cooler, similar to the ones the RX480 had).

On the AMD side I would advice against cheaper gigabyte models and all AMD ASUS models because they basically only slap NVIDIA coolers on AMD cards, unlike their old AREZ cards for example. XFX should have the best warranty on AMDs side.

For NVIDIA I would probably go with EVGA, even though they fucked up in the past(GTX 1080 thermal pads for example). But they handled it well. Their product also are high quality.

ASUS and MSi are also good options for team green. But ASUS fans did have problems on a GTX1080 ROG STRIX i put into a build. </TEXT>

In gaming the Ryzen 5s are slower but also better value and I think a better fit for the gpu mentioned. Except if you want to get closer to 144fps in cpu heavy games and are willing to turn down settings. Then the i7 is the better choice. </TEXT>

AMDs control panel looks better, but its performance is a bit more sluggish.

<TEXT> Depends on the game and Setup.

 

I have a 1440p 144Hz ips Monitor which I use for most games.

Right next to me I have an 4K OLED TV with a low latency. I use that for couch gaming, with a controller in titles like Witcher 3, AC aso.

Sometime I switch to 1080p 120Hz on my OLED TV. The picture quality is simple too good to not use it for gaming. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a guy.

why do you think this is?

Some female characters just got so interesting that they became my main characters.

How did you you develop this characters?

It just happens. I develop many characters and some are female.

How does your character reflect you and do you think you relate to them better than someone of the same gender as you?

I can relate to some female characters more easily than to some males and to some not as well. Some barely reflect me some reflect me very well.

Are there any realizations about yourself that youve arrived at?

Not really. Maybe a better understanding of other people IRL?

PS: Research into certain topics to make your characters more real can be quite awkward.

<TEXT> I also think the fact AMD released the card is because they decided to go along with the price fixing, I mean why the sudden announcement when they said they weren't releasing it(? correct me if I'm wrong there, haven't done a lot of research on that)

You are right, they said they wouldn't release it last year, which is also why I didn't expect the cards. The VII branding just popped up relative recently, which was assumed to be Instinct branding for Vega 20. The Radeon VII as a prosumer product looks rushed. They saw a quick opportunity to make money and took it.   Without better yields than expected and the high price for an RTX 2080 the product would probably not exist.

<TEXT> No, I'm not forgetting the Tensor cores.  TU104-400/A (TU104)  is  545 mm and Vega 10 is  486 mm. Vega 20(Radeon VII) has to have a bigger memory controller and the difference in size between 14nm and 12nm is next to non existent. But due to 7nm Vega 20 is  only  331 mm, so it should be much cheaper right? I don't know, but Nvidia also had the possibility to go with 7nm instead of 12 like most of r/nvidia seemed to think not that long ago. As you said both companies want money and nvidia based its decision to go with 12 on that. Yields are better than expected according to AMD which is probably the reason why we have this card. Still I don't think the cost per chip is that different. 

So I don't think its price fixing.

That being said 699$ is still too expensive and not a good buy for gamers at all.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, when I read I visualize the scene immediately and when some new details pop up I add them.
But when the new details don't fit in my current picture I need to do it all over again. This gets frustrating really fast. I end up dropping the book and dream up my own story from the bits I've read. Similar situation with audio books. Some books I have powered through, but it takes really long for me to finish.
I have no problems with science books, comics/Maga and watching movies.  </TEXT>

Soooo yeah make sure there isn't a legit excuse first.

When I was bored as a child I started daydreaming. I discovered that my dreams where more interesting than most of rl. Its like having the ability to watch a good movie anytime anywhere.

Next to nobody in the younger generations is going to church.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I guess that's one of the reasons why high school Anime are so popular even to a crowd that didn't enjoy their time in HS.

I think it's normal to some degree. Everyone has some regrets and wants to have a second try.   
  
I sometimes dream off my HS time and think what I would have done instead of playing video games and daydreaming even though I know I would do the same if I would go back. Also getting my epilepsy diagnosed would help a lot.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Rarely something was forbidden when I was at school and now that my colleagues all have kids.

Something like limited screentime or collecting the smartphone when it was time to sleep, seems to be fairly normal.

Absolutely no restriction on dating and curfews were very loose especially in teen years. Heck I did come back home at 3AM at the age of 14 or so (pre smartphone). Forbidding junk food would be considered strange. Its normal to eat healthy at home and junk while going out with friends. 

Age rating on games were a completely different subject when i went to school. We had a few school shootings in the 00s and Videogames were blamed. So no violent video games. Today nobody really cares. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Can I give the typical German answer? No! It depend son the working field however I rarely do any small talk, not even in during my breaks here in Germany. Then again almost everyone I regularly meet at is 20+ years older and a something something manager. I also have many international contacts, mainly Europe and you notice the difference. The more south(maybe east) you go the more you talk (when they speak English or someone talks to them in their native language). Norway doesn't seem as bad as Germany but they are not exactly talkative. For whatever reasons Bulgarians and Hungarians on the other hand are very talkative. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It matters. Have you ever played on 45 or 30 vs 60 fps? You will notice it even though your reaction time is much 15x or 10x  that amount. Same with latency. Why is playing with mouse and keyboard so shit on a TV even with only 21ms delay?
It feels smother. You could also argue that your eye can't distinguish between two pixels on an 27'' 1080p or 1440p monitor why should anyone use a 4k one. The difference in both cases is miniscule but noticeable for almost everyone who plays shooters regularly.  </TEXT>

Due to G8, too many students at my school and this kind of structure, we had up to 6 90min lessons per day. This meant 35h+ weeks and sometimes even staying in school from 7:45 to 18:45 + Homework... Some students had burnout at the age of 16.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> With the ASUS model RX Vega Model you have to be careful because the VRM isn't properly cooled. With the strix model I wouldn't too heavily go to the extremes. Only go down with the voltage to around 1.15V. That's still enough for Overclocking.  The cooler is good otherwise. If you are lucky you can get close to 1600MHz on 1.1V and with \~300W power draw. You should be able to get the HBM over 1000MHz. Wattman is good enough and works quiet well. The Crimson drivers also have an overlay for monitoring you performance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They are in an grey area. They are legit in the terms that they work when you get them from a non shady source. The worst thing that happens is MS deactivates the key because it wasn't meant for redistribution. So you have get a new one maybe from the same source for free as a replacement. MS doesn't bother to check those licenses so its unlikely that you will run into problems. Most of these licenses are from OEM systems sold to companies who used their own windows licenses.  So Microsoft already got their money twice. From the OEM and the company. I'm currently sitting on 200 unused OEM licenses, but cant use any of them due to policies. If you want to be completely on the legit side there are key stores which have retail licenses for 50 bucks. </TEXT>

In the case of france 70% is nuclear. Thats where germany wants to be with renewables in 12 Years.

<TEXT> eah, let's burn coal for the next 32 years, a very good idea indeed, and very environment-friendly.

Its not like they will shut down all coal powerplants in 2050. The target would be to shut down the biggest offender in the next three years and then the rest till 2030. Fossil fuel contains more then just coal, gas for example and everything gradually.

Come on, what's the avg energy income of a solar panel or a wind generator per square kilometer in watts? Is it even comparable with fossils?  

Ok lets make a comparison. 

The powerplants Frimmersdorf and Neurath are fed by the surface mine Garzweiler. They produce combined 6624MW. Garzweiler alone has an area of 30.96km. An inland Windpark can make on average 24MW per km so on the same Area it would produce 743.04MW. If we look at a solar in Germany we get 50MWp/km or 1.548GWp for the Garzweiler area.

Not too far off.

The great thing especially about Solar energy is that you can spread them out. The bad thing is their inconsistency.

 Nuclear is a completely different beast. </TEXT>

To be Completely fossil free till 2050.

To power the massive german industry with windmills?   
  
Yeah our flour industry is ginormous..... 

They want to achieve that with the use of renewable energy like windturbines, solar installations. Depending on the stage they want to mainly use different gas Powerplants to bridge the gaps. First fossil then synthetic. Maybe after 2050 also use fusion plants as a fall back. Currently they are inciting also hysteria regarding coal power. We seem to get there in the same time it would take to build and upgrade our nuclear powerplants.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm heavily on the visualization side.  
 
It's really difficult for me to read books. I make a picture/movie of a scene immediately and every detail which is revealed later makes me visualize the whole scene again.  It's very frustrating. Reading papers is really easy for me but writing them is difficult because it's hard for me to find the right words. I don't think in words I thinks in logic association. That's also why I'm bad or better slow at debating. Describing things takes a long time for me. It's as easy for me to remember numbers as it is for me to learn names. Makes remembering passwords really easy. It's easy for me to take things in but every way to communicate or express those things is difficult and it seems muted. I envy artists for being able to do it but I loose my patience.

One time in my German class(I'm German) we talked about the origin of language. I remember one girl seriously saying we can't think without language. I was shocked, because it's was unimaginable for me to just use word or language. This was the first time I was made aware of the fact that It is a spectrum.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I did go to school in the 00s.
 
Violent video games were blamed for the shootings.
Some teachers took that very serious. When the teacher caught wind that we played them the parents were informed and we had to write essays on why they are bad. Meanwhile we played counterstrike on the school computers with some other teachers. Fun times. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A lot of them seem to dig holes which is incredibly ugly, and seem to be somewhat rude oftentimes. They seem to assume everyone in the Netherlands speaks German, not even asking if you do before starting their German rant. 
  
Sounds like the behave exactly like they do on the German coast.

They seem to be very annoyed on Mallorca.

<TEXT> I would say to most here the separation seems a bit unnecessary, rules/laws should be followed and there are many idiots on both sides.
It's not that we don't get that Catalonia is very different, we just don't really think it would be beneficial for anybody involved.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> [PA]Wireless in ear replacement for Sony MDR-EX650AP </TITLE>
<DATE> 2018-07-13 23:47:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **Budget:** Up to 200 (Germany)

**Source/Amp** \- Bluetooth Samsung Galaxy S8 and Surface book 2

**How the gear will be used** \- Home and travel usage. Good sound isolation and only little sound leakage. I want use them for listening to music and watch some movies/Videos either at home or while traveling at the Airport or sitting at home. They need to be Wireless because the headphone jack position on the surface book sucks and I need more freedom. One charge should last for more than 5h. They should also be in ears because of size and I also want more freedom for head movement when I'm relaxing in bed for example. Being able to use them while doing sport is a nice plus but very low on the priority list. I wont do any phone calls with them.

**Preferred tonal balance** \- Im not a bass-head, I like a clear sound.

**Preferred music genre(s)** \- Metal, Rock, Classic. To name a few: Led Zeppelin, Eagles, Black Sabath, Godsmack, Marylin Manson, Rammstein, Babymetal, Cult to Follow, Blind Guardian, Hans Zimmer, John Williams, Howard Shore, Johann Sebastian Bach, Ludwig van Beethoven aso. 

**Past** **gear experience**  \- My main pair of headphones are Sennheiser HD598 which are great. The current IEM I want to replace are Sony MDR-EX650AP which are sturdy af. Im lacking in in-ear experience because i simply used the ones which came with  apple devices for years and then I bought the Sony's after to many of them broke down. I have listened to quite a few headphone and dac/amps but not many in ears.

**What** **aspect of your current listening experience would you like to improve?** I want to hear "more", than I currently do with my Sony MDR-EX650AP while also loosing the wires.  </TEXT>

*Silent  
 
*If possible 32GB RAM at 3200Mhz

*Enough power for a RX Vega card  
  
*At least a 80+ Gold PSU
   
I want to do an Ryzen/Vega build for my 1440p 144Hz FreeSync Monitor. This build will be purchased after the AIB RX vega cards hit the shelfs (early september i hope). When RX Vega will absolutly fail I will change the GPU to a 1080ti if I can find one in the right price range, even though i didn't like Nvidia cards/software in the past. The main parts Im unsure about are the mainboard, RAM and PSU. 
  
I like to tinker around with PC components so tweaking isn't a problem (bios update, overlclocking and so on).
I have done Ryzen builds in the past but not with a budget this high, thats why I want to be sure and asking /r/buildapc. Any kind of advice is welcome.

<TITLE> Bad experiences with questionable PC builders </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-06-20 14:13:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I thought I would share a story about why you shouldn't buy custom PC's from stores if you don't know much about the subject.  
 
The story began after a friend ascended in 2011. 
  
Since had witnessed the glory of PC gaming for the first time, he wanted a gaming PC. So he checked online some requirements for the games he wanted to play. Then he went to the next best PC seller he knew and got himself a gaming rig at a somewhat reasonable Price. The specs on paper were a decent intel CPU(cant remember exacly which), 4Gb ram and a 560ti. He didn't wanted me to build his PC, because he wanted a warranty for the whole system and didn't wanted the hassle with troubleshooting. For a few weeks he played non demanding games like AoE and so on, but then Battlefield 3 was about to release. He downloaded the beta and suprise it didn't work. After telling me the specs he invited me to help getting the beta to run, which i did. The first thing I did was checking if the monitor was plugged in the mainboard. You know the typical rookie mistake. It was. But then I saw that the 560ti was missing. I asked were it was and he just showed me the bill which contained the 560ti.  
  
On the same day we went to the store and demanded the GPU, but the salesman refused even though we showed him the computer with the metal covers still on the case. After a short rant I demanded to see the manager. I made him check his whole inventory. There it was one spare 560ti! He offered to build it into his Pc, but I just took it. 
 
Ok until this point the store just could have make a mistake without malicious intend.  
 
Then my friend told me his neighbour recomended this shop to him. He also recently bought a PC there. 
Of course I asked him what specs he had. Same processor, ram but a 560 non ti (both were non oem). He paid a little more for it than my friend, despite both systems having the same Hardware/Software except GPU and were aviable to him for the current prices. The reason for why he bought the weaker system was that the salesmen told him the 560 was newer and therefore better.  
 
Now both of have rigs which they build themself with my help.  
 
The moral of the story is don't buy stuff without any knowledge about the subject or consult an independent third party.  
 
TL;DR: Friend and his neighbour got screwed over by a shady system seller. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In May 2017, many pieces of information regarding the RX Vega series was unveiled, including the names of the cards in the lineup, the prices and approximate release date set to be in June 2017.  
  
  
Thats why you shouldn't trust wiki without looking at the sources. (cough Wccftech cough)
Maybe someone should update the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD_Radeon_400_series#Vega) . </TEXT>
