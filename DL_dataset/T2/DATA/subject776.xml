<TEXT> Its different depending on where youre from, but Im Australian and I just had to tell my GP that I thought I had ADHD and why, she then gave me a referral to a psychiatrist, and he asked me what I had been doing to deal with my symptoms and basically decided that I had already been doing everything that he would get a patient to try before going on meds, so he gave me a script for 30mg of vyvanse that same day. </TEXT>

I dont want to pay another $9 for shipping to order some more, and I cant find anywhere that stocks Wella developer in store near me, but since its just for bleach, does the brand really matter? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thats actually basically the half of year 10 english syllabus now, and I dont think thered be any value in extending it any further because you can only get so much from that exercise, the answers always going to be some sort of rendition of different sources have different biases. Analysing something as abstract as poetry gives students room to be creative and personal with their interpretations, and allows teachers to explore a much larger range of ideas and concepts.

EDIT: I do agree that the way english is taught at the moment is not the best for students, but I think the solution is in giving students more freedom and independence in what and how they study (the extension 1 and 2 courses would be a great framework) and actually communicating *why* studying english is important, because its super understandable why so many people have the same opinion as you, and coming into class with that mindset really hinders what youre going to be capable of </TEXT>

<TEXT> You analyse poetry to develop skills in critical thinking and analysis. The medium itself may be pretty useless in day-to-day life, but thats not the point. 

Its like how math is to develop your ability to problem solve. Memorising the cosine rule doesnt actually matter, but understanding when and how to apply it trains your brain to operate in a way which allows you to excel in so many aspects of academic and personal life </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, I get that its supposed to show that some students have the ability to synthesise any given analysis on the spot, but in making it so specific, the kids without those skills can hardly even attempt the question. And those kids without the skills arent even necessarily bad at english, they just take a different approach. If it were the case that good english students could bullshit an analysis on the spot, extension 2 wouldnt be a year long major work. </TEXT>

I hadnt actually had a real look at the question itself and my opinion was just based on the reactions Id seen from people at the time, who seemed to be more concerned with the fact they had to analyse a vague text, and that it was written by an aboriginal woman (from the sexist/racist attacks on twitter/hsc discussion groups) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just reading what you said just snapped me back into a normalish headspace ahaha thank you. Here I was expecting my TDEE to drop to like 600, a number pulled completely out of my ass

In the complete absence of thyroid hormone, basal metabolic rate or resting energy expenditure could be re- duced by 30% or more [source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/13102818.2005.10817207) 

Its only one source, so Ill look into it more later but according to this, in the absolute *worst* case scenario, my BMR would be 950-1050, and I do 2 hours of cardio a day so my TDEE would still be like ~1400, which is just about what I eat at the moment. Fuck thats a relief lol </TEXT>

<TEXT> I definitely wasnt planning on taking vyvanse on the same day, the reason Im curious though is because I didnt take it before the MDMA either, so I think my neurochemistry has changed since I started meds. And If thats the case Im trying to figure out if that means I cant have a pure experience of anything, if that makes sense? 

I definitely agree with you on the pharmaceutical industry, and I would love to live in a world without the corruption and malpractice that support it, but that world wouldnt be have a structure that requires me to need the medication to function within it in the first place lol (sorry if that is incoherent, Im trying to watch tv and type at the same time lol) 
I definitely recommend reading [this](http://www.abct.org/docs/PastIssue/38n7.pdf) edition of the Behavior Therapist if you havent already, it really opened my eyes to how fucked everything is. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1555 isnt over eating, its likely that its below your TDEE, which would be under eating

and in the case that its above or equal to your TDEE, chances are youve been eating much less for an extended period of time, which means that your body still has to recover. One day of eating at maintenance isnt going to cancel out any of the damage done from weeks of restriction

to feel a little better, try getting some electrolytes in you,
basically youre just looking for sodium (salty foods), potassium (fruits), calcium (dairy), magnesium (green veggies, nuts), and phosphorus (white meat, nuts, dairy) </TEXT>

But back to what youre actually here for, hourglass makes *amazing* eyebrow pencils, theyre pricy (50AUD) but Ive tried literally every major pencil money can buy and theyre the only ones I cant break, they also have wayyy more product than similarly sized pencils so it costs less in the long term </TEXT>

<TEXT> I turn 18 on the 5th of June 2020 and Im trying to register to vote. Im a US citizen, but Ive lived in Australia all my life. The last address my parents held is in North Carolina, and according to [FVAP](https://www.fvap.gov/citizen-voter/reside) Im eligible to vote absentee, but on [the NCSBE site](https://www.ncsbe.gov/Voters/Registering-to-Vote) it says that you must live in the county of registration and have resided there for at least 30 days prior to the election. I assumed that was just talking about state elections, but [Rock The Vote](https://www.rockthevote.org) has the same information.

So my questions are 
1. Am I eligible to vote?
2. Where can I find the correct forms to fill out?

<TEXT> Oh I totally get what you mean, Ive been filling mine in for years and I still feel so daunted when I have to do someone elses ahaha

Its not so much about creating an ideal shape, but rather enhancing what you already have, as thats what will usually work best with your face.

I use a pencil with a chisel tip and use the flat end to sort of underline my brows, this lets me extend them at the front to bring the start above my tear ducts. It also gives me a defined point to make a tail with at the back. Then I go along that line with little flicks following the direction on my natural hair. Its a little tricky to get the hang of at first ahaha the only tip I really have is to use a light hand </TEXT>

Your new hair colour looks great! or I love your outfit! makes them feel good about a choice they made, and they can talk about where they got their inspiration from or something along those lines if they want to keep talking

<TEXT> At the very least, by the time the next election rolls around more of the public will be aware of the facts, and more the younger generation will be able to vote. Politicians will realise their positions are reliant on support from these people and will be forced to reform their platforms to cater to them. Mass protests allow people to realise that theyre not alone in being scared about the future, and theyll be more likely to join forces again in labour strikes that can have a more quantifiable impact. They also remind people of the importance of being politically literate, and give platforms to politicians that are invested in meaningful change. Gathering so many likeminded people gives smaller activist groups access to potential members who would have otherwise never heard of their movement. 

Direct action absolutely has its place, but it will only weaken our cause if it is not backed and organised by groups created out of peaceful, appealing movements like these. </TEXT>

<TEXT> this information is from international averages and are in USD, but the trends are still relevant. [source](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dominicdudley/2019/05/29/renewable-energy-costs-tumble/amp/) 

Hydroelectric power costs $0.05/kWh. Onshore wind, solar photovoltaic, biomass, and geothermal energy cost below $0.10/kWh. However in areas with suitable natural resources (like Australia) onshore wind costs can drop to $0.03-0.04/kWh. Last year alone, the global weighted-average cost of renewable electricity dropped by 14%. Prices for fossil fuels on the other hand, range from $0.05/kWh to $0.15+/kWh, and are only going to rise over time as we deplete out natural resources.

Our dependence on fossil fuels will hurt the Australian economy in the long term. Prices will continue to [rise](https://www.abc.net.au/article/9985300), and this will undeniably hurt low income Australians the most. This can literally be reversed in making the switch to renewables, Australia has the perfect ecosystem to support these systems, implementing them would not only result in lower energy prices, but also in a massive increase in jobs. As technology continues to develop, renewable energy would prove itself as a massively profitable international export, further supporting the economy </TEXT>

While there may be POC and LGBT characters, very few stories focus on the unique experiences people from those backgrounds have. Having a cast that look diverse is important, but it's the bare minimum in representation. Marginalized people experience the world differently from those in the majority, and these perspectives should be represented just as much as any other.  
  
No ones asking for a disabled Tony Hawk game, theyre asking for a Oksana Masters game.  
  
And for what its worth, the *vast* majority all media that does explore these perspective, does so in an incredibly formulaic, cliche, arguably stereotypical way that is clearly designed to appeal to audiences from outside of those communities. </TEXT>

<TEXT> MOC are such a minority in my area, theyre probably at a similar risk of harassment. I always just assume they feel the same way I do when I see them walking alone at night, and I never feel the unsafe or like I need to cross the street.

I also have a few non-white guy friends, and they all have changed their behaviour in some sort of way to distance themselves from stereotypes, Ive done the same thing as a lesbian. Its sad, but it means theyre more likely to be aware of how their actions look to someone else (ie; speeding up if theyre walking behind me), which also makes the situation less uncomfortable than if it were a white dude

EDIT: sorry for going of on a tangent lol, I dont want to sound like Im invalidating your experiences, people are fucking racist and MOC are undoubtedly vilified, Im wouldnt be at all surprised to see that women feel more unsafe around MOC than white men. </TEXT>

<TEXT> total daily energy expenditure, basically how many calories (energy) you expend (burn) in a day.

so this number includes your BMR (base metabolic rate), which is how many calories you burn just by being alive (like if you were in a coma) along with all the extra calories you burn from not being in a coma, so exercise but also just general movement/functioning 

Say your BMR is 1300, that means that no matter how little you move in a day, you will burn that many calories. Your TDEE will include an additional 50-80% depending on how active you are, putting your TDEE somewhere between 1560-1959

To find their TDEE, a lot of people will calculate it as if they were sedentary (so BMR + 50%), and then manually add on calories burned through exercise. 

TDEE/BMR are just guidelines though, its really hard to get actuate numbers for these things through averages and online calculators as there are a *lot* of factors at play that just cant be adequately accounted for </TEXT>

<TEXT> so it was developed in 2013 by mathematicians (not doctors) to replace the current scale, which supposedly gives short people a lower score and tall people too high a score. 

current formula: BMI = weight(kg)/height(m)^2

new formula: BMI = 1.3*weight(kg)/height(m)^2.5 

however *no* professionals use the new scale in assessing patients body composition, so I choose to ignore it, but Im sure if I were taller Id have a different opinion ahaha </TEXT>

<TEXT> I hope this isnt considered a tip because knowing the calorie math stops me from extreme restricting and comforts me after a binge:

theres 7700 calories is a kilo of fat, but in order to gain that (real, not food/water) weight you have to eat that *on top of* your TDEE (usually 1500-2000) so say you have a 3000 calorie binge, and your TDEE is 1700, only 1300 of those calories counts, and youd gain 1300/7700 = 0.16 kilos (160 grams) 

so if youre trying to figure long itd take you to lose a kilo eating x amount of calories per day, you need to figure out how much your burning per day

if youre TDEE is 1700, and you eat 1200, that puts you at -500 calories per day, 7700/500 = 15.4, so itd take you ~16 days to lose a kilo of actual fat. If you want to lose more than a kilo, just times 7700 by how many you want to lose.

You could also do this is lbs (3500 calories per lb) but the math gets weird with the imperial system and the lb/oz conversion isnt as clean as kg/g. Also, I like working in kilos better because with lbs, small changes are super noticeable </TEXT>

I think a big part of it is that I dont want to be like your friend, I talk about myself a lot in normal conversations but its normally just because I remembered a funny story or Im being self-deprecating. So I dont want to come off as self centred, and I think if I just vent at my friends Itll feel like Im using them. So like the logical solution would be to get them to open up to me first, but I dont like asking other people about themselves, because I feel like if they wanted to tell me something, they would have already, and by asking Im overstepping/being annoying. I know thats not the case though now and I should just ask them, but I dont know how to start those conversations </TEXT>

<TEXT> The number of strip searches have increased 20-fold in NSW, Australia over the past 12 years. From 277 times in 2006, to 5483 in 2018. 

Nothing is found 65% of the time, and of that, only 20% of cases ever result in criminal charges.   
Further, of the 91% of searches are conducted to find prohibited drugs, only 30% have resulted in charges.

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders account for 10% of recorded strip searches, despite only making up 3.3% of the population.

[Another source](https://www.news.com.au/national/nsw-act/news/nsw-police-officers-are-increasingly-conducting-unlawful-strip-searches-experts-find/news-story/2ef73aff0a1f6d01f4aa7a7b1bb07b6e) 

Facebook page [Sniff Off](https://www.facebook.com/sniffoff/) documents hundreds of strip search operations across the state, many of which are during peak commuter hours at Sydney train stations.

These searches are also illegal. NSW law only allows for strip searches to be conducted  "in serious and urgent circumstances that make it necessary".  82% of all charges laid are for possession of a prohibited drug not indented for supply. Carrying drugs for ones own personal use is neither serious nor urgent.

<TEXT> he specialises in ADHD, ADS, and tourettes, (I have ADHD) and Im like 99% certain he has absolutely no clue about eating disorders, or fuck even just teenage girls

I weighed in last month after a fucking monstrous feed and when he looked at the scale and saw it was up 4kg from last time (100% water+food weight, the day before I hit a LW by 0.1g lmao) and he was visibly shook and started talking about the implications of being on the upper end of BMI scale (keep in mind this weight put me at like 20) and binge eating, and like, what? who says that? *that is now how you handle this situation dude*

I didnt care but all I could think about was what if I werent me? From the posts here I know for a fact that that would have *fucked up* a lot of people with eating disorders, and Im just lucky that mine manifests the way it does. 

If I did need treatment for my ED, I could probably figure out a way to see a psychologist without letting my current doctors know that Im seeing them about ED stuff, its just frustrating that I have to go through the back door you know? Im actually trying to see one now anyway since Ive realised that psychiatry is basically pseudoscience and the only thing its good for its drugs, but idk how long Ill have to wait since theres hardly any that 1. know what ADHD is (?) and 2. know its not just a disorder for shitty 7 year old boys. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Im on meds that suppress appetite as a side effect, and since going on them I dropped a fuck load of weight, and my psychiatrist and GP are suspicious that I might have an eating disorder. Youd think that in identifying that a patient is at a high risk of developing a serious mental illness, that you would refer them to see a specialist to work through any potential issues before they arise, but fuckin NOPE all I get is a warning that if I drop below *x* weight, Im off my meds. Thats it. No help. Just an ultimatum. Im too afraid to ask for a referral myself, because I feel like theyll take me off my meds. The likelihood of me deciding to recover has absolutely fucking plummeted now that it comes with going off my meds. Its fucking ridiculous, I *know* I could work through this shit with an actual professional, but I have to choose between treating one mental illness or the other. This literally means I wont get help until Im *fucking dying* and I know I cant be the only one in this situation. The entire system is backwards.

<TEXT> I totally agree, and thats why I added the part about them claiming its based on societal standards, maybe its just me but all the posts I see are about how they wanted to have the ideal body or look like someone else. My ED started because of my ADHD, and I feel like half the people on this sub alone developed theirs from other metal illnesses or trauma, and the for the other half who have theirs out of body image issues, its much more nuanced and complex than simply wanting to look better, but these posts dont go into that, they talk about the media and diet culture and leave it at that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Recovery posts on instagram that are just before and after shots of the posters body piss me off.

Youd think that in overcoming their eating disorder -so well in fact that they feel they need to use it to inspire others- that they would have learned that their worth is not determined by the extent to which they conform to conventional standards of beauty. That their worth can not be determined by the shape of their body. But youd be wrong.

So, to the girls on my feed;

If you really want to help others like you say you so desperately do, dont talk about how you got to the before photo by running *exactly this far* and eating *exactly this much* or how you got to the more socially acceptable, gymshark sponsorship worth body by just *intuitive eating* and only *lifting*. Talk about how your ed slowly isolated you from all the people and things you loved. Talk about how hard it was to finally reach out and get help. Talk about how now youre learning to view yourself as more than just a body. Talk about how you love making others laugh, you love learning, you love meeting new people, you love just existing in nature and being aware of the world around you, whatever the fuck it is- and talk about how because of your ED, which as you say yourself, started because you cared so fucking much about how you looked, you spent *years* you could have been doing what you love, thinking about numbers, and making your mum cry.

You wont though. You dont want to. You just want to talk about how great you look now, and *exactly how thin* you were before. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A study conducted at Harvard Medical School, in 2007, found that girls with ADHD were almost four times more likely to have an eating disorder than those without ADHD. Another empirical study found that 11 percent of women with ADHD, compared to 1 percent of women without, reported a history of bulimia nervosa.

youd also have a plethora of other symptoms, so its unlikely. 

youre almost definitely just holding onto water/food weight. it can take weeks to woosh. it happens if youve had a lot of sodium, not drunk enough water, not eaten enough fibre, if youve started working out more, or stopped working out as much, or changed your workouts, if its near or during your period, and a million other reasons im not even going to pretend to understand

2. will my body be harmed if my eating habits dont change?

3. even if I dont feel like it does right now, does my relationship with food have the potential to effect aspects of my life outside of eating (like determining my self worth, and making me isolate myself from people, interests, and activities) </TEXT>

<TEXT> It sounds like youre uncomfortable with your eating behaviours and that you dont feel like youre fully in control of them. Thats not healthy or normal, so youre eating is disordered.

I personally believe that *specific* eating disorders like anorexia, bulimia, orthorexia, and EDNOS are purely medical tools to describe how someones disordered eating is manifesting at one point in time, and so theyre not useful or relevant outside of a clinical context, as disordered eating behaviours and attitudes are dynamic and highly individual.


All that matters is that youre struggling and you deserve and need support. </TEXT>

I just told her to get out and I just dont know how I feel. I should feel bad for not being able to control my emotions. I should feel bad for speaking to my mum like that. But I dont. And that makes me feel... uncomfortable

I cant decide if sending this message is a good idea or not:

ADHD symptoms from the DSM V:

Inattention:
Note: The symptoms are not a manifestation of oppositional behavior, defiance, hostility, or failure to understand tasks or instructions.

d) Often does not follow through on instructions and fails to finish schoolwork, chores, or duties in the workplace (e.g., starts tasks but quickly loses focus and is easily sidetracked).

g) Often loses things necessary for tasks or activities (e.g., school materials, pencils, books, tools, wallets, keys, paperwork, eyeglasses, mobile telephones).

i) Is often forgetful in daily activities (e.g., doing chores, running errands; for older adolescents and adults, returning calls, paying bills, keeping appointments).

https://images.pearsonclinical.com/images/assets/basc-3/basc3resources/DSM5_DiagnosticCriteria_ADHD.pdf

I *really* dont want her to think Im using my ADHD as an excuse, but I also really dont want her to think Im intentionally not doing things.

<TEXT> I always just say I have disordered eating, and if my doctor decides to put a label on it at different stages thats up to her and just her business. For me at least. I dont really see the value getting caught up in the diagnostic criteria of each specific disorder, especially with the dynamic nature of my own (which sounds similar to yours, almost like, scarily ahaha we have the exact same stats and history minus me being a year older).

But it sounds those labels are important to you though, and Im not trying to invalidate that at all. Disorders, especially those developed in formative years, are naturally going to a part of peoples identity, and if finding the right terms makes it easier for you, you do you, but I just thought Id offer an second perspective :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Or stricter driving laws. Over here, if you are caught so much as touching your phone outside of a cradle while the car is on, even if stopped, you lose 3 to 5 demerit points and a $250 - $577 fine (170 - 391USD), depending on the state. And in NSW theyre rolling out cameras that can detect if people are in their phones. While Ive only been driving for a couple months (Im 17) I live in a pretty metro area, and I have never seen a person use their phone while the car is moving (some use it in traffic or at lights though) so it must be working at least a little bit

Also, with drink driving, in NSW if youre caught with a BAC over 0.05, you now lose your license on the spot </TEXT>

<TEXT> Im 17 but when I was 12ish I would sometimes sneak my ipod at night, then one day my parents noticed and started taking it away at 9pm, from then I was even more determined to get it back and I would sneak it on nights I normally wouldnt have, just to spite them. It was super petty but thats how 12 year olds are. I wish parents had instead tried to cooperate with me to find some sort of middle ground, their trust in me would have boosted my confidence, and my sleep schedule would be much healthier. Maybe suggest that she can stay up half an hour later given that her phones in your room all night, and then if she keeps that up for a week or so (a week is a long time for a 12 year old) then maybe she can be trusted to keep it in the lounge room without you having to guard it. </TEXT>

Its not that bad and its easy to cover up, but it seems like it could be something that is easily fixed, I just dont know where to start.

The photos above were taken on a good day btw, about half the time its a fair bit more red.

**My current routine (normal-dry skin, 17F):**

AM:

**Grown Alchemist** *Hydra Repair Day Cream*

PM:

**Mario Badescu** *Seaweed Cleansing Soap*

**Grown Alchemist** *Hydra Repair Day Cream*

I used to use **The Ordinary** *Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution*, which evened out my skintone on the rest of my face, but it was too harsh and didnt do much for my chin so Ive stopped </TEXT>

Im a lesbian, and one of the loudest, most opinionated people youll meet. I dont give a second thought to yelling at racists or transphobes, but as soon as someone says something homophobic I shut up. I just physically bring myself to say anything. I think its because *Im* in danger now. The same thing happens to a lesser extent with misogynists, I think its less intense though because while women are oppressed, there are much more of us around that other minority groups. </TEXT>

Dont really see the drug dealer thing you were talking about though, you just look like a normal kid to me

I can totally see you growing into your looks, not to say you look bad now, youre just super young. 

Its hard and cliche but try not to get caught up about this stuff too much, just be kind to yourself

sidenote though, youve got great skin now but if you start too get acne, get on that shit asap with a dermatologist. I started meds for my skin at your age and it changed my life, Im so glad I didnt ignore it because Ive seen how bad skin can really knock down people. Also your eyebrows are super nice, it can be weird for dudes but maybe think about shaping them when youre a bit older, its *crazy* how much good brows improve peoples looks </TEXT>

<TEXT> I go to a selective high school so thats definitely gonna skew my perspective, but I have heaps of derro friends so hopefully that evens me out a bit ahaha

most people start drinking in at the end of year 9, and from then everyone gets smashed every weekend lmao but for the most part people are aware of the risks and try to minimise them, like ive never heard of anyone drink driving, and most people i know keep track of their standards, mainly just to flex lol but still. Also most peoples parents are cool with it which is wonderful </TEXT>

<TEXT> A lot of people are put off tofo since its texture and flavour can make it tricky to prepare correctly at home. Try some at a restaurant first so you can get an idea of how it can taste when its cooked well, and if you like it you can focus on learning how to do it yourself :)

Also, if you are looking to lose weight, r/1200isplenty has some great low calorie recipes. However, 1200 calories is very low for most people, and the community can be a little worrying sometimes, so I would really recommend just using it for meal inspiration rather than getting super into the culture. </TEXT>

<TEXT> snuck out to sydney for the night (alone) with a ticket for an 18+ gig I bought that morning. My ID didnt work but I had already taken 2 caps that were kicking in so I decided to try and keep the night going. I sort of just roamed around for a bit talking to groups of drunk people outside of bars/clubs. I jumped the fence to one and managed to stay there for about half an hours before getting kicked out, this guy left with me and I followed him to this car where he picked up like a shit load of ket, I did a bump and then left lol. I ended up finding this group of very wholesome looking friends on the side of the road, this huge dude was passed out cold and his 100lb girlfriend and this 55 asain dude were freaking out and didnt know what to do since no cab would take them and all of their phones were dead. I walked over and called the non-emergency line for them and had a chat, I gave the asain guy my number and told him to let me know how his friend goes. I took another cap and left. I found these two older (30s?) ladies outside of an karaoke bar and they snuck me inside to their work christmas party lmao which was honestly so fun. Then the asain guy calls me and asks if I want to meet at this one 24/7 maccas, and so I leave the bar and while Im waiting for him I get to talking to this group of very messy gay dudes and turns out one of them works for heaps gay and he gives me his number (he got me into his float for mardi gras a couple months later!) anyway so the guy I was waiting for shows up and he had 2 more caps and we took one each and its only then I realise that the last train was 4 hours ago lmao but its fine because this guy says that I can crash at his. Hes got literally the cutest little townhouse and we stayed up all night just hanging out and he taught me how to blow up my own nags so I can stop being a scab lol and then before we know it its 5am and the first train home is close, he walked me to the station and I got an hours sleep on the train. I caught a bus back to mine and told my parents the sleepover at my best friends house was fun lmao </TEXT>

Its not *wrong* and some people even prefer it, but it makes a lot of people feel uncomfortable. So in my opinion at least, if theres a word you could use that doesnt risk make people feel that way,  using that instead is the polite thing to do. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Its not a huge deal and sorry to sound pedantic, but you sound like the type of person whod appreciate being corrected here

transsexual is a pretty outdated term, its not a slur or anything but since historically its been used by transphobes a lot of trans people are uncomfortable with it.

It also sounds like homosexual or bisexual, which can confuse some people into thinking its a sexuality.

Transgender or even just trans is the most accepted term :) </TEXT>

A nice person would give your friend more than the 100K, it's not the *right* thing to do, but it is the nice thing to do. But your friend sounds like a dick.

At my job I have to talk to large groups of people, and saying ok guys to get everyone to listen up has never made anyone feel confused or excluded, whereas saying ok girls, would.

If I were trying to address the men in the room separately, saying ok guys would not be effective. So I say ok boys/dudes, which is much more adjacent to ok girls than ok guys

<TEXT> I went to the doctors to renew a prescription and as that was wrapped up she asked me if I had anything else I needed to ask about, and I said something along the line off um yeah actually sorry this is kinda weird but I was talking to my friends and kind of feel down a rabbit hole online, and I think I might have ADHD? and she asked why and I had a list of things I do that I thought could be explained by ADHD, and she said that she thought I might be onto something and gave me a referral to a physiatrist.

When I saw him, I had the list ready again but I didnt really need it since the questions he asked kind of covered everything. He saw that I had already been using the strategies he would suggest someone use before they try medication, so he felt comfortable in giving me a prescription then and there if I was comfortable. Before that I hadnt mentioned medication at all. 

He mentioned 2 other types of meds (definitely adderall, and either concerta or ritalin) but he said that he thought vyvanse would be the best for me, and even though Ive had to go up in dosage every single time I check in with him, he hasnt said anything about trying the others.

Im not sure why you want adderall specifically, but if its genuinely wanting treatment for ADHD, I reckon you should avoid asking for specifics and just let them decide what they think would be most suitable for you </TEXT>

<TEXT> NAH I can see how you could be uncomfortable with the situation, as long as you were respectful in breaking off the relationship I dont see any issues here

12 years is already a very long time for anyone, but at such a young age its even more intense, even if it wasnt entirely committed and serious, it was during a time of serious development and growth for her. Personally, I think she probably needs to give herself time to fully process the situation and learn to more about herself before jumping headfirst into another relationship,

EDIT: Scratch all of that, I just saw your username, if your real issue is that you think shes any less of a person because of her relationship history, youre a massive, misogynistic asshole and Im glad for her sake that you broke up </TEXT>

<TEXT> not that it really matters since its clear what youre saying, but if you care;

it would be grammatically correct to say cost $60 a year 

when youre talking about price of something, the word cost doesnt change in tense forms

eg; it costs/cost/has cost me five dollars.

however, if youre talking about the action of determining the price of something, costed is appropriate as past tense

eg; the project was costed (out) at $2.5 million </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree, I only follow people I know, its easy to avoid toxic influencers and manipulative ads if you dont let them into your feed. I dont understand why people complain about this stuff when *theyre* the ones who decided to follow these accounts in the first place.

My feed is just photos and videos of friends, I dont get to see a lot of them as much as I would like and socials let us stay in each others consciousnesses, so were less likely to drift apart.

I post whatever I want, I dont think about likes, or themes, or followers, or whatever, its just a photo album of all the shit Ive gotten up to with my friends over the years. I really enjoy looking back on it, and looking back on my friends old posts and seeing how we all have grown as people over the years

Social media can be toxic and horrible, but only if you let it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Unfortunately the ACT isnt reflective of the rest of the states :( 

The NSW state government is awful, recently theres been a massive increase in sniffer dog and police at festivals, concerts, and the train stations nearby, its disgusting, people are getting strip searched and kicked out with no evidence to support them having/being on drugs. All this shit is likely to settle down when leadership changes, but the conservatives just won the election so its going to be a while :/

To be fair though, the punishments for actually being caught with drugs is pretty lenient/reasonable (well, compared to the US) they only really crack down on producers/large dealers. 

Were also super strict on border security since our ecosystem is so fragile, so just about everything that comes into the country is screened making it almost impossible to get drugs online, and while that is frustrating, its a tiny price to pay for preventing invasive species and all that stuff so its hard to be too mad </TEXT>

<TEXT> basically in 2017 the conservative party was in power and decided to hold a nation wide survey asking if SSM should be legal, and you had to be enrolled to vote in regular elections, so thousands of young people registered

So now the conservative party is fucked because young people vote against them, and theyre the reason we now have a record high number of young voters </TEXT>

<TEXT> Groovin the Moo! It tours to 6 regional Australian cities, but the pill testing is only available in Canberra. This will be its second year running, [last year](https://mobile.abc.net.au/news/2018-04-30/groovin-the-moo-pill-testing-finds-lethal-product/9710112?pfmredir=sm) 85 pills were tested and 2 were found to be deadly, everyone who got a pill tested was given an armband, and none of them ended up having to receive any medical attention. The staff at the tent also consulted with 128 people about drug use. The main problem though is that the tent was very hard to find, I didnt take any pills last year so I wasnt really looking for it, but there were no signs or anything, another problem was the police presence, the cops had to vow not to target people at the tent/with armbands, but I didnt know about this until *after* the festival. One arrest was made but it was a guy with 18 pills and some powder, so not just some unluky kid at least. Overall it was a huge success and I really hope it can spread outside of the ACT! </TEXT>

Just from your face it looks like youre a little bit heavier, but again, its really not bad at all and there definitely are girls who prefer cute to hot, it makes you look more approachable. But if you want to go for a more chiseled look, it doesnt look like a lot of weight to lose so it should be pretty easy

Overall you are definitely not ugly, just going through a little bit of that awkward state everyone has when theyre in high school, legit 100% if you keep taking care of yourself you will grow into your looks and be very attractive in a year or two </TEXT>

<TEXT> Normally I can stop a binge in its tracks by drinking 1L of water, going for a walk, and drinking tea (with milk and sugar) or hot chocolate, this kind of eliminates the possibility of it being a boredom/craving binge, and lets me feel a little more comfortable with eating more since I feel like I need it. So if Im still struggling after all that, I decide how many calories im ok with, normally at or slightly above my TDEE, and I make sure to drink loads of water in between foods. Once I hit my limit I have another mug of tea/hot chocolate and go to my room to get away from any other foods, I never eat in my room so that I dont associate being in there with food.

What works for me is changing the urge to bing away from being a loss of control, and instead towards a form of fucked up self care, 

I remind myself that eating around my TDEE for a day will not make me gain real weight, its just like pressing the pause button on losing, and that the reason I want to binge is because my body needs nutrients, and because I cant eat this much every day, I need to be mindful about my choices. </TEXT>

Mention that youve noticed that shes been behaving in a similar way to how you have, and that youre a little worried. Let her know that she doesnt have to talk to you, but if she did, all you would do is listen and support her, you would never try and force her to do anything she wasnt comfortable with.

Depending on her personality, it might be best to send this as a text, I know I personally wouldnt let you get past the first sentence IRL, but I would hear you out if I had time to read and gather my thoughts.

<TEXT> for me the walking is really just useful as a way to practice mindfulness, so in your case maybe the traditional sit down and do nothing method is the way to go (god knows i do enough of that already lol)

and with water, for me having an app to log how many times i finished my drink bottle was insanely helpful, i used Daily Reminder - Drink Water, but now i just use my fitbit </TEXT>

but Im worried for you. You say that since youve started dating youve distanced yourself from your friends, and now hes flat out not allowing you to hang out with them. I dont know all the ins and outs of your situation, but your partner should not be controlling who youre spending time with. If I were you, Id talk to him about how he needs to trust you with these guys, and how important it is for you to stay friends with them. If he doesnt respect that, you should probably seriously reconsider your relationship. </TEXT>

Guys already have fucked hormones/sexual responses at that age, which often leads to situations like yours through nothing other than biology, and that combined with the insane pressure hes under, both from wanting to please you and from wanting to live, makes it a perfect storm for this sort of thing.

I reckon you should doctor and try to push forward the appointment, and if you cant, call your GP and talk to them.

In 14 participants, drinking 16.9 ounces (0.5 liters) of water increased their metabolic rate by 30% for 3040 minutes [source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14671205) 

In 21 overweight children, drinking 0.3 ounces of water per 2.2 pounds of body weight (10 ml/kg) increased their metabolic rate b by 25% for 40 minutes [source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21750519)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree with space whale, but of you dont get answers here, you will most likely just ask other fitness forums and get the same information without the context of an ED, with could potentially be incredibly damaging to your health.

Lap swimming burns more calories than running as it engages your entire body, but it is very low impact and therefore ideal for people suffering with an eating disorder. Please take care of yourself, try to help yourself get to a place where you can ask for help. </TEXT>

<TEXT> what qualifies as a binge is very dependent on the individual, some people refer to eating more than their allotted calories is a binge, whereas to others the amount of calories doesnt matter, its all about feeing like you have no control over what your eating 

but if you want a concrete definition, the DSM5 defines binge eating (in the context of BED) as: 

- Eating, in a discrete period of time (e.g. within any 2-hour period), an amount of food that is definitely larger than most people would eat during a similar period of time and under similar circumstances.

- A sense of lack of control over eating during the episode (e.g. a feeling that one cannot stop eating or control what or how much one is eating).

The binge eating episodes are associated with three or more of the following:

- eating much more rapidly than normal

- eating until feeling uncomfortably full

- eating large amounts of food when not feeling physically hungry

- eating alone because of feeling embarrassed by how much one is eating

- feeling disgusted with oneself, depressed or very guilty afterward </TEXT>

all you have to do is make sure the person you are flirting with feels like they can reject you at any time with no consequences, that sounds a little harsh but I just mean that there has to be something external going on that can serve as a life boat to the other person if they feel unsafe (because its entirely possible that while you may have completely innocent intentions, they misread your body language or have had personal issues that make them more likely to be highly cautious of men) so this can be as simple as asking them out in a busy public space, giving them your number (not asking for theirs), the friend thing a person above suggested, and heaps more but im sure you get the idea </TEXT>

<TEXT> I already commented this but a lot of people seemed to appreciate the reminder 

you need to eat 3500 calories in addition to your TDEE to gain a pound of real weight (not food/water weight)

so if your TDEE is 1500, you need to eat 5 entire dominos value range brucetta pizzas in order to gain one single pound of fat.

if you have to eat more than youd like over the holidays, its ok, youll bounce back. Just stay away from the scale for a couple of days while your body settles

you will be ok x </TEXT>
