<TEXT> When I was younger I had recurring nightmares of awful things. Walking through my living room and being tickled mercilessly by some ghost creature. There was a ghost whose would hurt my family if I said his name. Along with these recurring nightmares the house smelled like worcestershire, and we absolutely could not find the source of it. I was about 8, I dont believe in supernatural stuff, but god that house and time of my life is an exception. </TEXT>

Sometimes Id lock it more frequently or longer if they werent dying enough. Id breed the ones who were the farthest away from dying of starvation when another sim dies. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Im also 30 days out! No kids to entertain here, but I do need to keep myself occupied or Ill go crazy with anticipation. Im on mobile, cant format very well at all, sorry in advance lol. Some ideas would be to make your own Minnie ears, and I believe you can write a letter to Mickey and the gang and theyll send you one back. You could color in a Disney coloring book. Make a fun countdown, maybe with a paper chain or something. Talk about everything youre excited about, and what kind of pins will be the best to find.

Edit: sorry, just realized you already said coloring pages. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Probably men? Being birthers we go through a lot. Periods from the age of 11-12. When we dont have those anymore we have menopause. We have to worry about HPV and TSS. Birth control. I dont want to say we are more emotionally unstable but... idk I think I do want to say that. I think men are angrier. We have very high standard that we are made to feel we need fit. I acknowledge that men also have issues and they are all very valid, but damn us bitches got it hard. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ill make them up on the spot. 

1- Treat yourself within reason. 
2- Dont get yourself into a situation where you need someone to rely on. Work on yourself to get out of that situation. 
3- Dont give people the pleasure of letting them get to you. 
4- Be kind!
5- Pull your weight. 
6- Dont spend what you dont have. 
7- Dont mind ANYONES opinions about you. 
8- Remember you are not your feelings. They will pass. 
9- Know that you are in control of your actions
10- Know that you dont know as much as you think you know
11- Remember that you have no idea what somebody else is going through. 
12- There are no rules. Do what you want.

Ive heard the horror stories, and Im still going through with it. The idea of actually having a good (a 3$ raise from what Im doing now, and twice the hours) job brings me so much joy for now.  So, what are your tales from the call center? Or, when did you get the first job you felt was good, and what was it? </TEXT>

They were both men that seemed to be a bit off. The first one seemed anti social and just plain weird. He was a bit more invasive, asking where I went to school, if I graduated, what my last name is, etc.  The second guy seemed like he mightve been on drugs. He had his son there and the kid was saying dad Im tired and want to go home he was also saying dad thats not a basketball as his dad was playing with a playground ball thing. Irrelevant details, but strange nonetheless. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Probably the no experience part. I really dont mind. The mod is the only one whose opinion matters. I mean, the community opinion matters, but I think everyone who found this thread so late are just people trying to get some power. 

Everyone is about enforcing rules and I get it, I would do that too. I wouldnt just be a police officer though, I would try to get some kind of organization. #voteforihateyou10012019 </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey! I have absolutely no experience with being a moderator. :) After asking about getting a chat room set up for us simmers, I was curious about what was going on with the mods of the group. Checked out the profiles and here I am. I did indeed set up a discord which is slowly getting rolling. Just an 18 y.o. girl working part time who is obsessed with The Sims 4. I lurk this subreddit every chance I get.

If it doesnt sound too intrusive, I would create a thread asking the community how they feel about having certain weekly threads to try and keep the repetitive posts down. It would be a democracy not a dictatorship. 

TL;DR- I have no experience. What I do have is a passion for the sims, this community, and too much free time. DM if youd like to bring me aboard. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oof. One game I put a teen and her parents in an apartment. The father started having an affair with the next door neighbor, eventually having a baby with her. I made the wife walk in on them, get very sad, and file for a divorce. I moved him into the baby mommas house. The daughter was filled with angst and got turned into a vampire. 

Another save is a mental hospital. I have a small house with the bare necessities filled with erratic sims. Well, I call it my hunger games. I lock the kitchen until one starved to death (or 2, or 3). I see who had the longest amount of time left before starvation, and have them reproduce by playing with genetics. Theyre too miserable to woohoo. 

I just started the 100 baby challenge in my most recent save! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I recently got both as my only EP. I like City Living a bit more. Making a 5-star celebrity is fun the first time. I really love the apartments and the festivals because I have a hard time being social on the sims. It sounds like get famous may suit you better though! I like City Livings world better than Del Sol valley. My advice is to watch some reviews and see in depth what each one offers. </TEXT>

She spends her night doing homework and hanging out with her neighbor, and I think a random townie? Im not sure if he lives in the city yet. His name is Akira, hes a young adult, and shes in love. When she ages up they will definitely (maybe) ((hopefully)) be a thing. She flirts with him through compliments and hugs right now. I also got vampires. I dont want to be bit though because I love the festivals and I think theyre all outdoors! :( also got laundry stuff </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry for poor quality image. I have a full house of mental hospital patients. I give them a disorder and stereotypical traits to go with it. (Depression; gloomy. Binge eating disorder; glutton. Narcissistic; self assured). They are all erratic. I lock the kitchen for 24 hours or until somebody starves to death. Then I look at who had the most hours to go before they starved to death and play with their genetics, breeding a stronger contestant. 

I have issues and way too much fun. </TEXT>

I watched a lot of reviews and Im happy with my choice :). Owning a restaurant also is something Id really like to do. Im not crazy about the laundry day idea, so I went with the pack with i butler for my famous chicks. For 10 extra dollars than an expansion pack, my impatience thinks its a good deal. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Everyone is complaining. :( I completely get it, dont get me wrong, but so far all Ive had is the base game and I still spend hours on it at a time. I actually bought it on Xbox years ago, just recently downloaded on PC because its free right now and Ive put in 6 hours so far. I get bored playing for long periods of time on Xbox. On PC the introduction of cheats keeps me interested longer. What theyre doing works, and I am falling for it and plan on buying Get Famous. I just like the game and dont mind paying for what I would like to add to the game.  I see where everyone is coming from, and I think I just feel like a dummy for actually buying the base game. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel like I need a more complex mood tracker than what Ive seen so far. Maybe a section for contributing factors, and more than just one emotion a day. As for habits, during my first few months I probably wont bother with a habit tracker. I dont have many to keep up with. Im thinking a sleep tracker as well because I sleep far too much and I need to change that. It will be rewarding to see myself getting better on paper. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I dont think Ive ever heard that song, but it sounds like I need to give it a listen. Thats a great quote. 

The only things I plan to use right now are a yearly overview, a monthly, weekly, and definitely a mood tracker. The last thing I want is for it to become a chore. Im going to use the basic system as a guide and set it up in a way that I think will work for me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you! I think if I feel like its ugly I might get discouraged because everyone elses look so neat and pretty. Im going to start small and simple to avoid that and make sure its a habit I keep and enjoy. I just need some organization and productivity in my life, Im hoping this is it! 

Thank you for the advice :D </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey all! I have a new journal coming in the mail and I absolutely cant wait for it to get here! I have some questions for you guys. When and how did you start bullet journaling? When did you start becoming happy with your spreads? Also, what tips and tricks would you give someone just starting out? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Best way to get tickets? Not sure, but me and my boyfriend are going in September. Were staying for 6 nights on property, and after looking at the price difference between 4-day tickets and 5-day tickets, we went with the 5-day tickets. I cant remember how much the difference was, but we thought it was worth it. 

2) Again, Ill share my plans. Maybe they can help you out. Were doing a park a day and a second day at magic kingdom. Im not a Star Wars fan, but I definitely want to do Hollywood studios too! Hopefully it shouldnt be super busy in August/September, even with the opening of SW:GE. I would recommend doing a  park a day, and if its in the budget, do a fifth day with the park that peaks your interest the most. All of the parks have a unique feel, and something special to offer. Keep in mind, if you want fast passes (which you definitely do), you have to pick your park days ahead of time. 30 days prior if you stay off of Disney property or 60 days prior on Disney property. 

3) No comment. Were going to magic kingdom on not MNSSHP days so we can stay and see the fireworks without having to pay to stay!

4) also no comment. Im expecting the worst but hoping for the best. You should have no problem getting IN. 

5) Dont want to feed the parks fake? Avoid buying pins in bulk from retail sites like eBay, Amazon. There a YouTube video I actually watched earlier of a girl ordering one to show you what its like and its pretty interesting to see the quality of those compared to real ones. If you cant wait, I would buy some from the official shopDisney site. If you CAN wait, it will probably be cheaper to buy some around Disney Springs and in the parks. 

Sorry if it seems like I made this all about my trip! I just wanted to share how I went about all of it, in hopes to help you out somewhat.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Girlfriend here, our 4-day trip turned into a 5-day trip after seeing the price difference. I think weve decided 2-days magic kingdom, 2-days Epcot to really absorb all of the fun stuff around the world (and eat our hearts out because of food and wine), and a day at animal kingdom. 

I really like the idea of starting and finishing with Magic Kingdom! Im soo excited and can not stop looking at Disney World stuff.  </TEXT>
