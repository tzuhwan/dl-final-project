<TEXT> Much of Menem's history takes place in what I have thought of as a Waterpunk setting. In part, it is a watery world and most of its great civilizations have been seafaring empires. But the terrestrial technology of these civilizations has also been dedicated to technologies for moving, manipulating, and creating power from water. The oldest forms consist of flood control systems in the desert cities of Qarisa, which captured seasonal flood water for use year round, and later developed additional hydraulics systems to perform work and develop these cities. Elsewhere, the Crown of Agata funded vast aqueduct and canal building projects to take its maritime trade power further inland. I suppose it doesn't share much more with Punk genres beyond that, since I haven't really focused on things like how technologies are used to control populace, but I have spent time on what sort of near-fantasy kinds of things you can build with pre-electric hydraulic power (dams, locks, reservoirs; elevators, mills, weapons...).  
  
Fun side fact: A common idiom in Griana, where Agata's water-building efforts reached their greatest achievements, is "Beware Agatters with shovels, (sails will follow)." The latter portion is usually left unsaid, and the phrase is used to mean "be wary of seemingly innocuous things, they can signal big changes coming." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Quite a number of names for things on Menem/Gashifa have changed over time or fallen out of use, especially following the Second Agata-Jirenes War and the foundation of the World Union. Not least of these is the name *Menem* itself. A Taragat word derived from a phrase meaning "all the seas", *Menem* was the most widely used name for the planet prior to the War, when Agata ruled as a global superpower. In many settings, this name has been replaced with *Gashifa* a Uajiren\* word meaning "place of union" to underscore the new era of solidarity and cooperation.  
  
\* The name Uajiren ("of Jirenes") has itself fallen out of favor, following the 3rd International Linguistic Convention. *Uagashifa* ("of the Union") and *Goshafa* ("Union speech") recognize the international character of the modern language and the influence of many regions on its development. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Only the wealthy can afford to dine on fish from Men Doeth, the Outer Ocean. Menem is a watery world and seafood or freshwater fish are staples of most diets. Most of this comes from inland seas, rivers and bogs, or the tranquil and abundant Men Olre (the Circle Sea), Menem's "inner ocean, warm in the embrace of Her lands"^1. The waters of Men Doeth are vast, relatively uncharted, and frequently storm tossed. The 'common' fish of Menem are plentiful enough to fill Kings' banquet tables, but when conspicuous consumption is a must, the elite can afford to sponsor fishing expeditions into the hazardous waters to bring in more exotic fare. Such catches are usually salted, pickled, or heavily spiced, to preserve them on the long return journeys. Sharks and small whales are particular favorites, served whole as the centerpieces of elaborate banquets.

<TEXT> The Maaum descend from whale-like aquatic giants of their world. Their ancestors and living relatives all live in symbiotic relationships with a remora-like creature, which the Maaum retained into sentience. In the Maaum's case, these animals are called Wouwa. Many other species erroneously believe that Maaum share a psychic connection with their Wouwa, but this is not the case. Wouwa are however closely attuned to their companions and can respond to their physical and emotional states, as well as responding to direct commands^1. For the large, slow-moving Maaum, their agile Wouwa are considered essential for everyday tasks including eating and hygiene, communication and tool use. A Maaum could survive without one, but it is considered a severe handicap, and many Maaum societies look on it as a mark of shame.

<TEXT> The Sons of Edolhrem have existed in many manifestations throughout Baliren's history, including as a doomsday cult. They take their apocalyptic vision from an ancient epic poem about the Ice King Edolhrem whose Marching Kingdom ruled all of Baliren and repelled a southern invader; and who is said to come again to reconquer and protect his kingdom when under threat. Many modern scholars interpret this poem as a mythologized account of a glacial period in Baliren's prehistory. The Sons of Edolhrem selectively use that interpretation to either predict a coming re-glaciation which will cover the north and (in covering everything in ice, 'conquer' the region and drive out any invaders); or to call for a literal Marching Kingdom which will retake the north by military force. In the first case, they were regarded as harmless eccentrics, as they themselves retreated from society to live in Baliren's far north on the modern extent of the glaciers - far above their prehistoric maximum. In the latter, however, they took it on themselves to raise that army of reconquest, crowned one of their number as the new Ice King and launched a bloody war - against their own people whom they deemed irredeemably corrupted by the influence of Agata. They believed that the glory of the kingdom of old would follow them if they could hold the region in the name of Edolhrem. Their campaign held the city of Riverbend and many smaller towns for several months, but failed to besiege the fortress at Ethenfarr. After this failure, the cult faded into obscurity, but occasionally resurfaces at moments of political tension to circulate anti-Agata hate literature and ethnocentric histories of Baliren.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, and no; it depends who you mean by everyone, and who you ask. Following the prolonged Agata-Jirenes Wars, which embroiled two continents in war for more than a century, there was a Great Peace. Under the guidance of Sovdu and Qareya, which had remained neutral during the Wars, a global peace organization, Gishefa ("Union") was formed, and oversaw a period of reconciliation and transition. The empires had fallen and their successor nations enjoyed a period of reconstruction and development, but many old ethic and regional tensions persisted and occasionally broke into violence. In the name of world peace, Gishefa tended to keep quiet about these events and did little to address their underlying causes. This situation came to a head in the Broken Summer with popular uprisings in the Union's three capitals. This unrest, and the violent response to it - lead not by the Union itself but by lingering pro-Imperial forces - all but toppled the Union. Many remember the Great Peace as a period of calm and prosperity; but others say it was only window dressing to pretty up a final stage of the bloody wars that had come before. Still, relative to the scale of casualties when two continent-spanning mobilized for war, what followed can't compare in numbers, even if animosity remained just as high or even heightened.    
  
Nevertheless, the Second Union did seek to address the ancient wounds that had led to the Broken Summer and the long period of peace that followed (which many attribute to the coming of visitors from Earth; not that Terrans themselves were more peaceful, but that they brought or forced a change in perspective) has lasted into its second century. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've written this up for other discussions, but everything in my worlds is always a work in progress, so I like writing things out again.  
  
One of the chief memory institutions on Menem, specifically in the influential region of Baliren, is the office of oathwright. The oathwrights have been many things during the long history of the profession, but always at base they were recordkeepers. The earliest oathwrights were high ranking court officers serving the regional kings and the High Council at Ethenfarr. They recorded decrees, agreements between kings and lords, decisions of the Council, and contracts between common folk (if these were heard at court). In a time when most of the populace was illiterate (including, often, the lords and kings themselves) this was a powerful and respected position indeed. This role persisted after the dissolution of the separate kingdoms, first under the High Kings of Baliren and then the Crown of Agata (a southern power than annexed much of Baliren) - now under the auspices of regional counts. In these periods, oathwrights' seals were not binding as their records needed official approval of the powers above them. Over time, however, the office of oathwight evolved into an independent legal profession, combining aspects of attorney/solicitor, arbiter, and notary. In the simplest cases, an oathwright witnessed an agreement between two parties and kept records of that agreement; but they could also arbitrate disputes and draft legal documents, and their seal was binding. With bureaucratization, the oathwright also become something of a license bureau. Throughout all of this, the oathwright always served as recordkeeper, maintaining lists of births, deaths, and marriages; crop yields; weather data; and all sorts of other information of public interest. Many also managed local printing office (and therefore, literally and figuratively, the press). Throughout the small towns of Baliren, the oathwright's office was the repository not only of public records, but all manner of other written and printed matter - the library.

<TEXT> The diet of residents of the desert cities in Qareya is heavily dependent on the region's flood control and hydroculture systems. Built in rocky canyons, they rely on cisterns and 'fishbeds' - raised ponds, stocked with fish, where the staple crop *qaralla* is grown; these also serve a vital water treatment function. So, Qareya cuisine heavily features products from these fish and the qaralla plants. Qaralla produces a barley-like grain eaten in many formats including porridge, cakes, and flatbreads (all often colored with qaralla's blue flowers). The qaralla's fibrous roots and leaves also form the basis of the region's textiles. Additional food sources include a domesticated pheasant-like bird (for meat and eggs), and occasional supplements from various migratory animals that cross the high desert seasonally. All is heavily flavored with the rich spices that thrive in the area, and salt extracted from seawater.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> According to the Court, the Unnaming exists to protect Mages and to protect society from an unsafe Mage. Name and memory magic are powerful and dangerous things. To know a thing's name is to have power over it; and it is a simple thing for a Listener to find a person's name in their own mind. The Unnaming not only strips a Mage of memory of their own name, but erases their name from others' memories and from records; and also prevents new memories from forming. An Unnamed Mage knows themself and their own talents, but others struggle to remember or even recognize them. They live a cloistered and solitary life and work at the behest of the Court. The Court argues that this is protective, and that Mages lead comfortable if lonely lives. But many do see it as bondage and slavery. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Adhica**  
  
Anywhere the Listeners have a presence is strictly prohibited to Court Mages, shunned by the desert Sages, and considered cursed or at least very dangerous to anyone non magical. The Listeners are a cabal of magic users who have sacrificed their personal identity to enter a powerful hive mind, which amplifies their power and makes the collective far more powerful than any group of Mages could hope to become. When gathered together, they are able to enter the mind and influence the thoughts of any non Listener, an unsettling experience for a mundane mind, but enormously dangerous should this happen to a Mage, even if they have undergone the Unnaming. This ritual, performed by Court Mages at a young age, also strips them of identity and personal memories, but shields them from the influence of the Listeners. Still, in the presence of a large number such as at one of their strongholds, the Listeners are powerful enough to take control of an Unnamed Mage's power, if in limited fashion. The greatest such strongholds is located at Stonebridge, far upcanyon from the city of Grand Adhica, making river travel hazardous and forcing any mage traveling inland to go around via the high desert. Though in theory the desert Sages might exert the server influence over a Mage, such intrusion is their greatest taboo and the Court has come to trust them, though it maintains a watchful eye on them nonetheless.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have had that feeling (and seen it in lots of other worldbuilding), that atrocity is necessary to make a world 'real', or the only way to situate the 'good' characters as those who triumph in the face of it. I think this often plays out as including atrocity for its own sake, without really considering why we think it necessary. In part, it may be a way of coming to terms with our own world. Our history has been set with brutality and violence, and it often feels like the only way to build a world is to mimic that. *Game of Thrones* is a prime example of that. Many argue that the level of violence is 'historically accurate' (whatever that means in a fictional world) or necessary to make a constructed human history feel real - but just as often it is included simply for the spectacle, without considering what role it really plays in the world or the lives of characters; or why it feels 'necessary'. I've certainly done the same, so I'm not just calling GoT or other worlds out; but want to consider why that's an element in a lot of our builds, be we bestselling authors and showrunners or writing for our own personal interests. Increasingly, I would rather build - and see others who are building - worlds that consider other arcs of history; that reject the notion that brutality and atrocity are necessary (either as demonstrations of evil or as unfortunate means for triumphing over evil), but examine why our own history has made them feel inevitable. Maybe that's not what you were asking? But it's what it got me thinking about. </TEXT>

The most frequent subjects of conspiracy theories on Menem include the **Mirrored Hand**, perhaps for good reason...perhaps not. The Mirrored Hand was an order of itinerant scribes who frequented the monasteries and universities of Tevra, originating in the days before printing presses. Each member was painstakingly trained to write with both hands simultaneously, to rapidly transcribe manuscripts at each library they visited - always taking one copy on to the next institution and keeping the other (the right hand, mirrored copy) for the Order's own collections. Such traveling scribes quickly became the subject of rumors and legends in their own days; said to be spies and assassins, the Order's library a vast trove of treasures untold and all the secret truths of power. Much like the Templars or Illuminati on Earth, such rumors and legends persist long after the demise of the historical order and are a favorite subject of theories and fiction alike. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Menem's wealthy elite, or its prosperous cities, have generally opted for places more like arboretums and public gardens. These rarely feature exotic plants or animals, instead acting as reserves for local natural wildlife, though there have been exceptions. Menem has relatively few of the 'charismatic megafauna' (pandas, tigers, elephants, etc.) that Earth audiences enjoy seeing in zoos; it's largest land animals are all domesticated and considered commonplace. Although its continents are quite expansive, they have always enjoyed close contact across the calm, shallow of the Circle Sea; its plant diversity can mostly be seen between different latitudes rather than between landmasses.  
  
Still, places such as the Palace Gardens of Parovir, the White Forest Reserve at Sovdu, and the flowering desert cities of Qareya, have long been popular attractions. These are beautifully tended and cultivated places, dense with plant life often right in the urban centers. Though they host few large animals, they are often preserves for a wide array of birds and fish. In this, many also serve as the basis of forest agriculture providing an important source of food - either from the fruits and and other produce, or the fish and game that live there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> *Shepherds* is a traditional game of Baliren, played on a gridded board with tokens representing sheep, shepherds, and pasture walls. It is usually a game for two players, and there are two phases of play. The first round is a territory claiming game, something like Go but pieces can be moved after they are played. The second round involves reclaiming pieces from the board, similar to Mancala. The object is to claim the largest portion of the board and/or return the most sheep to your hand at the end. There are many regional variants on the game, especially in the size of the board, whether there are 'terrain' obstacles, and the particular ways that each token can move.  
  
*Tunnelball* is an improvised game played among the Operations staff on board Union Station Paragon (only when not on shift, they promise), which features a deliberately arcane and negotiable set of rules. At base, the object of the game resembles capture the flag, and it is played primarily in the space stations maintenance corridors, crew quarters, and cargo holds - although the diplomatic dining rooms, visiting transport ships, and EVAs are not considered out of bounds. Gameplay can range from a few hours to several days, though once when the target ball was left unclaimed on a departing freighter which later returned, players agree that the round has persisted for three years. </TEXT>

Initially these were not able to stop at many levels like a modern elevator, but raised a vessel on a column of water from sea level to the populous center, midway up the cliff face. Later innovations removed the water in favor of counterweights and pulleys to allow the systems to access more levels of the growing cities - and avoid flooding. The Grand Lift, capable of lifting river-going vessels down to the docks for loading, is still maintained out of tradition, but does not see the use it once did. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Early human space travel relied on keeping travellers in long stasis, including a cocktail of anaesthetics and nutrients, which plenty of "nonsleepers" on ship crews have found recreational uses for in their down hours. The experience of a heavy dose came to be known as a "black hole", and the drugs are often called just "black". Use among crews on long runs became a serious problem. Availability dropped off, however, as NAFAL technology developed into FTL. Use on trading stations and colony worlds remains prevalent though. It is happily non-addictive, but "falling down a hole" can past for days, and there are problems of users shirking duties, so Union authorities still tightly control the trade of black. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When a Maaum is feeling particularly anxious, their emotional state is most obvious in the behavior of their Wouwa companion. Rather than reflect its companion's anxiety, the small creature attempts to sooth, sitting close by the Maaum's head and issuing a low (for the usually high-pitched Wouwa) purring sort of sound. Human anthropologists have compared the reaction, almost involuntary on the part of the Wouwa, to a human blushing or becoming flushed in the face. Many Maaum feel embarrassed about their companions reacting in this way and either deliberately move the creature, or attempt to train them to respond differently, at least in public settings. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There have been a number of prominent calendar systems on Menem. Nearly all traditional calendars reckon the length of a year^1 and its subdivisions by the highly regular cycles of the three moons, and count the years from certain major historical events. In fact, almost all mark the beginning of the year at the same time as well - by the single date each year when all three moons appear full in the sky. This is helpful to latter day scholars trying to reckon history across many historical calendars. Prior to the foundation of the Gishefa ("Union") and its official calendar, there were six dominant 'counts of years' using in various places. Each of these counted the year of Terran contact^2 (as a useful example) as follows:  

* **Gishefa** Years since the establishment of Gishefa: 82
* **Post-imperial Jirenes** Years since the fall of the Empire: 117
* **Imperial Jirenes** Years since the establishment of the Empire (out of use by the time of contact): 482
* **Agata** Years since the construction of Parovir: 1642 
* **Baliren** Years since the retreat of glacial maximum: 2293  
* **Sovdu** Years since the conclusion of the Wars of the Caves: 4311 
* **Qareya** Years since the construction of Qarisa (traditional): 9728  
* ***UGC***^3: Years since initial transportation of humans from Earth (speculative): approx 11,000  
  
1: Menem's year has 504 days, approximately 29 Earth-hours long  
2: The date of the First Arrival. Contact by radio signal happened approximately 30 Menem-years (roughly 50 Earth-years) prior.

Contact between Wouwa is an important part of how Maaum communicate, so it can be difficult (some stubbornly insist impossible) to become better acquainted with someone missing theirs. Most within a close family or friend circle would grieve with their loved one for their loss. One of the essential social services present in their communities involves the work of pairing those who have lost a companion with a new one. Very often a grieving partner or loved one will take on care for their Wouwa, until such time as they hear of someone who has lost theirs. </TEXT>

Both species are quite long-lived and pairs often form bonds for their entire lives.  
  
The Maaum, like humans, are somewhat outcasts in galactic society, relative newcomers to an extensive community of more advanced species. Within their own society, many harbor *eooun* - an emotion expressing pity mixed with distrust - of someone who has lost or lives without a Wouwa companion, and that attitude has also influenced their perception of other species. It was the presence of dogs on human ships and colonies that endeared humans to the Maaum, and helped build the close relationship the species now enjoy. The Union requires specially trained diplomatic companion dogs on all ambassadorial and trade missions. </TEXT>

Almost. The faeries, in their jealous efforts to recreate the Great Magic which the Gods denied to them, have broken free of their imprisonment Between Heaven and Earth. But they have not broken back into the realms of creation; they have broken *out* into the Colorless Void, once only hypothesized, that preexisted creation. They thought it was a blank slate on which to build their own worlds - and they have wrought magnificent kingdoms there - but they also inadvertently created a new primordial chaos that threatens to draw off the matter of the universe until there is nothing left of either Earth or Heaven.  
  
Spoiler alert: Our Heroes find a way to seal the rift and avoid catastrophe, but not before the world and the nature of Magic are fundamentally changed.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The **Republican Works Commission** (RWC) (formerly the Crown WC, and briefly the Revolutionary WC) is Agata   Baliren's equivalent to the Corps of Engineers, responsible for construction and infrastructure projects, large and small. As a function of the Crown of Agata, the WC had its roots in ancient history, overseeing the construction of roads and bridges, as well as wonders such as the Watchtower and Aqueduct of Parovir. Although viewed as servants of the Crown, the WC was always self-governing (as far as overseeing particular projects went, if not in picking them), but its members voted to separate from Crown authority at the time of the Ijeida Rebellion and fought (and built) to assist rebel activities. Following the establishment of the Baliran Meanweal (more below), the Republican WC became a worker-operated branch of that new government and took on a prominent voice in the Councilhouse.  
  
The **Wheat and Water Council** was the largest agricultural and industrial union in Baliren in the years leading up to the Rebellion, representing farmers and herders (symbolized by wheat) as well as coal miners, mill workers, transit workers and others (symbolized by water, and by extension, steam). The Council operated as a largescale regional decision-making body, comprised of representatives from worksites and local unions across Baliren. Worker-ownership was long the norm throughout Baliren's history, with farms, mills and villages all owned and operated collectively, but this posed a considerable sticking point in encounters with the Crown, and underlay much of the sentiment that ultimately led to the Rebellion.  
  
The **Baliran Meanweal** grew as a revolutionary movement to resist Crown authority in Baliren, and later occupation by the Uajiren TeuNau corporation. It advocated for a workers' republic on a grand scale, in the nature of the collective ownership that had long characterized Baliren's local governance. The Meanweal grew alongside the Wheat and Water Council, and had a powerful influence on the dissatisfied workers of the Works Commission, who ultimately joined the movement. It ultimately emerged from the Rebellion as a powerful and prosperous state with the W W Council and WC at its core. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That is precisely the great debate surrounding the *Catalog*, carved on an ancient stone monument found in Mfedue. It includes (typically long-winded) titles such as *Investigation of travels on the wind* and *Discourse on the development of the different varieties of animals*, causing some scholars to believe the ancient civilization that built the monument understood things such as flight and evolution. Perhaps the most controversial is the *Account of the visitors to Heaven*, once thought to be a spiritual text. Given the apparently scientific nature of most of the others, however, many suspect it concerned space travel in some form (which is decidedly possible...). Just as tantalizing, of course, is the nature of the works being lost, but their titles retained. The *Catalog* is very much Menem's Library of Alexandria. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Villainy is often in the eye of the beholder; and just as often rooted in circumstance. One of the famous 'redemptions' in Menem's history is that of Fiddha doLyria, the last Koriarch ("reigning daughter") of Agata. Many in the Crown realms of Griana and Baliren viewed her as a symbol of decadent empire; perpetrator of the bloody Second Agata-Jirenes War, whose conscription programs sent thousands to their deaths. Held in palace arrest by the TeuNau occupation of her capital, she ultimately renounced her crown and fought alongside Baliran rebels who had once opposed her. She died in the Siege of Ethenfarr, having been a signatory to the Principles of the Republic. Many view her as a mere opportunist, but others remember her turn as a vital moment in the demise of the imperial superpowers and Menem's global turn to democracy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Praven Terelson er Farr is the best known modern poet of Baliren, often called "the voice of the Rebellion" and "the beloved poet." He was born a farmers' son south of the regional capital, on the river island of Farr, and later served the Crown of Agata in the Tower Watch and Ijeida Rebellion in the Baliran Marshals. He did not serve in high rank in either of these outfits, but nevertheless was a trusted advisor and was present at many key events, including the capture of Highpass Prison, and the long sieges of Ethenfarr and Parovir. He was an eminent propagandist and wrote many accounts of these events - both prose and verse - which were circulated widely in the *Quarterday Prayerbook* and various underground publications. With Sair Anderdaughter, he was a principal author of both the Worksite Oath and the Principles of the Republic, two founding documents of the Baliran Meanweal and Gisehfa Union that followed it. He also penned many speeches delivered by revolutionary figures such as Sair, Pawil Anrison, and the deposed Queen of Agata, Fiddha doLyria. Perhaps his most famous poetic work is the "Worksong of the Councilhouse", written during the Siege of Ethenfarr. This verse epic is an account of the battle and the revolutionary sentiment of the workers and soldiers of the time; its words have been used in national and political anthems around Menem.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are two such places in the cosmology of **Banbha**. The first is the Grey or Twilight Realm of the faeries, located 'between' Heaven and Earth. This place was created when the Gods sundered Heaven after the faeries and giants rebelled, and the faeries were banished there. Separate from either the Divine or mortal realms, it still touches them and can be reached via the liminal places and times - dawn and dusk, foothills, seashores - with careful practice of either Small Magic (a human art) or Artifice (a faerie art).  
  
The other 'outside' realm has no name, though some studying it have called it the Colorless Realm or simply Outside. Where the Grey exists between the primary realms, the Colorless exists (after a fashion) beyond them. If Earth exists as a kind of foil to Heaven, the colorless is a foil to all creation. At one time, it was purely conceptual, a notion to describe the void that came before creation and will persist after the end. But by honing their craft of Artifice, the faeries have learned that their Grey Realm lies not only between Earth and Heaven, but also between Creation and the Colorless in much the same way - and they have learned to cross that veil, and have begun to learn how to forge their own creations their. Either out of jealousy or trying to redeem themselves in the eyes of the Gods, they have begun a process that threatens to destroy everything. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Home magic is performed with (usually improvised) prayers and ritual actions (chanting names while sweeping a door step; asking for protection while folding flower petals into an oak leaf, and casting it into a fire), whose general forms are prescribed by ancient tradition. More formalized festival rites look about the same, but have predetermined language and actions.  
  
All beings once dwelt together with the Gods in the Heavens, but the faeries (often thought to have originally been human) rebelled and were cast into a void realm between Heaven and Earth. They are jealous of Magic and, unable to reach the Gods, have found ways to reach into the mortal world to trouble humans. They have learned to manipulate the fabric of their realm (a skill called Artifice) to distort the mortal world, trap humans, and make them servants. Small Magic rituals are able to strengthen the veil between the realms and prevent these kinds of incursions by the faeries. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The largest living land creature on Menem is the *ynisim*, a powerful quadruped looking a bit like Earth's own prehistoric [chalicothere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalicothere). They are native to the Sovdu region of western Tevra^1 and are used for heavy burden and agriculture around the world.  
  
Much like Earth, however, the largest creatures probably live at sea. Unfortunately, despite centuries of maritime empires crisscrossing the relatively shallow Inner of Circle Sea, the marine life of the vast Outer Ocean (colloquially called Menem's "back half") is poorly understood. Rumors and legends abound about the mighty creatures that swim those deep waters, but little is confirmed.   
  
One such legendary creature, a Kraken-like entity said to swallow ships and snare overboard sailors, has in later times been observed to be a vast, and extremely dense, kelp forest (still quite hazardous to the unsuspecting).  
  
1: It's possible the ynisim is in fact descended from a Terran ancestor transferred to Menem in the same way that *Homo sapiens* was introduced, but hundreds of thousands or even millions of years prior. Only the circumstances of humans (and contemporary animals such as horses, dogs, and certain birds) having been introduced to Menem have been confirmed. </TEXT>

Communicating with the spirit world is one aspect of the Small Magic granted to humans by the Gods (who alone wield the power of the Great Magic of Creation). Often called home magic, folk use simple spells and incantations for many things - from warding a home against faeries, to divination and omen-taking. It also has uses in the ritual magic practiced by trained priests for the seasonal holidays, for communicating with ancestors and deities. This magic can neither create nor destroy things in the natural world - unlike the Great Magic or the Artifice used by faeries. </TEXT>

Many cultures around the planet celebrate the new year on the one night all three are full together. In Baliren, all hearths and fires are extinguished for this night and lit again on the following night from a communal bonfire.  
  
Baliren also celebrated a summer festival in the week preceding the start of the Council sessions at Ethenfarr, which featured harvest markets, games of chance and skill, and art demonstrations. This festival gave rise to the much larger Union Days, celebrated every three years in the *month* prior for the new legislative session of Gishefa.  </TEXT>

The Earth-Western concept of marriage doesn't really apply, but relationships do tend to be committed, long-term partnerships between a given pair (each of whom might have one or two others, though occasionally more). Proposals are rarely surprises or elaborate declarations, instead they are mutual commitments to share space and support together. All new partnerships are then celebrated together at the bonfire feasts held to usher in the new year. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;The Agata-Jirenes Wars were a series of conflicts fought throughout 15th to 17th Centuries YC, between Menem's great superpowers of the time. Many historians lump them together as a single protracted war of imperial supremacy, though each episode had its particular flashpoints and shifting alliances.  
  
 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;The conflict began when the emerging Uajiren Empire began threatening the Crown of Agata's already centuries-old dominance of the Circle Sea. It later became a struggle over the mineral and oil resources of southern Ijeida, resources which were rare in either power's home territories. In its final stages, the rivalry became a series of proxy wars as the flagging empires vied for influence rather than dominance.  
  
 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Its bloodiest moments came in this latter stage, namely with the events of the Crucible of Griana, the Siege of Baliren, and the Uajiren Civil War. Griana, in southern Ijeida, was historically home to a collection of small, wealthy, mercantile states, which over time became clients of the great powers, and were used to carry out the struggle for the region's resources. Following the first Agata-Jirenes War, their populace chafing under imperial influences, the states of Griana suffered coup after coup, often fomented by foreign interests. Conspiracy and secret police abounded and anarchy was more common than stable governance. Shifting borders and empty coffers left thousands of common folk to starve. When Jirenes abandoned the region to fight its own growing internal unrest, a rogue force proclaiming loyalty to the Empire moved north to seize the Agatter capitals at Ethenfarr and Parovir. There resistance fighters had only just undertaken their own rebellion against the Crown. Victorious in their attempt to hold Ethenfarr against foreign occupation, this resistance set their sights on Parovir, where the Queen was already held in palace arrest and victory seemed certain. What followed was a years-long siege against the seat of the Crown, only broken when the Empire itself fell and could no longer support its distant forces with air drops. The fertile Cashat Valley, once the breadbasket of the world, lay a ruined husk; the burning grave of some ten million farmers and soldiers. The toll of the entire three centuries of warfare can only be estimated, but reaches into the hundreds of millions.   
  
 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;The Treaty of Sovdu was signed not by representatives of the superpowers, but by the commanders of the Pyrrhic rebellion on either side. It proclaimed an end not only to the endless war, but also the final dissolution of both Crown and Empire. All factions, embroiled in each others' death throes, were ordered back home, such as they would find it. Now Sovdu and its close partners in Eya emerged as economic powers to oversee the lengthy period of reconstruction and ultimately helped establish the internationalist Gishefa Union. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Like a few folks have already said, feeling like you *need* anything for successful worldbuilding is a trap. There are lots of ways to flesh out a world and immerse an audience, and conlanging is just one. If you as a creator don't find it compelling, then it becomes a chore and arguably could make your world feel less real.  
  
I'll always celebrate the benefits of basic naming conlangs, though (because I like making them and find them helpful, entirely for my own worldbuilding experience). Complete languages are challenging and time consuming, but establishing a few simple phonologies and rule sets can be simple and really useful. They give you a ready reference for creating names for each group that are self-consistent and distinct from each other. One could have RSTLNE  as its most common sounds (yes, that's the Wheel of Fortune loadout, so maybe avoid that particular set), while its neighbor has sounds more like GMBHFU. Then it's easy to tell than Rentsle and Umgumpf come from different places. For me, it's less about how many words are in each lexicon, and more about helping ensure that each language sounds unique, and having a resource to draw on to make new words and names as you need them.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> tl;dr: Many humans live on other species' homeworlds and the many multi-species colony worlds, but relatively few non-humans live on human worlds, with the exception of the Maaumm.  
  
It's more accurate to say that humans live among non-humans. Humans are newcomers on the galactic stage and contrary to their sci-fi ambitions are not making much of an impression. Humanity's first alien contact was with the Maaumm, themselves underdogs in galactic society.  
  
At first contact, the Galactic Peace Organization was about thirty years old, the product of a protracted and brutal war among five powerful species (the Maaumm not among them). In peacetime, under the governance of the GPO, on the new capital world Embassy, these species were thriving. But they had assumed an isolationist stance in response to the war and were officially uninterested in expanding further or in developing relationships with the various 'lesser' species. Still, the GPO controlled vast resources and held important trade routes; granting access to non-members became a very lucrative endeavor.  
  
So, in the first decades after contact, [human] Union ships frequent Embassy and other GPO ports, and many humans live on alien worlds, but there is still no official diplomatic relationship between the Union and GPO. Meanwhile the Union has enjoyed a close alliance with the Maaumm, who do have an official presence on Embassy (among the 'junior partners' of the Organization, as it were) and have advocated for human interests on many occasions. Thanks to this alliance, Maaumm live on Earth, Menem, Renii, and other human worlds in considerable numbers, while other species remain quite few.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Two traditional breads that I've identified on Menem are Baliran blackbread and *let p'alla*, a traditional flatbread of Qareya. Blackbread, also called stonebread, is a dark, flavorful - sometimes bitter - bread, like a heavy rye or pumpernickel. It is typically baked in small dense rolls which are split for sandwiches (peppered mutton with onions is a favorite filling), or when dry, soaked in a broth and broken up.   
  
*Let p'alla*, or flower bread, is a product of the versatile *qaralla*, or desert flower. In this way, it is like the bulk of Qareya's agriculture. *Let* is a flatbread, typically cooked in square pans over a standing brazier, using the sweet flour from ground *qaralla* fruit. It is often salted or flavored (and incidentally colored a pale blue or purple) with qaralla flowers.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In most of my dreams I'm just wandering around some place, usually somewhere familiar (either a dream version of a real place, or a dream place that seems familiar to me in the dream). And I mean, really just wandering - walking down hallways or streets, opening doors, climbing stairs, riding subway cars, shopping in book stores. Sometimes I'm having a chat with a friend. If the dream is manifesting some kind of stress I'm having - I'm wandering around some place, while my teeth are falling out.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Does an invasive plant species count? Since the First Agata-Jirenes War, the region of Grianna has had to deal with siegegrass. A hardy, thick stemmed plant, native to the arid center of Terit, siegegrass thrived in the wet coastal climate of Grianna - and the Uajiren Empire was quick to find use for it as a weapon. In its home environment, the plant often remains dormant for several seasons and only blooms - sending out huge numbers of seeds - after the very occasional rain. In a wet climate, it can bloom several times a year and spread rapidly. The Uajiren Army seeded it everywhere to wage the War - on riverbanks to choke out fishing villages; in fields where it quickly outgrew crops and pasturelands; in forests to hinder guerrilla movements.  
  
Decades after the War, siegegrass remains a huge and expensive burden for the region.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Most of the faithful of Taretaret ("Gods Unnumbered" or "Infinite Divine") believe that the world has always existed. In this faith, there is a God in everything / everything is a God; and though Gods can die, the greater Gods at least are eternal, so the matter they embody must also be eternal. The world is an eternal God, and so it has always existed. There are some within Taretaret who believe in an eternal universe, but in which worlds are created and destroyed from other matter - "like puddles that form then dry up" one acolyte reflects. This is the predominant perspective in the latter day faith; and its early adherents were among the first on Menem to conceive of other worlds orbiting other stars.  
  
In the traditional religion in Eya, the creation of the world coincides with the construction of the city of Qarisa, but humanity preexisted, drowning in a perpetual flood. The Builders - usually believed to be a divine race - emerged from the chaos and constructed Qarisa, along with its systems of flood control and irrigation, and they taught the people how to work them.

<TEXT> When in doubt, I like to look into how real world things got their names, then see if mimicking those would be appropriate to my world. The names of real world currencies came from things like:  

* Measurements (what the coin represents). e.g. peso, pound, lira
* Historical or political entities. e.g. bolivar, euro, crown
* Geographical locations. e.g. dollar, rand
* Features of the coin. e.g. guilder ("gold"), yen/yuan ("circle"), florin (describing the fleur-de-lis image on the coin)  
  
If you have existing names for any of those things, you could attach them to currencies. Or riff on those kinds of sources. I used a lot of names based on what's on the coin, for Menem. In the Crown of Agata, the main coin shows a warship and is called (colloquially) a "ship" [*rago*]. Smaller denominations are nicknamed "rowboat" and "raft," and it's common to refer to a pocketful of change as "a fleet" or "the navy."  
  
I also always recommend using simple naming conlangs when you're feeling stuck on names. You really just need phonology and two or three rules to help generate sets of distinct names so each region feels different. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Union government on Menem (then called Gashifa) had three seats, in Grianna, Terit, and Sovdu, which functioned as regional parliaments. Every three years, a joint legislative session was held, rotation among the three capitals.  
  
The start of this joint legislative session came to be associated - as of old in Baliren - with seasonal festivals, and the month before was celebrated as a kind of World's Fair meets the Olympics. And there were rides! Often showcasing technological breakthroughs, historical favorites have included (tethered) helicopters, miniature submarines, and of course monorails.  
  
Extensive parks and fairgrounds developed around the assembly halls of each city, open year round, hosting museums, restaurants, libraries, and other public space. 'Rides', of a sort, typical during these times included paddle boats, rented bicycles and carts, and sight-seeing tours by car or rail.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the mythology of the Adega culture of central Sovdu, the land and people are protected by a race known as aSteala, the Beloved. The first people to walk on Menem, they were immortal - the Beloved Creation of the Gods, who did not wish to see them perish. Yet the Beloved grew restless and begged Sindal [Stillness] to grant them death just as the other creatures of the world. This she granted, but Naduin [Mobility] mourned to see their passing and granted them this blessing - that even in death the Beloved may watch over the world they loved and take form within it once more if they choose, though their children all will pass from with world.  
  
Some things about the Beloved!  

* Their spirits reside in the Outer World, even when they take corporeal shape 
* Most tend to take animal shapes, but are not prohibited from taking their original forms or even assuming a human form
* There are 729 individual Beloved, each associated with particular traits, skills, locations, and actions. 
* The Beloved, in life, are credited with first cultivating the White Forest, vast and extremely ancient colony of an aspen-like tree. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The **Siege of Ethenfarr** was the last large confrontation during the Ijeida Rebellion. That conflict was itself an iteration of the oft-fought Agata-Jirenes Wars. Following the Second A-J War, troops of the TeuNau corporation's private army were sent to occupy Agata and Baliren on behalf of the Uajiren Empire. After a protracted resistance campaign, Baliran forces had restricted the occupation to the old fortress outside the city of Ethenfarr, Baliren's capital - a fortress whose occupant effectively controlled the city's river port and railyard.  
  
Meanwhile, resistance forces under the banners of the Baliran Marshals, the Republican Works Commission, and the nascent Meanweal movement, held the walled city itself. Ethenfarr sits at the northern end of a grand river isle whose historically abundant croplands either laid fallow or were burning. The much beloved rebellion poet Praven Terelson remembered the events of the siege in his ode, "The Starving Isle."   
  
Under the direction of Works Captain Sair Anderdaughter, engineers, miners, and common fieldhands worked to dig tunnels beneath the Traveling River to break TeuNau's siege. Outside the city, resistance fighters headed by the already abdicated queen of Agata, Fiddha do Lyria, gathered and delivered foodstuff and supplies to the rebels inside.  
  
With this aid, rebellion forces were able to outlast the TeuNau troops in the fortress, who were ultimately recalled in order to meet the growing anti-imperial sentiment in Jirenes itself. </TEXT>

Re: the geometric maps: thanks! It's one of my favorite things that has come out of my worldbuilding.   
  
There are cave paintings associated with the earliest known settlement on Menem. They form the basis of the oldest religion; and the impetus for the oldest wars. And living with them has given folks, especially in the regions of Sovdu and Terit, a sense of societal continuity over tens of thousands of years, as well as an appreciation for change as necessary for progress and stability. We have always lived beside the caves, they say, and where once we did so with stone tools, now we live in glass towers and travel to distant stars whose worlds, it turns out, also bear painted caves. 
  
[Here's where Menem takes a turn for the sci-fi] Many also believe the paintings hold clues to the presence of humans on multiple worlds millennia before we developed spaceflight, such as the depiction of Terrestrial animals not present on Menem. I haven't decided if anyone ever figures it out, but my working explanation is that an ancient spacefaring alien society (probably on accident) transported Earth-born humans to Menem and Doreni. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, to start, on Menem, you would necessarily be working for some public institution - library, university, museum, etc. - and collecting on their behalf; as private collection of that kind if prohibited. Given that prohibition, and the considerable goodwill an institution like the Union Archives enjoys, you probably don't really need funds per se, just networks and diplomacy.  
  
Now, what sorts of things might you collect for the Archives? Perhaps the earliest extant examples of mechanical parts from the ancient flood control systems in Eya; stone tools used around the site of the White Forest Cave, the earliest known settlement on Menem; original copies of the Worksite Oath and the Principles of Republic; the former crown jewels of the abolished monarchies; or the remains of Ambassador Station, among the first of the interstellar ships that transported human visitors from Earth. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Until late modernity, most guest accommodations across Menem took the form of relatively small inns or spare rooms in the homes of folks living along major roads, with a few notable exceptions.

In the larger cities of Baliren, rambling inn/pub/theatre complexes were popular and served many travelers to these cities. Chief among these was Tarmenem ("The Voice of the Seas") in the northern town of Riverbend. It began its long life as a grounded riverboat, and developed - after a series of fires - into a complex of stone buildings and courtyards covering several blocks along the riverfront. 

The pilgrimage roads across the high desert of Tehlaer, in Tevra, are dotted with inn-towns served by dedicated monks. Weary travelers, escorting the souls of their beloved departed to the northern shores, put up for the night in the eastern side of these towns; while a mirror image of the town, west of the road, is reserved, in equal hospitality, for the dead. Hundreds or even thousands may take their rest there, and move along in the morning.

With the establishment of the Union in the wake of the great wars, a large, widely traveled, diplomat-bureaucrat class emerged, in need of accommodation, especially in the three seats of the Union's government, located in Grianna, Sovdu, and Terit. In these places, large embassy-hotel complexes were built, or established in renovated palaces, most of the world's monarchies have been abolished. These continue to be mostly driven by that purpose, serving government officials and so forth. Tourists and other travelers, still find their lodging in smaller guesthouses and spare rooms.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Menem has an as yet unnamed set of 51 triangular tiles that resemble a kind of Tarot/dominoes mashup. Originating as a teaching tool and ritual object, the tiles have evolved over time to be used in a wide variety of puzzles and games. Each is marked with a number (0-16), and an element (Earth, Sea, Sky), along with specific iconography depicting various aspects of local cosmology. Each element is divided into the House of Eight (numbered 1-8), depicting earthly aspects - the Mountain, the Cave, the Harvest; and the House of Nine (numbered 9-16, and 0), depicting aspects of the Divine - the Land of the Dead, the King of Heaven, the Angels. 

Use of the tile set for games is widespread, just about like Earth's modern deck of cards. Inexpensive paper sets are very common; while elaborately carved sets of wood, ivory, or even marble make for very handsome gifts.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sair Anderdaughter er Balirhearth was a Works Captain of the Crown Works Commission^(1) and celebrated commander during the Ijeida Rebellion.

* **Daughter of Industry:** Sair was born the daughter of a coal miner and steel foundry forewoman in the industrial city of Balirhearth. In those years before the wars, relations were mild between Agata and Baliren, and she went to study engineering in the Agatter capital, Parovir. She excelled at both architectural drafting and leadership roles and joined the Works Commission after her training, quickly rising to the station of Works Captain.
* **Held at High Pass Prison:** She was posted as the Captain overseeing the quarry operations in a region of southern Baliren, near the border with Agata, known as High Pass. The quarry was one of the first sites seized by the Uajiren Occupation that followed the First Agata-Jirenes War, and went almost overnight from humane conditions and high wages to a prison camp, its walls hastily constructed by the prisoners themselves by order of the TeuNau^(2) occupiers. Sair led a prisoners revolt and, coordinating with rebel Marshalls outside the prison, managed to expel the occupation force and hold the prison as a vital base throughout the Rebellion.
* **Revolutionary Works Commission:** Using High Pass as their base, Sair led a guerrilla and sabotage campaign against the occupation, managing to disrupt troop movements and supply shipments at several key moments. She gathered a growing army of liberated workers and prisoners of war to support these efforts, eventually achieving the liberation of Parovir. This rebel force took on the subversive title of Revolutionary Works Commission, in the model of the old Crown operation - most of its workers having abandoned their loyalty to the collaborationist Crown government.
* **Siege of Ethenfarr:** In the final act of the Rebellion, Sair gathered with other revolutionary forces to retake the Baliran capital at Ethenfarr from the occupation. TeuNau forces, undermanned but well supplied, held the city's old fortress and fortified port, while workers and rebel soldiers held the walled city itself. Denied the port, and hope of resupply, Sair and her Works crews undertook an ambitious project to tunnel beneath the Traveling River to break the mutual siege and outlast their foes. During this time she also participated in the drafting of the Worksite Oaths, Baliren's declaration of independence; and designed the Meanweal Meeting House, built shortly after the war to house a new Republican government.

1: Sort of a civilian Corps of Engineers, responsible for large public works like bridge building and dam maintenance.

2: Teugad Naufair, latter day special forces of the Uajiren Empire. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Accounts vary across the region of Eya, but folk of the canyon cities often believe in a group called the Builders \[probably a placeholder name\] who engineered the systems of flood control, irrigation, and cisterns that sustain them. The Builders also taught the ancient people how to maintain and improve upon their works. Some hold a merely practical sort of belief in the Builders - someone obviously designed and planned the systems, so let's call them Builders, and respect them for it. For many, though, belief in the Builders is an article of their faith, and the systems a kind of Promethean gift - albeit one for which the giver was rewarded rather than punished. The two most widespread accounts say either that the Builders were the Gods themselves, or that for the great works, some group of ancient people were granted divinity as reward for blessing the people - sometimes a whole race of people, sometimes a specific group, usually numbering nine.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In most places, at most points in history, the various powers maintained either a regular army or militia force. The largest of these was the Imperial Army of Jirenes, at its height the largest military force in the history of Menem; it was joined by the also quite sizable Imperial Navy and Air Force. The Empire's chief historical rival, the Crown of Agata, was an ancient maritime power and it commanded the largest navy in the world for nearly two millennia. For infantry work, however, the Crown turned to its northern neighbor, Baliren, and an outfit called the Marshalls. Initially a kind of county constabulary, the banner of the Marshalls was used to rally a large militia to resist the Pretenders' Uprising; and again to help defend Agata in the first war with Jirenes. Following this, the Marshalls were made permanent as the standing army of Baliren and the Crown.

The most stormtrooper-like of Menem's various military units, though, would be the Teugad Naufair (Western Capital Group) Security Force. TeuNau had begun its existence as a trading corporation and mine operator, but strayed from that brief into arms manufacturing. In the late stages of the Empire, as the last Emperor grew increasingly paranoid of his regular army generals, he swelled the ranks of TeuNau's internal security force to serve as a personal guard and secret police. Following the second war with Agata, and the emperor's paranoid purge of the army, TeuNau was used as the occupying force to hold Agata and Baliren - a short lived occupation, as the Empire fell into civil war, and the emperor was forced to recall the TeuNau to resist the rebel armies. </TEXT>

In a world I rarely dust off or post about here, Earth is dominated by a fascist fanatical cult based on the Book of Drevin - an anthology of myths, legends, and sacred texts that deal with dragons, demons, and other monsters, together with a series of commentaries by Drevin (usually referred to as an individual, but probably a group of authors). According to Drevin, Ragnarok was imminent at the close of the 22nd century - ripe for the giants and dragons to rise up, thrown down the Gods, and take their rightful place ruling the Earth. Those monsters are embodied in the inner circle of the cult of Drevin. Leaders, institutions, and even some key locations, are given the names of various legendary dragons and dragon-adjacent figures (the word preferred by Drevin, but a catchall for mythical monsters of various descriptions) all of them bastardized and perverted to serve the cult's worldview. Chief among them are:

* Tiamat: Most revered deity of Drevin, as well as the cult's term for the universe - that is, Heaven and Earth, which were formed from the body of the destroyed Tiamat.
* Cadmus: (also called the Theban or Caesar Cadmus) the supreme leader of Drevin, whose title-holders are held to be reincarnations of the mytical Cadmus, who slew a dragon and sowed its teeth, from which sprang the noble families of Thebes. The seat of Cadmus (in the city of Midgard) is called Thebes, and his residence Cadmeia. The five Spartoi ('the sown') make up his inner circle.
* Loki's Eye: the name of the six-member council made up of Cadmus and the Spartoi; freed from the blinding poison of Jormungandr by the triumph of the dragons.
* Jormungandr: The World Serpent, Drevin's name for the UN-successor global state, which was overthrown. Revered as a precursor God, whose sacrificial destruction gave rise to the new order.
* Azi Dahaka / Zahak: title given to the head of Drevin's secret police, and by extension to the police organization. Also called Typhon.
* Amphisbaena: Massive, silent, helicopter gunboats employed by Azi Dahaka to enforce order.

So, not any actual dragons, just people and things given the names of dragons. They're still pretty evil. I should note again that Drevin twists and molds existing myth to serve the purposes of the cult - and deliberately uses poor translations and misinterpretations to serve its purposes. For example, the motto of the office of Caesar Cadmus is "I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls". This comes from the King James version of the Book of Job (30:29), which actually refers to jackals and ostriches. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In Sovdu, the western portion of the continent Tevra, much of a given city's territory is dominated by public parkland. Traditionally, the populace of Sovdu lived in dense villages with great tracts of tended forest between them. Several neighboring villages shared the administration of the forest and traded among each other. Over time civil governments emerged, serving the several villages in a region. These civil governments took on the management of the forests, and codified what portions would be left wild, which used for crops and livestock, and which devoted to recreation. Even with modern development, and paved roads and railways between them, this city-of-villages structure persisted. In the traditional village structure, in which buildings rarely rose above the treetops, these village collectives were often referred to as 'invisible cities.' Latter day cities are much more evident, with dense clusters of towers emerging from the surrounding parkland.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In Adhika, magic is viewed as an affliction by most who are not born with it. Mages are carefully controlled by the Court, and at a young age must undergo the traumatic Unnaming ritual. Sages and Listeners (magic users outside the influence of the Court) instead relinquish their free will and individual identity to join a protective hive mind. In theory a non magic user could join such a collective, and could slightly-better-than-vicariously experience the use of magic as the other members do, but neither Sages nor Listeners have ever been known to allow a non magic user in. The Sages are a hereditary group and do not let outsiders among them; while the Listeners are magic-supremacists and would never allow their collective to be 'watered down' or 'corrupted'.  

So people without magic generally count their blessings that they were not saddled with it. Some, who find themselves ideologically aligned with the Listeners, have established a kind of cult of camp followers who serve the collective (which usually abuses their loyalty), but they would never be allowed 'in.' </TEXT>

<TEXT> This was simultaneously my most pleasant neighbor, so I can't complain too much. I used to have a downstairs neighbor who was an opera singer, and she sang/practiced a whole lot of the time while she was home. It was often very beautiful; sometimes her partner was over and they would sing duets (presumably while cooking fancy pasta dishes). But she also liked to do vocal warmups (scales and mi-mi-mi-mi kinda vocalizations) VERY early in the morning, which I did not find nearly so pleasant. </TEXT>

Those are (not especially useful) constructs of the American electoral milieu, and don't really have much bearing on the actual daily fight for LGBT folx rights and lives. The oppression of our rights, and turning blocks of voters against us, are weapons used by capital to maintain political and economic power. To fight for LGBT rights is necessarily to oppose capital; and opposing capital is necessarily a political act. </TEXT>

As far as humans have explored (or learned from the more widely traveled species), mammal-like hair is unique to humans among the galaxy's intelligent species. It does exist among non-sapient animals on some worlds; causing some societies there to view humans as primitive, wild, or unintelligent. Others are so intrigued by the stylistic possibilities afforded by human hair that, that hair implantation became an early milestone in interspecies medicine. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Throughout the villages of Baliren, and even the latter day urban neighborhoods, folks tended to live together in large communal houses. These structures, generally of stone and with open floor plans, housed young adults - singles and childless couples - alongside elders; while procreating couples with small children tended to live apart. These buildings featured small private quarters, along with open areas for gathering and recreation.  
  
A typical rural village would center on two or three of these longhouses around an open greenspace (often featuring a well at the center); in cities, four or more would surround a public square. Even in later city construction, residential towers would mimic the longhouse layout on each floor, with additional large gathering space on the ground floor. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A very popular periodical in Baliren is the *Quarterday Prayerbook*, which combines aspects of publications like the *Farmers Almanac*, *Reader's Digest* and a Catholic missal. As the name implies, the Prayerbook is published quarterly, ahead of the seasonal festivals, and is distributed widely across Baliren and Agata. Each volume contains prayers and services, popular literature, political writing, weather forecasts, and other reports. There are several regional editions which feature local news and authors, and matters of local economic interest like tide tables and projections of river depth. Prior to modern communication methods, the *Prayerbook* was an essential means of sharing information staying up to date. During the Ijeida Rebellion, the *Prayerbook* and its network of printers served a vital role in relaying information on everything from troop movements to the needs of besieged cities, through coded messages.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I actually haven't entirely sorted that out yet. I've tossed around two variations, and I'm not entirely satisfied with either.  
  
In one version, everything (grains of sand, the wind, that chair, each person...) has a True Name, either in some Magical Language, or in a more spiritual sense [yes, that's vague]. Magic is performed by knowing a thing's True Tame, addressing the thing with its True Name, and commanding certain behavior of it. In this version, an Unnamed mage can be cut off from their True Name, whatever it was, but everyone can still just call them by their given name.  
  
In the second version, a true name isn't anything separate from a person/thing's ordinary name, so knowledge of someone's given name is all it takes to control them magically. Absent the inherently magical True Name, this version is a lot murkier as to how magic would work. But, in this version, an Unnamed mage literally has no name. Not only can they not be controlled by a Listener's magic, they can't be addressed in public, or referred to in records, or introduced by a friend. The cost of the Unnaming is much greater. It forces mages to be set apart from society; locks them into systems and bureaucracies that can identify them and track them without names.  
  
I like the outcomes of the second version much better but it seems to introduce a lot of problems I haven't solved yet. If the magic is in ordinary given names, would anything that refers to the person end up standing in for their name? So, couldn't '24601' end up being just as good to a Listener as 'Jean Valjean'? Would someone have to get Unnamed many times in their life?  
  
There's a compromise or a third version in it somewhere, but I haven't settled on it yet. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In Adhica the threat of such possession comes from Listeners, cabals of mages who have linked their thoughts into a powerful hivemind. Some Listeners have grown so powerful they have escaped the bond of the constituent mages' bodies and can persist long after they have died. These Wild Listeners can sweep on human settlements like a plague, driving everyone who lives their to madness. Such an event is dangerous to anyone, but especially horrific if a Listener possesses a mage, gaining access to their powers.   
  
The key to possession is name magic; a Listener must hear your name in your thoughts and speak it in order to possess you. The only protection is to join a Listener cabal yourself, or to perform the Unnaming ritual, which wipes all traces of your true name from the world - from your own memory, from others' memories, and from records. The Unnaming is a complicated ritual, and difficult to perform without overreaching. So it is common for the Unnamed to suffer from short-term memory loss, and for others to be unable form memories of them, especially because most authorities require mages to perform the ritual as novices. This is considered an acceptable cost because a powerful Listener in possession of even a single mage can have devastating consequences.

<TEXT> Such organizations have varied widely across Menem's long history. A couple of examples include:  
  
There have been religious, semi-state run entities like library/university/monastery Fastness of Sovdu, which in addition to providing free education to all comers, sent its students on study/mission trips to both build housing across the continent and gather new sources of knowledge. The Fastness generally operated independently, but did receive various royal endowments and as such was, at certain key moments in history, answerable to the Crown.  
  
The revolutionary Republican Works Commission arose during the complicated Ijeida Rebellion. Once a function of the Crown of Agata, the Works Commission (WC) was responsible for building public infrastructure, including housing. When the Crown WC was abolished by occupying forces from Jirenes following the First Intercontinental War, workers established the Republic WC. The RWC simulataneous engaged in public works - building flood levees, repairing local roads; and sabotage against the occupying force - tearing up rail lines to military assets, bombing steel mills. It was also responsible for smuggling food shipments past Imperial observers to feed starving communities.

<TEXT> [The continents of Menem](https://imgur.com/a/pYUKw) as presented in a traditional stylized map.  
  
The major landmasses of Menem are Ijeida, Tevra, and Jirenes; along with the large, unpopulated polar continent, Tehnuin. These names are some of the earliest things I established about the world, after I had its first conlang, Uajiren. The name Jirenes came out of building that language. Conversely, the name Ijeida inspired some of the features of the second conlang I made for the world, Taragat. But it and the others first came from just making noises, hoping some would sound like names.  
  
In terms of what Earth continents they resemble:  

* Ijeida is shaped more or less South America, embiggened to about 2/3 the size of all the Americas together, with a Mediterranean/Carribean mashup sea in the middle
* Jirenes's two largest parts, Terit and Iuliat, are sort of Australia- and New Guinea-shaped, respectively
* Tevra is something like Europe + Central Asia, if the Ural and Carpathian mountains were both Himalayan in scale. 
* Tehnuin probably looks like Antarctica, but in the north. I dunno, I haven't mapped it at all. 

Edit: spelling and formatting </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was 13 or so and just found the Silmarillion, and was like "wow, I could just invent a world!" So I can't say that Nyreal, or the Orasilani (sound familiar?), was generally very good or original. But it did occupy me and entertain me all through high school, so it holds a special place in my memory. In terms of plot, it was clearly a Tolkein rip off - there was a Dark Lord, and a ring (though I thought at the time it a *totally original* use a powerful ring that will defeat the Dark Lord...sigh). And there were lots of just silly mistakes - I drew a world map which was inadvertently a torus.  
  
BUT, a lot of it I still like. It was home of my first conlang, which I'm still pretty proud of. And I have resurrected certain elements for more recent projects. My "Nrealnya" notebook, full of those old maps and sketches and alphabet practice, is definitely one of my prized possessions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just such a conflict is the crux of one of the major time periods in which I'm building Mene. The **Crown of Agata** and the **Uajiren Empire** were the unrivaled powers of their respective continents, Ijeida and Jirenes. 

Background: For a long time these powers were economic partners, driving global trade and spurring the prosperity of their neighbors. Then came an industrial revolution, and competition for scarce fossil resources, predominately found in the long-neutral mercantile republics of Griana. These small nations historically had close ties to Agata, but also robust trade relationships with the Empire. The superpowers began pressuring the Griana states into exclusive contracts, but agreements about mineral rights eventually gave way to stationing troops to protect them. Border disputes, common throughout Griana's history and traditionally settled in negotiations between trade ministers, became armed skirmishes backed by the military force of superpowers - with the small, often unarmed states in the crossfire. Things escalate from here. 
  
Your questions!: Pretty much nobody wins. The conflict generates two periods of large scale war, with a highly charged Cold War-like interbellum, during which the powers play out proxy wars in devastated Griana. The Second War bankrupts both Crown and Empire. The Koriarch [queen of Agata] abdicates while giving her support to a growing socialist republican movement. The Imperial army rebels against the Uajiren Emperor, fighting a protracted civil war against his private security force. Several post-Crown states in Ijeida commit troops and materiel to support the rebel army. When all is said and done, both superpowers are toppled and much of Griana and Jirenes lay in ruins.  
  
The smaller nations: As mentioned, Griana was historically comprised of many small merchant republics, most of them with a small military or none at all. In the First War, these sided with the superpowers according to contractual obligations [though they were essentially occupied territories]. When the Second War arose, the powers carried out their battles at sea or in each other's territory; while the republics of Griana rebelled against their former occupiers. Baliren, traditionally an ally of Agata, supported the Crown in the First War, but over the course of the Second War rose in rebellion against the Crown. Mbueti, Tigala, and other states of northeastern Ijeida, which had remained neutral in the both wars, sent their support to the rebels in Jirenes to hasten the end of the Empire. Meanwhile, Sovdu, Qarisa, and the other nations of the 'third continent' Tevra remained neutral throughout the Intercontinental Wars. As the central organizer of the armistice that followed the Second War, and with both superpowers devastated by the wars, Sovdu emerged as the dominant global power. The peacetime Union that emerged from the ashes had its headquarters at Gishefa [Union City] founded in the ancient capital of Sovdu.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> They have a [facilities plan](http://www.cincinnatilibrary.org/info/facilitiesplan.html) which outlines the needs of the various branches. There is a lot of deferred maintenance from the last few years, and several branches have never been made ADA compliant. The plan has a $54 million price tag. They cite the sale of the North Building downtown as a possible source of the revenue, but their [estimate](http://www.cincinnatilibrary.org/info/appraisal_2017.pdf) places the sale price of the building at only $3.9m, with a $3m bill to move those services into the south building, so it barely makes a dent in the bigger need. Considering that Michael Moran, who provided the Board's first (slightly higher) lowball estimate, and is the son of a Board member,  has talked about "locally minded developers and end-users who are looking for an urban spot to plant their flag," ([Enquirer, July 31, 2017]( https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2017/07/31/public-library-close-north-building-might-leave-entire-downtown-block-available/492586001/)), the whole thing is suspicious. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Something specifically called 'psionics' is pretty much a D D element, but 'psychic powers that we're not calling magic' are common enough. I think you're right to say it's common to SF. Fantasy is perfectly happy to call magic magic; while SF wants to give fantastic-seeming abilities a name consistent with the SF setting. So you get Mass Effect's 'bionics' (which can readily enough be reskinned as magic - to get Dragon Age...). I was never quite satisfied with the D D distinction. Like - you don't do magic, you do...other stuff; with your brain! It is conceptually distinct, and adds a different flavor, but doesn't always lend itself to a consistent world.  
  
For my world Banbha, I do have a distinction between sorts of powers, where one is arguably more about mental powers. Humans are granted access to Small Magic by the Gods, which allows them spells such as love charms and protective wards. There are clear rules, prescriptions, and proscriptions governing the uses of Magic. Faeries, since they are denied Magic, have devised their own form of power, called Artifice, based on manipulating the veil between mortal world and the faerie realm, and manipulating the minds of mortals. Artifice is chaotic and ungoverned, limited only by the faeries' imagination and the malleability of veil or mind being altered.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the lands of eastern Tevra, the land of the dead - Tehlaer - is believed to lie on the northern polar continent, and it is believed that the spirits of the dead must make the journey over land and sea to reach it, and they do not all know the way. Many among the living make the mourning pilgrimage, through difficult terrain and barren lands, to guide the spirits of those they have lost. An order of dedicated monks regularly make the journey, both to guide the living - who may not know the way themselves - and the unescorted dead. Still, the northern coast of Tevra is said to be a haunted place, troubled by wayward spirits looking for a crossing - wandering the wastes or occupying the wrecks and ruins that dot the shores.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The history of Menem begins 30k to 60k years ago - there are ongoing debates in-world about the timeframe, with conflicting evidence - when intervention from an advanced alien race transplanted a human population from Earth [this being the earliest event]. The first definitively dated event is the paintings of the White Forest Cave in Sovdu, and the erection of the nearby Touchstone monument, 30k years ago. This may have happened shortly after transplant, or considerably later.  
  
Like a lot of worlds, it seems, there is much more past than future, so the latest event occurs in the (relatively soon) ~25th century CE, following the establishment of the pan-human Union of Worlds. In that time, humans have come to understand that our species originated on Earth and the ancient transportation to multiple other planets; and have since encountered alien species beginning with the Mauum, representatives of the ill-named Galactic Peace Organization.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> *The Principles of the Republic* is a Baliran political treatise primarily written by Saghir Anderdaughter and Praven Terelson, initially distributed under the collective pen name Ethenfarr Oathwrights' Society. They wrote it from inside the besieged city of Ethenfarr during the Ijeida Rebellion, and had the manuscript smuggled out for printing. In both content and influence on subsequent history, the *Principles* combines aspects of the *Declaration of Independence*, the *Declaration of the Rights of Man* or the *Universal Declaration of Human Rights*, and the *Communist Manifesto*, along with a touch of Robert's Rules of Order.
  
*Principles* became the founding text of the Baliran Meanweal and a number democratic socialist states that followed, including the Menem-wide Gishefa ("Union") government and the pan-human Union of Worlds. Adherents of the republican movement, and later citizens of *Principles*-aligned societies, frequently carried copies with them, and copies were always printed with a number of blank pages for notes and 'localized addenda', and distributed with a pencil.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> ***The Oathwrights of Baliren: A History***  

 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;The communities of Baliren were traditionally served by **oathwrights**, a profession which combined the responsibilities of attorney, mediator, librarian/archivist, and notary. The oathwright was responsible for negotiating, drafting, witnessing, and authorizing agreements and contracts on primarily local matters - land deeds, trade arrangements, large-scale production deals (as where the forges of one town supplied iron to neighboring settlements in exchange for leather and meat, for example), as well as more personal affairs such as such as officiating marriages (in some regions, though marriage was informal elsewhere), or mediating disputes both large and small. In this capacity, the oathwrights served as county officials - that is, authorized by the local Count and representing the Count's approval; and by extension, in certain periods, representing the High King of Baliren, the Baliren Council, or the Crown in Agata. Oathwrights also served as public advocates within the county courts, as in the case of an individual facing criminal charges, or in various civil cases.  
  
 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;It was also the oathwrights' responsibility to maintain the records of these *oaths* (a term reflecting any agreement overseen by a 'wright or Count) and provide public access to them. Larger municipalities and Baliren's few cities housed permanent offices, employing multiple oathwrights specializing in certain tasks, where these records would be kept. Rural areas were often served by itinerant 'wrights, and records were housed under the auspices of the court itself. As Baliren's economy and politic centralized over the centuries, records were also increasingly held in duplicate in the capital at Ethenfarr and later in the Crown capital of Parovir.  
  
 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Oathwrights traditionally trained as apprentices under working masters, who then presented their pupils to the Count, Council, or Crown, for authorization. Again as Baliren centralized, this training came under the oversight of the College of Oathwrights, which operated campuses at Ethenfarr, Riverbend, and Balirhearth. Latter day 'wrights were authorized by the Baliren Council (or the Crown) and appointed to the various local courts (no longer constituted around an individual Count).  
  
 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Prior to the rise of printing, the records held by oathwrights' offices and courts were primarily restricted to the kinds of legal documents they dealt with. In the early days of the press, when costs were high and short runs were most common, their expertise was employed as a kind of public library service. New works were distributed to the courts and oathwrights, who maintained records of their growing collections and oversaw public access to this material. Apprentices within the oathwrights' office might hand copy popular texts for local distribution, especially the treasured *Quarter-day Prayer Book*. Later, central publishers began distributing 'authorized editions' by which a local printer would set and distribute copies, while the oathwright maintained the original.  
  
 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Over time, the profession came to specialize all of these various roles into separate offices and particular training programs. The chief distinctions among these are the so called Oathwright Advocate, which takes on the legal aspects of the profession, and the Oathwright Archivist, which overseers both the public records and library collections (still generally housed in a single institution). *The Oathwright* also remains a popular title for local newspapers, or for a section thereof reporting on business transactions, etc.

<TEXT> In the late 15th Century YC, Menem is embroiled in a kind of lukewarm war. The Agata-Jirenes War has ended, to no one's satisfaction, and disorganized fighting continues in many corners. Both great empires are waning, but each still seeks to hold the upper hand against its rival. Civil war looms in Jirenes, with the imperial army soon to stage a coup. The increasingly paranoid emperor attempted to purge the ranks of his generals, whom he blames for the failure of the War; but many escaped and fled to remote territories, with a majority of their troops. The emperor's private army - the security forces of the giant trading corporation TeuNau, itself losing interest in propping up the regime - are occupied in lands surrendered by Agata. These lands, ostensibly ceded to international jurisdiction, were given over to TeuNau's control through a controversial vote of the Council of Nations, a body critics now call the Purchased Parliament. Nationalist movements in those territories, already poised to fight against the Crown of Agata as the war came to a close, now find themselves 'liberated' and occupied by a foreign power. For its part, Agata has sponsored volunteer forces from Mbueti, Tesura, and Baliren, to foment rebellion within Jirenes, hoping to help the Free Army strike a decisive blow against the emperor.  
  
In the long-suffering Crucible of Grianna, which saw some of the worst fighting of the great War, unstable regimes change hands continually. Old borders and loyalties are remembered but functionally erased, swept away by the imperial allegiances that dragged the region into the War decades before.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> For most of history, the void is empty, just an endless nothing outside of creation. To your second question - traveling between the realms has been the goal of many faeries since the beginning of their exile. For the Gods, who made the world, this is a simple task. They don't often do it, but they can move among their realm and the various afterlifes, as well as they mortal world. Their presence, in part, begets magic, so they have never visited the prison realms, but they could. The magic given to humans by the Gods is limited and does not allow them to physically travel, but through ritual they can send offerings, prayers, and sacrifices - literally, physically - into to the realm of the Gods.   
  
The faeries have been trying to find a way out of their prison to strike back at the Gods, and over the eons have created a kind of magic unique to their grey wasteland - Artifice, the ability to manipulate and shape boundary between them and the mortal world. They cannot exactly travel across this boundary, but they can create permeable pockets where they can appear to humans, and create strange effects in either realm. One faerie, the great Artificer called Eiduen, punched through not to the divine realm but *outside* to the Void. She found that she could survive their, pulling across bits of the two other realms she could touch. She found that she could create new things there, out of the stuff of the existing realms. And she fancied herself a goddess of new creation and sought to remake the world according to her vision. Jealous of her - quite literal - breakthrough, other faeries sought to join her, but she kept them away wishing to perfect her creation on her own. As she worked, she pulled apart not only the fabric of the mortal world, but all of creation.  A rival Artificer, called Gluana Liath - the Grey Glass - sought to seal the tear into the void, and in so doing trapped himself there with Eiduen, and left worlds safe - for now - but changed. Faeries traffic across the boundary to the mortal world has become much easier, and portions of the Earth have been walled off within the faerie realm. Some humans have learned to work the faerie Artifice. </TEXT>

1. The home of the Gods (dwarfs live here too) 
2. The mortal world  
3. The Festhall, the heroes' afterlife
4. The afterlife for ordinary folk and the virtuous  
5. The afterlife for the treacherous  
6. The prison realm for the faeries, a barren waste "beneath the Earth and behind the sky"    
7. The prison realm for the giants, much like the mortal world, but cut off from the Gods and magic. Since they deemed the faeries responsible, the Gods only wanted to banish the giants, not punish them further.    

The colorless void, a 'byproduct' of the sundering that surrounds the realms. Thought inaccessible, perhaps even to the Gods, until the faeries find a way.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the beginning, all the world was one. The Gods and all their creations lived together in Heaven. All beings had their roles and contributions. The immortal Gods ruled all; the mortal humans knew death but they did not suffer, and they joined the Gods in the Houses of Revels when they passed; the faeries, dwarves, and giants served the Gods and made wondrous things. But, jealous of the power of the Gods, the faeries and the giants (goaded by the faeries) rebelled. The Heavens War raged long, and to protect the mortal humans, the Gods sundered the single world into nine realms - among which the humans could live protected in the fertile Earth, and the Gods could dwell in splendor in Heaven, while the rebel faeries and giants were banished to the silent prisons of the unmade places. The faeries have not ceased in their efforts to seize the power of the Gods, and so they found a way to breach the veil between their twilight prison and the mortal Earth. With this artifice they tempt the jealousies of humans, but always pursuing ways to attain higher powers to challenge the Gods once more.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Magic in Banbha can do many practical things, from clearing dust and warming fires, to warding against faerie intrusion and directing the beloved's eye in the direction of the caster. But one thing it cannot do is influence battles. Just as raising the dead or tearing the veil between the realms, such magic is a violation of the will of the Gods. Since humans' Small Magic is a gift of the Gods, such acts are not only forbidden but impossible. The Gods will never give one human a greater weapon to use against another. Human quarrels, and human battles, must strictly be fought on human terms. Those who distinguish or debase themselves will be rewarded or punished as is proper, regardless of the sides they took.  
  
That is not to say that humans have not tried to eke out magical advantage for their soldiers. Forbidden by the Gods, some have turned to the faeries for such boons. Faeries are the great enemies of the Gods, so such an effort has already demeaned the seeker, who will be shunned from the heroes' afterlife. But further, faerie magic is rarely all that is purveyors claim. Any warrior seeking an unearned advantage on the battlefield is likely to meet an unseemly end of his own making. Indeed "he dealt in faerie magic" is an idiom equivalent to "hoisted by his own petard." These usually involve 'Midas touch' sorts of curses, where the power granted far exceeds the wish. Such as the chief who bid a faerie make his skin impermeable, and who shortly starved as food "passed him as a foot through a pair of hose" in the words of the bard.  
  
Now, the Gods themselves, facing dire enemies in the faeries and giants, will seek every advantage for their cosmic wars. They have crafted magical arms and armor of miraculous powers - spears of heavenly lightning, or the spells that split the world into its many realms to imprison the enemies of the Gods. Even so, the braver historians have mused, it is pursuit of these weapons and tactics that has hardened the faeries' resolve and protracted their rebellion against the Gods. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Contemporary professional sports are hugely problematic\*. The leagues are structures are capitalist machines for their owners profit; and even while top players make obscene salaries, most players (consider the minor leagues and 'farm team' concept) do not, and represent an exploited labor class. The Olympics too are profit-driven, and as exemplified in the recent case of Rio, do nothing for international solidarity or aid.   
  
But sport itself definitely has a place in a socialist society. Local clubs and intramurals at universities become the primary outlets. There is even an argument for a professional structure, organized around players' unions rather than corporate interests; compensated as are artists or other entertainers.   
  
Edit to add rant: \* And the whole profit-driven system surrounding them perverts everything it touches. The NCAA exploits student labor, while denying it even constitutes labor. Universities and colleges massively misallocate funds to support athletics programs over education or other student activities; cities and municipalities do the same, beholden to their sports teams for income. A mindset of 'making the big league' as the ultimate goal forces children to distinguish themselves as athletes in middle and high school, to the detriment of their health and education. I could rant on, but yes, certainly sports as they currently exist are grossly capitalist, but I believe they can be reformed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Menem is a world of extreme geographical features (because they're fun and dramatic!), and many of its cities were founded in impressively defensible locations.  
The historic center of **Ethenfarr** sits on a rocky promontory at the upper end of a large island in the Traveling River. It is difficult for besieging vessels to moor in the rapid waters upstream of the fortress, and the approach overland calls for a long slog up stony slopes. The city is surrounded by pastures and farmland, vulnerable enough targets, but the fortress itself has never fallen.  
Agata's capital at **Parovir** is built high atop the cliffs of the Seawall, with the vast expanse of the Sunken Sea before it; and at its back, the steep, narrow Cashat Valley. The approach along the cliffs is treacherous, and though the valley can be climbed, the city commands Mithrenna, a huge navigable aqueduct which can be drained or flooded, or have its flow reversed, and serves as huge rampart in defense of the capital. The defensive structures, and the mythic stature of the city, prevented all attempts at siege until it fell in Agata-Jirenes War to aerial bombardment.

<TEXT> In magical Banbha (there is a version of the world without magic), human magic users have various - mostly informal - titles depending on the primary functions of the magic they use. Most people have access to some Small Magic, and rarely are referred to by any particular term. Among others who use magic more often, 'druid' or 'priest' refers to those who perform ritual magic and tend to sacred shrines and altars; 'witch' refers to those perform hearth magic, charms, and wards to protect homes. These are magicks open to anyone, as is true of any craft, but druids and witches are those who have specialized. There are also a number of monastic sects, devoted to various Gods or sites, who perform some ritual magic as well as healing arts. These are most often called 'good brother' or 'good sister.' Finally there are faeries, among whom powerful magic users are called 'artificer.' 
  
In Grand Adhica, all magic users are generally called 'mage,' but they can also be distinguished by the sect they belong to, which determines the measures they have taken to ward against being dominated by another mage. Court mages are called the Unnamed after the process they undergo to strip themselves of a magical name. Two significant outside groups are the Listeners and Sages, both of which practice a king of hivemind/collective consciousness which protects individual members from outside influence.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Many regions of Menem, especially in Ijeida, use important geographical and/or cultural features for orienting, rather than cardinal directions. In Baliran, for example, most people talk about four directions:

* Toward the Ice (north)
* Toward the Sea (south)
* Toward the Traveling River (east or west, depending which side of the river you are on)
* Toward the mountains (almost any direction, but functionally meaning "away from the river")  
  
For Balirans, the River is the center of the world, so River-ward and anti-River [temporary terms pending conlang] are the most important.  
  
The city of Ecevet is built into the cliffs along the south side of the Sunken Sea and residents use their own orienteering terms as well. 

* Seaward or Outward (roughly north)
* Inward (roughly south)
* Windward (with the prevailing westerly wind)
* Zenith (up within the many levels of tunnels that comprise the city)
* Nadir (down within the city) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Waterfall powered elevators sound rad! Ecevet uses tidewater rushing in and out of lower level tunnels to power mills. Latter-day Ecevet (it was founded in antiquity and survives into the modern era), is studded with protruding structures, including cranes and wind turbines. The turbines assist in pumping tidewater up into higher levels, where it is stored and in turn used to power the cranes and elevators - first via complex mechanical infrastructure and then with electric power. Part of the city surrounds a protected cove, with relatively calm, deep waters. Ships are able to anchor near the walls and the cranes are used to haul cargo up and down. Internal navigation was historically on foot, or with manual lifts where rider/operators haul on ropes to move a cart along (usually steeply inclined, but not vertical) shafts. These too are later replaced with hydroelectric power.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Central and northern Ijeida, on Menem, are studded with geological marvels, chief among them the Sea Wall in Agata and the Great Scarp in Mbueti. 
  
The Sea Wall, which rises dramatically around the shores of the Sunken Sea (giving the Sea its name, in fact), reaches its greatest height at about 1km - but is famously exaggerated to "half a league high." Two of Agata's great cities, Parovir and Ecevet, a situated in part on the fave of the vast cliffs. Parovir is built on the vast terraces that were created when harvesting the Wall's stone to build ancient Agata's many ancient engineering wonders; while Ecevet is a many-layered network of tunnels extended back from the cliff's sheer face.  
  
North of Agata, in Mbueti, the high desert is split by the immense Great Scarp. These cliffs rise 'merely' 400-500m, but extend for nearly 500km. Like Ecevet, many settlements are carved into the rock of the Scarp. The much-traveled Summer Road hugs the shadow at its foot. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Banbha is an island, slightly smaller than Ireland, located southwest of the Emerald Isle in the Celtic Sea. It started as just an alt-history of Ireland (with the kernel "what if England had left Ireland the hell alone?"), but eventually I decided to turn it into a separate place. I've tried to have it play a role in world history, without drastically altering the course of events, but it has had its impact. 
  
Some highlights:

* Romans generally believed the island was a myth, and early Christian missionaries were slow to visit it, so it was Christianized last among European populations. 
* The Normans came to Banbha significantly later than to Britain or Ireland, and never pushed past the east coast, but maintained a foothold there. 
* There was a powerful native Banbhan kingdom when the English came later, which successfully repelled the invaders and held the center of the island.
* Banbha later became a major strategic target to Europe's naval powers, with the establishment of a Spanish settlement/fort/harbor on the west coast, frequently coming under fire from English ships. The climactic battle that would have happened at Trafalgar, instead happened off the coast of Banbha, though with the same outcome, leaving London with iconic Bhiscaia Square instead. 
* Many Irish emigrants fleeing famine went to independent Banbha instead of crossing all the way to America [having an influence I haven't sorted out yet]
* Steamships departing Europe often made their final call in Banbha instead of Ireland, meaning - among other outcomes - the maiden voyage of the Titanic took her on a course ever so slightly further south. She was sunk not in 1912 by ice but in 1915 by a U-boat, shortly before the Lusitania. The greater public outcry drew the USA into WWI by the end of that year instead of 1917. [I also haven't determined what impact that will have on the outcomes of the war, but it won't be significant enough to, say, prevent WWII] </TEXT>

But yeah, to just say they "can't believe" these shows don't have queer characters isn't contributing much. A think piece on how various popular shows could incorporate queer characters (more than just "these shows should have queer characters") would have been more interesting.  </TEXT>

Descended from a remora-like species like those that frequently accompanied the Maaumm's own whale-like ancestors, Wouwa have become intelligent, highly dedicated service animals, performing fine motor tasks out of reach of the behemoths. When Maaumm gather socially (as well as in close-knit working groups such as starship crews), their Wouwa form a kind of collective support network, aiding their masters' friends as they would their own.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Agata was historically ruled by a triumvirate called the Dodore Menem, Sisters of the Seas, consisting of three women of the ruling house. In its ideal form, the Dodore included three generations of mothers and daughters, but as all forms of governance, various arrangements arose, with sisters, aunts, cousins, and lovers, all taking the seats at different times. In the later years of the institution, a single queen became the dominant figure, as a 'first among equals,'  her mother and daughter forming the symbolic triad with her.  
  
To the south, in Griana, maritime republics were long the norm. In their early form, suffrage was limited to a property-holding class (in most of the cities, this indicated owning a fleet or interest in a trading company). These were slow to democratize, but later became the forefront of the Meanweal and workers' republic movements. Though short lived and met with harsh resistance (notably, primarily from foreign interests), these became Menem's first socialist states, a model for the successful Baliran Meanweal.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> They charge what they can make people believe they have to pay. I used to have Comcast - and after the first-year 'promotional rate' of $26 ran out, my price jumped to $75. I called to complain, and was told "yes, that's the full price for the service" (5Mb!). I said, "that's horseshit, please cancel my service." Then they found another promotional rate. I was able to keep this up for five years, calling to 'cancel' every six months to get a better rate. Eventually a 'customer loyalty' rep flat-out told me I had maxed out my account's allotted 'give them a better price if they complain' tokens. I suspect that person was fired. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Menem's an Earth-like planet orbiting a Sun-like star, so it's daytime sky would be unremarkable to a visitor from Earth. It is ~15 light years from Earth, so it's night sky looks roughly similar to what we see; it is filled with pretty much the same stars, albeit in slightly different apparent arrangement. Two key differences would be apparent to an observer familiar with Earth's sky. The first is the number of moons - Menem has three, which due to their composition appear red, blue, and green. The second difference results from the orbital orientation of Menem's system, almost perpendicular to the galactic plane (CF Earth's 60 degree tilt). That is, Menem's north pole points toward the galactic center, while its southern pole points outward. As a result, the famous band of the Milky Way galaxy dominates the northern sky, while the southern sky is relatively dark.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The one alien species I have pinned down so far got named while considering what their anatomy is like and what kind of language they would have. The first description I had for them was as "six-limbed, faceless giants," which I attributed to the first human who encountered them. From there, I developed them as whale-like, with a language built not on vocalizing but on internal "thumps and rumbles." So what would terrestrial (and spacefaring) whalesong sound like? And then, what would a human, trying to mimic those kinds of sounds, sound like? That's how I got to *Maaumm* or *MMM* (for now).

<TEXT> **Banbha**^1 is an alt-history of Earth. Though I've mostly focused on the Celtic Sea island itself, and situating its role in world history, the various real-world powers exist around it. Since I'm developing **Menem** at many different time periods, I'll pit Menem's great nations against (roughly) comparable Earth powers.  
  
* Iuliat vs. Phoenicia: Both are accomplished early thalassocracies, and wide-spread colonizers. Pre-Carthage, Iuliat probably ekes out the win. In Iuliat vs. Carthage, Hannibal takes the prize.
* Ancient Agata vs. the Roman Empire: Both boast vast territory and many tributaries; great feats of engineering; large militaries. Agata has great advantage at sea, and can mobilize skilled Baliran forces on the ground. Rome has greater numbers and better tacticians. This war is long and bloody, both are devastated, but Rome likely wins. 
* Modern Agata vs. England or Spain: Agata built the largest and finest navy in human history - across all three worlds - and would easily have smashed Earth's naval powers from the 16th to 19th centuries. 
* The Uajiren Empire vs. the Allies (WWII): Menem and Earth ideologies don't always line up, but Jirenes would likely have sided with the Axis powers, and would have brought a powerhouse industrial economy to Hitler's aid. Such an alliance can produce vast numbers of missiles and jet fighters and might quickly overwhelm the Allies. If, perhaps, Agata were to also join, they would re-balance the equation, ensuring the Allies' supremacy at sea, accelerating the war in the Pacific. The US still develops nuclear weapons and ends the war. 
* Any state on Menem vs. nuclear powers on Earth: No contest, if it comes to it. Menem never develops nuclear weapons. 
  
1: There are two versions of Banbha, one mundane and one fantasy. Here I'm talking about the mundane. If the fantasy Banbha goes to war with any power of Menem, it can leverage witches, faeries, and giants, and will win every time.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> In old Agata, treason against the Crown carried such a sentence - and that was extended to mutiny against a ship's captain, be it a naval flagship, merchant freighter, fishing skiff, or luxury yacht. An old saying goes, "the wise sailor fears his captain's wrath before the sea's." A captain was well within his rights to put any man overboard, but in modern Agata it became more common to bring insubordinate sailors before a tribunal on land. A finding of mutiny - and therefore treason - still carried the death penalty, generally executed by taking the convicted out to sea and putting them overboard. Still, this was considered an honorable death - to die in the embrace of the sea. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Like the [explanations for how they are recorded](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/6lu07y/who_are_the_collectors_of_your_worlds/djwvfft/) the answer to this may vary.  
  
In traditional belief, anyone can drawn on the memories of the stone, but the right to do so is reserved to the Keeper and his pupil/successor, apart from very special circumstances.  
  
Non-believers who view it as a meditative practice of the Keeper often suppose that he can teach it to his successor, or can convey the emotional weight of the events remembered, but doubt that the memories are retrieved as if they were recordings.  
  
Alien theorists also suppose that anyone could tap into the recordings in the stone, with varying notions as to whether or not the Keeper and Stone should be left alone.  </TEXT>

The Stone is physically unaltered except by the minimal wear of the Keeper's touch. In the view of the Keeper and fellow adherents to traditional ways, it is a spiritual act that records the memories in a transcendent consciousness.  
  
Outside observers have characterized it as a meditative practice of the Keeper, by which he recalls previous emotional states, independent of the stone except as an object of focus.  
  
There are also all manner of other theories about the Stone being an alien artifact using some unknown technology.   </TEXT>

The Keeper of the White Forest Sanctuary 'collects' great moments in history and records them on the Memory Stone of Sovdu. The prehistoric standing stone bears hand prints worn by the touch of countless generations. By long tradition, it is the source of human collective memory. The stone is believed to have stood at the center of an ancient settlement, whose members laid hands on it to mark every birth and death, but it now resides in a remote clearing in the Sanctuary, where it is tended by the Keeper alone. At times of great hardship and triumph, the Keeper imprints the memory of those events on the stone, reciting a litany of what has come before.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The power to change shape was the last gift of Nadwin to *an Stealan*, the Beloved, the first people. Nadwin summoned them from the stones after He had made all the rest of the world, and gave them eternal life, to watch over His creation. But after countless eons, watching the earth around them grow and wither, grow and wither, they had become weary. They begged their creator to let them pass from the world, as did all other things. This He granted them, letting his Beloved Children pass into the realm of rest, but He gave them two more gifts: the will to return to the living world, and the power to take any shape within if they so chose. And so they come and go, no longer bound to the world but attuned to its suffering.  
  
When the despairing Nadwin then summoned humankind from the mud, the Beloved became their guardians, no longer in their own shapes but in the forms of animals, plants, stones and clouds. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have several time periods for Menem, and there are a number of things in one time period named for notable people/places/events from others.   
  
Prince adel Anar (semi-mythical) is a heroic figure originating in Sovdu, most famous for victory in the Battle of the White Forest and for writing a poetic ode to his fallen comrades. Anar becomes a popular name throughout later periods. A notable bearer is Anar Uajeuma, a post-contact biologist and Union-ist supporter.  
  
A pair of Union space stations Sovdu Ruehafi\* and Qarisa Ruehafi are named for ancient cities on Menem, famed for their university and ancient engineering marvels respectively. The two stations are given the names Paragon and Quintessence in English. 
  
Edolhrem was an ancient (also semi-mythical) king of Baliren, said to have driven out a army of invaders from the south and to have unified the region under the High Kingdom. A latter-day rebellion styled itself as Edolhrem's Rising (elsewhere called the War of the Pretenders), having problematically interpreted the mythical southern invaders as modern-day Agata.

<TEXT> For most of the history of Menem (whose name means "the seas") the most powerful military has belonged to the great naval powers. In the ancient world that was Iuliat and Agata, each unrivaled in their sphere of influence. Iuliat, the earlier to emerge, dominated *Men olre*, the Circle Sea, and the coastal territories of Tevra and Terit. Their power was owed not only to the consummate skill of their mariners, but also to a rich understanding of the cycles of the planet's three moons and its unforgiving tides. Meanwhile the ancient Agatters were skilled engineers as well as sailors - navigating Ijeida's 'unnumbered' inland seas, and constructing grand canals and aqueducts to connect them.  
  
Moving into modern times, ancient Iuliat long since faded, Agata became the great power of the Circle Sea and beyond. The Crown built a grand ocean-going fleet that even braved *Men doeth*, the vast uncharted Outer Sea, covering more than half the world. From oar, to sail, to steam; wooden hulls to ironclad leviathans - Agata and Her queens ruled the seas, and so ruled the world.  
  
But reliance on naval power was to become Agata's undoing. As the Intercontinental Wars unfolded, the Crown built ever larger destroyers and deeper diving submarines. She neglected the novel canvas wings of the show planes that had astonished the world at the Sovdu Exposition; but not so Jirenes. Unable to face his rival at sea, the Uajiren Emperor saw the potential of air dominance and ordered hundreds of warplanes, clad in his engineers' new lightweight alloys, and carrying precision bombs. So the Imperial Air Forces became the most powerful weapon as the esteemed Agatter navy sat helpless.  </TEXT>

Divided Lands consisted of a single continent, with some nebulous 'rest of the world' outside it, while Gashifa was a larger world but had one continent I hadn't fleshed out yet. DL was initially fantasy, so I developed it separately, but was beginning to strip out the magic elements, when I realized they fit nicely together and solved a lot of each other's problems. So, I mashed them together and Menem was born.  
  
My very first world ever, **Nyreal** or **Oriscilliny**, which I had long since retired, I eventually revived a few pieces of to serve as one culture's mythology within Menem.  
  
Finally, I was developing an independent space opera setting, **Paragon Station**, which I have since tacked onto Menem as a future scenario.  
  
Two other projects, **Sparks**/**Denizens** and **Banbha**, post-apoc. cyberpunk and modern fantasy respectively, are sprinkled with Easter eggs suggesting, for my amusement, that they are also part of the same universe. </TEXT>

Sure it gets hot and humid in the summer, but I spend a lot of time out in the woods, in the shade down by a creek - so nice! And I love when that first cool evening comes around at the start of Fall. Break out my favorite jacket again, find 37 cents and some ticket stubs in the pockets. And Fall smells so good! Then dust off my boots and tromp around in the snow (didn't really snow last Winter, which was dumb); or curl up inside with a blanket, a book, the cat, and some tea. And when I'm tired of the cold, Spring is back. Open the windows, watch a couple good storms roll through, and the woods turn green.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> would they have naturally made one themselves or would the surface...have given theirs... 
 
Probably depends on contact (whether they have it at all) and length of isolation (if they are out of contact). A subterranean society descended in recent memory from a surface group would probably maintain some form of the old calendar. But a society long isolated, or one that developed entirely underground, would have no reason to do so - or no concept of light cycles at all.  
  
With a lack of external stimuli (though geological processes might provide some form of that apart from light?) the most likely source of some kind of temporal regulation would be internal body systems of creatures/people involved. There's evidence of long-isolated (millions of years) cave fish that still maintain a kind of circadian rhythm, albeit based on food (probably?), and interestingly stretched out to longer than a day.

<TEXT> There was an attempt to establish a universal religion by excerpting passages about peace, goodwill, compassion, and other good things from scripture and other religious writings and bringing them together in the Unified Book of Peace. In protest to this attempt, a rival group compiled the Book of Drevin (an assumed name of the primary editor), which selected passages condoning violence, acts of revenge and destruction, and - in particular - descriptions of demons and monsters. Both were presented as utopian projects: the Book of Peace would unite all faiths by showing adherents how much they had in common; the Book of Drevin would bring about an end of religion by presenting scripture as universally problematic. Neither succeeded and both were largely ignored at the time.  
  
A generation later, in the midst of a severe economic depression, Drevin was dusted off and embraced by a fanatical cult to establish a fascist regime, proclaiming its leaders to be Jtnar emerging triumphant from the devastation of Ragnarok, having triumphed over the gods of old. The Followers of Drevin are often credited with pulling the world out of depression, and they do rule over a strong economy, by pretty much only the inner circle and military are really winners. Others have few rights and disappearances are quite common.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Menem has many spectacular natural wonders. Chief among these for the absurdly wealthy and/or danger-minded are the **Turning Lands**, highly active volcanic islands at the center of the Inner Sea. [My plate tectonics may not be up to snuff, but] The Turning Lands occupy a small plate mushed in the center of Menem's great continental plates, all sliding around it - thus, over long periods, the island group has been observed to rotate. A visitor cannot witness the turning, but can sit out at sea to observe lava flows, plumes of smoke and fire, and other pyrotechnic displays. Do be careful to position your ship upwind, as you don't want to suffocate in the gas clouds rolling off the islands.  
  
For wonders of the built environment, you'll want to visit Agata's great infrastructure projects around the Sunken Sea - from the **Mithrenna Viaduct** to the **Crane Docks at Ecevet**, there are many marvels of ancient engineering to behold, still unrivaled by modern technology.  
  
Or you could travel to Tehlaer to witness the greatest pilgrimage on Menem, as thousands set out each day to walk the **Ghost Road** across the high plateau, escorting the souls of their dead loved ones to the edge of the world. To do so as a tourist would be the height of culturally insensitive asshattery. But if you are looking for a pious outlet for your enormous wealth, it is a most respectable act of kindness to bear food and water to the pilgrims, many of whom in their grief set out without sufficient supply to make the whole journey.  </TEXT>

They don't want deities to rule them, but rather the faeries thought they could each become a new god by claiming the divine magic. For a long time the imprisonment worked, but the faeries figured out how to mess with the boundaries and reach into the mortal realm. They can't (most of them anyway) actually cross over, but they can cause all sorts of mischief - from wayward teapots that don't seem to stay where you put them, all the way to pocket universes where a piece of one realm has bled into the other. The most powerful have managed to obtain certain humans as servants that do their bidding. </TEXT>

The Gods did not fear that such a rebellion would succeed, but they saw the devastation it wrought in the lives of the mortal humans living among them. To protect the humans, punish the rebellion, the Gods sundered Heaven into many realms, retaining Heaven for themselves alone, creating the Mortal Earth for humans, and banishing the rebel faeries and giants to realms of barren wasteland.

I'm glad we're trying out a soccer team for Cincinnati, and I really enjoyed seeing them play at Nippert. I'd like to see FC Cincinnati become a permanent fixture of the city going forward. But I have to wonder who benefits from the MLS requirement that a team have a dedicated stadium. At least Lindner also says they intend to make the facility available to other users.

<TEXT>  Do the other planets seeded with life from earth have intelligent life?

They don't have other forms of intelligent life. Or, not in the period in which humans are living there. Menem bears some unexplained ruins, abandoned long before the seeding, but a satisfying explanation for them has yet to emerge.       
  
About 10,000 years ago, populations of humans, along with samples from their environments were carted off to set them up on other worlds. Menem, one of those other worlds, was the first 'alien' life Earth encountered - and were surprised to find humans already there. There is little direct evidence regarding these events, and some even argue they may have happened by accident. The less pro-human species suggest humans may have stowed away on EGC (the Extinct Galactic Civilization) vessels like vermin.  
    
 ...how welcoming of humans was the Galaxy?

Somewhere in the middle of that scale. No one launched extermination wars against them, but neither did they rapidly ascend to become the dominant species. The most welcoming were the Maaum, the first humans contacted. They became humans' mentors or sponsors on the galactic scene, and diplomatic contact with others primarily went through them. Over time, humans came to be tolerated well enough, but considered a backwater species with little to contribute.   
  
Edit: updated upon actually understanding the question.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> When Earth and Menem emerge on the galactic scene, hair took on a number of interesting roles in human societies. Mammalian hair, it turns out, is unique to Earth and to the three other planets seeded by the EGC with specimens from Earth. The other species they encounter responded in different ways, ranging from indifference, through curiosity, to disgust.  
  
Humans often modified their hairstyles based on the species they interacted with. For example, early human diplomats contacting the chitin-bearing and highly xenophobic Sirig, frequently shaved their heads and faces - or underwent whole body hair removal- and wore plastic armor to make their appearance more amenable to their hosts.  
  
Even in later centuries, as humans established a place in galactic society, many prefer to remain closely shorn, or keep hair covered, to better fit in among their neighbors. Others, however, have embraced a 'pro-human, pro-hair' ethic, refraining from shaving or even trimming their hair, and styling it in elaborate fashions.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> According to Dialogism, the Universe consists of opposing (and/or complementary) forces pushing back and forth on each other, seeking balance. Life, the Gods, the World, all things, are made by the motion and change that these Dialogs between forces create. In time, all forces will settle, change will cease, nothing new will be created, and everything will fade away. Essentially, the heat death of the universe.  
  
Many adherents of Etaretare believe that the sea is the ultimate power, the beginning and end state of the world. Land arose from the sea, and is always returning to it. In the end, all the Earth will be weathered away leaving only perpetual ocean once more.  
  
Elsewhere in my worldbuilding multiverse, the folk of Banbha aren't content to anticipate the slow natural processes of empathy. There, the Gods know there will come a time of great upheaval. Their ancient enemies will escape their prisons, and will try once more to depose them. The last time this happened, the Gods shattered the once uniform Heaven to imprison the faeries and giants in isolated dungeon realms. They foresee a coming final battle, in which the Gods shall be triumphant, unifying the realms once more - Heaven restored, but the mortal Earth will cease to exist.   </TEXT>

If the embryos/genetic material/whathaveyou is from known donors, perhaps those people are given the chance to name their children before sending them off. So you get names as diverse (or not) as the parental generation.

<TEXT> In Banbha:  
  
* Great Magic: Potentially universe-endingly dangerous, but no one can just stumble upon it. It is the domain of the Gods, jealously guarded. But that guardianship can also be dangerous. The Gods sundered Heaven in order to banish the giants and faeries and prevent them from gaining access to the Great Magic. 
* Small Magic: No more dangerous than any mundane task. With or without magic, you might burn your hand in the cookfire or slip from the roof while thatching. Life is dangerous, humans using magic has little impact on that. 
* Artifice: More dangerous than anyone has really predicted. The Gods thought banishment would prevent the faeries from stealing their magic, but now they have invented their own. They don't understand the reaches of its power, and are beginning to cause irreparable damage not only to their own prison realm but also to the mortal world.  
  
In Adhixa:  
  
Using magic beyond your skill level can be very dangerous, just as in any trade or discipline. But the real danger of magic rests in the source of its power, the language of names. To know another's name is to be able to control them; and to control the power of another mage is to increase one's own exponentially. Any mage is susceptible to influence by another mage unless she is either Unnamed by the Great Court or shackled to a hive mind such as the Listeners or the ascetic Sages. A rebel mage could topple an empire with only a handful of thralls, so no mage may be left unguarded.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hard to pin down, really, 'cause I sort of have always been worldbuilding. When I was little I drew maps and pictures of animals I made up that lived in those places. In grade school I was constantly drawing spaceship plans and giving the crews harrowing missions. My class notes from high school are covered in doodles of dragon, next to lists of their powers, names, and histories. Etc.    
   
I was always immersed in fictional worlds: the usual suspects like Narnia, Star Wars, and Middle Earth; and went to bunches of [storytelling festivals](http://www.storytellingcenter.net/festival/) growing up. Building my own just seemed the natural thing to do.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Banbha has three types of magic, used by different sorts of beings for different sorts of tasks: Great Magic, Small Magic, and Artifice.  
  
**Great Magic** consists of the powers of creation and destruction wielded by the Gods alone. It is with Great Magic that the Gods made the universe, fought their terrible wars against the giants, and split Heaven into the nine realms to imprison their enemies.  
  
**Small Magic** was a gift given to humans after the Gods sundered Heaven to punish the faeries and giants, granted for their loyalty and faithfulness. Though not strictly differentiated, Small Magic has two primary area of practice: Altar and Hearth. People use altar magic to bless sacred objects, make offerings to the Gods, and perform sacred rites. Hearth magic is for all purpose getting-things-done at home and work: sweep the stoop, start a fire, stir the soup, track a lost lamb, keep the creep neighbor out of your house. As the name 'small' implies, it allows for simple conveniences and connection to the Gods, but can never grant a human the powers of creation.  
  
**Artifice** is a discipline created by the faeries after they were banished by the Gods to the Grey realm "behind and beneath the mortal Earth." The Grey began as a endless formless waste, but the faeries soon learned how to manipulate it - and came to fancy themselves a new kind of god. With Artifice, they craft wondrous homes and landscapes in their realm, and reach through to the mortal world to manipulate humans. They are honing their craft, and believe they can some day reach back into Heaven and wage war on the Gods once more.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Principles of the Republic  
  
More a legal document than a law, per se, Principles is the title given to the preamble of the Constitution of Baliren. Though a proper convention would follow later to officially ratify the document, Principles was originally drafted by Praven Terelson ("poet laureate of the rebellion") during the siege of Ethenfarr. In content, it resembles a meeting of the US Bill of Rights and the UN Declaration of Human Rights, and binds the state to uphold these rights and to serve its citizens above all else. It became the basis for most subsequent modern constitutions, including the founding charter of the global Gishefa Union as well as the interplanetary Ambassador Accord which united Earth and Menem.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Haarken-Balirhearth** was the primary arms manufacturer for the Crown of Agata and her allies during the Intercontinental Wars. More a trade union than a company, H-B represented the collectivized steel and manufacturing industries of the towns of Haarken and Balirhearth in western Baliran. H-B's prominence came to draw the best innovators, so even while forges across the continent were producing arms for the Crown's war effort, almost all were building H-B designs.  
  
Haarken-Balirhearth's counterpart under the Uajiren Empire was **Teugad Naufair**, the Western Capital Group. TeuNau began as an overseas trading company working for the Empires interests, and soon developed its own well-armed fleet. At the time of the wars a century after its founding, TeuNau had strayed from its original brief considerably. It was now the world's leading producer of ships, warplanes, and small arms. It furnished arms for the Imperial forces as well as its own security force. By the end of the Wars, that private army had become the Emperor's personal security agency and secret police.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  completely removing magic from a fantasy world
  
That's exactly how I got Menem in its current form. I had two separate worlds. Menem (before it was so named) was medieval-ish fantasy; Gashifa was alt-history and space opera. But Menem was only a single continent, for which I needed a foreboding foreign enemy; Gashifa had an empty continent which I had placed and named but not built anything for. Putting them together quite handily filled in the gaps in both worlds - except Menem lost its magic in the process. Some of the fantasy elements became in-world folklore; but some of it I just discarded.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mostly, airports will corral you where you need to go, but it can definitely be overwhelming if you haven't done it before.  
  
Make sure to get to the airport with a couple hours to spare - it can take a while.  
  
At the airport, go to your airline's desk - or kiosk - and present your ID. They'll pull up your info, take your bags, and print your boarding pass. I like this part. Once I get my boarding pass in hand, I always feel like "I'm going on an adventure!!" Some airlines/booking companies let you print the boarding pass ahead of time - but I honestly find that more of a hassle than just waiting in line when you get there.     
  
Security is next, and usually a hassle, but there'll be signs and TSA folk barking commands. They get a bad rap, but they're just trying to their job and most will be reasonable if you're cooperating. They'll ask you to do some stuff that seems asinine - like taking off your shoes for the x-ray scanner - but roll with it.  
  
Find your gate, grab a cinnabon, and try to drown out CNN playing on 15 screens.  

Customs is usually handled by the destination country. An attendant will probably give you a form on the plane, and then they'll herd the passengers through a checkpoint after you land. They might ask some questions, but should be painless. This is when you get your passport stamped! So, I like that part too.

Yes, she is suggesting exactly that.

Home growing for personal use was limited and selling outside of the approved distributors still illegal.

Uajiren is an in-world conlang, developed by the 1st and 2nd Imperial Linguistic Congresses under Emperor Katlisa II. Among his many nation-building projects, Katlisa desired a single national language to unite his vast new territories. He imagined an "alchemy of tongues" that could "distill our many voices down to the pure, original, continental tongue of Jirenes," believing he could accurately reproduce a long-lost ancestral proto-language. Despite his visions, the resulting language consisted of just as much contemporary invention as linguistic scholarship. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I recognize it will be difficult, but that doesn't mean it's a bad idea. People resist public transit, saying that we need our cars - but that was the result of a very successful PR campaign; and the reverse is possible. We believe we need our cars because transit isn't good enough; so we don't support improvement of transit because we need our cars...What if we didn't need cars because transit was so good?     
  
Trump is a temporary setback, and federal support for rail can be regained under another administration. Responses to today's statement indicate that a majority are tired of him already.  
  
The citizens of Cincinnati were happy enough to pay higher taxes for the stadium, for all the good it's done us. Again, good PR goes a long way.   
  
Before even looking at a regional rail system, a good system within the city(ish) could be an enormous boon. Neighborhoods like Mt. Adams and Clifton initially thrived because of the old street car and the inclines. Replacing them can be a new impetus for growth; connecting students to OTR, and wealthier residents to downtown attractions; connecting downtown jobs to suburban communities. WE can get over our stateline drama and connect NKY bedroom communities to the city, too. There is use for it, if we implement it.

<TEXT> Well, I have a couple threads following stories in different time periods, so 'now' in each of the in:  
  
A note on years and seasons: Menem's calendar counts from the founding of the city of Parovir (YC: Year of the City). The new year, marked by the conjunction of the planet's three moons, occurs on the 17th day after the vernal equinox. In the future, the alliance between Earth and Menem creates [a new calendar for governing activity in space](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/68s6ma/what_dating_systems_do_you_use/dh1fq1e/).      

Winter 1374 YC: The Ijeida Rebellion is at its height. Early in the year, the Queen's Revolt successfully extracted Fiddha do Lyria from house arrest in the palace in Parovir; the revolutionary Republican Works Commission freed the TeuNau prison camp at High Pass. Now in late winter, a coalition of sometime rival factions have held the city of Ethenfarr for two months, against a siege by occupation forces.  
  
Mid-summer 1580 YC: Rioting has crippled the Union capital of Gishefa, and other cities around the world. The bulk of the representatives of the 3rd Arrival from Earth have evacuated to Ambassador Station in orbit, though a number remain unaccounted for. Among these, unable to report in during the chaos, is Prof. Perrin Shou, who has taken shelter with a population of refugees, inside the sacred, forbidden, White Forest.   
  
UY 157, 8th month, 2nd shift (~1710 YC): Members of the operations staff of Union Station Paragon have undertaken a project to construct of small, personal use, FTL craft, by hand using spare parts.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Humans settled other worlds long before they ever discovered space flight - on the order of 10,000 years before. The only clear evidence as to how/why/when this happened is actually a lack thereof - humans (and hominid ancestors) appear in the fossil record only on Earth, while the oldest archaeological evidence on Menem and Renii is, as mentioned, 10,000 years old.  
  
Proposed explanations range from divine intervention to ancient aliens to a "universal evolutionary predisposition" (debunked because of the fossil evidence, but tightly clung to by some, like a latter day anti-vax). The alien species of the Galactic Peace Organization believe the human mystery is further evidence for a hypothesized extinct galactic civilization, which settled and even terraformed many planets throughout the Milky Way.  
  
Unbeknownst (and possibly unknowable) to anyone in-universe, while the extinct civilization did occupy much of the galaxy, and did observe many other 'primitive' species, they were unaware of humans and the transportation *Homo sapiens* to multiple worlds was a complete accident, the byproduct of the catastrophic failure of an experimental FTL engine.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's sort of what happens to all the magic in Adhicha. A mage left to her own devices possesses phenomenal cosmic power - she can raise a mountain or drain the sea, dominate vast armies or control Emperors, send stars supernova or collapse the galaxy. But almost all mages are tightly restrained in some way - submitted to a hive mind by the Listeners or forced to Unname themselves by the Court. The result - despite the potentially grand scale of their spells, mages are most often seen effortlessly harvesting turnips and painting exquisitely detailed street signs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dialogism is the largest religion on Menem, practiced widely across the continents of Tevra and Jirenes. Although it is a diverse religion with many sects, the central tenet can be stated clearly: the universe consists of the interaction between opposing forces, moving towards balance. This is the Dialog. Sectarian differences arise over interpretations of ancient texts and perspectives on the number of Dialogs. The predominant form, practiced throughout Terit and Qareya (where it is paired with folk traditions as well) asserts Eight Most High Divinities and four Holy Dialogs between them, in pairs. Other traditions assert everywhere from one Holy Dialog (composed of the forces of creation and destruction) to infinitely many.  
  
In Tevra, this diversity is celebrated as a core facet of the faith: Discourse and debate help mortals to refine their understanding of the transcendent. However, in Jirenes under the Uajiren Empire, the Church of the Eight Most High became the dogma of the state. To question it was treason. Because of this, Jirenes in post-imperial days tends to be more secular. </TEXT>

<TEXT> * Baliren's Gods are typically worshiped in home shrines and community altars in villages or city neighborhoods. They are also often depicted in life-size sculptures, performing ordinary tasks - Senoen cradles a child in a roadside shelter; Eferet presides over court in county halls; Sahrir grieves beside a war memorial.
* In Sovdu, it is proper to greet wild animals respectfully, and then to thank them. All beings deserve a proper greeting, of course, but thanks is required because you never know when a wild animal is one of *An stealan*, the Beloved, the first people, secretly watching over you. 
* Peoples of the Qar desert believe the land of the dead to lies to the north, on the polar continent. The spirits of the dead, though disembodied, must make the physical journey overland to attain their final rest. Mourners often make pilgrimage along the route, to keep their dead company and to ensure that they themselves will know the way when their own spirits have to make the journey.
* Eastern Iuliat is a collection of storm wracked islands on the edge of the vast ocean. The storms of the War Season each year are given names, and the names are always the same - Bani, Aco, Eces, Silig... These are the sea gods reenacting their ancient rebellion against their father, the land; wave after wave of their assault. The people tell time by the events of each storm, each year. "We were married at home because that was the year Falo destroyed the temple." "You were born just after Eces came, in the year Bani was so late. That's why you're so much bigger than your brother. We got a second harvest that year."  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Menem's two great industrial superpowers - the Crown of Agata and the Uajiren Empire - fought a series of destructive wars during the 14th century YC, which ended in the dissolution of both powers.  
  
The Crown of Agata ruled much of the continent of Ijeida for nearly two thousand years, but even as the Intercontinental Wars began, it was losing its power of many regions. The Crown rose to dominance through trade and influence rather than conquest, based on a policy that "open borders soon fade." Over time, many regions acceded to a kind of protectorate status under the Crown, while others were outright annexed into Agata territory. As tensions between the superpowers heated up, Agata's many long-held friendships were strained by revolutionary waves. Republicans, regional nationalists, anarchists, socialists, and more butted heads with the Crown and each other. By the end Baliren, Tasur, Mbueti, Eqre, Gavore, and many of Grianna's city states had declared independence, reducing Agata to its ancient core territory on the shores of the Sunken Sea. After the wars, the the last Queen abdicated and Agata was reformed as a republic. Most folk today believe the Crown was a good thing that ran its course, and are pleased with the proliferation of post-crown states. These maintain - mostly - strong relationships, rooted in centuries or millennia of exchange under the Crown.    
  
The Uajiren Empire was much younger at the time of the wars, founded merely two centuries before when Katlis II of Mfenisa deposed the High King of Terit and declared himself Emperor. Katlis IV later undertook a project of rapid industrialization and, due to imperial lands being poor in fuel resources, seized lands in Ijeida - especially in the south, around Grianna - to power his vision. This, at least partly, among a number of factors, precipitated the long war with Agata. The final two Emperors, Nfaro III and Katlis VII, grew increasingly obsessed with winning the war and paranoid about the security of their state. For his part, Nfaro bankrupted the empire building ever more advanced weapons; while Katlis VII disbanded the army and imperial guard, in favor of the arms manufacturer TeuNau and its private security force. When he next attempted to purge 'untrustworthy' generals, many resisted and formed the Army of Free Jirenes, forcing the Empire to withdraw troops from the war with Agata to fight a civil war. When the Free Army seized the capital, the generals called on neutral powers Sovdu and Qareya to support their building a transitional government. The constitutional congress that followed established a new democratic state comprising most of the Empire's vast territory, minus Iuliat.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Most of Banbha's giants have been stripped of their (considerable) powers and imprisoned as disembodied spirits, so they don't exactly have a size presently. They are also shape shifters, so a giant at liberty might assume any size or shape that suits his present needs - from a speck to, it is argued, the size of the entire universe. In their 'natural' form -  how they existed for most of the time before the great cataclysm that saw them expelled from Heaven - they are human-shaped and around 30 feet tall.

<TEXT> In Miksala, a God's domain(s) may be acquired by another being, either by the God in question granting the power willingly, or by the death of said God. Any and all domains of a dead God will be transferred to their slayer, along with various other features of divinity - nigh-invulnerability, agelessness, semi-immortality, etc.  
  
For you (presumably a mortal human) to perform this feat, it would take a great deal of effort. The Gods guard their powers jealously, and most remove themselves from the mortal world and are surrounded by servants and guards. You will have to sneak in or raise an unspeakably vast army.  
  
In the very unlikely event that you succeed in killing the God in question, you will be in ample company however, as all the present Gods ascended to their positions through various accidents and murders. Most often, this has happened by one God killing another for their particular domain - usually in the form of the violent Great Cataclysms that have shaken up the entire pantheon. But mortals have been known to ascend as well - as when Xeswa the Mad Sprite killed Tenhar the Magnanimous in a fireworks mishap and obtained the domain of Death. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  The works of the roots of the vines, of the trees, must be destroyed to keep up the price, and this is the saddest, bitterest thing of all. Carloads of oranges dumped on the ground. The people came for miles to take the fruit, but this could not be. How would they buy oranges at twenty cents a dozen if they could drive out and pick them up? And men with hoses squirt kerosene on the oranges, and they are angry at the crime, angry at the people who have come to take the fruit. A million people hungry, needing the fruit- and kerosene sprayed over the golden mountains. And the smell of rot fills the country. Burn coffee for fuel in the ships. Burn corn to keep warm, it makes a hot fire. Dump potatoes in the rivers and place guards along the banks to keep the hungry people from fishing them out. Slaughter the pigs and bury them, and let the putrescence drip down into the earth.

 **There is a crime here that goes beyond denunciation. There is a sorrow here that weeping cannot symbolize. There is a failure here that topples all our success.** The fertile earth, the straight tree rows, the sturdy trunks, and the ripe fruit. And children dying of pellagra must die because a profit cannot be taken from an orange. And coroners must fill in the certificate- died of malnutrition- because the food must rot, must be forced to rot. The people come with nets to fish for potatoes in the river, and the guards hold them back; they come in rattling cars to get the dumped oranges, but the kerosene is sprayed. And they stand still and watch the potatoes float by, listen to the screaming pigs being killed in a ditch and covered with quick-lime, watch the mountains of oranges slop down to a putrefying ooze; and in the eyes of the people there is the failure; and in the eyes of the hungry there is a growing wrath. In the souls of the people the grapes of wrath are filling and growing heavy, growing heavy for the vintage.

<TEXT> I've definitely become disillusioned with the Olympics in recent years, but I'm still enamored of the ideal. Somewhere inside the continual debacle, there's a kernel of optimism, a vision for a peaceful, cooperative world that celebrates skill and builds community. But it's obviously become the athletic-industrial complex and mass media cluster-of-fun that we know and cringe at today. Of course, none of that is new.   
   
Can it be saved, or is it too tainted by capitalism and imperialism? It seems there's a version of the Olympics where the international community invests in developing a nation's infrastructure, instead of just coming for the party and leaving the host with the bill - can that be realized? </TEXT>

<TEXT> High Pass Quarry is probably the most famous of prison camps built during the TeuNau occupation of Baliren and Agata following the First Agata-Jirenes War. Though among the shortest-lived of these camps, it gained a reputation for brutality, and served as the site of the first large-scale battle of the Ijeida Rebellion.  
  
The quarry housed high ranking leaders of the revolutionary Republican Works Commission, who had attempted to the hold the quarry against occupation forces. When TeuNau seized it, they turned the workers to constructing walls and cells for themselves, under grueling conditions. Over several months the prisoners staged a revolt and succeeded in ejecting many of the guards, but found themselves besieged by TeuNau reinforcements outside the wall. Baliran Marshals broke the siege, taking advantage of the occupation's unsure position toward them at the start of the Rebellion. Following its liberation, High Pass became an important headquarters for the Rebellion.  
  
High Pass and its liberation became Baliren's analog to the Bastille, and the date of its liberation became a national holiday.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lawns confound and infuriate me.  
  
When I was a kid (in suburban Ohio in the '80s and '90s) our neighborhood used to spray everybody's lawn with TruGreen, or something like that. You could opt out, but it was an absolute nuisance and they often went ahead and sprayed the opt-out lawns anyway. It smelled, it stained, and you couldn't go on the grass for a day or two afterward - perfect for a neighborhood full of kids and pets! They said it was for the clover, but it didn't even kill the clover; it just dyed the flowers green. But it probably did kill the dog. And wtf for? That sweet, sweet, useless monoculture.   
  
They haven't done it for at least ten years, and it turns out you actually can see the difference. It's so much more beautiful without that crap! My folks' yard is full of dandelions and violets, rabbits and bees, and the various grasses are actually healthy plants, instead of having to dump fertilizer after the herbicide to keep it alive.  </TEXT>

This, however, is the product of the systematic misconstruing of a challenge to capitalist ideology, which has sought to delegitimize the left and decimate the communist movement. </TEXT>

* The Agata-Jirenes Wars, which ended with the dissolution of both superpowers and the complete rearrangement of Menem's geopolitics.
* Menem receives a signal from Earth and responds; Earth receives Menem's response. These events shook up both worlds and eventually led to Earth building ships to visit our neighbors, and ultimately to a twelve-planet Union after finding yet more humans out there.
* Contact with the Maaum and Wouwa, and introduction to the other species of the Galactic Peace Organization. This was actually less of a turning point than you'd think, as most of the GPO don't want to have much to do with humans.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Someone from Agata will likely tell you its Etaretare ("Gods Unnumbered"), their traditional faith. Followers adopt the worship of neighboring peoples' gods, and regard everyone (except the infidel Dialogists) as "actually" practicing Etaretare. However, this is mostly a political claim about how many people are within the Crown's sphere of influence. For the sake of argument, the population of the Crown and its associated states is about one third of the world population at its height. But self-identified followers of Etaretare represent about one tenth of the population.     
  
Dialogists and outside observers will say it is Dialogism because the greatest number of people would identify as practitioners of that religion. They comprise about one quarter of the population.  </TEXT>

That's actually how humans got to Menem in the first place, except that happened 10,000 years ago. The planet's mostly Earth-like (rougher winters and more deserts, but not too bad) so those first people survived just fine, and you probably would too. Your main hurdle would be finding a way to fit in. You said it's my choice, so I'll put you in Qareya, where you'll most likely be treated a curiosity and then welcomed into the local community where you 'land' - perhaps spending your life regarded as a celebrity.

<TEXT> I'm building Menem at a number of time periods, and have focused each on a primary set of protagonists and their lives. The action focuses on:

* The events of the 1st Agata-Jirenes War, and the immediate post-war [industrial revolution-ish]
* The arrival of the third delegation from Earth to Menem, and the events leading up to forming a Federation-analog [pre space opera]
* Operations crew of a deep space station designing and building a starship by hand; also other hijinks. [not quite fully-automated luxury space communism]
  
Each one has helped me focus on both the geo(spacio)-politics as well as what ordinary lives are like in these different periods. So the key players are mostly people and nation-states, or post-national collectives of various descriptions.

<TEXT> I previously shared [this standard calendar](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/644xj3/share_your_worlds_unique_time_system_if_it_has_one/dfzlzp8/) of Menem for a similar question, so let's jump ahead to the post-planetary Union and its systems.  
  
Because humans originated on Earth and settled on various roughly Earth-like planets, the familiar concepts of days, months, and years were retained when the Union established a standardized decimal time-keeping system. The system used the average human lifespan at the time (~120 Earth-years) as its basis, and set this at 100 years. From there you have 10 months per year, 10 days per month, 10 shifts per day, 10 hours per shift, 100 minutes per hour, and 100 seconds per minute. 'Week' was left out, after much debate. Some felt keeping the week made the day too short, others thought eliminating it made the day too long. The shift was introduced as a compromise, and proved useful for scheduling people's activity. The resulting hours, minutes, and seconds all work out to roughly their Earth equivalents (unless my back-of-envelope math is way off...).  
  
The relevant SI units (e.g light year) were all adjusted to derive from these time units.  
  
Folks living planet-side still follow local solar time, because it's a nightmare otherwise, but folks traveling or working in deep space use the standardized system. A typical station resident follows this schedule (or similar):  
1st shift: work  
2nd shift: recreate  
3rd shift: rest   
4th-9th shift, repeat above)  
10th shift: rest   
Repeat for 9 days, with the 10th day off.  
Repeat for 9 months, with the 10th month off.  
Repeat for 9 years, with the 10th year off.  
Repeat until 90 years old.  
Retire.

<TEXT> Around the galaxy and over time, there's quite a bit of variation. At the time of contact between Earth and Menem, neither planet has achieved FTL. Their first communication signals are delayed 15 years and the first ships take nearly 50 years to travel between them (so, really damn fast actually, but not so convenient). Elsewhere at the same time however, Renii, had colonized four other systems and maintained regular FTL shipping and travel among them, monopolized by the planetary church-state. The Galactic Peace Organization, a (not entirely aptly named) coalition of alien species occupied one-third of the Milk Way. Most citizens are familiar with the construction of "simple" star drives and home-built ships are commonplace, so they definitely fall in the every man and his dog category (or every Maaum and his wouwa, as the case may be).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pretty much the grossest you're imagining. The Watchtower was one of the most active military bases under the authority of the Crown of Agata, home to a few thousand troops and support staff, with well plumbed facilities all draining to the Pits.  
  
The reasoning was this: As physically detestable as was such a fate, it was spiritually far worse. As a maritime power, with a Sea Goddess as its chief deity, to drown at sea, in glory, in service to the Crown was the greatest honor. But to betray the Crown, and so to be drowned "in filth in the heart of the mountains" as one account put it, was a terrible perversion. It was to be denied Heaven. In the words of the traditional jailer's 'blessing' to the condemned, "Pray as fervently as ever, and perhaps something will grant you mercy hereafter. But I promise you this, though there be Gods Unnumbered, the Lords of heaps and middens do not love you near so well as did the Sea and all Her Sisters you have betrayed."  </TEXT>

In so doing, they created a highly organized and disciplined resistance which, though vastly outnumbered, and despite ruthless imprisonment and attempted purges, recaptured their home in the celebrated Ijeida Rebellion. In fact, the Rebellion so weakened the resolve of the defeated Empire that their success is credited with precipitating the Jirenes Civil War which brought the demise of the empire.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dore Menem Fiddha do Lyria was the last queen of Agata, also regarded as a founding mother of the modern republics of both Agata and neighboring Baliren. As she was her mother's second daughter, Fiddha was not expected to inherit the Crown and instead was reared for a career of diplomacy. She eschewed this role however, and became a noted military leader. In the War of the Pretenders, during the Battle of Balirhearth, she led a band of outnumbered Baliran Marshalls and Agatter sailors bereft of their ships, to successfully repel an attempt to seize the city by Baliran separatists. This victory, as a symbol of Agata's successful campaign in that war, is credited with cementing the solidarity between the two nations which led to their close cooperation in the 1st Agata-Jirenes War to follow.  
  
In that war, Fiddha commanded a submarine squadron in several naval victories in the protracted Battle of the Encircled Sea. She was fighting one of these battles when Jirenes launched a surprise attack against the capital, Parovir, killing her mother and sister - and placing the Crown of Agata on her head. She returned to the capital for coronation in the last days of the war, and presided over treaty negotiations to end the conflict.  
  
When Jirenes later breached the treaty and occupied Parovir, she was kept in house arrest within the palace for ten years, until she and a band of loyalist Marshals executed the Queen's Rebellion, striking a blow against occupation forces and successfully escaping the city with her daughter, her heir. Her daughter was taken into hiding in neutral Sovdu, while Fiddha joined the rebel movement in occupied Baliren, eventually joining those who held the besieged city of Ethenfarr.  
  
At Ethenfarr, Fiddha was among the signatories of the Worksite Oath, whose opening Declaration of the First Principles of the Republic is regarded as the founding document of modern democracy, and included a clause abdicating her throne at the end of the war. She was killed in the final Jirenes assault on the city, which rebels successfully repelled. Her daughter returned to Parovir three months later when that city was liberated, but honored her mother's declaration, never receiving the crown, and declaring the First Republic of Agata on the day of the signing of the Treaty of Qareya putting an end to war with Jirenes.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The 1st Agata-Jirenes War (and therefore the 2nd, which kicked off over the unsatisfactory conclusions of the 1st) was broadly caused by conflicting imperialist expansion of superpowers. Somewhat less broadly, it was caused by disputes over access to fossil fuels and mineral resources in Griana.  
  
The two superpowers had been engaged in "diplomatic hostilities" in the region for decades, each maintaining a number of client states among the various city states and small principalities. The flashpoint that escalated the conflict to open warfare was the Platform 89 Incident. The oil platform, constructed by TeuNau (Jirenes's East India Company analog) in disputed waters, was raided by military police from the Principality of Eqre, a tributary to Agata, claiming it violated their access to shipping lanes. While the Crown alleged miscommunication, several Agatter warships surrounded the platform and fired on a TeuNau freighter. Though all parties then stood down, Jirenes began escorting all TeuNau supply ships with Imperial Navy vessels. Taking this as an escalated threat, Agata began blockading TeuNau and Imperial traffic, leading to the Battle of the Encircled Sea and the rest of the war afterwards. </TEXT>

<TEXT> More often than not, people of Menem use natural phenomena rather than built structures to defend their settlements. 

* **Baliren** Folks here build earthen ramparts well outside of their cities and settlements, relying on them to slow approaching enemies and to provide local troops space to engage invaders. They also benefit from region's extremely rocky soil, making it easy to erect obstacular walls wherever necessary to halt an enemy's advance.
* **Agata** This region relies on the sea for its defenses, building cities in defensible harbors or atop high sea cliffs with inhospitable terrain at their backs. 
* **Qareya** Cities here are built inside canyons, typically near the deltas of the rivers responsible for said canyons, and are surrounded by hostile desert environment. The surrounding deserts are difficult to cross, and it is difficult to descend into the canyons to strike at the settlements.

<TEXT> **Shepherds** is a game that originated in Baliren, and became popular around the world. Observers from Earth have called it "Baliran chess" because of its checkered gameboard and multiple pieces which start in a prescribed formation, but gameplay is something more like Go meets Stratego. The premise is that each player (of two) represents a shepherd trying to claim the largest contiguous area of pasture (the board), while also keeping track of their sheep, and possibly capturing sheep from their opponent. Players take turns placing Stones to build walls (this is the part that resembles Go), and moving their Shepherd and Dog pieces. Sheep pieces move randomly (with a die roll) but are constrained in various ways by the Walls, Shepherds, and Dogs - e.g. a Sheep cannot cross a Wall; a Sheep in a square adjacent to a Dog will not move, but on the Dog's turn the player can force the Sheep in a chosen direction. Play ends when one player either has all their Sheep enclosed by walls, or runs out of Stone pieces and cannot build any more walls. Win conditions are complicated, but the ideal goal is a) to control the largest contiguous walled-off area of the board and b) to have more sheep in that area than anywhere else.  
  
Fun facts! The oldest known Shepherds board is a National Monument of Baliren, and is etched on the surface of a large, flat-topped boulder overlooking the Stony Sea. The largest Shepherds board ever constructed is in the gardens of the royal palace of Parovir. The squares are made of different shades of marble, and players controlled living game pieces (i.e. servants) from overlooking balconies.

<TEXT> The dominant religion of Agata, spread by its trade empire to the entire continent of Ijeida, is Etaretare ("the Gods Unnumbered"). In its native Agata, the faith arose around the belief that there are infinitely many Gods, and the Gods inhabit all things - both physical and abstract. So there is a God of war and a Goddess of the sea, but also a God of each grain of sand, a God of the argument you had with your spouse last week, a God of 7:58 PM EDT on April 27th, 2017. In practice, this is a panentheist worldview, that the divine pervades all of existence, but remains distinct from the mundane reality it inhabits. The Unnumbered are worshiped in the collective, but there is also a dominant pantheon of major deities - the chief of which is *Ces Mera* the All-Mother, also called *Dar Ricis Menem* She Who Guards the Seas and *Afan Menem* the Seas Themselves. These deities and the collective Unnumbered are worshiped both in grand temples and home shrines, along with house deities. The house God is usually the God of the hearth or its fire, but some areas favor other central features as the divine locus in the house - the door or threshold are common.   
  
An extension of the belief in the Unnumbered is an acceptance that the deities worshiped by other peoples are real and worthy of reverence, and are distinct from Agata's own deities. When traders and travelers from Agata began contacting other regions of Ijeida in ancient times, they carried this faith with them, and took up the worship of other peoples' Gods, even building temples to them back home. This tendency proved an enormous diplomatic boon to Agata, and helped grow the nations favor and influence across the continent.  
  
As to their form, the native Agatter deities are never depicted, nor are they conceived of as human. They are transcendent and formless. Many of the Gods borrowed from other traditions do have forms (human or otherwise), and the faithful tend to happily roll with it.  
  
The acceptance of the other peoples' faiths was challenged when Agata come into contact with folk from Tevra and Jirenes. The main religion in those regions is Dialogism, which in its dominant form has a pantheon of eight deities who comprise the entire universe. That is, there are eight and only eight. Agatters struggled to integrate this tradition into their own - unable to accept the Eight without the assertion that they must stand alone - so many came to reject Dialogism, even after centuries of adopting other peoples' religions.  </TEXT>

Sometimes Death is honorable and just, while sometimes it is in the hands of a psychopath dispatching mortals (or not) on a whim. The current God of Death is Xeswa the Mad Sprite, who ascended when he killed his predecessor, Tenhar the Magnanimous, in a practical joke gone horribly awry. Xeswa is not terribly interested in performing his duties, and will neglect to kill anyone for years at a time then instantaneously annihilate entire cities to make up his imagined quota, elsewhere leaving suffering people to go on suffering, unable to die. For her part, Tenhar had a long and celebrated reign as Death, known for her merciful and egalitarian application of doom. She was a particularly welcome relief from her own predecessor, Nipper the Plague Rat (actually a rat), whose brief but disastrous tenure nearly wiped out all mortal life and led to the 17th Great Upheaval. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here I will strongly endorse the use of naming conlangs. Rich, deep, thoroughly grammared, conlangs are a particular passion of mine, but doing all that work definitely gets in the way of trying to build more world. That's where a simplified conlang for naming purposes comes in handy. All you need is a basic sense of phonology (what sounds each language can use) and one or two pieces of grammar ("this one's verb-subject-object" or "genitives use the prefix *ro*"). Make one for each nation or region, and its names feel both distinctive and solidary.  
  
Edit: More rambling. Also, names generated this way can feel emergent, born of the world you're trying to build. At least, that's my experience. Menem had no name for several years as I started building it, but once I had established one culture as dominant, and had a few ideas about its language, "Menem" almost presented itself as the 'obvious' name of the world.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's about the long and short of it. Except, the Ice Kings were semi-mythical, ancient rulers of said far northern region (Baliren). Some four centuries before the war, Agata (to the south of Baliren) had built the grand Viaduct which connected the two regions and opened trade and migration between them, and ultimately brought Baliren under the authority of the Crown of Agata. The Ice Kings movement emerged as an ethnic nationalism, opposed to southern influence and seeking to reestablish the independent High Kingdom of Baliren (disregarding the fact that the High Kingdom has ceased to exist centuries before the Viaduct, its collapse having nothing to do with Agata). Supporters viewed it as a righteous assertion of northern rule - reflecting the legendary account of the Ice Kings' Marching Kingdom driving out southern invaders. Opponents thought them ridiculous - akin to someone claiming descent from Arthur raising an army to challenge the modern UK.  
  
The movement did raise a sizable army and occupied much of Baliren, but ultimately helped to ensure its own demise. The effort to repel the Pretender army in its march south helped establish a sense of Agata-Baliren solidarity, and a broader sense of continental identity which would help Ijeida (where Agata and Baliren reside) repel foreign occupation during the subsequent Intercontinental Wars.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The greatest mystery is how humans came to be living on multiple planets prior to developing space flight. It is clear that the species evolved on Earth, and is absent from the fossil record of Menem and Renii. The earliest archaeological evidence dates on either of the other worlds dates to around 10,000 with the foundation of settlements in the Sovdu region of northern Menem. It is believed human emergence on Renii occurred around the same time, but the church-state that dominates the planet is not forthcoming with their evidence. Many believe an unknown alien intelligence must have intervened, but as yet no direct evidence has been uncovered. This belief is supported by a) contact with the Wouwa, demonstrating that non-human intelligent species exist, and b) the Wouwa's own belief that an advanced civilization once colonized a neighboring planet in their home system.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sahac, the Guardian of the Front Door of Ifara do Essia's House, is honored in an annual festival drawing many thousand worshipers from the surrounding area.    
  
The primary faith of the nation of Agata is *Etaretare* "Gods Unnumbered", which in the strong form professes that there is a God of everything - from the smallest mote of dust or droplet of water on up to the universe itself, every thing is watched over by an individual God. The smallest God typically worshiped outside of the collective reverence for the Unnumbered is the Guardian of an individual home, which is usually embodied by the hearth or more specifically its fire. In certain regions the Gods of other elements of the house - such as the door - are given primacy. And sometimes, usually because of miracles or deeds attributed to them, such Gods develop a cult outside of the specific home or location where they were initially honored.  
  
In this case, a terrible plague ravaged the city of Ecaya, and Ifara do Essia's house was the only one in which no household member contracted the disease. The Door Guardian was credited with saving the household, and in order to protect the whole city, the door was incorporated into the city's gate. Some years later another plague ravaged the area and, lo, the whole city was spared. Thereafter many people gathered at the gate of Ecaya to implore Sahac to inspire greatness in the Guardians of their own homes and cities, and over time the gathering became a great festival.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Most of latter-day Menem is governed by parliamentary republics of various shapes, there being a widespread political distaste for powerful executives.     
  
Qareya takes the rejection of an executive to the extreme, with most government devolved to local councils and trade unions, with most actions of the national parliament requiring ratification in referendum. All of these governing bodies have a rotating chairperson position, which is given no special authority or influence apart from ensuring parliamentary procedure is followed.  
  
Agata was traditionally ruled by a dynastic triumvirate, modeled on the three persons of the triple goddess of the sea - Maiden, Mother, Crone. In its ideal form, these were three generations of mothers and daughters - but in practice, inheritance is rarely so clean. The membership of the *Odore Menem* "Sisters of the Sea" changed when the Maiden's own heir reached majority at the age of 10 (or roughly 17, given Menem's long year), ascending to the Crowns while the Crone retired.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Humanity's *first* first encounter with aliens went completely unnoticed by both parties, but still had profound affects. About 10,000 years ago, an unknown advanced alien civilization's experimental FTL propulsion system malfunctioned catastrophically in the vicinity of our solar system. The resulting series of anomalies transported a population of humans from Earth to the planets Menem and Renii, and probably a number of other places where they couldn't survive.   
  
Contact was established between Earth and Menem at the end of the 22nd century CE, when scientists of Menem responded to a signal Earth had been broadcasting to nearby solar systems for several decades. It was another several decades before we managed to send a ship.  
  
First contact with non-human aliens occurred in the mid 24th century when two Union of Human Worlds ships encountered a Wouwa deep space research vessel. The Wouwa were themselves members of a six-species coalition and eagerly introduced humans to their fellows. The coalition was significantly more advanced than humanity, and the others tended to look down on the humans, uninterested either in helping them advance or in anything they might contribute. The Wouwa remained open with humans, however, and the two species developed a close relationship. Humans initially imagined being able to joint this coalition, but the disinterest of the other members relegated them to a role as "the Wouwa's adopted strays" in the eyes of galactic society.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I used to work in a shoe store. Trying to resist people gendering children's shoes was a nightmare. The products made it hard - because there would always be two similar shoes, one with Transformers and one with Ponies, or whatever. People would always say shit to their toddlers like "no honey, that's a girl's shoe." But they did it with just basic shoes, too. We had some standard Adidas sneakers, that came in white with either blue or red stripes. Fairly frequently, parents would come up and ask me which was "the girl's shoe". I always told them all children's shoes are sized the same. "Yes, but which one's meant for girls?" Or they would just freak out and refuse to let their son pick the red ones. </TEXT>

Like, Gashifa had a named continent I had not developed at all, and Menem was a complete continent without a broader world. Menem was gearing up for a great war, and needed an overseas adversary; and Gashifa had a great war in its past which I had left undeveloped. Once merged, they helped answer a lot of open questions about each other, and the distinctive parts came together to make something that felt like a more diverse, realistic world.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> One of Menem's largest religions, Dialogism, has a central tenet that the world is composed of the balance of opposing forces. Specifically, the world exists as the process of those forces seeking balance. At any one moment, one may be dominant, but they are in balance over time. This is presented as a negotiation between the gods responsible for either side - the Dialog. The various sects of the faith interpret the Dialog in many different ways, specifically regarding the number of Dialogs. One dominant version says there is only one, between the powers of creation and destruction, and the world is made and unmade as these two seek balance. The other dominant view takes there to be many Dialogs, each governing some aspect of the world, with different sects arguing for between two and and infinitely many.  
  
The most widely followed version posits four Dialogs, and Eight Most High Divines responsible for governing them. Each pair is intimately connected and always expressed together. These are Life-and-Death (or Creation-and-Destruction), Earth-and-Sea (or Motion-and-Stillness), Before-and-After, and Inward-and-Outward.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Mfenit dynasty rose to power when Katlisa I seized the High Kingship of Terit and declared himself the Emperor of Jirenes. In an event called the Silence of the Princes, Katlisa gathered with the rulers of his rival principalities for their regular Council, and had his guards murder them at supper. He waited for their courts to send riders inquiring as to their delay in returning home before making his declaration - hence the Silence. He had first attempted to consolidate the powers granted the High King, knowing he would ascend to that role, but grew frustrated with diplomacy and chose the sword.   
  
Katlisa's empire was fittingly ended in a coup as well. Some 200 years later, with the state impoverished by the grueling Agata-Jirenes Wars, a paranoid Emperor Reuhen III attempted a purge of his disaffected generals and they turned against him. TeuNau, the Empire's foreign trade corporation and the Emperor's private army, remained loyal and resisted, but with Reuhen's young heir captured while abroad, and an increasingly war-weary citizenry, the company garnered little popular support. Backed by an international coalition, the rebel generals quickly overwhelmed their opposition and declared the Empire dead.

<TEXT> I tend to worldbuild in long histories, so I haven't sorted the specs of any particular vessel, but there are plenty of names and accomplishments.  
  
In each age, the flagship (and its class) of Agata's mighty navy has been called *Fira Menem* or *Seas' Brother*. The name has been applied to everything from ancient triremes right up to starships, including one submarine and, in peacetime, a number of merchant vessels. Its latest iteration is an FTL transport making the regular Earth-Menem-Renii circuit. Some have criticized giving such an illustrious name for a "glorified ferry", but most see it as a triumph of technology and interstellar diplomacy, worthy of the title. It's Earth-built counterpart is named *Enterprise*, because I can't help myself.  
  
Other great ships of Menem-Earth history include:  
  
*Ambassador*, Earth's last and largest NAFAL ship, which carried the members of the Third Envoy to Menem and served as an orbital research station during the early contact period, as well as a refuge for its Earth-born crew when the Broken Union War erupted planetside. Later still it served as the cornerstone of a colony on Menem's largest moon Ekna.   
  
*Cashati Taloen* or *Cashat Valley*, the experimental craft that first achieved FTL and shortened the travel time between Menem and Earth from decades to days.  
  
*Four White Horses*, the first civilian-built FTL craft which ushered in a new age of exploration.  
  
*Rick Husband* and *Kalpana Chawla*, Columbia-class explorer ships that made first contact with the Wouwa, humanity's first alien encounter.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Indeed not. Planes were a relatively new technology, and long-range bombers completely unheard of, a closely guarded secret of Jirenes. Agata (of which Parovir is the capital) relied on its naval power to overwhelm Jirenes at sea before they could make landfall - mistakenly believing that Jirenes needed to control territory nearer to the capital to launch their planes. The city had anti-aircraft guns, but was overwhelmed.  
  
The last words are considered apocryphal, as there is no evidence the Admiral actually spoke them, and if he had, it's very likely his actual last words were a string of expletives. Nevertheless the quotation does reflect his attitude at the time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Across most of Menem, you'll be best served by a horse, but there are a few other options. If you only have a short distance to travel, are noble or otherwise very wealthy, and are willing to travel with a trainer, you might be interested in one of Agata's trained dolphin mounts. They don't respond well to most riders, don't like traveling long distances, refuse to bear any load apart from a rider, and have a tendency to dive unexpectedly, but they have the benefit of being exceedingly fashionable. In Sovdu, you could opt for an ynisim. These are like Earth's extinct [chalicothere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalicothere), and are primarily beasts of burden but provide sturdy mounts if you aren't in a hurry.  </TEXT>

"These lands" is a traditional way of referring to the regions of Baliren, Agata, and Griana, on the continent of Ijeida, which enjoyed a long history of peace and cooperation. Following the First Agata-Jirenes War, however, foreign occupation, along with a surge in regional nationalisms, frequently pitted communities against one another and led to a period of civil conflict. In a famous speech, "poet laureate of the rebellion" Praven Terelson referenced this traditional phrase when he said that no part of Ijeida could have peace "'til These Divided Lands are one again."  </TEXT>

Menem's solar year consists of 504 29-hour days (that's Earth hours; local reckoning counts 21), but the cycles of the planet's three moons have dominated timekeeping and calendars in most cultures. The moons have cycles of 18, 24, and 56 days, and due to their close resonance, always align exactly once per year at the same time, a date nearly universally regarded as the start of the new year^1. The dominant modern civic calendar (originating in Agata) uses the moon Ael's 24-day cycle to define its months, of which there are 21, and which are divided into 6-day weeks. Iava's 18-day cycle is also an important marker, frequently used for regular events that might be called "first friday" or the like on Earth.

Ancient folk of the region took a wild grass found in oases and bred a number of cultivars from it, selecting for grain size, fibrous roots and stalks, and even broad shade for shade. It is raised hydroponically in "fish gardens" with water from seasonal flooding stored in cisterns.  </TEXT>

Thousands of games and 'novels' offer immersive worlds for users to inhabit and explore, from inside a stasis chamber. The popularity of this form of entertainment has raised concerns over people spending long periods in stasis 'unnecessarily'. Inexpensive stasis chambers have hit the home entertainment market, and have been identified as the cause of several dozen deaths.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> All beings once dwelt together in the same heavenly realm - humans, faeries and giants, with the Gods ruling over them. The faeries (or *na liath* "the grey") were skilled craftspersons, and made many wondrous artifacts and weapons for the Gods. But they craved more power, and pressed the giants into an army to rebel against the Gods and steal the magic of creation. None too pleased by this turn of events, the Gods split the world into separate realms and banished all other beings from heaven. To the humans they gave the mortal realm, its bounty as well as its hardships. The giants they sent to a bitter, frozen land "beyond the seas." The faeries they sentenced to a barren, lightless, waste "beneath the Earth". But they retained their cunning and they devised a method to shape their prison - a craft called Artifice. Through it, they built grand palaces and lush landscapes - and were able to reach into the mortal world to trick humans into serving them. They have not yet reached the realm of the Gods, but they keep trying.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Stop policing other people's sexuality.  
  
Looking at a straight-identified man who has sex with men and saying, "Nah, dude, you're bi," doesn't get us anywhere in combating erasure and biphobia. It puts that man on the defensive and makes it less likely for him to consider a non-normative identity. It does nothing to challenge the notions of masculinity that lead that man to embracing an identity that *we* read as being challenged by his behavior. It gives ground to the biphobic narrative that identity has to match behavior. If that straight man has sex with a man and I have to call him bi now; do I have to relinquish my bi identity because it's been a couple years since I had sex with a man? What's the statute of limitations on that?  
   
Dismantle patriarchy and toxic masculinity, but don't attack these men who are also subject to them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When is it acceptable to use a name that already exists?

Pretty much whenever, in my opinion. I got hung up on trying to always have unique names, but its just impossible. Take a look at the real world. We use names over and over again all the time. There's so many dudes named Steve or Jack - even in fiction, where it seems there'd be an effort to distinguish characters. Practically any given city or town on Earth seems to share its name with some other town someplace. Unless you want outrageously long names like Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwyllllantysiliogogogoch or you don't mind that all your characters sound like pharmaceuticals, I think your effort is better spent on making distinctive characters and places. Names from other works of fiction are probably best avoided; you can't get away with calling a dude Darth Vader of Hogwarts. But if it turns out that one of your heroes' names means "fart face" in Hungarian, hang onto that for later giggles, but move on. You can change it later if you ever translate it into Hungarian. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Qareya is a vast desert on a high, dry plateau. It is flanked by ocean along its long south coast, and backed by high mountains to the north. The plateau is scored by canyons, ravaged by brief, intense, seasonal flooding. For millennia, only Qarisa thrived there - an ancient city built on complex systems of flood control and hydroculture, which allow the desert canyon to bloom and produce harvests year round. Though the desert is dotted with other small settlements, Qarisa always held controlled the region, as its kings grew wealthy and powerful thanks to their regular surplus of food.  
  
Early in the modern period, a rebellion in Qarisa deposed the kings and established a communal government, by which residents jointly ran the the city and operated its vital infrastructure. This society developed a new ethic, not of hoarding their city's riches, but sharing the knowledge of the systems that give it its power. Within a century, Qarisa sponsored the foundation of thirty new cities - a grand project called the Green Revolution or the Flowering of the Desert. These cities operated autonomously for some time, but in the face of growing pressures from the imperial powers of Agata and Jirenes, joined together in a regional coalition - the Union of Green Cities, which has become a wealthy and influential player on the modern world stage. Many fledgling states in regions long under imperial control have looked to the Union for inspiration in founding their new governments. In turn, alliances among these communal states will make them a significant political bloc in a few years time when the intergovernmental Gishefa ("Union") is founded.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Following the Agata-Jirenes Wars, the Uajiren Empire was reduced to a shadow of its former power. It had lost vital resource-rich territories in Ijeida - whose control had been one of the major flashpoints of the wars. Public tolerance for the increasingly paranoid Mfenit regime bottomed out when the Emperor attempted to purge disaffected and dissident members of the returning armed forces. A portion of the army split off to form the rebel Free Army of Jirenes to oppose the regime, aided by popular revolt, and ultimately by considerable international support from Agata and its former territories. The resulting Jirenes Civil War is widely considered an extension of the Agata-Jirenes Wars.  
  
When the imperial government was toppled, an international oversight commission was established, headed by Sovdu and Qareya - parties that remained neutral in the Wars. The transitional government began with a set of regional councils appointed by the commission, which oversaw reconstruction of vital infrastructure and the distribution of essential goods. That phase lasted five years, followed by a second phase, where a general election was held to establish a constitutional congress. The congress is in its second year, debating the equitable subdivision of former imperial territories into new states under a central executive committee (the current most popular proposal). At the outset, the Transitional Government was projected to last ten years, after which it would be dissolved in favor of multiple autonomous states. It is on track to meet that goal, but there is a lot of work yet to be done.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Republic consists of what remains of the long-standing Crown of Agata which once ruled much of the continent of Ijeida, including the modern nations of Baliren, Tasul, Mbueti, and much of present United Griana. Following the second Agata-Jirenes War the revolutionary wave called the Ijeida Rebellion rejected Crown rule in many territories and deposed the monarchy within Agata itself. Much reduced in size, Agata today remains a wealthy and powerful nation, owing to its historical dominance of the Sunken Sea, which it still commands in large part. It also remains a close ally of former vassals in Baliren and Griana, but tensions are high with other post-Crown territories, which have allied themselves more closely with Sovdu and Qareya, powers which remained neutral during the Wars. Agata is undergoing a rapid industrializing effort, because many of its ancient cities - which now form the core of its territory and population - were slow to modernize before the Wars, in a time when the Crown could rely on wealth and resources from its dependencies.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Edolhrem is the great ancient hero of Baliren, in whose name a dozen nationalist movements have risen - each interpreting and exploiting his deeds and legends to their particular ends. He is a frequent figure in adventures and romances alike.  
  
In legend - especially as filtered through latter-day geopolitics - Edolhrem was the Great Liberator, the Spear-King, and first High King of Baliren. When a villainous invader from the south (along with monsters, possibly) threatened his lands, he built an army to drive them out, and united the lands under his beneficent rule. Depending on the version, his army is said to have consisted of "each man of the north, to the newest stripling" as well as "giants of frost and stone, broken free of the Great Ice [a glacier] itself." 
  
Turning to the scant historical record, evidence suggests Edolhrem was himself a minor king ruling an area of east-central Baliren around the year 1000 BYC [where YC is roughly "the modern era"]. His famed seat at Dekaar was in fact constructed and abandoned generations before his reign. As to the southern invader, it is likely that a series of such events contributed to the consolidation of power under the High Kings, but this unfolded over several centuries; there was no single Liberator or Uniter, no grand army. Edolhrem participated in one such campaign, and may even have been a particularly effective commander, but there is no evidence he ever sat as High King himself.   
  
The earliest folkloric account tells of Edolhrem raising an army from among his lands and joining with others to fight an invader, and also specifically mentions that he retired to his own kingdom afterward and live out his rule in peace. It attributes great deeds of heroism to him as one of several vanguards, but never singles him out as the greatest. In a poem dating to the time of Tithen I, the second High King, Edolhrem is hailed as "one who gathered the peoples of Baliren under the strength of his banners." Over time he has been conflated with a number of similar minor kings, forming a kind of super-king credited with all of their deeds. Later, he is used a nationalist hero by various movements seeking to expel foreigners and/or restore the High Kingship.    
  
**tl;dr:** King Edolhrem is sort of Beowulf + Arthur, I guess.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not hard. There are two plants (well, a plant and an algae) that I invented for specific areas, but otherwise I haven't much dealt with plants. They haven't been essential to the things I'm interested in developing, so they fall to the background. I did start out with a few thoughts, but they always went along these lines: "this is a kwijibo flower, which is a bit like a daffodil, only blue and..." So I gave up on that.  
  
I still operate on a vague assumption that the world does have distinctive flora and fauna and I'm only naming them "in translation." Maybe I say "oak tree" and imagine it means "thing on Menem for which an oak tree is a reasonable facsimile, for immediate narrative purposes." But I still just say "oak tree."

<TEXT> Agata has been sitting at the bar all night with a bunch of her friends. As it gets more crowded, Jirenes and Qareya can't even get up to the bar to order drinks. Griana, the bartender, tries to hand drinks out to them, but Agata keeps slapping them out of his hand, insisting that she will pass them back. Griana gives in, but Agata starts spilling or drinking some of each glass that passes her. Qareya has had enough and gets Sovdu, the bouncer, who insists that Agata and her friends move to one end of the bar and let the others have access. Tasur refuses to give up his seat and orders another drink from Griana, so Jirenes takes him into the alley, beats him up, and takes his wallet. When Jirenes comes back in, he takes Tasur's seat and drinks his beer. Agata appeals to the bouncer, but Sovdu says it serves him right for not complying. Things calm down for the rest of the night, with Agata and Jirenes keep asking Griana to convey insults to the other.  
  
The next night, Jirenes, Qareya, and some of their friends show up early to claim the bar. Sovdu lets them in, but says he's going to enforce the same rule as last night, and make sure Agata gets some of the bar. Agata's ex, Baliren, shows up and hangs around in the parking lot, waiting to confront her. He has several old drinking buddies with him, who never liked Agata, egging him on. Sovdu sends them home, but not before a lot of shouting and posturing ensue. Inside, Agata and Jirenes have been trying to convince other patrons, sitting at booths and tables, to support their right to sit at the bar. Griana quits because he's got enough trouble at home and doesn't need all this drama. Jirenes goes behind the bar and starts serving drinks to his friend. Sovdu tries to remove him, but management says Jirenes is a good customer and to leave him be. Since Jirenes is refusing to serve Agata, she joins him behind the bar, and starts serving her own friends. The two make all the other patrons join sides and will only serve someone who swears not to order from the other. By now, Baliren has ditched his friends and snuck in through the storeroom. He is alternately trying to convince Agata to take him back and yelling he never wants to see her again.  
  
The other patrons get fed up with Jirenes and Agata running the bar. When some of the taps run out on Jirenes's side, they start shoving each other, while the "bartenders" start wrestling over control of the active taps. Baliren leaves, but comes back an hour later bragging that he set fire to Jirenes's house. Jirenes leaves in a panic, but some of his close friends keep fighting over the bar for him. Sovdu tells some of the patrons who have stayed out of things that he bounces weeknights at this chill bar down the road, where there's not so much drama. They leave. Agata and Baliren are seated at the bar, drunk, laughing about the old times, when the paramedics arrive.

<TEXT> In Banbha, there are three sorts of magic (and a different group uses each), with different answers.  
  
Great Magic (Gods)

* The Gods cannot avoid magic; it suffuses their every action.
* Therefore they solve all their problems with it.  
* Balance of power among the Gods keeps any one from overstepping

Small Magic (Humans)

* Humans have few qualms about using what magic is granted to them by the Gods, knowing that it is significantly limited. 
* In fact, they use magic to aid most every household task. It's great for lighting stoves and clearing dust, but can't ever produce an exploding fireball.
* The Gods would smack down that evil wizard - *if* he somehow came up with more powerful magic; or they would wait for him to get himself killed.    
  
Artifice (Faeries and Giants)

* Artifice always has unforeseen consequences and is generally very dangerous. Most humans would avoid it; but faeries and giants don't care 
* The faeries both solve and create all their problems with Artifice 
* Basically every faerie thinks she/he is that powerful wizard and is two breakthrough's away from overthrowing the Gods themselves. What stops them is they're all crazy and their magic rarely actually works; and kills them when it does.   </TEXT>

And, oh boy, do they! The city is ancient, and has been the major play in the history and culture of the region (Eya). Its founders were once revered as semi-divine heroes, whose feats of engineering were considered holy. Maintaining them - and innovating them - in the name of the Builders was sacred duty. A communist revolution secularized the founders as Citizen-heroes, and leveraged popular reverence for them to create a modern sense of civic duty.   
  
In antiquity, the city's agricultural systems were unique, and jealously guarded secrets. Qarisa's kings raised great fortunes in the form of the city's food surpluses, and dominated all other settlements in Eya's vast desert - until they took their city for granted. When the last king ignored warnings that certain dams were failing - the result was the execution of that king, the abolition of the monarchy, and that communist revolution I mentioned. The eventual Republic colonized the desert with dozens of cities modeled on the ancient designs of Qarisa - and eventually helped colonize the stars, too, with starships and space stations housing hydroponic gardens refined over millennia.  </TEXT>

Magic is based on names; to know someone or something's name is to have power over them/it. For a mage to know the name of another mage is to wield incredible power. Within the influence of Grand Adhica, Court Mages undergo the Unnaming, a spell to strip themselves of all memory of their own names, so that other mages may not exercise power over them. A Unnamed mage's mind is closed and cannot be disturbed or abused by another mage. But not all magic users comply with the Edict of Unnaming.    
  
The Listeners are a secretive cabal initiated by former Court Mages who refused the Unnaming. Rather than protect each individual mind from outside influence, they have formed a hive-like joined consciousness. Their joining is so extreme that each individual surrenders their body to the control of the collective. Each body hosts all of them, and none of them, at the same time, so that outsiders cannot isolate one member from the others. If one Listener body is destroyed, that person has already given their consciousness and ability to the collective, and does not die, so long as others live on. The Listeners take their name from their practice of growing the cult by seeking out (or *listening for*) magic sensitive individuals before they can be subjected to the Unnaming. At the extreme of Adhica's crusade against the Listeners, the order was reduced to two bodies struggling to contain some two thousand minds.   
  
Another group, the Sages, predate the courtly practice of Unnaming by a thousand years. They too practice a kind of collective consciousness to protect themselves from outside magic. Each Sage retains her (for they are traditionally all women) name and separateness from the group, but is given the freedom to sleep or become distracted because there are always others of the order watching over her. Sages can share thoughts and feelings, including over great distances, but each retains her own identity. At death her consciousness dies with her body and she is removed from the communal whole. The Sages are tolerated by the Court of Grand Adhica, largely because they draw their number from within their own, geographically isolated, ethnic group, rather than the "aggressive" recruitment policies of the Listeners.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Trade and/or worship, in Baliren anyway. In this region, many small towns have specialized in particular crafts, distinct from their neighboring towns. Within a local area, folk from one town will bring their textiles (for example) to another town known for ceramic. Folks traveling through an area for other purposes may be attracted to one village's famous craft and choose to stop by. Still others, connoisseurs of one craft or another, may journey among towns know for that art and experience their variations.  
  
Baliran towns and roads also frequently contain notable shrines to particular deities. Many folk have developed personal patron relationships with the Gods. If you are traveling through an area and know that the next town has a shrine to your patron, you may choose to spend the night there and worship at the shrine.  
  
These goals can often be combined as well. The domains of the Gods often include certain crafts or arts. So, for example, towns known for textiles often also have a shrine to Senoen, whose domain includes weaving. A weaver from another area might choose to make a journey to that village, both to study its techniques and to visit its shrine; or they might be traveling through on some other business, and choose to visit that particular town out of the many they might pass.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In Baliren, Senoen is worshiped along with a host of local deities, but these don't form a clear pantheon quite like the Olympians or Aesir. They are worshiped more or less separately on particular occasions or associated with specific domains; folk also adopt personal patron deities whom they worship most regularly. Most Baliran deities are venerated in small shrines such as this, and at home altars.  
  
In Agata, where foreign gods are often adopted and incorporated into the faith of the Unnumbered, Senoen is most often worshiped together with other Baliran deities who are regarded as a more unified pantheon. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A visit to a shrine of Senoen, from an account by Marshall Captain Pawil Anrison er Haarken, ca. 1370 YC:  
  
"I left Ethenfarr in the small hours, walking down the length of the isle to Pravens house, on the stony path that hugs the riverbank. I soon came upon a welcome and familiar sight, which I had not seen in many years - the shrine of Senoen, Old Mother. Beneath a low slate roof supported by five thick beams, a bronze likeness sits on the ground, facing the River, with a small child on Her knee. In Her folded skirts She always holds a small pile of coins and bits of paper, the wishes and prayers of pilgrims and passersby.  
  
As I approached, I saw a man of middling age sitting at Her side, gazing with Her upon the water. He himself was not familiar to me, but he was so like his brethren I had known well. He dressed in the grey robes of his order and sat on his feet with his legs folded. In front of him he had placed a small wooden bowl, overturned, asking nothing. And he sang, a low, slow intonation to the Holy River, Mother of the North.   
  
When I entered neath the low roof, the monk sang a verse of welcome, ever in the name of River and Mother. I bowed my head, touching my thumb to my brow, lips, and belly, and spoke three blessings, in the names of my mother, and her mother, and hers. I sat with them awhile." </TEXT>

<TEXT> In Qareya, *eyalzerca* is quite common. It consists of a flatbread wrap filled with fish, greens, beans, and a sweet honey sauce. The name means "thirty-four flowers," a reference to the fact that the flour, greens, beans, and various ingredients of the sauce all come from varieties of the qaralla plant. Bonus fact: thirty-four is frequently used to just mean "a lot."  
  
Folk of the cities of Baliren, as well as the Agatter capital of Parovir, all enjoy a good blackbread pasty, filled with lamb or mutton, potatoes, onions, and possibly cheese, and heavily spiced. The spice mixture particular to each city is considered an important point of civic pride.  
  
In the merchant city-states of Grianna, you'll find two distinct varieties of street food in different quarters of the cities. Around the docklands, workers often eat at stalls serving various forms of fish stew served in a pot made of tough bread. In the wealthy districts, most street food is enjoyed in the late night or early morning and consists of sweet pastries taken with coffee. Berry tarts are a particular favorite. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well no, they'll kill you in the hunt and then eat you. So you won't really know about the getting eaten part, necessarily. Then you'll appear again in the hunting grounds. In the oldest versions of the myth, there is no mention of the fate of the wicked dead. Only the righteous join the Gods, Valhalla-style, in eternal feasting. At some later point, a scholarly debate arose surrounding two questions: 1) What are they eating the whole time? and 2) What fate befalls the wicked? It seemed a reasonable conclusion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Menem's folkloric equivalent to angels are the Beloved, originating in the creation myths of Sovdu. The Beloved, or the Thousand Children, were the first race of people created by the Gods. Unlike all other beings, the Children were granted immortality to watch over and steward the Earth. After countless eons, they grew weary and begged to be allowed to die just as all life. The Gods granted their desire, seeing that eternal life caused as much suffering as death. The Children were allowed to pass into the Land of the Dead - with the caveat that they, alone among all living beings, could still return to the Living as they wished. So, when the Gods made humans in the image of the first Children, they were watched over by the Beloved. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Banbha has three types of magic, each reserved to a particular 'race': Great Magic (the Gods), Small Magic (humans), and Artifice (faeries). Only the human Small Magic can be learned, and any human with a capable teacher can learn any spell. There are neither formal schools (institutions like Hogwarts or Unseen U.) nor distinct 'schools' (classes like Destruction or Charms) of Small Magic. One distinction that many make is between *hearth* and *henge* magic, that is, domestic and sacred - but this is a practical distinction about the uses of different spells rather than an innate one.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I traveled a lot as a student, and I loved learning about how different cultures dealt with small, everyday things like this. As an American I grew up with "bless you" and "gesundheit." Living in Spain, I learned the little litany for successive sneezes: "Jesus...Maria...Jose" (and the secular version: "Salud...Dinero...Suerte"). Then when I asked what to say in Japan, they stared at me blankly and said "Why would you say anything?"

The Qar ("desert") is a vast dry plateau bordered along one long edge by ocean and along the other by high mountains [it's modeled on the Atacama]. The city of Qarisa consists of a strip of the narrow shoreline and three deep canyons, cut into the plateau by little streams and their annual floods. Though the desert has dozens of such canyons, only Qarisa's are evergreen, thanks to the ancient systems of cisterns and pumps that a) control the flood waters and b) keep the water available year round. Dozens of carefully cultivated varieties of qarisa, the desert flower itself, produce the city's famous "perpetual harvest". At nearly 6000 years old, it is Menem's oldest continually inhabited settlement. Its beloved Builders, who established the city's water systems, are revered as saints.

<TEXT> The Baliran Marshals are the great champions of justice in Menem's history. Though descended from an order of armored knights, their heyday came much later, in the tumultuous wars of the modern era. The order has a complicated history, beginning as the personal champions of the Counts in Baliren, then taking on a role more like sheriffs, before they became the first commanders of Baliren's regular army, and finally its elite special forces. Wielding their *longarms*, a rifle fixed with a bayonet modeled on Baliren's traditional glaive-like polearms, they were credited with holding off invasion forces during the first Agata-Jirenes War. Later, during the Ijeida Rebellion, loyalist Marshals ejected Jirenes's occupation forces in Baliren and Agata and helped the city of Ethenfarr withstand a six-month siege. The Rebellion-era Marhsal leader, Captain Pawil Anrison, is regarded as a father of the modern Baliran nation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a rule, folk of Menem don't have much of a sweet tooth, but they do go in for bitter flavors and spice. In fact, most folk would say a fresh fruit is too sweet if they don't have a bit of cinnamon or pepper to sprinkle on it - and Menem's cultivated fruits are generally far less sweet than Earth's. So, like lots of their foods and beverages, medicines are flavored with spices or bitter herbs that alter the taste rather than masking it with sugar. The aforementioned cinnamon and pepper are common for cold/flu/sinus treatments, believed to assist in clearing congestion. Many other herbs and spices have traditional associations with health benefits (perhaps erroneous) that persist in how modern medicines are flavored. The most common standard flavoring would probably be good ol' *basil and allspice*. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Banbha diverges not so much at a particular point in time as with an alternative geographical fact. There is an additional large island in the Celtic Sea, southwest of Ireland and west of France - this is Banbha. I made it explore alternative histories of Ireland, without disturbing Irish history itself. So my challenge has been to give the place its own history, and a role to play in the history of the rest of Europe and the world, without having to great an impact on the ultimate outcomes outside its borders. Some things definitely change - it plays an important role in the wars between England and France, and later between Spain and England - but the broad arc of history is about the same.  
  
As I've followed out various threads of influence such an island would have, I realized that it could well have a profound influence on the US film industry. If a ship departing England or Ireland - say, most famously, the Titanic - called at one last port before crossing the Atlantic, it might be traveling ever so slightly further south, and therefore not encounter any ice, and not have a blockbuster, career-defining, film made about it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Baliren and Agata uses a base-6 system of measures where the basic unit "hand" is used to measure time, length/distance, weight, volume, currency, and simple quantities. It is derived from a finger counting system where the fingers of the right hand are counted as units and the fingers of the left are counted as sixes. A count of one is called a "thumb", a count of six is a "hand" or "right-hand", and a count of thirty-six is a "full hand" or "left-hand". Hands are used for counting everything, but the size of the basic unit varies. Conveniently (that is, so I can remember it) a left-hand is equal to one meter, one liter, one kilo, one day, or any quantity of thirty-six. Supposedly these were derived from original references to the body (e.g. the length of a hand, the volume a cupped palm can hold), but there were standardized long ago. Folk use a variety of derived terms to specify which sort of hand they are counting, such a sun-hand for time, flat-hand for length, or handfull for volume, while merchants use a set of standardized symbols for their inventories and exchanges.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have tended to use 'queer' more often than 'bi' to describe myself, but lately I've been reconsidering that. I like queer as a reclaimed term, but I recognize that it isn't one I really had used against me. I got called a faggot, and that's a word I'll never use to describe myself or anyone else - so I'm not 100% comfortable with queer, thinking of people who have experience on the negative end of its usage. I also wonder if my preference for queer comes from a place of internalized biphobia, that I'm less comfortable calling myself bi or bisexual. Queer is easier, I can claim membership in the LGBT community, and sidestep claiming a bi identity (and the heaps of bullshit I've dealt with before in doing so).  
  
So, in the course of writing this response, I have talked myself out of using the word queer. I've allowed myself to feel more comfortable with it, but I'm afraid - and, really, have been for awhile - that claiming anything other than ***BI AND PROUD*** is contributing to invisibility and erasure.  </TEXT>

The planet has a greater axial tilt than Earth, of about 30 degrees, so seasons are both longer (for the longer year) and more intense. The winter is long and cold enough to glaciers to regularly, significantly, advance and retreat again in the long warm summer (which is believed to have given rise to the Baliran myth of the Marching Kingdom, an army of ice warriors who wage war on the sun and are driven back). Many areas of the world are prone to drastic flooding, and the most powerful and successful early civilizations were those that devised methods to control the flood waters. Menem's population is considerably concentrated in the subtropical zones, away from both the coldest winters and the most intense seasonal storms.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Definitely, and it was a source of the confusion I felt for a long time - until I sorted out that bisexuality is a thing. It still generated self doubt for years after I came out. If I was less interested in men or women for awhile I'd be like "uh, maybe I really am just straight/gay." Then I'd see someone that attracted me, or my fantasizing would shift back, and I'd reassure myself "of course I'm bi, quit doing that." Eventually I've been able to come to terms with attraction shifting around, and a bi identity that's stable over time. I use an analogy to weather vs. climate: Today it's raining/I'm thinking about women (weather); I live in a temperate zone/I'm bisexual (climate). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks!  
  
This is my alt-history/fantasy world Banbha, where I plopped an alternate, extra, Ireland into the Celtic Sea, and am playing with how that might affect various bits of history. I have a straight alt-history version, as well as a version where there's magic.  
  
The Gods are versions of Irish or more broadly Celtic deities, with some Norse influences thrown in, especially in the cosmology. Although there was originally a single universe, there are now nine worlds: the human world, various divine realms, two afterlifes and the underworld, and spaces inhabited by giants and faeries. The Gods control the Great Magic of creation and destruction, with which they shaped the Earth and all the realms. They granted Small Magic to humans, consisting of divination, wards, charms, and the like. In the beginning, before the Gods split the realms, the faeries (which comprise a range of Nordic-ish elfy/dwarfy folk) were servants of the Gods, especially fine craftsmen, and were granted a taste of the Great Magic to craft their works. At the urging of the giants, a group of them rebelled, seeking more power, and in response the Gods split the universe up into the different realms and divided the races from one another. They banished the faeries "to twilight in the roots of the Tree, beneath the Earth," and stripped them of their magic. But the faeries are patient and crafty, and they realized that their realm and the mortal world were not completely separated. They could not enter it, but they could tug at the boundaries and contact humans. At first they tried to 'borrow' the Small Magic, or persuade/coerce humans into using it for them, then as they perfected their Artifice, they began to influence the mortal realm more and more - creating the faerie roads that connect distant places, and even managing to transport humans into their grey realm, which usually resulted in madness. They kept pushing on the boundaries of the realms until they found *something else*, and it resulted poorly.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The gist: Some faeries cracked open a kind of magic Upside Down (Stranger Things), spent a little too much time there, went bad crazy, and brought weird stuff back.  
  
The background: The Gods denied the faeries access to the Great Magic of creation and the Small Magic granted to humans, and banished them "below the Earth." That turned out not to be underground but 'outside' both the mortal world and divine realm - a twilight, liminal, non-space, called the Grey. At first a prison, the eventually found they could manipulate its weird nature to influence the mortal realm - and so invented the third magic, Artifice. Artificers grew in power and skill, in pursuit of their ultimate goal of returning to the divine realm. With the help of some condensed Artifice-stuff called greyglass, they punched through the Grey, but not into the realm of the Gods. They found a colorless, formless void, which in time they found they could manipulate and shape even more powerfully. Better than returning to the Gods, they thought - now they could craft a new world in their own image! But the Colorless started to bleed through into the mortal world, and vice versa. It became less pliable, resistant to the whims of the Artificers; just as the Earth became less solid and everything started to look like a Dali painting, then more like a Bosch. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Conspiracy theory: Visitors from Earth living in the Union capital on Menem deliberately caused the unrest and rioting that led to the "shattered summer" and the resulting civil war.  
  
Truth: The tensions, including disenfranchisement of rural and minority populations and economic distress of agricultural communities, were long-standing problems of the Union government. Terran representatives, most famously Dr. Perrin Shou, raised these issues in diplomatic conferences, but were hardly the cause of them. It is possible that Earth's involvement accelerated the outbreak of open hostility, but the breakup of the first Union government was an outcome almost a century in the making. Nevertheless, the war has been used as a reason to question Terran motives ever since.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Banbha, not my biggest world, but one I like to toy around with, is both alt history and historical fantasy. The 'alt' of the history is the addition of an extra British Isle, located southwest of Ireland, in the Celtic Sea. It mirrors much of the history of Ireland (started off as just an alt history of Ireland, but I wanted more flexibility to make stuff up) - with key differences in that Christian missionaries come quite late, and Banbha better repels the Norman/Anglo invasion - so a small pagan kingdom persists into the modern period. Also faeries are real,  at least in some stories I've set in Banbha.  </TEXT>

* "Pharaoh's Daughter" - Secret Machines
* "Like a Song" - U2
* "When the War Came" - The Decemberists (because a) I dig it and b) it clearly borrows from "No Quarter" and works nicely as a reprise of sorts)

Scholars debate whether it was recent enough to still be retained by cultural memory or if signs of the last ice age are simply clear enough to spark the imagination. Either way, the Ice is personified in myth as a grand army - the Marching Kingdom - that conquered southern territory and waged war on the sun itself. The present day glacier, though far retreated from its historical extreme, still weighs large in myth and legend. It is said to be the abode of the gods and the land of the dead. </TEXT>

Exhausted and half starved, they occupied the ruins of an ancient fort outside Ethenfarr, the capital of Baliren, surrounded by loyalist soldiers and vastly outnumbered. Still they were committed to a final assault against the city - to die fighting for their cause rather than surrender. They charged their enemy's ranks, and all but one were killed within minutes. The last was escorted to the city square where, manacled and beaten, he nevertheless declared victory for his cause: "In this moment, in the heart of the last true man of the north, Ethenfarr belongs to the rightful King!" He then threw himself on a spear. The defeat is immortalized in the enormously popular derisive drinking song "Victory of the Pretender."  </TEXT>

<TEXT> *Menaha u, ru nasqita qe a tasm sita, ti hlokita qe nhurn*  
"Oh beloved, you have been born a thousand times, but do not die"  
  
In the mythology of ancient Sovdu, *An tasrinan*, the Thousand Children^1, were the first race of people created by the gods, charged with watching over the earth and all its other life. They did not age and could not die, but still after countless ages at their post, they grew weary, and begged the gods to let them die as did all other beings. Nadwin the Singer loved his creations and did not wish to see them end, but Sindal the Dancer heard their pleas and did not wish for them to suffer. The Children were allowed to pass from the living world to the Lands of Rest, to have children of their own that would know the agony of death but not the suffering of eternal watchfulness. Nadwin sang a new gift for them, that they could pass between the worlds as they wished, taking the form of any of their beloved creatures of the earth. So they became *An stealan*, the Changing, and *An menahan*, the Beloved. They have continued to watch over the earth, protecting its peoples, but resting when they need. Folk of ancient Sovdu believed in them as a kind of angel, messengers and protectors, and there were many tales and legends of their appearing to heroes and common folk alike. Even into the modern era, many have faith in the patronage of a Beloved One, and see omens in the behavior of animals they believe to watching out for them.   
  
1: Thousand has a more poetic ring, *tas-* is fact means 729, or nine cubed.

<TEXT> Cremation is used by most cultures. As for the fate of your souls, the folk of Menem believe many different things. 
  
In Baliren, old tradition holds that the dead join their forebears and the gods in the Ice Kingdom, located inside the great glaciers to the north. There the virtuous partake in eternal feasting - while the wicked become beasts to be hunted eternally.  
  
From Tevra, the dead go north also - but they must journey over the mountains and deserts of Tehlaer and cross the frozen arctic sea to reach the land of the dead. Depending on their deeds in life, they may find joy or torment waiting for them, meted out by those who went before. Some believe the souls of the wicked are either shunned from the land of the dead, or remain in the world as haunts, avoiding punishment due to them.  
  
In Agata, it's believed that all life comes from and returns to the sea. The dead return there both literally and spiritually. Normal folk have their ashes spread on the waves, but the glorious - especially monarchs and sailors who die in battle - are "sent home whole" and are believed to live on bodily with the Mother of the Sea eternally.  </TEXT>

Earth initiated contact with Menem sometime in the late 21st century (which I haven't bothered to pin down precisely), having detected signs interpreted as intelligent life. At a distance of 15 lights years, and limited to sending radio signals - it took a long time to get things established. Earth eventually built a ship which made the journey in 45 years, and managed to shave it down to 30 years with the latest Really Fast Ships^TM.

<TEXT> A place in Parovir, capital of Agata, actually called "Temple City" consists of hundreds of shrines and temples commissioned by successive monarchs over the course of the city's early centuries. The grandest of these are the fourteen "God-Palaces" each dedicated to one of the major deities of Agata's oldest traditions. These surround the central Temple of the Unnumbered, a sprawling complex containing thousands of shrines itself. The whole Temple City covers just under 3 sq. km. It houses a population of some 1,000 permanent residents, largely priests and acolytes of the largest temples, but often has a temporary population of 5,000-10,000 pilgrims. It exists as part of the much larger capital city, but Temple City is given a kind of independence and special rights as a holy center.  
  
Qareya and Sovdu have several large monastery-university-commune-temples. The residents are farmers, priests, scholars, and pilgrims but all take holy vows to the service of the community and they are regarded as sacred sites - usually founded at places featured in ancient scriptures. The largest of these is a walled complex with a permanent population of around 7,000 with sometimes twice that many pilgrims or students residing for a year or two.

<TEXT> I have two problems with the episode from a worldbuilding perspective. First is that "question no one asked" issue. As a viewer, I recognize that I'm watching human actors, so I can allow that alien species will look human. I'm not especially interested in an in-world explanation, and much more interested in telling stories about culture clash and identity, where Star Trek generally excels. Similarly, I particularly disliked the whole Klingon, virus, something-about-foreheads storyline in Enterprise.  Worf's "dark time for the empire" comment in the DS9 tribble episode accomplished the goal so much more effectively, without wasting most of a season.
  
My second problem is that the episode establishes something potentially groundbreaking that could shake up the Federation - yet is never mentioned again. This is a common enough failing of Star Trek episodes, but The Chase presents itself as particularly important and meaningful, while ultimately accomplishing nothing. It might be a neat premise for a universe, but it isn't the premise of Star Trek. It comes off as revisionism, not revelation.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Numerology plays a significant role in the philosophical traditions of the regions of Tevra and Iuliat on Menem. The most significant numbers are 8, 9, and 17.  
  
8 is the divine number, and there are 8 chief deities in the ancient pantheon of Tevra. The divines are associated with  domains that complement each other in elemental pairs - water and fire, earth and air, life and death, knowledge and action. Because of these pairings, 2 (representing the pair) and 4 (as there are 4 pairs) are also divine numbers.  
  
9 is the number of humanity and the mundane world. As 9 is composed of 3s, 3 is another important number. The world has 3 realms - earth, sea, and sky - each of which has three idealized roles - king, priest, and wright.  
  
The divine and the human together comprise the universe, represented by the number 17 - the sum of the human and the divine numbers. But, just as 17 is prime, the universe is unitary and indivisible - made up of divine and human elements that are inseparable.  
  
Further derivations of this tradition regard all of these human and divine elements as tripled, across three states of the universe - High, Middle, and Low, or Past, Present, and Future - which renders 51 a sacred number signifying all of space and time.  
  
This structure was codified in a number of treatises on the nature of the universe - which were later condensed to a tarot-like deck of 51 cards. Initially used for instruction of temple acolytes, the cards have become popular for divination as well as a wide variety of secular games.  </TEXT>

What sort of room is it - office, kitchen, library... How big is the room? What are the walls, windows, doors, furniture, etc. made of? How is it decorated; what's on the shelves? What building is it in? What is/are the occupant(s) doing? What's going on outside...  
  
Then I follow up on all those questions: The walls are stone. What sort of stone? Where was it quarried, by who? What were the working conditions? There's a book of scripture. What religion? What translation? Where and when was it printed?
  
No room is an island, so when you begin filling in the details of what makes up a single room, you can rapidly begin discussing the history, economics, politics, religions, etc. of the world. It may not give you riveting narrative or fill up a best seller, if that's your goal, but I've found it a super useful method for populating a world, with both people and concepts. The seeming mundane details of a single room give you something tangible to hang all the juicy worldbuilding on.

<TEXT> Menem and the alternative name for the world Gashifa both came from conlangs I put together for the world. Once I had them, and some generalizations about history and culture, was able to pull from those conlangs what the people called the world. Menem means "the seas" in the language Taragat and stems from face that Agata was a dominant sea-faring culture, which referred to its dominion as "all the seas." This phrase was shortened and extended metaphorically to mean "the whole world." Gashifa is a much later term from the Uajiren language which means "Union City." Terran visitors mistranslated the name and mistook for the name of the planet, started using it that way, and it just kind of stuck.  
  
My other world is called Banbha, taken from the Irish goddess of the same name. Banbha was a patron goddess of Ireland, along with her sister Eriu (from whom we have Eire, Ireland). As Banbha is imagined as an alternative Ireland - a sister Ireland - I named it for Eire's sister.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> All the Gods of Miksala ascended to their status. The Gods are supramortal, transcendent beings, but even they cannot escape destruction. Their domains can be bestowed upon others, even upon mortals - or they can be stolen by one who kills a God. They have been prone to wars over the management of the domains, and mortals have rebelled against the caprices of the Gods many times.  
  
There is none more contentious than the domain of Death - a status of great power, but also a heavy burden. Not all who have ascended to it have been equal to its challenges. The present God of Death, Xeswa the Mad Sprite, killed his predecessor, Tenhar the Magnanimous, quite by accident he insists, in the miscarriage of a prank intended to liven up the dull festivities of a Creation Day parade. For her part, Tenhar was regarded by mortals and divines alike as a wise and just Death. She had been a judge in life, before receiving the domain from THE UNCONQUERED SUN and a gathered council of surviving lesser divinities following the the 17th Great Upheaval. For a thousand years she carried out her duties with honor and grace. Under Tenhar's watch, Death came, but not so much of it, to noble and commoner, innocent and seeming deserving, some to the young, but mostly the old. Her reign was an honored time, at first a blessed respite from the excesses of Nipper the Plague Rat, then a long period of prosperity and predictability. But Xeswa has brought a new terror. He attends his duties and sends Death only as it amuses him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Humans from Earth call humans from Menem "Gashifan", which is a bit like calling everyone from France Parisian. The first communication between the planets used the term *Gishef uaMenem* (Union of Menem), referring to the global government, not to the planet. Earthlings^1 shortened the phrase and used the locational form *Gashif*, which only refers to the Union's administrative capital. Everybody pretty much knows better, but it stuck. The nearest term which Gashifans use themselves is *Geushif*, meaning "citizen" or "comrade," which is a form of address rather than a denonym. Speakers of Uajiren, the dominant language and primary language of the Union government, use the demonym *Meunim*.  
  
Gashifans (or *Meunima*), call the people of Earth *heufi* (star person) or *meuri* (eye person). From Menem, Earth's sun appears to be the eye of a constellation called the Prince.  
  
1: There is little consensus among people of Earth what to call themselves. Terran, Solan, Solarian, Earthling and many other terms have been used, but nobody's really comfortable with any of them.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is an ancient monument attributed to the Magisters called the Efen Stone. Approximately nine thousand years old, it consists of a wall of black stone bearing an inscription commonly translated "List of Works Known to be Lost." What follows is a list of titles and authors, the majority of which are attributed by no other source. Most have titles such as "Four Tragedies of Gavoren aat Emle", but others bear titles such as "Plans for Vessels Borne on Wind" and "Treatise on the Ancestry of Man" which some interpret as indicating advanced ancient knowledge (in this case of powered flight and a theory of evolution). The foot of the monument bears the inscription, "We thought a weapon could preserve us, but it has proved our doom."  
  
Multiple attempts to discern the subject matter of the listed works have amounted to little more than speculation. The monument has been known for some four hundred years, and many interpretations have been published, always suggesting that the titles predict the most current technological advancements. The Stone has been the basis of countless conspiracy theories ranging from it being a hoax to suggestions of the alien origins of life on Menem, or the builders' destruction by nuclear war.
  
Whatever the meaning of the inscription, scholars take it to be a warning, the last monumental work of a dying civilization - however advanced - attempting to preserve what it has lost, and prevent others from following their fate.

To many, the Stone is to Menem what the library of Alexandria is on Earth - the reminder of ancient knowledge lost. For others it is the suggestion of deep connections to other worlds, or just another "I'm not saying it's aliens" source of crackpot theories. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Most of Menem has settled on a base 12 system derived from a traditional finger-counting method used in Agata and spread around the world by sailors and merchants from there. Agata's dominance in higher maths and science later helped codify this as the system used for those disciplines as well. Various regions and languages maintain holdovers from systems no longer in wide use, such as base 6 in Baliren and Griana or base 60 in Jirenes. Much of the continent of Tevra maintains a base 8 system for daily use alongside a base 17 ceremonial numerology. 17 has great significance in the cosmology of Dialogism, the dominant religion of Tevra, and is also used in secular contexts because of its ancient origins.   </TEXT>

Also "collective" is a somewhat, uh, sterile translation of the *eu-a-* root that appears in the second example. It can also means "people," "society," or "nation." A more colorful translation might be that you're calling the person a "shit-nation", that is, far shittier than an ordinary person - shitty enough for a whole nation.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Menem has seen two instances of a UN-like(ish) body in the planet's history. The first was a powerful, centralized, global government, which ultimately collapsed in rebellion. The second relied on a greater distribution of power, and coincided with the creation of an interstellar union, following contact with Earth and the Dorenii Systems.  
  

  
The Second Jirenes-Agata War ended in the collapse of both imperial powers, with a multitude of successor states inheriting a starving populace, devastated infrastructure, and massive stockpiles of arms. Wealthy third party states, namely Sovdu and Qarisa, proposed a central cooperative body to administer relief and oversee reconstruction efforts. They offered considerable investment and guidance, in exchange for a role in brokering relations among the new nations, and oversight of the disarmament process. The collapse of the empires rendered a traditional peace treaty impossible, but new nations were welcomed as signatories to the Union Accord, which established an international parliament for, among other tasks, adjudicating border disputes and distributing aid. This body was called Gishefa ("the Union") and had its headquarters at Gashifa ("Union City"), a new, planned city on international soil surrendered by Sovdu, originating as a resettlement area for refugees. Gishefa promised a way forward from centuries of conflict and ethnic division. Gashifa became the premier modern city, a pinnacle of culture and technology, and a symbol of the healing process. But it did not last.  
  
  

Gishefa had a significant hand in drafting the constitutions of many of the post-imperial states, and granted considerable leeway to Union oversight of each nation's domestic affairs. Initially this spirit of cooperation and reconstruction was welcomed, but as the new states aged and grew more independent, they began to chafe at what they perceived as a new imperial influence and foreign intervention. This was especially true in long-contested regions such as Griana which carried the memories of a series of brutal proxy wars waged by Jirenes and Agata. Nearly a century after the Accord, regional independence movements and neo-loyalist militias dedicated to reestablishing the old empires clashed in the war variously called the Broken Union of Dozen-fronts War, with early visitors from Earth witnessing from orbit. The conflict culminated in the launch of an unarmed rocket against the Earth ship Ambassador by Jirenes royalists, after which Union peacekeepers established multiple ceasefire agreements in the face of unprecedented interstellar war.  
  
  

The last act of the the First Gishefa was to initiate the meetings that established the Accord in Orbit, which simultaneously called for a new international peace agreement on Menem and a statement assuring the "eternal fellowship of all human worlds"^1. The First Gishefa surrendered regional sovereignty to the various national powers and a new Second Gishefa was established for negotiating conflicts and addressing crises such as drought or natural disasters. The subsequent Ambassador Agreement established long-lasting peace between the many nations of Earth and Menem, despite any intraplanretary conflicts, called for a fleet of exploratory ships and space stations under the flag of new Union of Human Worlds.

<TEXT> The Crown of Agata was such a union. Though its boundaries were a matter of some contention and its influence varied considerably, it lasted in some form for more than a thousand years. It is united under the Doremen (Sister of the Sea), which position latter-day Terran observers dubbed "Koriarch" meaning something like "ruling daughter/maiden." The earliest form of the Crown united the city-states surrounding the Sunken Sea, chiefly Ecliya, Ecaver, Ormont and the Sea of Glass, and expanded south and east over time, warring with the rival alliance the Crown of Eqre. It later incorporated much of Baliren to the north. The early states were traditionally united by the practice of Etaretare, the Faith of the Gods Unnumbered, which accepted the Doremen's divine right and variously viewed her as semi-divine herself, which grew complicated with the inclusion of Baliren and its own indigenous gods.   
  
The Crown's influence in Baliren first expanded via trade, and many folk of southern blood moved into the area, still owing fealty to the Crown back home while duly paying their taxes to the Counts and High Kings. With the dissolution of the High Kingship, the larger cities became free states whose growing merchant-nobility urged them towards affiliation with the Crown. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the traditions of Qareya, which modern scholars tend to group under the umbrella title Dialogism, there are eight major deities. The Most High, as these are called, are equally ranked, and each balances the others in a web of pairings (the Dialogs). Each is associated with a complex of aspects that are contrasted/opposed/complemented by the aspects of others, which underlies an inherent universal balance. The exact identification of the aspects varies by region and in various scriptures, but this general structure unites thousands of years of belief.   
  
In Sovdu, there are two creator deities, Nadwin and Sindal, generally taken to be balanced in rank. Many scholars take this tradition to be related to Dialogism as each of the two is associated with a variety of aspects usually contrasted by the aspects of the other. They do not act in concert however, as the Most High usually are believed to act, but often are at odds with one another - one act of creation rapidly undone by another. In this tradition, the universe is not in balance, but is chaos merely constrained by the often capricious whims of the two gods.   
  
Baliren has a family of chief deities like the Olympians or Aesir, joined by a number of lesser deities and other beings. They are ranked according to the traditional structure of the ancient small kingdoms of the region - led by the High King and his brother, who is chief counselor and provides a check on the High King's power; followed by their wives, then their children.  
  
The dominant belief in Agata is Etaretare (Gods Unnumbered) which holds first that there are gods of all things - every stone and drop of water, every river, tree, storm, and village; and that the gods of all other peoples are real and worshipful. They appropriate beliefs and practices from many other traditions they have contacted. It is a broad religious tradition with much individual variation; with some Agatter's primarily following the Baliran pantheon, for example. There is not single hierarchy, most believe that the Sea is the chief of all gods and worship her above all else.

<TEXT> In Agata and Baliren, knowledge and technological progress are considered sacred. Doctors who develop life saving treatments or cures are revered as saints. Reading, learning and teaching are acts of devotion. A particularly strong example of this concept can be seen in the history of railroads. They became more mundane over time, but the first stations were literal temples, the engineers and conductors were ordained as priests, and to ride a train was an act of worship with special prayers - all in the name of celebrating the gifts of the Gods. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In Baliren most folk use a structure of [Given name] [Patronymic] [Hometown]. Pawil Anrison ir Haarken; Sagir Anderdaughter er Balirhearth. The full name is often called an "oathname" and is generally used for formal or legal purposes only. Differing shorter forms are generally used according to context. Pawil, serving in the Marshals far from home is usually called Pawil Haarken; Sagir, living and working around 'Hearth is referred to more frequently as Anderdaughter.  
  
Agata has two typical structures of family name, used historically by noble and common families. Noble houses typically had place names associated with their traditional holdings - Ecliya (Greywall), Menefet (Sea of Glass) - of which an individual might have several, reflecting their noble lineage across several houses. Occupational surnames developed among commoners and eventually became family names. Alternatively, as commoners rarely owned land and Agata is a maritime society, fishing and merchant ships might be their most significant property, handed from father son, so ship names frequently became family names: Firamen (Sea's Brother), Foraikal (Silken Sail), Rennaleo (Wave Flyer).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are quite a number of such states in the region of Griana, southern Ijeida, most of them maritime mercantile republics. They once formed a confederation, historically [symbolically] united under the Crown of Griana, and cooperated broadly on matters of law and trade. In the run-up to the Intercontinental Wars, the Griana republics had their loyalties divided between the opposing great powers of Agata and Jirenes, their wealth and resources subjected to the imperial states. The failed armistice that ended the First War drew a border and 'zone of embargo' across the center of the region, dividing many of the former states in half and severing vital trade routes. The republics, independent for centuries, found themselves beholden to the empires for basic goods and staple food. The region spent a quarter-century racked by successive waves of rebellion, coup, rioting, and martial law, in a period that became known as the Crucible of Griana.  
  
Gavoran At, an exiled noble of Eqre, living in neutral Sovdu throughout the war, famously likened the governance of these states to a shell game: "Power continuously shifts from one hand to another, and back, until the exasperated people cannot follow or even hope to guess where it has ended up."  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree that maps add boundaries, but not that it's always a bad thing. Sometimes I have felt overly constrained by a map, like I couldn't change things or put new things where I thought they belonged. But other times a solid map was just the thing I needed to expand my imagination about a world. Sometimes boundaries help you think more deeply about the possibilities of a particular situation; you give yourself a set of rules to conform to and push against, which can be very satisfying. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The war that surrounded the foundation of the Uajiren Empire was historically known as Unification War, when in reality is was a series of invasions and conquests that subjugated the continent under the imperial ambitions of the Amfenisa dynasty. Its initiating action was called the "Glorious Revolution" among other exalted names, while most historians now consider it a coup against a popular and stable monarchy. Following the collapse of the Empire, however, the public and historians alike have tended to "redwash" its history, attributing to it more blood than it was truly responsible for. Notably, the Empire is frequently given sole blame for instigating the Intercontinental Wars while minimizing the role of other powers, especially the Crown of Agata with its much longer history of imperial expansion.  
  
The foundation of the post-war Grand Union is similarly painted in rosier (er, whiter) light. While it governed relatively stably for most of two centuries and some say it recovered from its birthing pains - it was not met with universal support and many early dissidents were jailed or disappeared.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> For Menem that is the Great Intercontinental War, fought between continental alliances of Ijeida and Jirenes, while Tevra looked on horrified. Jirenes had been unified under the Uajiren Empire for two centuries, and as the world industrialized the Empire turned its attention to fuel rich Griana in southern Ijeida. Its expansion began with Teugad Naufair ("Western Capital Group"), a state-run corporation, acquiring land and extraction rights in Griana, until the Crown of Agata grew nervous and began pressuring states in Griana to refuse these rights. Agata soon began stationing troops around Griana and fortifying its own holdings. After a number of early standoffs, in 1312 YC the Empire began annexing islands in the Encircled Sea to launch an air war - the first of its kind - against the heart of Agata. Fierce fighting followed on the sea to defend those islands, until the Empire landed an invasion force and marched across Griana toppling the city-states and imposing its own rule. The period sometimes called the First Intercontinental War ended with the long siege of Parovir, the Agata capital, and the surrender of the Queen. The Empire, via its proxy Teugad Naufair occupied Parovir and other Agata cities, and over the following few years moved its occupation north into Baliren, seizing infrastructure and supply routes.  
  
Despite Agata surrender, resistance in Griana continued as Empire-backed regimes faced successive coups and a dozen "failed experiments" attempted to establish varying forms of radical new governments. After a generation of occupation of the north, Agata and Baliren began a new resistance - the complicated Ijeida Rebellion which in the end successfully ejected occupation forces, but also toppled the ancient monarchy of Agata and divided Baliren in civil war. The short-lived Ijeida Union that emerged sent massive support across the sea to back to growing civil war in Jirenes until the Empire was finally destroyed in the bloodiest campaign of the long conflict, sometimes distinguished as the Second Intercontinental War.  
  
No nation that entered the fighting was left standing when the Peace of Qaris was signed in 1384 YC, and long-held assumptions of regional relations had been deeply challenged. A coalition of Tevra states oversaw transition governments among the belligerents, a state of affairs which evolved into Gishefa, "Grand Union," Menem's first attempt at world government. Many thought that all war really had ended, and Great Peace that followed lasted nearly a century, until the Shattered Summer ended that dream.  
  
I meant for the Great War to be a clear parallel to the World Wars, so it begins in a similar technological environment, and sees the development of nastier weapons during its course - though nobody achieves nuclear weapons. Much of the early part featured a rapid technological arms race, beginning with canvas bi-planes and wooden-decked ships and ending with early jets and massive carriers. The occupation and later is fought between the bankrupted Empire and a rag-tag insurgency, and looks very different. But both periods were bloody.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The primary period of Menem's history that I've developed parallels the 19th-early 20th century political revolutions of Earth. There is a plethora of rival factions espousing various political positions, including republicans, socialists, and yes, anarchists. They are most influential in the regions of Baliren and Griana, both areas occupied by the Uajiren Empire following the First Intercontinental War, and earlier brought under the influence of the Crown of Agata. All of these seek the removal of the Agatter and Uajiren states from influence of Baliren and Griana, some coupling these motives with more radical aims to dismantle those states entirely.  
  
In Baliren, the anarchists generally advocate a return to the pre-Agata collectivist communities that abounded in the region. Some view this a purely political/(anti-governmental goal), while others have coupled it with an ethnic nationalism that seeks the expulsion of ethnic Agatters (who may have hundreds of years of heritage in Baliren) and other foreign groups, sometimes by violent means. Ironically, the most radical of these groups claim descent from the arguably quite statist Ice Kings (who legendarily founded the High Kingdom of Baliren), while also claiming an anti-state anarchist agenda. These are countered by a peaceful agrarian movement who have re-occupied rural settlements abandoned during industrialization or depopulated by the wars and have begun a revival of traditional collectivist methods.  
  
In Griana, the anarchists tend to be anarcho-capitalists seeking to reestablish the pre-war independent city-states, which tended to be run by a wealthy merchant class and their influential markets. In later years, during the period known as the Crucible of Griana, these are overshadowed by those advocating violent revolution against occupation and loyalist governments.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Baliran Marshals, originally a county constabulary, later a militia raised under the same name, and finally the regular standing army of the region, are colloquially called "spring foxes" for the grey and yellow colors of their uniform which resemble the spring/summer coat of the northern fox. They are also sometimes called "shepherds" for the local herding dogs with similar colors.   
  
Historically the Royal Agata Navy was referred to as the "Brother of the Sea" [while the Queen herself is called the Sister of the Sea] and frequently appears in poetry as "our Brother" or "little brother." Later, submariners of the Royal Agata Navy are called "swordfish" by their allies and "eels" by their enemies.  
  
The air forces of the Empire of Jirenes were called "kites" [a word in the Uajiren language meaning only the flying toy and not referring to birds of prey] for the code name used while early military aircraft were under development.    

Edit: some city nicknames!  
Gashifa is called the "little world" or the "little union" as it was founded by a diversity of groups from around the world, primarily displaced peoples following Intercontinental Wars, as a neutrally-located capital for a peacekeeping Union. For this history is also called, somewhat less affectionately, "refugee city" and other pejoratives.  
  
In Agata, the phrase Crown of Agata refers variously to the nation itself, the Queen's royal authority, the geological feature known as the Seawall that dominates Agata's territory, or to the ceremonial Crown itself, an ancient artifact bearing a depiction of the Seawall. The capital city, Parovir, located high atop the Wall, is often called the "jewel of the Crown" or "Crown city."  
  
Ethenfarr, whose name means "meeting place" is called "festival city" and "council city" for its traditional role as the cultural hub of Baliren and the site of annual summertime festivals and meetings. In later centuries it is called "Constitution city" and "peace city" because it was the site of the signing of the aptly named Ethenfarr Constitution which established the Republics of Wheat and Water and, in the eyes of its signers anyway, precipitated the end of the Intercontinental Wars.

<TEXT> Tanaka Mitoe, the first human to contact the Maaum (a species in my space opera universe), described the species as "faceless, six-limbed giants."^1 Their closest evolutionary relatives are their planet's whale-analogs, aquatic behemoths of whom the Maaum alone are terrestrial. Almost all of them travel with a **wouwa** companion, which human xenobiologists have likened to remoras, and which co-evolved with the Maaum as they emerged onto land. While Maaum communicate in a "thumping bellow" which took human linguists and interpreters decades to comprehend, their companions "babble in a jittering shriek" which most aliens find inscrutable if not intolerable. Among themselves, Maaum tend to distrust anyone who does not have a wouwa companion, and extend this suspicion to other species which lack the same kind of symbiotic/companionate relationships. Notably, dogs and wouwa get along extremely well, and it was the presence of dogs among human colonies that led to the first diplomatic breakthroughs with the Maaum. The strategic importance of relations with the Maaum led to considerably more dogs traveling on human starships and living in human colonies. Non dog lovers consider this a political compromise, while the Maaum look on it as their positive influence improving the lives or ordinary people on alien worlds.

<TEXT> I've been toying around with [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/) which is a nice light 3D modeling tool, not super robust but user-friendly and good for sorting out a notion. I've made [a few designs public](https://www.tinkercad.com/users/cAagM1c1ElX-papercupmixmaster) so you can take a look.    
  
On to the lore. The folk of the Grand Kingdom of Adhika have made a life of the high desert, in all its harsh corners. The large cities lie down in the canyons cut in ages past when rivers flowed with vigor, and now are fed by meager streams. These canyons cut straight across the vast plateau on their way to the sea. Above, in the wind-blown, arid expanse of Leleomo, no such cities could survive, but the expanse is dotted with villages protected from the wind and heat by their walls and their dearly treasured wells. Many are single compounds of a seven or ten dwellings, three or four families, gathered around a cistern, with its domed cap and soaring towers - windcatchers that draw off heat to cool the homes and water. In those few places with a deep well to tap, several such compounds may cluster together, facing their gates inward to form a market square, or stringing them along a line so a field beyond may be sheltered from the wind and even sustain a few hearty crops. Inside the walls, residents tend small gardens and keep their goats and fowl.  
  
Strung along the roads from Grand Adhika to Ederes in the high country, these villages are the domains of sages and their households. Two or three walled compounds lie clustered together, their backs to the wind and their gates away from the road. One is given over to the sage and her husbands - each in a dwelling with favorite concubines; the second reserved for the sage's chief daughter and her children; a third for others of the household. Always one dwelling is reserved for travelers, whether they are passing through or come seeking some spell or wisdom from the sage.

That describes Adhica quite well! It's an old, old city. Once a little fishing port in one of the desert's few safe approaches to the sea (elsewhere its all a steep rise to the plateau), and is continuously growing, building and rebuilding. It's also repeatedly ravaged by earthquakes, so the old rubble is deep and new buildings built tough.  
  
Ederes is a trading hub for the interior, and so indeed attracts all kinds.

<TEXT> Grand Adhica (the Grand gives it away) is indeed the capital. Its old center sits on the coast and it has continued to sprawl, incorporating towns and communities that lie along the deep canyons that cut through the desert to the sea.  
  
Ederes is an inland city on the high plane above the desert, sitting on the region's single large lake.  
  
Narrowbridge is long rambling canyon city named for the natural bridge that crosses overhead. The bridge is buffeted by high winds and dangerous for travel. Most descend to the canyon floor to cross; but the bridge is home to a monastery housing devotees of the Unnamed...  

The Unnamed are powerful magic users who not only renounce their former lives, they use their magic to strip all memory of themselves from others. The order is well known, but none remember ever having encountered any members (though they do on a regular basis).  
  
The Listeners have been used as spies, but in recent years serve only their own secretive goals. They are magic users as well, who peer into unsuspecting minds, seeking memories and also planting them - directing their victims to work for them without knowing it. The Unnamed developed their art as a defense against the Listeners.   
  
The Reposing God is a enormous monumental sculpture of the god Oppuron. When it fell in an earthquake, its ruin was left to lie sprawling across the desert above Adhica for a thousand years.  
  
Giant's Lantern is a volcano! It sits high the ridge above the desert and the broad barren plateau, and clear dry air allows its glow to be seen from a great distance. Giant's Candle, a grand lighthouse that sits in Adhica's harbor, was lit by the Lantern's fires, and serves as much a spiritual purpose as a practical one.  </TEXT>

A plague came to Telles and spread so fast it simply overwhelmed magical healing. It was treatable, but not fast enough. 2/3 or more of the population died, including kings and lords. That was awful, but then a cabal of necromancers began using the vast numbers of plague dead to raise an undead army to enslave the survivors. The zombies can pretty much only be destroyed with fire. Many remaining towns and vast tracts of forest and countryside were burned to fight the hordes. Society as it had been was torn down by the Death, and the zombies left no hope of any recovery.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Lagrange points are stable for objects of negligible mass relative to the large bodies of the system. In a typical planetary system (not that we really understand what's typical yet) you might be able to put *objects* there, but they couldn't be viable planets. Jupiter can sustain large groups of asteroids in its L4 and L5 points, but not a moon-sized body. Earth-Sun Lagrange point objects still need to undergo some amount of station keeping because the orbits aren't completely stable on their own -good for telescopes and possibly space stations. A planet-sized Lagrange object (or set of objects) would require the two parent bodies to be incredibly massive. On the order of a brown dwarf orbiting a supergiant, perhaps three Lagrange planets might be conceivable (L3, L4, L5). </TEXT>

I've found this enormously productive for kickstarting a world from an initial idea. By describing one single room in detail, you start with something small and contained, but you can hang so much information about the world on that room - things that can be used to generate more and more information as you go. You don't have to think about continents and cultures in detail yet, but you can start to capture what the world feels like and what an ordinary person's life is like within it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wrote a whole long list of things, but I can boil it down to this - I draw inspiration from seeing things I've never seen before. They make me think of something or see something in a new light.  
  
As to the process - I usually start without maps, too. Characters or scenarios come first. Usually I write a bit of dialogue or a description of a place or event, and begin filling out the world around it. Those starting 'kernels' have been inspired by everything from ancient ruins and 19th century prison logs to natural places and people-watching on a train.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This world is a new project and I'm still ironing out basic structures - but here's my present thinking on the matter. Names, having a name or not, and having lost a name, are crucial elements of a rigid caste system. Such a person would be stripped of their name, but incompletely, and could be branded 'casteless' which others would be able to remember. It would not be a good position to be in.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The problem I see is that most of your planetside hard targets - infrastructure, settlements, etc. - can be approached from above, from orbit, so naval support doesn't pose much of a threat to such invaders, even for coastal targets. That changes if it's a particularly watery world with lots of stuff on islands. If the invasion progresses and a lot of land-based targets are lost, the navy could become an important last stand position, its mobility allowing it to avoid enemy forces for longer.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Jacob Greyglass is young in relative terms. He is of a more recent generation of the half-faeries, folk for whom time is a difficult concept to grasp (though as the proprietor of a clock shop, he has a somewhat better hold on it than his fellows). He does sometimes wear glasses. He's a secondary protagonist to Maebh (below).  
  
Alasdair Scyld. I suppose he is a demon in the eyes of some. An older half-faerie with an abiding interest in the humans. If he ever lights fires though, it is only to brew tea. He is a mentor to the younger half-fae, Jacob and Cuorob.  
  
Cuorob U'Fomhoir is indeed big and none too bright, though he rarely hits things. He is half-faerie, but descended from the Fomorians (giants) through his mother. Alasdair placed a curse on him to hide him from his jealous father, to the effect that no one who is looking for him can ever find him, even friends. He spends most of his time fishing in the river Aen and startling children.  
  
Cuerideun is a powerful faerie magician, and student of Jacob's mother. She was banished from the Otherworld for becoming too powerful and threatening the power of others.  
  
Maebh is a human who trope-ily gets pulled into the world of the faeries and ends up involved in defeating Cueriduen's insurrection.  
  
Bannock, Laghaen, and U'Groabhi are all cities in Banbha. Bannock is the Dublin-like European capital, and Laghaen the ancient seat of the High Kings of Banbha and a favorite haunt of the half-faeries. U'Groabhi is more rightly a village, related to Cuorob in that he sometimes views it as his charge to protect.    
  
  
To Menem! 
  
Most of these were things rather than people since I've post about the people fairly often.  
     
Ynisim is a religious concept of sorts. They are pack animals native to the homeworld of the Doreba, and the name is often extended to their nomadic caravans, and later to their starships.  
  
The Doreba are a nomadic religious sect from Renii who took their unending pilgrimage to the stars after suffering generations of persecution at home. They traditionally followed certain stars as they journeyed through the sky throughout the year - so it became seen as the natural extension to travel to and live among those stars when they were able.  
  
Sovduna Rec is the holiest relic of the ancient faith of Sovdu (it's name means Standing Stone of the White Forest). It was believed to be the origin of the human race and becomes their primary symbol among the many species in the galaxy.  
  
Dera Tehlaer is another word for religious pilgrimage that took on a new meaning in space travel. It was once the journey of mourners to the edge of the world to send away the souls of the dead. It is now the long flight home that many of Menem take to  bury their loved ones in the soil of the home world.  
  
Qarisa Ruehaif [that *a* at least was a typo...] is a deep space station built by the Union between Renii and Menem, named on the ancient city of Qarisa ("the garden in the desert"). *Ruehaif* means "in space." It *has* a space bazaar with many exotic ladies trading goods and information.  
  
Tirhane is a person! One of the exotic ladies! She escaped the police state operating Renii's colonial moons aboard a Doreba Ynisim and ended up on Qarisa. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Unnaming is the first spell a mage ever casts, and the most powerful. It is a test and an initiation rite. It proves that she is a caster, and it binds her to the Order. The Unnaming erases all memory of her name from her own mind, and from the minds of all who ever met or knew her. It wards her against ever bearing a name again. Her only names are *I* and *mage*, as every other mage.

<TEXT> The long lives of the non-human races probably gives them a distinctive position within or relative to human cultures. Tolkien's elves live apart from the humans, uninterested in them and even looking down on them; and the humans distrust them. They exist but, at least in the hobbits' eyes, they're semi-mythical. Their view of history and events of the past doesn't have much weight on human lives or politicking, until the events of the Fellowship, etc. Alternatively, you could have the elves (or whoever) hold places of distinction within human societies. They are well-known and regarded as sages or revered for their mastery of skills, having lived so long to perfect them. Perhaps some hold them in this regard and others distrust them. If you want the thousands-of-years timeline, they could help keep society static - both keeping it from advancing to hovercars and maintaining continuity which the short-lived humans would tend to lose of thousands of years. If your friend's grandmother could remember the pyramids being built, our world would probably be quite different.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've thought a lot about this one, and decided that I don't mind humanoids. I can convince myself that at least some basic elements of the human body,e.g. symmetry, differentiated limbs, eyes, speech, are plausible products of the evolutionary processes of a completely different planet. Plus, they're easier for audiences to relate to, and obviously easier for actors to portray. What's a bigger problem for me is when sci fi imagines a world to have an evolutionary history very like Earth's but that produced a humanoid intelligence from a different, recognizable, sort of animal. I can handle Vulcans, Twi Leks or Asari looking implausibly similar to humans, but I can't stand cat people, shark people, spider people, etc. </TEXT>

The FTL engine they have is cumbersome and prone to burning out after two or three jumps. But plenty of folk are eager to set up colonial shop on new worlds. There's basically one sort of ship, with a plethora of designs - big modular colonizers with hefty cargo holds for equipment and dense, cramped living quarters.

There are hundreds and thousands of names, descriptions, and words for the divine - largely compounds of various length, like Inuit 'words' for snow. Most amount to things like "the god of this stream" and "lord of the middens heap" and "the god that resides in each wave of the sea". A huge quantity of them are standard and well-known expressions, and arguably constitute "hundreds of words for gods."  </TEXT>

Following the first War, the Uajiren Empire occupied and imposed its rule on much of Ijeida. The Rebellion was a chaotic period some thirty years later when dozens of rival factions rose against the occupation, against the former established governments, against one another, and/or all of the above. At its most successful, the Rebellion ejected the occupation forces in Baliren and Agata and dissolved the old Crown of Agata in favor of a set of independent republics. At its worst, the Rebellion exacerbated the ongoing conflicts collectively called the Crucible of Griana, inciting greater unrest and establishing a string of corrupt and unstable governments.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> For one set of characters, such a time loop would be horrific. They live during wartime, and see the front lines, prisons, refugee camps, cities under siege, and sinking ships. To relive days like that, believing you couldn't change the course of events, would unhinge a lot of people pretty quickly. Some might initially spend time trying to change things - to save a comrade, pull off the perfect escape, or warn others of an attack they know is coming later in the day - only to wake up and find their work undone. It would be bad. As for the cause and solution, most would believe it a curse from an angry god and many would try to understand how to atone for some misdeed.   
  
At another time, things would go much, much better. The third and largest-yet group of people from Earth have lately arrived at Menem and reside on the orbital Ambassador Station, with its plentiful and versatile shuttlecraft. Any number of them would happily indulge in a grand tour, landing and/or flying around the planet to visit all corners, and the ship's vast library would keep them from getting bored on the flight down. Many would exhaust said library trying to understand what was happening and end up baffled.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Like much of public infrastructure of Agata-Baliren in the middle City Period, sanitation and health services are seen as sacred endeavors. These services are operated by religious orders and funded significantly by the Crown. Reducing illness and disease, and responding to outbreaks, are religious duties of the highest order. At this early stage, microorganisms have not been observed, but infection, proper sanitation, and certain treatments are well (enough) understood. The bulk of these efforts are put into disease prevention, so the cities are well plumbed, waste water is treated or removed, and outbreaks are quarantined. The workers in all these areas are religious devotees - monks or priests. The physical infrastructure, from hospitals to the sewer networks, are considered holy sites and temples.  </TEXT>

For my reference, there are two primary historical periods of Menem that I'm developing stories for, which I refer to as "these divided lands" and "Gishefa" (or, "the Union").

<TEXT> Humans' FTL capability is based on a jump system that crosses vast distances instantaneously. The problem is that it's enormously energy intensive. So much so that a given ship is capable of two, maybe three, jumps before its fuel is depleted and jump engine burned out. The biggest ships simply carry multiple engines and enormous quantities of fuel. As a result, nobody's zipping around interstellar space. Colonists pick a promising system and jump out there to make a go of it. Exo-planet surveying has gotten quite sharp, so they generally have a sense of what they're getting into.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Fiddha was born *eto Lyria* (second daughter of Lyria) while her grandmother, Aenan do Farand, held the Crown of Agata. As a second daughter, Fiddha was not destined for the Crown, and was trained in diplomacy and command. In peacetime she would have become a trusted advisor to her mother and sister, and likely nieces, who would hold the Crown. When she was a young woman, Agata went to war with the Uajiren Empire as the Empire encroached on neighboring Griana seeking control of the petroleum and coal deposits there. In the war, she became a U-boat commander and led a battle group to multiple victories on the Encircled Sea. Her grandmother died early in the war, and shortly thereafter her mother and sister were killed in the bombing of Parovir, the capital. Before her coronation, the Empire seized the capital and forced the Agata parliament to surrender. Fiddha's transport was captured, and many feared she would face execution at the hands of the Empire. Instead, in a show of a goodwill she was returned to the capital and allowed her coronation, then promptly held in house arrest as Imperial forces occupied the city, blockaded the Sunken Sea, and seized control of key infrastructure throughout Ijeida.  
   
 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;During the next quarter century, the Crown was allowed certain nominal freedoms, always under the watchful eye of imperial governors. Fiddha retained her traditional palace guard, to the Empire's eventual chagrin, though they were not the powerful military unit they once were. The Empire's occupation of Baliren was much more tenuous and carried out by proxy, using the private forces of Teugad Naufair [the Empire's analog to an East India Company], and relying on the compliance of the Counts. Baliren was allowed its own traditional Marshals and Watch, though the command of these units was co-opted somewhat.  
  
 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Pawil Anrison and Praven Terelson served in the Watch - they were trained at Ethenfarr and later rose as officers in the Guard Tower of Parovir, where they began to move in revolutionary circles. Pawil got himself placed with Fiddha's palace guard, declaring to her in a famous clandestine meeting "if I am loyal to my grandmothers, I am loyal to the Crown," to which she replied, "the Crown is dead. You must be loyal to These Lands [Agata and Baliren] and to their sons and daughters." Though she harbored sympathy for the growing republican movement, she knew her escape from Imperial guard would deal a blow to their command in the region, and the Queen's Revolt was plotted. A complicated scheme, relying (perhaps unwisely) on a network of ferryman, cab drivers, dock workers, guards, and loyalist ministers in parliament, the plan was almost thwarted by a last minute roster change, ending in a city-wide pursuit. Fiddha was secreted to safety, first to the tempestuous but politically safe neutral zone in Griana, and then returned north to fight in the revolution.  
  
 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Separated from the Revolt conspirators during the night of the escape, Pawil returned to his loyal Watch in time to flee with several dozen men before Imperial troops seized the Guard Tower. They made for quarries in Highpass as Praven knew a foreman there, but did not know this area had already been seized was now run by Teugad as a prison. As they arrived, they found the prison in a state of revolt, led by Sahrir Anderdaughter, who had been a Workscaptain on the aqueducts before being imprisoned for suspected sedition against the Empire. Pawil and his troops captured escaping Imperial guards outside the prison walls, and together with the Works Commission imprisoned members inside, captured and held the prison for the duration of the Rebellion. 
  
 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;At Highpass, Sahrir, Pawil, and Praven laid the groundwork for their revolution, the plan to hold Ethenfarr and declare a new republic. Here Praven wrote the famous ode, "The Meanweal Builds" referencing an old Baliran term for a communal government. Sahrir left to build a "workers army" among those members of the former Crown Works Commission whom she could free or locate in hiding. With these, now calling themselves Republican Works Commission, and several regiments of Baliren-loyal Marshals, she marched on Ethenfarr, while Pawil and Praven continued to hold High Pass. Under much more humane conditions, the WCers who had remained in the quarry/prison continued cutting stone to ship to Ethenfarr for the planned symbolic raising of the Meeting Hall. Ultimately, they realized they could neither retake the Guard Tower, as necessary to ship this stone along the Traveling River, nor could they move it overland across the mountains north from Highpass, so this aspect of the plan was abandoned. Leaving Praven in command at Highpass, Pawil traveled to Ethenfarr via Balirhearth and his home region of Haarkenhold. Here he encountered childhood friend Tithen Dekketson, who had raised the workers in 'Hearth, and they together moved on Ethenfarr [which I should mention was the traditional political capital of Baliren before most of the region swore fealty to the Crown, and then was occupied by the Empire, so it was an important symbolic site to declare independence]. They reached the ancient island city just as Sahrir's army ejected occupation forces stationed there and Imperial troops closed on it to lay siege.  
  
 nbsp; nbsp; nbsp; nbsp;Inside the city, Pawil and Sahrir made contact with ship captain Fit Maaloren who agreed to use his networks, already accustomed to smuggling goods past occupation forces, to support the rebels. This proved an enormous challenge, and Fit only managed a handful of trips past the besieging forces, but these were essential to the survival of those inside. Leaving behind the plan for Highpass stone (which would have been another powerful symbolic gesture), the soldiers and Works Commission inside Ethenfarr began dismantling the Teugad barracks to build a stone Meeting Hall modeled on traditional Baliran structures. Praven marched his Highpass troops on the siege forces outside the city to try to break the pressure, and entered with the last of Fit's shipments, alongside Fiddha do Lyria [so, the city is on an island in the Traveling River and the siege forces were massed at the northern end where rail lines and bridges entered; smugglers and spies were able to approach the city by crossing the river further south, usually under cover of darkness]. On the site of the rising Meeting Hall, the united leaders declared the Worksite Oath which, following several ideological statements about the functions of the state and the rights of citizens, declared the parliament of Agata in violation of its oaths, dissolved the Crown of Agata and abdicated Fiddha's claim to any authority, renounced the fealty of the counties of Baliren to the Crown, and called for a constitutional convention to establish a republic or republics as such a body saw fit, which were dubbed in Praven's prose "the Republics of Wheat and Water."  
  
*deep breath* Um, so, that's how they came together. The Rebellion progresses from there, as I mentioned in the first comment, but I've already run way long, and you are a champion for sticking with me.

<TEXT> These are my 'rag-tag bunch of misfits' who become revolutionary leaders during the Ijeida Rebellion, ousting imperial occupation and ending the monarchy in Agata. They all play major roles in the Siege of Ethenfarr^1 and the signing of the Worksite Oath^2 , and all are remembered as founding heroes. To avoid going on too long, these are some of their key accomplishments.  
  
**Sahrir Anderdaughter er Balirhearth:** Workscaptain of the Republican Works Commission, a revolutionary front formed from outlawed labor unions, engaging in fortification of rebel positions and sabotage of occupied infrastructure. She led the revolt of Highpass Prison; oversaw the construction of the Meeting Hall in Ethenfarr and the post-war reconstruction of that city and of Balirhearth. She is elected an early representative of the Republics of Wheat and Water after the war.    
  
**Pawil Anrison ir Haarken:** Watch Commander of the Parovir Royal Guard until its dissolution by the occupation governors. He orchestrated the Queen's Revolt, breaking Fiddha do Lyria from house arrest. He held Highpass Prison following Sahrir Anderdaughter's revolt and his exiled troops formed a large part of the besieged revolutionary army at Ethenfarr. He and Fit Maaloren ran smuggling operations to feed their army and later bring workers and supplies to build the Meeting Hall. He is killed in the attempt to push occupation forces out of Parovir.     
  
**Tithen Dekkeson ir Haarken:** Iron worker and member of the Republican Works Commission. He leads several sabotage missions against occupation-held train lines and forts. He became a leader of the re-organized Republican Works Commission and later a republic representative. Despite the Republics' official non-involvement he volunteered to join rebels in the Jirenes Civil War, and is remembered as a revolutionary hero there as well.  
  
**Praven Terelson ir Ethenfarr:** Watch officer under Pawil Anrison, his chief lieutenant in many Rebellion operations including Highpass and Ethenfarr. He wrote the 'wall speeches' delivered by Sahrir Anderdaughter, Haarken, and Fiddha do Lyria during the Siege, and later penned the initial drafts of the Worksite Oath and constitution. For his role in the Oath and his other writings he is often called the Oathwright and First Poet of the Nation.     
  
**Fit Maaloren:** Ship captain and merchant turned smuggler for the rebel-held Ethenfarr.   
  
**Fiddha do Lyria:** Doremenem (queen) of the Crown of Agata under occupation by the Uajiren Empire. Held in house arrest in the royal palace of Parovir and directing a covert resistance. When discovered, she escapes the palace with loyal guards and joins the broader rebellion. Alongside signing the Worksite Oath, she dissolves the authority of the Crown and announces her abdication, then calls her loyal people to oust the occupation and declare for the republics. The growth of rebel sympathizers following her declaration breaks the siege of Ethenfarr, and she joins Pawil Anrison and others to push the occupation out of Parovir. Though the campaign is ultimately successful, she is killed defending a rebel position in the capital.    
  
1: The Siege of Ethenfarr was the definitive campaign of the Ijeida Rebellion in Baliren. Rebel forces and civilians held the walled city against occupation troops for six months. During the siege, soldiers and workers built the simple stone Meeting Hall and signed the Worksite Oath, declaring the independence of Baliren from Agata and Uajiren and establishing the first of the Republics of Wheat and Water.  

2: The Worksite Oath is a revolutionary declaration claiming the independence of Baliren and Agata from the occupying Uajiren Empire, dissolving Baliren's loyalty to the Crown of Agata and establishing the Republics of Wheat and Water. It is followed by the Ethenfarr Constitution, drafted in a convention after the Rebellion and the fall of the Empire in the Jirenes Civil War.

<TEXT> Following the protracted and exhausting contact wars, the seven most powerful species of the Perseus Arm established the Galactic Peace Organization (GPO) to help stabilize relations, arbitrate disputes, and oversee trade. No species was satisfied with the headquarters of such an organization being located in any other's space, so an unsettled planet in an unclaimed system was selected for the purpose. Despite a number of proposed alternatives, the planet came to be known by its early de-facto name of Embassy. Its territories were divided as equitably as possible among the member species for use and establishment of a colonial presence on Embassy, while an administrative capital was founded in a neutral territory. Before settling, the GPO species jointly fought the grandiosely named Unification War to reduce the population of some of the planet's more dangerous megafauna - a campaign credited with cementing the cohesion of the GPO going forward.  
  
In the following decades, Embassy's population boomed as it became a hub of galactic trade and diplomacy and much of its surface was settled in sprawling mega-cities, climbing to a population of some 11 billion by its centennial celebration. The central laws of the planet govern how the various races are to share resource rights - though access to any number of systems' abundant asteroids, etc. reduce any potential strain over mineral extraction. Since Embassy's founding, multiple additional species have been encountered and (sometimes begrudgingly) admitted to the GPO, and tensions have arisen over the allotment of planetary territory only to the seven founding species. "Younger" species tend to live relative poverty in the mega-cities, with less local or galactic representation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In antiquity, Griana was an extensive confederation of states united under the Crown of Griana. Beginning with the Wars of the Crowns fought with Agata, the Crown of Griana dissolved and its constituents developed as independent kingdoms and city states, and began a long of history successive occupations, annexations, and revolutions. Several northern Griana states were incorporated into the Crown of Agata, while others acceded to personal union under Agata's queen. Such relations were unstable and prone to generational shifting, though the south of the region enjoyed a long period of independence and amicable trade relations. In the late city period, long-known but little-utilized petroleum deposits in the south provided a moment of economic boom for these modernizing city states. Facing increasing industrial demand, the Uajiren Empire soon came knocking, though its initially generous trade deals were quickly eclipsed by aggression, invasion or coups. Uncomfortable with the Empire's growing influence in the region, Agata began stationing troops in allied Griana states and pressuring neutral states to render aid. Increasing tension led the two powers into fighting the First Intercontinental War, primarily fought over continually shifting borderlines in Griana. The War ended with a nominal truce, establishing new borders and a neutral zone between Agata-occupied and Empire-occupied portions of Griana. This immediately proved unsustainable, and grew into the half-century of bitter conflict known as the Crucible - which saw almost continual revolution, coup attempts, and border skirmishes. The unsatisfying armistice eventually led the two great powers into fighting the Second Intercontinental War, this time fought in the capitals of Baliren and Agata, or in devastating naval confrontations, with beleaguered Griana spared the brunt of the conflict. The war concluded with the collapse of both historical powers, leaving Griana an independent region but all continuity of the former states long-since shattered. Several faltering attempts to unify the region or establish new states have proven short lived.

<TEXT> Here's what I wanted to see happen with the tropey characters: they come out of stasis as amnesiacs with few clues to their former identities, only a few items and apparent skills. So they cling to these scraps and cobble together some meaning - they seem to have cultural awareness, so they identify with the tropes they recognize. As they learn who they really were, they complicate these identities and break away from the cliches. That's what I would like to have seen - and they do get started on that, some characters better than others. Four is stuck in the Swordy Asian Guy, which is hard to forgive; but I like where they take One and Six. I hope season two breaks more of the cliches and finds its own voice; I'd liked the show well enough by the end to at least give it a try.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Gashifa ("Union City") is a modern planned city established to serve as the seat of Gishefa ("the Union"), Menem's United Nations. It was constructed around the ruins of one of Sovdu's ancient "invisible cities", which now forms a massive central park, and mimics its structure - with five major roads radiating in a semi circle from the administrative headquarters. Sovdu was chosen as the site for this capital because of the significance of its ancient cities' confederated governance, and for the region's neutrality in the recently-ended Intercontinental Wars.  
  
Gashifa's five grand avenues divide the city into six primary wards, subdivided by four concentric canals into twenty-four neighborhoods referred to as villages. Each village is intended to be multi-use and semi-autonomous, providing residence, schools, gardens, shops/dispensaries, offices and light industry. The city developed rapidly following the Wars, and saw initial waves of immigration from peoples displaced during the conflicts. Members of ethnic and national groups tended to gravitate together, and the villages retain distinctive cultural identities from this period, especially those nearer to the center which were settled first. The outer villages, planned from the initial construction of the city, were inhabited over time as the population grew. The six-ward plan was expanded to include a seventh and eighth, though these did not follow the original radial design of the city. 
  
The grand metropolises of before the Wars were devastated and while their historical centers were rebuilt and they have once again flourished, they remain reduced in size. At its peak, Gashifa has a population of 5 million, with an additional 4 million living in the greater metropolitan area, officially residing within Sovdu. 
  
Relations within Gashifa have tended to be peaceful, though it was a site of some of the major unrest of the Shattered Summer that threatened world peace and the future of the Union. It is operated as an independent city state, but it has had recurring jurisdictional and administrative disputes with the Union itself and territorial disputes with the surrounding regions of Sovdu into which it has expanded.  
  
At the time of contact with Earth, Gashifa takes on a new significance as the primary headquarters of visiting Terrans. It serves as the site of the second Terran embassy (after the orbital Ambassador Station was grounded on the moon), and later as the Menem headquarters of the cooperative exploration endeavors of the two planets. As more Terrans settle, and folk of Terran heritage are born on Menem, Gashifa is by far the city with the greatest alien population.

<TEXT> The Queen's Rebellion, part of the broader Ijeida Rebellion, itself a regional expression of the ongoing Intercontinental Wars, is frequently regarded as a miracle. Following Agata's defeat in the First Intercontinental War, under occupation by the Uajiren Empire, Queen Fiddha do Lyria was kept in house arrest in the royal palace. The Empire recognized they could not command if they killed the Queen or even removed her from the ancient residence, but still stripped her of all official power and kept her under close watch. One branch of the often chaotic and many-factioned resistance believed that releasing her would strike a blow to the occupation government and bolster the morale of the people. In a carefully coordinated campaign lasting over a year, they placed undercover loyalists in the occupation police guarding the palace and orchestrated an elaborate escape route relying on cab drivers, sewer workers, and dock hands to remove her from the capital. A last minute shift change threw the scheme off balance but the conspirators desperately went ahead with the plan. Instead of the smooth operation imagined, the Queen and her supporters narrowly dodged a city wide pursuit and several conspirators and guards were killed. Although it did not go according to plan, the Queen's later emergence, albeit in exile, was all the more embarrassing to the occupying Empire for its very public pursuit and failure. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The weapons ban is likely to remain in place, if largely because warfare in space doesn't seem particularly viable, as others have discussed. The treaty will, however, need some revision and clarification when it comes to states and corporations exploiting "the moon and other celestial bodies" for resources and profit. At present, the treaty isn't very clear on things like asteroid mineral rights or altering the surface of Mars with habitats. If and when we start doing those things, the language of the treaty will need to be amended. That could be a contentious process, but amending it seems more likely than scrapping it.

<TEXT> The first period of history that I developed was contact between Earth and the planet that became Menem. I originally had Menem (then called Gashifa) under a unified global government at the time of contact, whose destabilization would be widely blamed on Earth. But as I filled in various periods of early history, such a global union seemed less and less likely.  
  
**The Ijeida Rebellion:** a chaotic, multi-faction conflict which won Baliren and Agata freedom from Uajiren occupation (established during the First Intercontinental War), and ended the monarchy in Agata, creating the first of a series of republican governments.  
  
**The Uajiren Civil War:** Following defeat in Ijeida (the above Rebellion), and a failed attempt to recapture Agata and impose order in Griana (the Second Intercontinental War), a series of coups toppled the Uajiren Empire. When the euphemistically named Transitional Council proved equally tyrannical, it too was overthrown by a revolution with substantial foreign aid and replaced with a provisional democratic constitution.  
  
So instead of a global union, Earth encounters a set of not-quite-warring states with this complicated history of conflict, kept somewhat restrained by the influence of a United Nations-like body. Although still blamed on Earth, the destabilization of this arrangement is more clearly rooted in the planet's own history.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Several cites of Agata in central Ijeida are built on and around massive sea cliffs. They tend to be divided into three sectors - the generally wealthy section on top of the cliffs, the poorer, working class segment built/carved on the face of the cliff, and the harbor at sea level below.  
  
The few large cities there are in Qareya, eastern Tevra, are built within canyons on artificial terraces carved from the rock, and are millennia old. They make use of cisterns constructed at the top to produce pressure for plumbed water systems throughout the city. Little else is built on the tops of the canyons, in the direct sunlight. Natural separations and barriers created by local geography tend to influence how the cities are subdivided - e.g. the North and South Wall, or East and West Fork.  
  
Sovdu, is western Tevra, is famous for its "invisible cities" (a term coined by visitors from Agata accustomed to their prominent, cliff-top cities). These are sprawling complexes of small villages of 10 or so families each, connected by networks of roads and surrounded by managed forest and farmland. The whole is encircled by denser, wild woods, which provide a level of defense. The various villages manage their many of their own affairs but an elder council meets semi-regularly to address matters of city-wide import such as drought or flood, founding new villages or moving existing ones, and answering outside threats. Culturally, the villagers identify as members of the larger community and each village draws its name from the larger city.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm running a zombie apocalypse game and we're building the post-apoc world a little bit like this. We started several months in, at a point where the characters all came together, but they've been surviving separately the whole time - so what were they up to? Rather than have everyone track their whole history, whenever something comes up I have them roll off to answer questions like - have any of you been here before, do any of you know this person, did any of you come through Georgia? Then they fill in the blanks based on what we know of their characters and the world so far. We haven't based it on knowledge skills or bothered with success or failure - just roll off between the players with circumstance bonuses (we know this guy's been on the road, so he's more likely to have [blah]).  
   
This has worked really well in this kind of setting - where the world's a chaotic mess and we can kind of build the setting up from scratch. To have a more consistent feel in a more standard D D world, it might be harder. I've been in groups where we used knowledge checks to see if the character has knowledge we know the player has - this worked well in a Game of Thrones game and some Forgotten Realms campaigns, with lots of established lore everyone was familiar with: "Roll to see what Throngar knows about the Red Wizards." "Roll to see what Tywill knows about the Red Wedding." That's not collaborative worldbuilding, but does avoid the problem of "roll to see how much of this fact sheet the DM will read to you."  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I use a mix of new terms and Earthisms. I'm not really sure where the line is, but it has to do with whether I feel something is immersion breaking. For the most part, I assume that if I've conceded to writing in English about non-English speaking worlds, whatever is the standard English term is just fine. More proper-noun sorts of things I do tend to change, though. I usually come up with a more generic term rather than trying to substitute an in-universe myth or discoverer which would require a distracting worldbuilding aside. So, in your examples I might say "standard mechanics" instead of Newtonian, and I have  described L4 and L5 objects as having "leading orbits" and "trailing orbits", but I do just say terraforming.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are two sorts of magic in Banbha: small magic and artifice. Well, arguably there is a third, but the Great Magic is the exclusive domain of the Gods (and was once that of the faeries as well). Both are able to imbue objects with magic.  
  
Small magic consists of the blessing, warding, divination, prayer and other rituals of common folk and priests. Many ritual objects are used in performing small magic, and these can become imbued with special significance and greater power. Hearths, where many home rituals are performed over generations, as especially powerful places. Images of the Gods become dedicated seats of their presence. This kind of power is generally passive - it assists in performing ritual like a familiar tool. Because of their connection to the divine, these objects are resistant to the manipulations of Artifice (more on that below).  
  
Artifice is the new magic developed by the faeries when the Gods banished them and denied them the Great Magic of creation. It is the result of manipulating the strange relationships between the natural world and their Other Realm, and they often use it to make objects of strange power, either for their own gain over one another or to fool and entrap mortal humans to do their bidding (often unawares). These are objects such as mirrors that allow looking into another space; doors that lead to many places; clocks that tell time what to do - *Labyrinth*-y, Goblin King sort of magic. Mundane objects - especially keys and teapots, for some reason - can also be influenced by artifice through association, especially if a faerie handles them or takes them to the Other Realm. The most common such effect is to spontaneously move - that is, cease to be in one place and suddenly always have been in another place. Long use of ritual objects for small magic prevents faeries from being able to manipulate them and keeps them from picking up weird properties of artifice.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the traditional religion of Tevra, His Holiness refers exclusively to Sage Seloet, whose writings are considered the foundation of the modern faith. He wrote and studied extensively, and his complete works fill many volumes. They are considered holy writings, but also the subject of much study and debate. So, while they are not considered scripture per se (at least, they are not taken to be infallible) they are the most widely read texts on the continent for the last three thousand years. Seloet codified many related but disparate traditions about the Eight Most High, their relationships, and their relationship to humanity, the natural world, and the cosmos. His texts explore many subjects and form the basis of millennia of scholarship in mathematics, astronomy, biology, ethics, and other fields. He is considered to have been a perfect scholar beyond measure or equal, and no other since, though they have borne the title of Sage, has ever been styled His Holiness. The continued study of his works and their use as the basis of literacy in Tevra have also happened to have a profound conservative effect on language.  
  
Her Holiness is a title often associated with the High Priestess of the Temple of the Mountains, the highest spiritual leader in Jirenes. Traditionally a hereditary role, the Priestess was in the most ancient times the wife of the High King. This relation became a symbolic coupling long ago, though the consort of the Priestess (and father of her daughters, at least generally) is a position of great prestige, often surrounded by intrigues, and frequently drawn from the royal line or other nobility. Her Holiness is the embodiment of the Great Goddess on earth. It is through her that the divine right of the High Kings derives, and without her sanction and blessing, they lose all right to rule. Thus, her political power is great. When Katlisa Uamfenisa sought to overthrow the High Kingdom and establish his empire, he murdered the then-heirless High Priestess with hopes of placing his own successor in the Temple, one who would officially sanction his rule. This he did, but thereby created a schism in the faith and few outside his governing circles ever accepted his replacement Priestess. The people called her and her descendants, who continued to sanction the rule of the Uamfenisa dynasty, High Imposter. The rightful heir, identified by ancient custom set in place for determining the successor of a Priestess without daughter, was secreted away to Qareya where she and her own line remained in exile for the two centuries of the empire's reign, a figure of defiance and resistance. The civil war that ended the empire rallied under the name of Iuliea XI and returned her as rightful Priestess to the Temple in triumph. Her Holiness presided over the transition to democratic government, and it is officially by her sanction, and that of her daughters, that the republics of Jirenes draw their authority. Her Holiness no longer directly supports or opposes any leaders or representatives, giving Her blessing to a government of the people, though she remains an important political figure, a champion of justice and human rights. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Many folk on Menem would name Emperor Katlisa Uamfenisa as the worst. In terms of governance, however, he was highly effective and led his empire to a strong economy and a string of celebrated military victories, albeit with incredible brutality and numerous summary executions of dissidents.  
  
For least effective governments, you should look to any of the myriad short-lived powers that emerged and failed during the Crucible of Griana. In this half-century of turmoil, several dozen attempted governments claimed control of various portions of the region. Generally rife with cronyism, none lasted more than three years and most left their territory worse off than they found it.  
  
Others might offer Gishefa Nera ('the First Union'), Menem's first attempt at a global government, as a candidate for the worst. Though it remained in place for more than a century, its sweeping reforms and grand scheme of centralization were frequently ill-managed at best or fraught with malfeasance at worst. It is celebrated for championing justice and for ensuring the rights of many formerly marginalized groups, but its early policies contributed to multiple dire famines. Its collapse nearly sparked an interstellar war.

<TEXT> Prophecy means one of two things in Menem: propaganda or doomsaying. In the poetic sagas of Baliren's mythical heroes, much time is devoted to the future return of the legendary Ice Kings and their coming war of reconquest. This is generally taken by responsible scholarship to be a mythologized account of the advance of the great glaciers that line the region's northern border - evidence of whose periodic movements was apparent to the ancient bards. Nevertheless, the "prophecy" of the Ice Kings' return has been utilized to mobilize support and legitimize someone's power in three separate wars (neglecting that the saga's also tell of their future defeat, which has also proven true in each case).  
  
In Tevra, there is a great tradition of 'prophets' who speak out against the social ills of their day, usually warning of a coming collapse or great war if the people do not repent and change their ways. Their rhetoric is usually couched in terms of faith and frequently claimed as divinely inspired. Several of them throughout history proved to be rather accurate in the predictions of future decline - not because of precognition but because they were observant students of society and understood what was likely to happen if some course of events was not diverted.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> The 14th century YC has probably undergone the most change. I'm continually adding and refining things and moving stuff around to all parts of the world, but that century (especially its politics and wars) have changed a whole lot. It's ultimately what I've spent the most time developing, but it isn't where I started. I began with a period about two hundred years later, with vague references to an early period of global warfare, without much detail. As I worked back to it, I fleshed out what was going on - but then I added an entire continent to the world (already fleshed out but originally its own world), and had to work it into that history. Then I overhauled the history and politics of that continent, significantly altering its role in the Great Wars. Then I set most of what I had aside and began working forward from a much earlier point in history, which again drastically altered the context. There's a still a period of substantial warfare in the 14th century, but it pretty much looks nothing like it did to start.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Within the villages of Baliren, same- and other-sex marriages are both quite common (as is divorce). Marriage in general is not viewed as a lifelong commitment, but a commitment over a shorter period to live and work together, especially to raise children. Couples planning to rear children (their own or adopted, which is fairly frequent) are more likely to wed and form separate households; whereas others will cohabit in communal living quarters. Other-sex marriage is somewhat more common among the nobility, but inheritance is frequently reckoned through adoption or mentor relationships rather than strictly passed from parent to child, so there is no emphasis on bearing heirs within sanctioned marriage.    
  
In Agata, among the nobility, all marriages are between a man and a woman and expected to produce children to carry on the family lines. However, it is generally accepted that both men and women will take additional lovers, both men and women, and even include these others as members of their households - but such relationships are not treated as marriages. Among the lower classes, officially recognized marriage per se is not common, but same- and other-sex couples and multi-partner relationships are all accepted. </TEXT>

Some nations have had advantages in steel, or bows, or cannons, but victory more often than not has gone to who had the fastest, or biggest, or best-reinforced transport (with the essential attribute varying over time). For much of history these were warships of various sorts - from triremes to destroyers - eventually augmented by aircraft and submarines. The latter two proved initially devastating because the powers that wielded them were the first to develop them (Uajiren for attack planes; Menem for submarines) and their enemies had little defense against them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Such an event occurred during a succession crisis in ancient Agata, and spurred rival claimants to the throne into fighting a civil war. The star was named Paromar Docethona ("the New Sun, Daughter of Heaven"), and worshiped as a goddess. Its emergence corresponded with the birth of a new heir in one noble line claiming the Crown, and was taken as divine sanction of her right to rule. She was hailed as Doremara ("Sister of the Suns") to rival the traditional title of queen, Doremenem ("Sister of the Seas"). Her clan rejected the rule of the queen who took up the crown and raised an army in her name to place her on the throne. They captured and held several cities, which her mother ruled as regent, until the light of the New Star faded and popular support for their cause waned. The rebel clan was exiled. Paromar Docethona retains a shrine in the Temple of the Unnumbered where is prayed to as a patron of desperate cases and lost causes.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Change over time was essentially the starting premise when I began work on Menem. I established several distinct time periods in order to explore how it would get from one to another. A central example is the shifting relationship between the regions of Baliren and Agata. Baliren was once an isolated region, called by many the Great Walled Kingdom, known to outsiders but separated by high mountains, deep valleys, and superstitions about crossing open ocean. Still, its trade goods found their way out and it was renowned for its stone, iron, and the skill of its smiths. Agata came to view it as the last frontier of their expanding trade networks and built many great works to bring the whole continent under their influence: bridges to span valleys, roads to cross mountains, aqueducts to water the dry cliffside ports of the Sunken Sea. Some in Baliren called it an invasion - but it came with no armies, only silk and coin and marriage. The gods of Baliren found worship in Agata, and Agata's Queen found fealty in Baliren. The High Kings faded, and merchant-nobles ascended. Baliren steel armed Agata's navies. Later, with its guns, Baliren fought a war for independence, and later still stood beside Agata to fight off invasion.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The capital of Agata, Parovir ("New City" in the Taragat language), replaced the ancient capital at Ecliya ("Grey Wall"). Many still regard the ancient city as the spiritual heart of the nation. When the great bridge and aqueduct called Mithrenna ("River Bearer") was built to connect Baliren to the Sunken Sea (and so Agata to the wealth of Baliren), Parovir was built to be its anchor and to serve as a port for the new influx of trade. The city is in two parts: a wealthy district atop the great cliffs of the Seawall, into which the waters of Mithrenna flow via canals; and the trade district and slums situated down the cliff face and around of the artificial harbor carved out to serve the city. The upper district is home to palaces and gardens, the homes of wealthy merchants and nobles, prominent craftsmen and artists; and of course the Queen of Agata, called Doremenem ("Sister of the Seas"). Here are also the great temples, including the sprawling complex of the Temple of the Unnumbered said to house a shrine to every god ever worshiped across the continent. The lower district is situated both on the face of the Seawall and in caverns carved out behind it; it is also faced with the enormous cranes and systems of locks that enable hauling of cargo up and down the wall - a system mastered by the builders of Agata in a half dozen cities before they built Parovir.  
  
Parovir's initial construction consisted of a workers' encampment for those building Mithrenna. This settlement split into the "wall city", comprising those worker digging the harbor and quarrying the stone of the wall that would face the aqueduct; and the "walking city" comprising those workers extending the great project across the valley north of the city. When construction was completed, it served also as a vital garrison to defend the fledgling port from Balirans suspicious of the arrival of Agatters at their formerly closed borders. The city thrived as a port for nearly a hundred years before it became the new capital of the nation, when Doremenem Erela do Fiddhet built her royal palace at the heart of the upper district.  
  
The construction of Parovir is a pivotal event in the history of Agata, marking the expansion of its already vast trade networks into Baliren, once called the Great Walled Kingdom. It was met with both suspicion and praise, right down through the centuries. Baliren would come to Agata's defense in the Great Wars; but so too the Pretenders accused Agata of invasion and destruction of the culture, leading a war to expel them 900 years after the city was raised. For all this influence, the thousand years after the construction of Parovir are widely referred to as the City Period.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  There is great richness in exploring early human life, if well done. Picasso said, "After [the cave art at] Altamira everything is decadence."   

The trouble I see with such a setting is primarily in how little direct evidence we have about what Paleolithic life was actually like. There is a problem of tone, in that any amount of either Flintstones-style modern sensibility. or over simplified, club swinging, "ugh" speech, will come across as comical. We really don't know what language and culture were like in such a period, and it's easy to over simplify them or to make them feel too modern. Even if you do it well, people are still likely to deride the effort. Take the intro to *2001* - especially the novel, over the film. I think Clarke handles early humans brilliantly, but people still whinge about the "monkeys". So I think  there's a fine line between simple and clear, and dumbed down artificially, which is tricky, but achievable.  
  
As others have said, careful research is probably key. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I doodled a lot of starships when I was in elementary school - which usually had a consistent set of features. So, maybe that counts. My first real in depth world I developed early in high school (er, 20 years ago). It was a fantasy setting with elf-analogs and orc-analogs and dragons and a dark lord in his black tower, also gryphons and immortal shape-shifting angels. Also, it was accidentally a torus because I didn't understand maps or geometry, and when I drew the map I wrapped it around on four sides. It did feature my first conlang, of which I'm still pretty proud. Some of the setting and story has survived in my current world as the mythology of a region named for that first worldbuild. </TEXT>

Antibiotics are widely used and vaccines exist for many diseases which have reduced mortality significantly. That is to say, infectious disease is not a major cause of death anymore. Cancer and genetic disorders remain poorly understood and represent the most lethal diseases. At present, widespread warfare pertaining to the Agata-Uajiren conflict is another significant cause of death.

<TEXT> Some thoughts and questions to think about:  
  
Does the soul-stuff need to be refined separately, or is it part of utilizing coal and oil (just like IRL, but with extra bang)?  
  
I think it would be most interesting if magic is tied to the industrial aspect more than just unlocked by souls in the fuel. So, it can make more fantastic machines but doesn't just make somebody a wizard. A 'spell' is a design for a machine with that capability and a 'wizard' is the engineer who makes it work. You can sling fireballs, but you need a soul engine to do it. That gives it a distinctive feel and imposes limits you can work within to find cool outcomes.  
  
Maybe for the most part you need machines to harness the magical energy (just like the chemical energy) locked up in the fuels. But what about extensive exposure? What if coal miners don't just get black lungs, they end up breathing fire? Makes the labor movement much more, um, explosive.   
  
Also, everything u/vonadler said. That's good stuff.

<TEXT> Presumably the elevator cable's airspace would be tightly restricted, so there shouldn't be much problem with the city being near to the cruising altitude of an airliner - but collision should be considered as a threat, even as an unlikely one. This is cyberpunk, after all, where we can't assume effective regulation. 40k feet is also still fairly atmospheric so shit like lightning and wind need to be considered as potential hazards.  
  
Socially speaking, because the altitude means this city is likely a waystation to the much, much higher anchor station, the population may be variable and transient - great for trafficking in whoknowswhat and staying off the radar. Consider a significant security/police presence if highly regulated (probable, for keeping the place operational), or significant gang activity if not (fun, for keeping the place grimdark). </TEXT>

<TEXT>  but it actually orbited the star in the same time the planet did?

Yes, this is what would have to be happening, as I understand. Such an orbit is not probably stable under regular orbital mechanics - the two objects would a) smash into each other, b) end up as a binary system orbiting each other, or c) end up as a planet-with-moon, depending on their sizes, the particular orbits, and a whole bunch of other factors. But I think sorting out the mechanics is important and cool, even if you say "I really like the idea and I want it to work" and make it work with magic - now you have a whole lot of statements about what magic can do in your world.

Light from the star striking the moon ~~from a particular angle~~ while it's in a particular location causes folk on the planet to see some portion of the illuminated side. To permanently appear as a crescent, the moon would always have to be in the same place relative to the planet and star - that is, orbiting with the planet *but not orbiting the planet*. According to ordinary mechanics, this wouldn't be possible. But messed up seasons due to magic, you say? So messed up, stuck-in-place moon (due to magic) sounds fine. </TEXT>

In the middle City Period, the Knightly Order of Baliren was a highly formalized class within the minor nobility. Their arms and armor were elaborately decorated with local and nationalist motifs. This fine example of the ceremonial long-arm includes a representation of the Council Tower at Ethenfarr on the cudgel end, signifying the strength of law and the knight's loyalty to the Counts. The detail on the long curved blade depicts the Breath of the North, the great god of the Ice Kings, whose Marching Kingdom - a mythical account of the last advance of the glaciers - conquered Baliren in ancient times.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Ring of Baliren is such a region in many ways.  
 rugged area  
  
The Ring is composed of several mountain ranges that surround the region of Baliren and the high plateaus within/beyond them. By some reckonings it also includes the coastal region beyond the western mountains, whose rocky shoreline, heavy rains and dense forests, coupled with the perception of the Outer Ocean as treacherous or inaccessible, render it particularly remote.  
  
 Difficult or time-consuming to access  
   
As above. The mountains and coastal regions of northern Ijeida were perceived as alien and inaccessible, as much as the terrain actually made them difficult to reach. The old networks of roads and canals that crisscross Baliren, and the later rail lines connecting it over the southern mountain passes to Agata, were never extended north, east, or west. Considering the great feats of engineering it took to initially connect Baliren and Agata, such endeavors were not repeated into the rest if the continent.  
  
 less government presence  
  
The Ring was once incorporated into the old governance systems of pre-Viaduct^1 Baliren, based on communal settlements administered by counts who met semi-regularly in council. Following contact, these mountain counts grew suspicious of Agatter influence and tended to join their counterparts less frequently. Settlements in turn grew disinterested in broader administration and the practice of appointing counts fell away in the Ring. With the latter-day development of Baliren and Agata into nation-states, the Ring remained apart. Officially incorporated into the Meanweal and later the Ijeida Union, most governments in Baliren extended invitations to Ringfolk and accepted their refusal.  
  
 Populated by a minority    
  
Most of the Ringfolk are native to Baliren and its surrounding lands, and were once regarded as kin by the valley folk. Post-Viaduct, and later still post global industrialization, these native Balirens are rendered a minority due to ethnic integration among other populations.  
  
 History of oppression, etc.  
  
The regions of High Pass and Overmountain in southern Baliren, in the mountainous border with Agata, have long been disputed territory - usually left alone for their relatively low utility to the lowland nations, though they represent some of the most important production and agriculture of the Ring. Successive revolutions and rebellions in the modern era saw dissidents and their hunters flee into these regions, and Ringfolk of the area pressed into service either as fighters or laborers. The bloody War of the Pretenders is frequently blamed on the Ring, due to its perpetrators claims of long northern bloodlines and relations to mountain kings of old - which has pressed many in the far northern highlands to reject outside contacts the more strenuously (quite contrary to the unification war the Pretenders tried to link them to).  
  
 lifestyle may be considered "primitive"  
  
Folk in the Ring have maintained the communal settlements that were once common around Baliren but abandoned for larger cities and growing industry. Outsiders either view them as backwards, or romanticize their commitment to a "dying way of life", sometimes traveling in the region to seek their own roots. Though they survived generations separated in this way, growing imposition of modern market systems and the protracted territorial conflicts of the Great War have left the Ring economically depressed.  
  
1: The Viaduct (called Mithrenna ("river bearer") in Taragat) was a massive engineering project to connect Baliren and Agata to open trade. It is a bridge and navigable aqueduct extending the Traveling River beyond its natural falls to the Agatter capital of Parovir on the Sunken Sea. Its construction marks a major shift in the economic and cultural development of the continent.

We don't establish a new galactic order, we don't save the universe from a big bad, we don't miraculously find our way into galactic political power within a matter of decades.

<TEXT> The old knightly order of Baliren wore simple armor which over time became increasingly ornate plate and mail, employed in increasingly formalized duels and small-scale field engagements. For formal events they wore the colors of their own line combined with those of their Lords, decorated with medals of the complex battle heraldry denoting their victories. For pageantry and parade they carried an ornate halberd.  
  
This class gave way to a police force and militia known as the Marshals, which in turn developed into Baliren's standing army following the War of the Pretenders. This force wore long woolen coats, usually grey or green, and carried rifles. Both coat and rifle had formal versions: the coat with polished buttons and embroidery or braids; and the rifle with a long, elaborate bayonet modeled on the traditional halberd.  
  
Agata's military power was always in its navy. Sailors and officers alike wore light and flexible clothing appropriate to warm seas. At home, officers wore fanciful, elaborate dress wear befitting their noble lineages. Called the "silk and silver", the sailors' relatively simple dress uniform was no less exquisite, befitting the honor of defending the nation.

[Real ones looked like this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_hammer), not the comically huge boulders-on-sticks you see in lots of RPGs, so you could swing them fast and deliver a lot of force to a small area for puncturing metal, and they could be long so you could keep your distance or attack someone on horseback.

There are definitely edible seaweeds, which could be gathered wild or cultivated using a technique like putting ropes in the water to guide its growth and ease harvesting. Coral is not so edible, but a reef is an excellent location for gathering fish, molluscs and other goodies. They could employ fences or nets to keep big predators out of the areas the want to cultivate. For the river folk (around fresh water) there are fruits and tubers that do well in wetland environments, so they could cultivate these as well.   
  
I'd love to see some manatee herding in action - they are called seacows after all! People have certainly trained seals, so it seems *plausible* you could domesticate them as "sheepdogs" (even if it's not likely - it turns out pretty few animals can be successfully domesticated).  </TEXT>

If you give them too much early on (like a complete world map), it's harder to move things around later. Give 'em a map of the Shire with arrows pointing out that say "To Gondor", etc., not the whole map of Middle Earth.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Inkarnate is great tool for showing a map to players. It's quick to learn and simple to use; you can throw together a polished-enough map after playing around for a little while.  
  
It is not a great general worldbuilding tool, though. For one, r/worldbuilding doesn't particularly like to see Inkarnate maps (or just got tired of them). It's harder to modify small details of a map once you've put it together. It doesn't have layers - or even a save-as function (gah!) - to modify or add information without changing everything. And because it's quick and simple, it's also fairly limited in scale, whereas if you have more time to learn a tool like GIMP or Photoshop you can make something as big and as detailed as you like.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a general writing exercise I got from a creative writing class, but I have found it very useful for worldbuilding: assume the voice of a character and describe a room. You might even start it without any fiction and describe your own living room from your own perspective, but then imagine how that description would change as you flesh out a different world. Describe your room in wartime; on a space station; as a dwarf... This makes for a very bottom-up approach, starting with something visceral or intimate like a home and building outward only as much as you need to describe that immediate space. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In Baliren there is a long oral tradition of songs and poems concerning the Ice Kings. In their earliest forms, there are mythical accounts of ancient kings and heroes fighting wars to unify the region. These are in part a mythological account of the advance and retreat of glaciers in the last ice age, equating them with the chieftains and warriors of the earliest-remembered times. Later, images of the Ice Kings were used to glorify historical kings and heroes and to create a nationalist sense of dynastic continuity. This was popular during the time when Agata was establishing trade and intermarrying with Baliren nobility, which some viewed as an invasion. Later still, when a group of "purist" Baliren lords fought a nationalist war to eject southern invaders (many of whom had a thousand years of northern heritage), their supporters equated these lords with the Ice Kings in song. As their war failed, the came to be called the Ice Pretenders, and were equated with the retreat of the ancient ice rather than its advance. This began a tradition of competing Ice Kings-themed songs in support of/satirizing various political causes.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, history is not wars alone, and wars are not spontaneous events free of context. Start by asking yourself some questions about the world: Where do your characters live? Under what sorts of governments? Practicing what sorts of religion? Are peasant revolts likely (and would the peasants consider them pointless)? What are the neighboring nations like? I've found that wars begin to suggest themselves when you begin to fill in the world map (even a conceptual map without drawing it).

<TEXT> The standard calendar of Agata, used as the standard calendar globally for much of Menem's late modern period, dates from the foundation of the new Agata capital at Parovir (which means, creatively enough, "the new city"). More specifically, it dates from the laying of the cornerstone of the royal palace, some fifteen years after the actual establishment of the city as a workers encampment. The calendar itself was only standardized about forty years after the palace was built. This period of history is widely referred to as the City Period, because of this calendar and its origins.  
  
A later calendar called the Union calendar was created some 1800 years after the creation of the City calendar, after the establishment of Gisehfa ("the union"), Menem's version of the United Nations.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mithrenna ("river bearer") is the great wonder of Menem's antiquity, a bridge and aqueduct that spans the Cashat Valley - 16 kilometers in length and 90 meters in average height, with a maximum height of 200 meters above the valley floor. It diverts the flow of the Traveling River from its natural falls at World's End (the traditional name for the falls in Baliren, where it was regarded as the edge of the world) to the clifftop city of Parovir across the valley. The reinforced concrete structure is faced in marble, the careful quarrying of which created the canals and reservoirs into which the river flows to serve the city. The first Terran architect to examine Mithrenna called it "The great masterwork. We crossed ten light years from Earth to be humbled by your ancients."  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The real game-changer would have to be alien contact, which dramatically shook the worldview of most Menem-folk and brought them into a nascent galactic community. But understanding their reactions to it begins with:  
  
The Intercontinental War, or Great War, was a half-century of intense conflict and warfare fought across the whole of Menem. [yes, this mirrors the World Wars and some of the Cold War] This period is sometimes subdivided into the separate conflicts of the First Ijeida-Jirenes War, the Ijeida Rebellion, the Crucible of Griana, the second Ijeida-Jirenes War, and the Jirenes Civil War. Conflict began as a clash over imperialist expansion between Agata and the Uajiren Empire after which the Empire occupied much of Ijeida. This gave rise to insurgencies, independence movements, and republican revolutions seeking to overthrow the imperial powers across both continents.  
  
These conflicts are the defining events of the modern period and their fallout continues to shape the course of history for centuries after. They mark a drastic change in the geopolitical order, with the decline of nations that had ruled for nearly a thousand years and the end of the superpowers. Pan-continental federal republics emerged from these conflicts, and quickly fractured into regional federations with long-simmering tensions. This established the state of political relations at the time of contact with Earth and Renii and laid the groundwork for the second global war, a proliferation of factional conflicts fought in hundreds of places, which broke out in the wake of alien contact (and briefly threatened to become an interstellar war).      
  
[This is also the period that dominates most of my r/worldbuilding responses...This one may conflict with (and supersede) versions I've posted elsewhere, since I'm refining it as a I work along. Prompts like this are always super helpful!]

<TEXT> Locally, you are walking or riding a horse on largely dirt roads, with some stone pavement in select areas. Larger highways you might take to make your way to the big cities, perhaps for festival season, are generally paved in stone, and are later replaced by railroads. The rail networks become quite extensive, and are never eclipsed by automobiles quite like they have been on Earth. For much of Menem's history, you'll rely on sailing ships to reach the other continents; followed by an age of powerful steam ships powered by coal and petroleum, with brief nuclear flirtation. Menem's fledgling (chemical rocket) orbital flight endeavor is eclipsed by NAFAL ships from Earth and FTL ships from Dorenii. The world proves rich in the *unnamed unobtainium* needed for their construction and soon adopts those technologies for interstellar travel and becomes and important construction partner.

<TEXT> Menem's Outer Ocean (Men Doeth) has a vast and extremely dense kelp forest, which is probably the source of a great many myths of sea monsters. Ships' rudders and oars, and sailors who've gone overboard, can easily become tangled in the long stalks - and then spin stories of being pulled in by tentacled monsters. This region is located near the most accessible outlet to Men Doeth from Ijeida and fears of it led Agata, in particular, to avoid any extensive exploration of the ocean until quite late in history.

<TEXT> Teugad Naufair (Western Capital Group) or TeuNau began as something equivalent to the East India Company - an overseas agent of the Uajiren Empire which pursued trade (and fought wars) on the Empire's behalf in Griana. It later became the primary weapons developer of the Empire, thanks to its petroleum reserves (generally regarded to have been unlawfully extracted from Griana) and substantial industrial operations, producing everything from sidearms to fighter aircraft and destroyers. Following the 1st Intercontinental War, TeuNau was awarded oversight of seized infrastructure in Ijeida and, via the firm's private security branch, became a de facto occupying force. Ejected from Ijeida in the 2nd War, with the Empire itself approaching bankruptcy, TeuNau forces were used at home to oppose revolutionary activity during the Jirenes Civil War, until TeuNau executives staged their own coup to seize control of the waning Empire, leading an oppressive 6-month regime that executed thousands of dissidents, until itself overthrown by a new resistance with considerable foreign aid. This marked the end of the Empire and of TeuNau.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let's say you're shipping from Riverbend (trade hub of northern Baliren) to Targo (minor interior town of Sovdu). Riverbend, as the name implies, lies on the Traveling River, so you'll start by shipping your widgets south along the River. From there, the path will depend on the period in which you're doing this:  
  
**Antiquity** (these had better be valuable widgets): Ship along the River to Last View, then pack them onto mules and haul them down, across, and back up the steep-walled Vale, then along the top of the Seawall to Ecliya. From there, load onto a ship bound for Griana via the Inward Sea and out to the Circle Sea by way of canals, where you will transfer the widgets to merchants from Iuliat (familiar with the Circle Sea) who will sail them north to Sovdu, unload them, and pack them overland by horse or chalicothere to Targo. This will take a year to several years, depending on the state of war on the Circle Sea.  
  
**Early City Period**: Ship along the River all the way to Parovir atop the Seawall - bypassing the Vale by use of the newly constructed Viaduct. Haul down the face of the Wall on cranes, load onto ships on the Sunken Sea and carry east to the Circle Sea via new, Agata-built, canals - avoiding having to go as far south as Griana. Continue hauling north on the Circle Sea (Agatter sailors can now navigate it), then haul overland by horse or chalicothere to Targo. This should take a couple months. 
  
**Late City Period**: Either ship along the River or via rail (alongside the river), again all the way to Parovir, etc. Once in Sovdu, haul by rail part of the way, then pack overland by horse or chalicothere to Targo. Still probably a couple of months.  
  
**Great War**: As above, but ship over the Circle Sea under destroyer escort to protect against encounters with Uajiren U-boats, then all the way to Targo by rail. A month or so. 
  
**Occupation**: As above, but smuggle through Parovir to avoid interception by TeuNau (occupying security force) or Trade Commission (occupying bureaucrats). A month to several months, depending on strength of present occupation force, and willingness of ship captains to carry smuggled goods.  
  
**Reconstruction**: Ship by River or rail to Parovir, then by sea, canal, and sea to Sovdu, and by rail to Targo. A month to several months, depending on the state of the reconstruction effort and whether available vessels have been commandeered by the Union.  
  
**Post War through Second Union**: Place your widgets on an airplane at Riverbend, fly to a Sovdu distribution center, and then haul by rail to Targo. A few days down to overnight, as aircraft continue improving.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Each city would take a while, but each region/nation tends to build cities with distinctive styles:  
  
**Baliren** has many small villages, and very few large cities. Villages are compounds of stone buildings, mostly of communal use, generally arranged in three or four rings, and surrounded by fields, woods, and pastureland. The region's three large cities were founded separately from the villages to serve as a trade center (Riverbend), administrative center (Ethenfarr), and industrial center (Balirhearth).   
  
**Agata's** cities take two forms: ports located in natural harbors and highly engineered cliff cities. The cliff cities, with the capital Parovir as the greatest example, feature wealthy districts on the cliff top, including palaces, gardens, and noble estates, while the cliff-face is covered in cranes and locks and populated by the working class and poor.  
  
**Griana** is home to a dozen merchant republics, each centered on a single city-state, which usually comprise wealthy estates surrounding an old fortress. As maritime powers, their docks and ports are prominent. Many feature extensive systems of canals and/or grand avenues and boulevards.  
  
**Sovdu** was historically known for its "invisible cities", sprawling networks of often far-flung villages, nestled in the region's dense forests, unified by local administrative councils. During the Wars of the Caves (a series of religious wars with Iuliat   Terit), these complexes became dominated by centrally-placed fortresses, which later still became the palaces of kings, towering over the trees.  
  
**Qarisa** benefits from the genius engineering and hydroculture of its ancient civilizations, who built the miraculous (to many eyes) oasis cities that bloom year-round in the desert, most of them nestled into the southern canyons. These are densely populated, compact communities, with very few of the region living outside the great cities. They are cultural hubs, the seats of kings, and centers of knowledge and trade. Each has tended to specialize its trades and professions, and to engage closely in exchange with its neighbors.  
  
**Terit**, like Baliren, has tended toward small stone villages and few (mostly modern) large cities, which generally developed only with the advent of industry. These are usually small walled communities, hardened against the widespread, small scale, local warfare the region was historically prone to.  
  
**Iuliat** grew to power as an ancient maritime empire, and its one-time centers of power still dominate the culture of the area. These coastal cities feature imposing architecture built of stone quarried in Sovdu and Terit and shipped across the sea.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In Banbha there are rivalries between the races of magic users, but these are rooted in issues much deeper than just magic. There are two sources of magic - divine *Great Magic* and faerie *artifice*. Through devotion, humans have access to a form of divine magic usually called *small magic*.   
  
Small magic can be quite powerful - but is small in relation to Gods. It is limited to manipulation of the natural world (including time), and further limited by the will of the Gods (who may deny an abusive caster, or grant a particularly powerful omen, for example). It is used for wards and charms, divination, and manipulation of natural elements. There are schools dedicated to its study, but most magic is folk magic, taught in the home and local temple, passed from mother to daughter and priest to acolyte. Village witches and priests tend to be suspicious of the schools, viewing them as unnecessary contrivances. Otherwise there is little rivalry between human users, who are generally eager to pass along useful insights to their neighbors. Some particularly powerful incantations are kept secret by certain schools, however.  
  
Faeries are forbidden magic, both Great and small, and are jealous of humans and the Gods. They once knew the Great Magic but were banished from the natural world by the Gods for their misdeeds and lost all knowledge of it. They inhabit the Otherworld, and have developed a new form of magic called artifice which relies on manipulating the strange relationship between this world and the Other. Artifice cannot actually alter the natural world but can create powerful illusions and phenomena such as faerie doors and roads that connect geographically distant points through the Otherworld. It too can create quite powerful effects, generally learned through long study and experimentation. All faeries are jealously protective of their knowledge - sharing little with each other and often warring over it. They can reveal their artifice to humans, but cannot teach it. Faeries have been known to kidnap and enslave humans to make use of their magic; and many have attempted to break the bonds placed on them by the Gods in order to regain their lost Great Magic - to no avail, but sometimes dangerous outcomes.

<TEXT> The prophets of the Divine Dialogs [Dialogism] tend to focus their efforts more on "repent!" than on "the end is nigh!" They are doomsayers in that they predict downfall if people do not correct their wicked ways, but they do not speak of imminent destruction, distant things to come, or end times. They prescribe and proscribe certain behaviors and advocate certain worldviews or ways of life, so their writing and oratory are fairly clear in terms of their subject matter- stop sacrificing prisoners, abolish slavery, read more books, etc. Their predictions, when they make them, are based on practical observations - society will suffer in this particular way if the people keep up their bad behavior. Many claim to be prophets but "true prophets" are rare, a few per generation, and are regarded as receiving divine inspiration. However, the Gods are believed to be in conflict with one another (their contrary actions and teachings creating balance between opposing forces) so many generations have produced rival prophets - believed to be divinely inspired and teaching sometimes radically different viewpoints. After their lifetimes, Prophets are often treated similarly to Christian saints - venerated by particular monastic societies, attributed great works and miracles, and asked to intercede with the Gods on humans' behalf.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sport on most of Menem evolves from local and regional competitions held on festival grounds and rocky fields to large-scale international Olympic-like events held in grand stadiums. Cities, towns, and other sub-national groups form teams which compete, but it is all amateur-based, with little concept of professional athletes. The most common sports are track and field events - races, throwing things (hammers, rocks, cabers, javelins, teammates), etc. There are some competitive team sports  - I presume, but I haven't cooked them up yet.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sovdu ("white forest") is a 95,000 year old clonal colony of a quaking aspen-like tree. It was worshiped as a god by the prehistoric Builder culture of the region named for it, presumed eternal and immortal. It was once also the largest living organism, spreading over 100 square miles. Huge portions of it were destroyed in the Wars of the Caves and in the First Intercontinental War (mortal shells proved quite devastating to it). It has spread again since those events, but only a small portion of the ancient root system still remains.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've spent some time on this for Earth-Menem-Renii contact. Telescopes on Earth are eventually able to determine enough features of neighboring stars and exoplanets to judge which are the most likely to be habitable/inhabited to try to initiate contact with. Earth crafts a message, a repeating radio burst containing information similar to the gold records on the Voyager probes - demonstrating certain aspects of our science and cultures. It includes guides to learning a number of Earth languages and instructions for sending a return signal - encoded using atomic numbers. It takes eight years to first reach Menem, then scientists there spend two more years determining that it is a message, another five decoding the message, and five more crafting a response and building the transmitter powerful enough to send it. They respond in decoded English and Mandarin, and include translations in several Menem languages. Finally it takes another eight years for the response to be received on Earth. At this point, Earth has developed a faster-than-light communication technology (something like Ursula Le Guin's ansible). They send instructions to Menem for building the device, and direct dialogue is established - 35 years after contact was first made. Neither planet has developed FTL travel yet, so this is the extent of their contact for some time.  
  
Eventually, observers from Renii (much further away) also detect Earth's initial signals and, having FTL ships, come looking. As they approach, the also detect the FTL signals passing between the two planets and spend some time eavesdropping, learning the languages being used. They make contact with broadcasts in all the languages they've learned, announcing their presence and peaceable intentions.  
  
tl;dr It takes a long time and many linguists to get the ball rolling.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Summer is the time of the "working vacation" in Ijeida.  
  
*The* summertime destination in Baliren is the Highsummer Fair held at Ethenfarr. It is a vacation for many, who come for feasting, dancing, and games. Births and weddings (consecrated on the winter solstice) of the past year are celebrated. It is also an important judicial and administrative event, with judges, oathwrights, and court officials coming to enter local records into the Council Archives. The Counts meet in Council to discuss matters of regional import (and partake in feasting and dancing).  
  
The summer residence of the royals and nobles of Agata and Griana is the Sea of Glass, whose elegant estates are nestled in shade trees around the deep, clear waters of countless coves and bays. This is also an important diplomatic opportunity, with the ruling elites of the two regions gathered en masse, and in generous moods.

<TEXT> The center of the world is the Circle Sea, and at its center lie the Turning Lands, a set of highly active volcanic islands treated with dread and superstition - and so given a wide berth even by experienced sailors - and they have never been mapped. Should a bottomless pit open up among them, it would take a while before anyone noticed it, if they ever did. If it opened on one of the islands (there is one roughly in the center), it would join many of its fellow craters, holes, and calderas and go unnoticed entirely. If it opened on the sea floor and was big enough to appreciably swallow up some water, they might notice shifts in the sea currents - which are very well mapped - but blame it on the Turning Lands and no one would go investigate.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>   Neighboring countries and hesitant allies Agata and Baliren have both historically had a class system, which has been a source of tension between them. The nations were largely isolated from one another in antiquity due to the enormous Seawall around the Sunken Sea and the Tono Mountains separating their territories.  
  
  In this period, Agata was ruled by a monarchy supported by a hereditary nobility, which formed the bulk of the largely naval military, and a wealthy merchant class. Below these were crewman and fisherman, and finally the "landlocked" agricultural peasants and servant class. There was little space for mobility, except for merchants to marry into noble families, and intermarriage of nobles to maintain the royal line.  
  
  Baliren was divided into forty-odd counties (with somewhat changeable boundaries) governed by local nobility and supported by a warrior class, a trade/professional class, and tenant farmers. Their relationships were characterized by occasional wars and long-standing alliances. Though established by the semi-legendary Ice Kings, the county system had no central authority and matters of regional import were handled by an irregular council of counts. Mobility between the farming and trade classes was common and expected, and both were regarded equally. These could attain warrior status (minor nobility) through distinction in service, usually wartime (though not necessarily military), and gain influence with the count. Over time a poor servant class developed, stemming from the tradition of a count's obligation to provide employment to any in need. At the end of this period, a major restructuring occurred: most county land was turned over by the counts to trade/agricultural collectives to own and manage, the warrior class diminished, and the counts became a semi-hereditary judiciary and established a more regular governing council. 
  
  When Agata built the roads, canals, and aqueducts that ended the period of isolation and began what most consider the modern period, the two systems came into greater contact and clashed. The Agatter nobility remained strong and, encountering a (formerly) analogous system in Baliren, often expected to be able to marry into ruling families and gain influence; merchants who quickly gained wealth in the Baliren cities aligned these cities' politics with the Crown of Agata; peasants and fisherman in Agata encountered the collective structure of Baliren's county management and began mobilizing for reform.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> As others have pointed out, we can't answer this question definitively, having only one planet to look at. But, basic elements of our body plan can be argued to contribute to the develop of our intelligence: placement of sense organs; upright posture to allow limb specialization; fine manual dexterity. But remember that evolution doesn't choose what's best, it settles for what's good enough. The quadruped body plan, which became the human biped shape, emerged pretty early in the development of vertebrates, and hasn't changed. Once it was established, there was pretty much no chance of a species adding extra useful limbs (such a complicated mutation probably comes with significant problems), only refining the four they had. But who's to say a planet with entirely different evolutionary history didn't hit on a different shape early on and carry on from there? It's not so much a question of what forms intelligent life can evolve into, as what shapes it evolves *from*.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not sure how this would work, because autumn is really a transitional period specific to temperate zones. Natural processes associated with autumn happen because plants and animals are responding to changes in daylight and temperature. But, if (a part of) the world was static around equal length of day and night, and relatively cool temperatures - it would be both always spring and always autumn, I think. It would lack the extremes of winter and summer. Plants and animals would lose (or never have) a seasonal cycle of dropping leaves or growing thicker coats and shedding, etc., or if they did they would be specific to each species rather than a general process. Each plant would have its own cycle, but there would be more plants flowering, fruiting, and shedding leaves year round. This means people could plant and harvest year round, probably rotating crops according to each one's growing season. That could have all kinds of effects on societies, not having to rely on seasonal floods, warm periods, etc.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Mirrored Hand were a guild of scribes who traveled around Tevra visiting libraries (most often housed in monasteries) to copy texts held there. Their most elite members were skilled at writing with both hands and could produce two copies of a text at once. They were responsible for disseminating knowledge across the continent, and were always welcomed as honored guests. The Mirrored Hand were originally itinerant scholars, but it was one of their membership who invented the printing press to drastically improve their art. They soon ceased the traveling copyist trade altogether, and founded the first publishing houses, continuing in their role as the servants of knowledge. As printing became more and more widespread, the Mirrored Hand soon faded in prominence, but remains a respected publisher of scholarly texts well into the modern period.   
  
In Agata and Baliren, the Works Commission has a long and varied history, as a government office, labor union, and revolutionary force. Founded as the Crown Works Commission, the organization originally oversaw the conscription of laborers to produce the great ancient wonders of the Crown of Agata - from the mighty aqueducts to the capital city of Parovir itself. Following a workers revolt, the WC was reorganized as a representative body in the early City Period, comprised of workers who were able to negotiate collectively with the Crown for fair wages, good working conditions, and representation before the courts. It represented workers in all trades, from field-hands to engineers. In this capacity the Works and Labor Commission functioned for nearly a thousand years, until abolished when Agata was occupied by the Uajiren Empire following the First Intercontinental War. Its membership soon reformed in secret under the name Republican Works Commission and continued to advocate for workers' rights under the occupation, but soon took on a revolutionary role, constructing fortifications and performing sabotage in support of the rebel forces during the Ijeida Rebellion. The RWC was later built into the constitution of the Baliren Meanweal as an office of the legislature.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Months get a little complicated on Menem. The planet has three moons, Iava, Ael, and Ekna (to give them their Taragat names), which have cycles of 18, 24, and 56 days, and complete 28, 21, and 9 cycles, respectively, during Menem's ~504 day year. The moons are in close resonance with each other and all come full at the same time once per year; the solar year is slightly longer than this period and most cultures have devised an intercalary day to account for the discrepancy. The lunar conjunction occurs (correcting for drift) 17 days after the (northern) winter solstice each year.   
  
Different cultures place differing value on the moons, and so have arranged their calendars differently depending on which is regarded as the most significant moon. Most common, and the calendar which becomes standard in the modern period, is the Iava-month, dividing the year into 28 months of 18 days, each of which begins on the day after full Iava. The modern calendar does not name these months, but simply numbers the days of the year, 1-504 (or 0-504 every fifth year, treating the intercalary day as a special holiday).  </TEXT>

Just as you, I wanted to flesh out a MacGuffin for the first adventure - a magic weapon had been stolen from a lord's collection and he wanted it retrieved. I rolled an evil, intelligent longsword with a secret mission to destroy all good divine spellcasters, and a domination power - against a party including a druid (NG), paladin, and cleric. They didn't realize the power was in the sword, and blamed the thief who wielded it against them. They loathed him instantly, suspected him of a sinister plot, and feared his involvement in everything. He and the sword were tangential to the bigger arc of the campaign, but he was a perfect red herring whenever I needed him and it was just hilarious how much the party hated him.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In my own:  
  
There are a number of noble estates in Sovdu which were converted to other functions with the decline of the noble class and then with its abolition. These estates were home to large extended noble families, and usually featured a number of grand residences with several support buildings, outbuildings, stables, etc. Many became universities and hospitals. More urban versions were generally occupied by government offices. To align with the ideology of the revolutionary government that first occupied many of them, which emphasized that government was to serve the People - offices, even of senior officials, were placed in the former servants' quarters and kitchens, while the "upstairs" sections of the houses became public space.  
  
The Earth Ship Ambassador filled a number of functions throughout its lifetime at Menem. It carried the bulk of visitors of the Third Arrival, most of whom landed and remained on the planet's surface. The ship remained in orbit and acted as the Terran Embassy for some two decades. When Ambassador took a rocket strike during the Broken Union War, damaging its engines but not significantly degrading its life support functions, it was landed on Menem's larger moon where it served as a research station. It was later incorporated into the larger lunar habitat and became a museum documenting the history of Earth-Menem contact.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've dabbled in developing plate tectonics and continental drift, but that kind of deep geological history (while actually fascinating) is just not what I'm in interested in building. So the continents of Menem appear to fit together to suggest a plausibly real world, but that's as far as I've gone. Menem's a non-Earth fantasy world with humans on it [probably without an in-world explanation, though I've dabbled in that, too]. In developing a human history of the planet, the continents only need to have one arrangement, which can be functionally static over the short (relative to geological processes) period of time the species has lived.  </TEXT>

To ride - while convenient for traveling long distances - was considered taking part in public ritual.

<TEXT> "From Tevra, the dead go north." Traditional belief holds that the land of the dead lies in the north polar region, across the Troubled Sea. It is a perilous journey, and the living do many things to ease the passing of their departing loved ones, including accompanying them in a long pilgrimage to the northern coast, where a great stair has been built down the face of the sheer cliffs. Tehlaer, the Road of the Dead is dotted with guest houses and pilgrim towns where the dead and living alike may rest on the journey, all with empty rooms and inns reserved for weary spirits. Dedicated priests, who walk Tehlaer dozens or hundreds of times in their lives, will make the journey for those who are not able. Many struck with grief have begun the journey, intending to die along the way and join their lost beloved. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'ma have to dust this off, since I haven't done much work on it in a while. My cyberpunk setting is a dystopic post-apocalyptic world following a series of major wars and economic collapses caused by the bursting of the cyber-tech bubble. So, it's kind of post-cyberpunk. There is not a virtual world of any significant utility or power because a) the infrastructure supporting the one there was has decayed and b) it was always kind of a pipe-dream that couldn't sustain the economy or politics long term. There was a boom in cybernetics and VR tech of all kinds that promised a bright future, but overlooked long-term neurological problems for users and the extreme vulnerability of those who had migrated to virtual life (a sizable minority). A series of coordinated terrorist attacks against data centers killed thousands who were living online, and the rest abandoned ship afterwards. Several major economies that developed with virtual currency subsequently collapsed to devastating effect.  
     
Perhaps the greatest consequence of the fallen cyber age was the significant redefinition of legal personhood which identified corporations and intelligent networks as legal persons and codified all sorts of their rights. The two major corporate entities that play the antagonists to Our Plucky Heroes are TriaComm, an agriculture and industrial conglomerate producing everything from corn and pesticide to office furniture and jet engines, and MediPac a pharmaceutical empire with essentially a monopoly on research and development and which runs the most extensive intelligence agency in the world.  
  
Corporations and the few remaining wealthy states have established a new electronic infrastructure, under much tighter control and surveillance (banning private encryption and installing backdoors in everything, and causing enormous problems for themselves). The resistance stay off the new "metanet" and instead work exclusively on isolated portions of the "old net" - running on the landline phone networks abandoned years before and on "guerrilla networks", mobile systems put up by white hats and (usually) quickly torn down by the vigilant corporate powers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The cities of Agata are largely built into the faces of sea cliffs around the Sunken Sea, very much maximizing the availability of dark, damp spaces for fungus cultivation. Agata relies heavily on fishing and trade for its foodstuff, but has also developed a wide variety of edible mushrooms and lichens. Regional cultivars and professional connoisseurs abound, alongside home gardens and various traditions of appreciation (including taste and, of course, hallucinogenic capacity).   
  
In Qareya, agriculture relies on the ancient cultivation of certain flowering desert plants, closely attuned to the local climate of each of the oasis cities. In the city of Qarisa, for example, more than a thousand distinct cultivars of qaralla are carefully tended (*qar-* being a common root word meaning "desert") for various purposes ranging from water treatment to intoxication. In the latter category, a great variety of beers and liquors have been developed over the centuries.  </TEXT>

The first broader elements of the world were inspired by cave paintings in Spain that I visited in March 2006 and the world took off from there. So it's about ten years old too. Though, I've been musing lately about rehashing some much older work for a different world and finding a place for it in Menem - I'm realizing that a world is a very, very big place with ample room for all kinds of things. So if I find a place for that work, the combined world would be eighteen years old, though that may be cheating.  </TEXT>

There are very specific demands of a task like achieving space flight - reaching escape velocity, leaving/entering atmospheres, etc. - that strongly shape what the technology can look like (not in terms of design but specifications/abilities) without radically different materials or fuels. Computers are harder to say, because we only developed them once and are really still advancing the same technology - it's very hard to imagine how else a computing machine would work but easier to imagine that a society might have found a very different solution. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it's hard to separate technology and culture. Our society strongly values a particular cultural construct of progress which entails technological development for its own sake, technical one-upmanship, and physically imposing architecture. It's not unreasonable to imagine that a society that shares these values would build similar structures at a comparable level of technology - but suddenly that's a lot of assumptions and givens. A totally alien culture is likely to view progress and development in a very different way, even if occupying a similar environment, and is more likely to build structures in line with their worldview.  </TEXT>

The [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_language) is pretty good and has lots of links out to more resources. Just like verbal languages, signed languages are classified in families (ASL was developed from French Sign Language, for example, but Danish Sign Language is different and has its own descendants; and others, like Nicaraguan Sign Language, developed in isolation).

<TEXT> Baliren county towns all have festival grounds that include athletic fields. There are many annual events featuring games and competitions, and people come from around the county to participate or watch. Many villages have similar fields where local competitions are held as well. Locals will use the locations in the off times for practice and informal games. Most include short tracks for sprint races (long distance races are run on the roads) and bowling greens for, well, bowling - though most are not flat and even, just open spaces for tossing heavy rocks around. Agata, and later Baliren through Agata's influence, had training facilities for military officers which were opened to the public after the great wars. In both types of facilities, the emphasis is on games and/or cooperative efforts; there is little interest in the individual work out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In most of Baliren, land is owned communally by the members of towns and villages. Historically, each county was owned in full by the Count who leased it tenant farmers, but some centuries ago most Counts ceded the land to county residents with the Counts remaining as arbiters of its fair distribution among communities as population shifts over time.  
  
In neighboring Agata, there is precious little land, the nation being a collection of isolated port cities surrounding the Sunken Sea. The ports are owned and administered by the ruling families. A worker's "land" in Agata is her boat and the income she makes as a trader, fisher, or other profession that may be plied on the sea.   
  
As to your loggers - How is the village and/or city administered? Who gave the village rights to log that portion of forest? It seems the protection the fruit-pickers seek has to come from who oversees the logging interests and (as is historically often true) they will have an uphill battle staking their claim against the loggers. Perhaps armed guards?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The rule of Agata has been passed for many centuries from mother to daughter in the house called Dodomenem (Daughters of the Seas). Terran scholars have called the sitting ruler "Koriarch", a neologism of Greek root suggesting "ruling daughter" to distinguish the practice from matriarchal succession. Each Koriarch ascends to the Crown when her eldest daughter comes of age [at an age I have yet to determine], at which point her mother steps down and joins the advisory Council of Mothers, made up of living female relatives of the Koriarch - mother, grandmothers, sisters, aunts - some previously Koriarch themselves. The daughter of the Koriarch is apprenticed to this Council, to learn their ways and methods, until her own daughter comes of age and she ascends to the throne. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are two sorts of magic users in Banbha - faerie artificers and human faithful - and three sorts of magic - artifice (the magic of faeries), small magic (the working of humans), and Great Works (the acts of Gods). Faerie's developed artifice as a means of manipulating the strange relationships between their Otherworldly realm and the mundane world. It emphasizes illusion and crafting strange objects (such as mirrors that along faerie-travel between distant places). The faeries are few in number and generally dislike one another, so most artifice is developed individually and is highly idiosyncratic. There have been powerful artificers who took apprentices, but these never became schools of any sort. Human's small magic is limited to protective magic, such as wards and charms, and divination. In the past, small magic was practiced widely in households and communities around the island. It was taught informally, just as cooking and other household tasks, acquired from watching your father work and sitting on your grandmother's knee. Today, few still believe in the old ways, and many doubt the efficacy of the traditional small magic, so the ways are dying out. Practitioners are increasingly to be found only in small towns and villages away from the cities, but there is little to distinguish them otherwise from those who have lost faith. Just as in human magic, most folk have stopped believing in (and being wary of) the faeries and their artifice.  </TEXT>

Each major house and city has its colors, in particular arrangement, easily recognized at a distance (along with a kind of semaphore widely used to communicate at sea, but that wasn't the question). Horizontal bands are common, as they appear the same if seen in reverse. The oldest houses' colors are those of the stone around their home harbors (or the colors associated with those harbors).

<TEXT> The cold war period on Menem developed from the uneasy terms of peace that ended the First Intercontinental War, fought between the Uajiren Empire and the Crown of Agata. Officially neither power was victorious, but the armistice agreement heavily favored the Empire, which was given powers to oversee the dismantling of Agatter arms and the disbanding of its military forces. Meanwhile the region of Grianna, whose mineral resources were a significant object of the war, was divided between Imperial and Agatter administration, with a significant neutral zone between their jurisdictions. This division trampled over many longstanding borders that had governed peaceful relations in Grianna for centuries. In the thirty-year interim before hostilities erupted into the Second Intercontinental War, the powers fought proxy wars within Grianna, including heavy focus on espionage and covert operations. Grianna was subjected to periods of puppet governments, police states, and ongoing civil wars, seeded by the larger powers. Exiled to the Agata capital of Parovir, Prince Gavoren At of Eqre, a traditional Grianna state, famously remarked "Your war may be over, but Grianna fights ten thousand." This period of violence and turmoil is often called the Crucible of Grianna.  
  
This cold war period ended when republican revolutionaries in Baliren, long a subject of Agata, rose against both Crown and Empire in the Ijeida Rebellion, which quickly grew in scale when a united force of Grianna dissidents rose in rebellion as well, and Agata finally unleashed secretly developed arms against the Empire. The short lived nation United Ijeida emerged the victor, as the Empire retreated into its own growing civil war. The century of conflict ended with neither former power still in place. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **The Republican Works Commission** The Works Commission was a longstanding agency within the Crown of Agata, providing jobs to thousands and creating much of the infrastructure through which the nation rose to power in the modern age. When Agata succumbed to the Uajiren Empire in the First Intercontinental War, one of the Empire's first acts was to disband the Works Commission and turn over vital Agatter infrastructure to its own TeuNau (equal parts arms manufacturer and military police). Already chafing under monarchist rule, many members of the former Works Commission reconstituted the organization in secret as the revolutionary Republican Works Commission. With intimate knowledge of bridges, dams and factories, and experts in many trades, the RWC set about dismantling installations vital to the Uajiren occupation. At the same time the RWC began rebuilding and occupying sites damaged during the war. When the Ijeida Rebellion came to a head at Ethenfarr, it was the RWC that fortified the city and kept TeuNau and Imperial military forces at bay through acts of sabotage. They are lauded as the heroes of the rebellion and champions of the republican Meanweal movement; but vilified by the Empire and its allies.  </TEXT>

From a distance, say on a ship out flying over a port, the distinct color of each small shield would be lost, especially with additional imagery like a crest on each one. Having the smaller shields all in a single color different from the large central shield would represent them all while also representing their subordination to the imperial capital.

<TEXT> I primarily use my conlangs for naming purposes, but the best of them are productive in other areas. Sapir-Whorf is dangerous if overstated, but a well built conlang can help understand - or at least help express - how a culture understands and interprets the world. My conlang taragat has a grammatical structure that readily expresses "countless" as an extension of the standard plural form. Having stumbled on that really helped think about how taragat speakers, and the heavily overlapping group of Etaretare ("Gods Unnumbered") practitioners, express a particular belief structure.  
  
So, in terms of what's presented, I most often use conlangs for names, though I have written a smattering of poetry in various conlangs for use in narratives. But I guess I find the primary "use" for me to be in developing the world and shaping the cultures that populate it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Very nice exploration of an interesting idea, as always! I think there's a lot to the comparison between the Atomic Age obsession with all things nuclear and the Information Age obsession with more and more powerful computing. I recently re-read Asimov's *Foundation* novels and was struck by how clearly they are situated within the Atomic Age in which he wrote. He envisions, some 10,000 years in the future, a galactic civilization in which space pilots safely wear nuclear reactors on their belts, but the powerful computers remain room-, city-, and even planet-sized. He saw miniaturization coming, but from within the short-lived Atomic Age he attached it to the wrong technology. The creators of Fallout, working in a post-Atomic, post Cold War era, see that nuclear optimism as folly and follow it to a tragic conclusion. But, I think, with the best of speculative fiction, Fallout comments not only on our past and a future we didn't create. It says of our present that we should be wary of over-lauding any technology and basing our lives around it too much. Perhaps the development of the transistor led us down a more peaceful path than nuclear proliferation, but we don't yet live in a world at peace, and we are finding new ways to use computers to make war. As the recurrent opening line, which Mike echoes in this video, has it, "war never changes" no matter what technology is driving it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Baliren wedding ritual is a simple, private affair between the couple, performed as part of the larger winter solstice hearth lighting festival. At the winter solstice, a huge bonfire is lit in the center of every village in Baliren, and villagers extinguish the hearth fires in their homes (which consist of separate single family houses and communal living quarters, usually shared by younger unmarried adults and elders, and divided into small units). Households then relight their hearth fires together from the village's large bonfire. At this time, living arrangements are changed - young adults leaving their parents' home, roommate situations changing, newlyweds moving in together, and divorcing couples moving apart. For the wedding version, each partner participates in the extinguishing rite with their former household and then they join each other to light the hearth in their new home (which may be quarters in the shared houses or in a separate home). The ritual is the formal recognition of a marriage (divorce, move, etc.), but in practice the couple may have moved in together (or moved out) earlier in the year at any time, especially if partners are not from the same village. The hearth lighting rite is performed in the morning of the solstice, and the rest of the day is spent together with the other members of the village feasting and celebrating.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have things scattered around in several places, not well organized (despite being a librarian), which comes from working on all my projects in pieces over several years. It's mostly together either on my hard drive or Google Drive, but the local stuff is in all kinds of formats - Wordperfect   Quattro, Word   Excel, .txt files, various images. The reason for each was just what was available or seemed convenient at the time. I need to do something better for keeping stuff from older projects together and available - eventually legacy formats are gonna bite me in the ass - but I haven't gotten around to it.    

I've been doing all my writing in Google Drive for the last few years, which I like for keeping it available wherever I am. I have a pocket notebook where I do most of brainstorming, sketching, and working out problems, then I write things up in online.

<TEXT> Parovir was built to be the trade capital of Ijeida, the "jewel of the Crown of Agata", when that great nation opened trade with Baliren in the north by constructing the great canal and aqueduct, Mithrenna, and connecting the Traveling River to the Sunken Sea. It is built all in marble and filled with canals and gardens where once was a barren clifftop. Its construction defined an era, and the Agata calendar used for the next 1500 years across Ijeida reckons the Year of the City as its start. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The faeries of Banbha reside in a place called *Tire an Liath*, the Grey Country - or the Otherworld. It is not a coherent or contiguous land the way the mortal Earth is but "a dream made of mist and twilight" and is, for the most part, inaccessible to humans. The *liathena* (Grey Folk) who inhabit it are few and generally solitary, more often than not despising each other's company. They appear (when they appear) as unusually slender humans and are not so much fair as grey or colorless as if glimpsed in a dim light, or blue as if seen at dawn or dusk or from under water. Their race once inhabited the land but they were banished by the Gods to live "under the earth and between the days". They were denied the High Magic of the Gods but have developed a method of manipulating the strange relationship between Earth and Grey, called artifice. Powerful artificers among them can hide away a piece of Earth in the Grey Country or make roads out of nothing that connect geographically distant places - preferring to employ mirrors and disused cabinets for such purposes. Perceptive humans can glimpse these effects - only ever briefly - and have spun many wild tales about the Grey folk and what they are up to, or what they look like.  
  
*Liathena* can have children with mortal humans, and such folk are often skilled artificers. However they frequently suffer strange side effects from being born of neither world. One can never be found, by anyone who is ever looking for him or expecting him; even if they saw him enter another room they will forget he is there and his return will be surprising. This is thanks to an off-hand remark his Grey mother made about his jealous father. Another is blind to the mortal realm but can still see the Grey Country or objects touched by artifice.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is a popular game in Baliren and Agata just called "the shepherds' game" or "shepherds." Though there are many regional variants, it involves moving tokens (which may be stones, chips, coins, etc.) and claiming territory on a gridded board (which may be round or square, or rarely other shapes). It's popularly believed to have originated among shepherds debating the equitable division of pastureland and drawing out maps to do so. This may be apocryphal, but the earliest known shepherds board can be found etched on a flat-topped boulder in the Stony Sea. Terran observers have called it "Baliren chess" but the rules are more similar to a combination of mancala and go.   
  
A deck of cards roughly similar to our own was developed in Sovdu and became popular worldwide. It is composed of 3 "realms" of 17 cards, each subdivided into the House of Eight (heaven) and the House of Nine (earth). The cards - historically wooden tiles - are triangular and have varying values on each edge or corner. Each card has a unique identity - the horse, the priest, the mountain, etc. - which have become uniform over time. Like our own cards, the whole pack or a subset can be used to play dozens of different games. Games of skill are favored over games of pure chance, and the cards are rarely used for betting or gambling (which is more often reserved for dice games).   </TEXT>

<TEXT> Another 'vestigial empire', said to have once thrived in Baliren, is known popularly as the Ice Kings. The Ice Kings - if they existed at all - fought a war of unification in the north and established a great kingdom that ruled for generations until it splintered in rebellion. They are likely a legendary account of the retreat of Great Ice, which coincided with the expansion of agriculture and the establishment of the historical counties of Baliren. Despite being a legend, the ancient kingdom still holds sway over the politics and imagination of the north. The Ice Kings have been invoked many times by many factions seeking support in war, revolt, elections, even criminal trials. </TEXT>

Around 65,000 years ago, scientists belonging to what has come to be known as the Extinct Galactic Civilization were experimenting with a new FTL technology in the vicinity of Barnard's Star (6 light years from Earth). The experiments created a series of unstable wormholes - or similar phenomena - which, by chance, transported a small population of humans from Earth to at least three other habitable planets around nearby stars. It is likely that many more were simply killed by the incident, transported to inhospitable planets or into deep space.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The canyon cities of southern Qareya have had high quality sanitation for several millennia, owing to close management of a limited local water supply. Their advancements include reservoirs, a complex plumbing infrastructure, and artificial wetlands for water treatment. Showering per se is rare, as it uses a great deal of water, but most homes are equipped with a plumbed wash basin and daily ablutions are common. The cities are planned vertically within canyon walls, with homes and fresh/clean water located at higher levels, and public baths, lavatories and water treatment ponds below, along with screwpumps to return clean water to the upper cisterns.  
  
Agata developed sanitation systems, including the isolation and treatment of waste water and regular washing, independently around 1,700 years ago, thanks in large part to a major cultural emphasis placed on the value of mothers' and infants' lives and a desire to control infection and disease. Agata's widespread trade influence across the continent of Ijeida helped to spread their innovations widely as well. Home lavatories are common in the wealthy Gardens district of the capital Parovir (home to the royal palace), while elsewhere in the city and across the region nearly all areas include public baths and facilities. Such baths are a mark of Agata influence in an area, so there are many in such cities as Riverbend and Stationside, but they have not been as widely adopted in Baliren cities such as Balirhearth or Ethenfarr, for example.    </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Principles of Republic began as a revolutionary declaration during the height of the Ijeida Rebellion - a statement of the rights and obligations of state and citizen, and a challenge to the control of the imperial powers. It became the backbone of several constitutions to follow - first that of the Baliren Meanweal, then the confederation known as the Republics of Wheat and Water, and later still of the short-lived Ijeida Union. In Baliren it was followed by the Distributed Powers Clause, which established the structure of a republican government based on those principles. In a sense, the Baliren Constitution (also called the Ethenfarr Constitution, for the city in which it was drafted) reads like the reverse of the U.S. Constitution - the Bill of Rights comes first, followed by an addendum organizing the actual government.

<TEXT> The likeliest place for a revolution on Menem is the so-called Crucible of Griana. Prior to the First Intercontinental War, the peaceable and prosperous region was comprised largely of small principalities and city states. The convoluted armistice that ended the war left it a patchwork of occupied territory, puppet states, and an ostensibly neutral zone between the two great powers, the Uajiren Empire and the Crown of Agata. A period of mass migration followed, as supporters of Empire or Crown fled to territory loyal to or controlled by one or the other, and more fled into the neutral zone seeking to escape their influence. As the "temporary solution" grinds into its third decade, dozens of factions have emerged, amid rioting, armed conflict, and civil unrest; police states seize power in some corners, to be toppled within a few years by tentative republics lacking the resources to stand. Crown and Empire continue extracting the wealth over which they fought the war, bleeding the nations of Griana. Spurred on by a young, idealist Republican movement in Baliren, the coming Ijeida Rebellion will see all Griana rise against the powers just as the armistice terms begin to crumble and the Second Intercontinental War gets underway.

<TEXT> *Qaralla* is a general term meaning "desert flower" that describes the flowering plants which bloom after rain and during the brief wet season of Qareya, the "great desert" of eastern Tevra. The ancient inhabitants of the region cultivated several species of these plants and established the agriculture of a thriving civilization. In oases and the canyons of the south, qaralla plants grow and bloom year round, yielding - among other benefits: grain, seeds, and fruit for cooking, brewing, and animal feed; fiber for weaving; cooling through shade leaves and water retention; and water treatment through a system of wells, pools, pumps, and cisterns.  
  
The work of the Qareya ancients has been carried to the stars, as the efficiency and efficacy of qaralla cultivation proved an ideal base for the food and water treatment needs of Union starships and colonial outposts.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Baliren poetry values metaphor and allusion very highly. Kennings similar to Old English and Old Norse poetry are very common. For example, "ship trail" refers to a river and "raven tender" refers to a skillful warrior (whose many kills feed the ravens).  
  
Poetry in Agata makes frequent use of the distinctive reduplication of the Taragat language. These forms create subtle differences in plurals and in the meanings of verbs that are frequently exploited to create novel forms and puns.  
  
Poets in Sovdu and Tehlaer rely very heavily on prescribed poetic forms such as couplets or quatrains with internal rhymes. It is said these forms reflect the order of the Gods and of the universe; and adhering to them demonstrates the poet's understanding of that order.  </TEXT>

There is very little direct physical evidence of the EGC - no ruined cities or derelict stations, just a few widely scattered artifacts. But signs of their activity may be inferred, pointing to more powerful technologies than any Union world or other known civilization possesses. These include successful terraforming projects, the manipulation of whole solar systems to realign orbits, and the presence of certain species (including humans) on multiple planets long before any of them had achieved space flight.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is very common in Baliren to produce life-size statues of the Gods in accessible places and familiar postures, out of bronze so that they are durable, may be touched (or climbed on by children). There are few large temples or grand scale sculptures on plinths. In a roadside shrine to Senoen, the Grandmother, she sits on the ground with legs crossed and skirts spread around her. Children sit in her lap and adults take her hand. Eferet, the Warrior rides his horse beside a towpath, and stands guard in the square at Ethenfarr. Meroben, the Judge, presides over many council halls, seated at the table or standing at a lectern with a gavel in her hand. The folk or Baliren take an intimate and familiar few of their deities, and welcome them as kin in their midst. If a statue is well worn by interaction, there could be no higher praise to God or to artist.  
  
In Qareya and Tehlaer, by contrast, it is very rare to depict the Gods in human form. Here the Eight Most High are represented in abstractions, sometimes vast in scale, in attempts to capture the wonder and awe of the Gods. These are hung from ceilings and placed high on columns, that onlookers may aspire to such greatness.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> We've been starved for good TV space opera for several years, and I was really hoping this show would be good. I've watched the first season, and I think it still has potential, but they have some work to do to win me over. By the end, I was interested enough in the story to plan to stick around for season 2, but it took a force of will to make it that far. I almost quit half-way through episode 1 because the characters are all so painfully generic. Early on Three even hangs his hat on this, giving Six a little litany of the stock type each character reflects:  

* One: Pretty boy  
* Two: Boss lady  
* Three: Serious badass  
* Four: "Swordy Stabberson", stoic Asian martial artist  
* Five: The kid (you gotta have blue hair!)  
* Six: Black Number 2, straight man (Zeppo)  
* Let's not forget the android who wants to be human  

They flesh them out *a little* by the end, but the cookie cutter start is a deep setback to recover from. Couldn't they have given us a little nuance? 
  
As for the setting, I can't tell if the Dark Matter universe is just also super generic, or they're planning to roll out the details over time. I hope for the latter, but the impression of depth is not great so far. What year is it, how'd we get to space, and is Earth a thing; or are we in a galaxy far far away? Who gave the Galactic Authority its authority? How much galaxy are we moving about in? There's nothing to hold on to.  And what's with all the secondhand Starfleet space stations?
  
The amnesia storyline is pretty tired, but I'll allow that they have done interesting things with it. The corporations are interesting, and feel like the best realized thing so far. I like that they aren't just warring semi-states called corporations for flavor, but really play out like companies, where stock options and boardroom stalemates are real tactics for negotiating with them.  
  
Anyway, *Dark Matter* has enough potential coming out of season 1 that I'll stick around, but it might just be because I'm hungry for *any* space opera.

<TEXT> The martian landscape boasts many enormous features and structures that dwarf their counterparts on Earth. Olympus Mons is three times higher than Everest; Valles Marineris could swallow the Grand Canyon six times over. Elsewhere, many-kilometer-high cliffs are common. As I understand it (from my armchair), these features owe their grand scale to exactly what makes Mars hostile to life - no plate tectonics, minimal magnetic field and atmosphere, no hydrosphere. The volcanoes sit in the same place and keep growing for billions of years, and rain never wears them down.  [correct me if I'm wrong on any of that...]
  
So my question is: do the dynamic crust and weathering processes necessarily preclude Earth (or a similar world) from developing landscapes on the martian scale? Is it that Earth *can't* build mountains that size, or simply that it *hasn't*?

What are some non English options? In some universes (Star Trek) 'human' works because people from other planets are also other species.

<TITLE> Can we clarify the categories for post flair? </TITLE>

<TEXT> 'Prompts,' 'Discussion,' 'Question' and 'Request' in particular are being used pretty interchangeably, which limits their usefulness. Prompt is mostly used for "Tell me about your X" kinds of posts, but those are flaired with Question and Discussion a lot of the time too. Question, Discussion, and Request are all used for "(How) Would this work?", for advice, and for procedural questions (e.g. "where do you keep you notes?").  
It would be really helpful to clarify as a community what these categories mean, so that flair better indicates the content of posts and  filters can be more effective.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Television portrayals exploiting bi women and denying bi men </TITLE>
<DATE> 2014-12-28 17:25:14 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> There are bi women all over television these days - in behavior anyway; few if any explicitly identify. Lost Girl, Arrow, Gotham, Korra, to name just a few off the top of my head. But I feel like these portrayals are mostly less about diversity and more about titillation and exploitation. Only Korra feels like an actual positive portrayal - a developed relationship, on an all-ages show. And bi men are nowhere to be seen. Apart from Oberyn Martell, with whom I for one couldn't particularly identify, has a bi man had anything like a prominent role in popular TV? </TEXT>

<TITLE> I am the Koriarch Fiddha doLyria, Reigning Daughter of Agata and the Sunken Sea. At the start of the new year I will renounce the crown of my Mothers and call for the formation of a new republic. AMA. </TITLE>

<TEXT> For generations beyond reckoning, by the grace of the Gods Unnumbered, my Mothers have ruled Agata and the waters of the Sunken Sea as koriarchs and Adelemenem, Sisters of the Seas. By the will of my great grandmother, Farand doTereien, the realm submitted to the suzerainty of the Trade Parliament. For many years the nations that touch the Sea knew great partnership and prosperity. But since my mother's reign, the Parliament's growing corruption has starved the northern nations. It has seized control of the Navy and the Merchant Marine, abolished the ancient Workers Guild and held its leaders in labor camps, and has sold our resources for influence among the foreign powers. 
Agata and the Sea of Glass alone remain prosperous, but not for long if our sisters and brothers suffer so. I have met in secret with leaders of the Meanweal Party - the republican movement which began in the north - and with envoys from many nations. It is agreed. In my address to welcome the new year I will deny the Parliament's authority, give up the crown, and with the High King, the Group of Princes, and the Many Councils, call for the election of a constitutional convention, that the will of free peoples may declare a new republic for these once divided lands.

[OOC: 'Koriarch' is a term I coined to describe the traditional rule of Agata, based on 'patriarch/matriarch' and the Greek word for daughter, kori. So, 'reigning daughter.' Each Koriarch is crowned when her own first daughter comes of age at 17. Her mother, grandmothers, and sisters form her inner council.] </TEXT>
