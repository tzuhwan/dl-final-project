<TEXT> ok yeah I probably shouldnt have said its not her fault that she made several mistakes obviously if she prioritizes going to other shows instead of rehearsing thats what were gonna get, unfortunately.

<TEXT> Yeah, I thought she had great energy and was actually very funny. The only part that genuinely annoyed me was the magician. Other than that, I genuinely think she just couldnt have known where the spotlight could or couldnt reach. She was engaging so that made up for the little blunders. Im just not sure what you mean by the messed up cues? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I actually thought her numbers were really great (besides the few slight wardrobe malfunctions) but yeah the magician that filled in between numbers completely does not go with her whole vibe. It felt like constantly going back and forth between a stunning burlesque show and a childrens party

Edit: I also wanna add that I snuck a few glances over at Aquaria while the magician was doing a number close to where she was sitting and she was NOT living </TEXT>
