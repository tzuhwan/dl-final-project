<TEXT> I'd recommend saying hello, at least for Jews. Shalom isn't a strictly religious greeting and we greet other Jews by saying hi or hello (or whatever the equivalent is in the local language). However, if you want to use more Jewish greetings, there's a [seemingly endless](http://www.jewfaq.org/express.htm) amount of holiday specific greetings which are appropriate to use. </TEXT>

<TEXT> NAH. You clearly meant it as a compliment but for lots of visible minorities, you get those types of comments when you're with people who are of the same (perceived) ethnic group as you. I'm brown and it's pretty common for mostly white people to think I'm related to any other brown person I hang out with, even if we're from different ethnic groups and don't look alike at all. I'd imagine your friend has gone through that too and may have been a bit confused if she thinks her kids look whiter than she does.

If her kids don't look white, family and friends may have expressed disappointment in her non-white kids and your comment may have been misinterpreted as disappointment. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My parents weren't as accepting as you. A big thing you can do is not invalidate his feelings, especially as he gets older. It really sucks to have adults not take your crushes on members of the same sex seriously, especially if you have a straight simply whose crushes are taken seriously.

The next thing is to avoid making small homophobic comments. My parents would always talk about how they were accepting of gay people but make disparaging comments about feminine gay men. That really fucked with me as a more effeminate boy and it made me pretty nervous to come out.

Should we assume hes gay when talking about possible future milestones like marriage, children, and even just sex?

Try to keep these conversations gender neutral or say things like "whatever boy or girl you marry" so that he knows it's okay to like boys, just as it's okay for him to like girls. Ignoring the possibility that he might marry/have kids with a guy shows him that marriage/parenting is just for straight people, which can really fuck with a young gay kid. I wouldn't assume that he's gay, though, because he might not be and if he's closeted, it might really rattle his self-esteem if you assume he's gay. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I didn't always know I'm gay but it was more that I was in denial, rather than being unsure. I eventually figured it out when I was about 14, even though it was painfully obvious in retrospect. 

I briefly dated a girl when I was 16 to see if maybe that would make the gay thoughts disappear. Spoiler: they got stronger. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Did you always talk like that or does it come from embracing the feminine side of you?

It's both. I also talked like that but was forced into talking like a straight guy. When I came out and felt comfortable exploring the feminine side of me, no longer putting on a straight voice meant no longer needing to hide and live authentically.

Why do gay men have a need to work so hard on their look?

In the gay community, you gain a lot of worth based on your appearance. Also, part of being attracted to the same sex is you can compare your body and style to the bodies and styles of guys you find attractive. If you think your body falls short of what you're attracted to, it makes you feel like shit. </TEXT>

I used to be really uncomfortable with gay jokes when I was newly out because a lot of gay jokes have historically just been mocking gay people for being gay. It took me a while to be comfortable making self-depreciating gay jokes, which is saying something because I make self-depreciating jokes all the time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The Wizard of Oz was one of the first mainstream movies queer people really identified with. It features someone who's living in a black and white world (which is like living in the closet) be transported to a bright, cheerful place (which is like being able to live openly). Those who stand in their way are defeated, which is like coming out and facing homophobia. 

The three main male characters, the lion, the scarecrow, and the tin man, aren't traditionally masculine and at the end of the movie, they discover they already have the attributes they believe they lack. This resonates with a lot of not traditionally masculine gay men because not only do they have characters in media with characteristics that they identify with being portrayed as sympathetic protagonists, but also the characters finding out they have what they believe is lacking resonated with gay men who felt they were weak or lacked masculinity or worth. 

The Wizard of Oz also resonated with queer people who had to make a new family. In the movie, Dorothy's original family is shitty and she creates a family with the scarecrow, the tin man, and the lion. As they fight similar enemies (the witch, those flying monkeys that gave me nightmares as a kid), their bond grows stronger. 

Also, a lot of gay people identified with Judy Garland herself since she lived a tragic life which was similar to the ones lived by gay men at the time. Since so many gay men liked Judy Garland, whenever she performed they'd all get to meet up. Referring to gay men as a friend of Dorothy made reference both to the male characters in the Wizard of Oz and them being fans of Judy Garland, who played Dorothy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The first time bottoming is always a bit scary but it gets easier as you do it more. The key is to be relaxed and comfortable and use way more lube than you'd think. It also helps to go slowly at first since it can hurt at the beginning.

Before you bottom, it's a good idea to eat light. You may also want to douche and put a towel you're not that attached to down before you start. Cleaning up afterwards is easier if you use a condom. </TEXT>

Before I was with my boyfriend, I could theoretically get a guy pretty easily but the attention I was getting was from guys I wasn't attracted to.

<TEXT> I can't speak for babies but it can a bit of a pain for toddlers. Having to put a snowsuit on a toddler is not an easy task. They're squirmy and don't like wearing them so getting them in there is hard. It's especially rough if the kid you're trying to get into the snowsuit doesn't like wearing clothes in general. It's pretty common for toddlers to take their hats off when you're out with them so you should take a few hats with you. God help you if you finally suited up a toddler and they announce they need to use the bathroom right now.

Also, it's nearly impossible to pick up a toddler in their snowsuits. The material they're made out of is slippery and the clothes you're wearing is also slippery so it's hard to get a good grip on them. </TEXT>

I'm also from a secular (although not as secular as your husband) Jewish household and I don't really buy his arguments. You can always reassure him that the things he's worried about (keeping kosher, sending your kids to Hebrew school, etc.) can be as much a cultural thing as a religious thing. I'm not religious at all but I still keep kosher because it makes me feel more connected to a culture my family worked hard to maintain.

<TEXT> YTA. I know you don't mean to be an asshole but having been in your daughter's position, it's not great advice. Your daughter probably already knows that your mother's homophobic and is well aware of the risks involved in coming out to her. 

Coming out to her grandmother might also alleviate any worries that she'll be outed to her. I thought I could just not come out to my grandparents but I ended up getting outed to them by another family member who didn't understand I wasn't out to everyone. That caused way more drama than if I had come out to them myself.

Finally, it's incredibly stressful to be closeted to people you live with, especially if you're out to some people and not others. She might also feel guilty if she doesn't come out to her grandmother. </TEXT>

<TEXT> First, I want to address how I feel about the whole "I don't see colour" thing. It's a nice sentiment and reflects how society should be but not really how society currently is. Of course there's no fundamental difference between people when it comes to our biology but there is a fundamental difference in how we're treated by others and society as a whole based on how we look. I'm a light brown Jew with a Middle Eastern name and I can assure you, I'm treated very differently from some blond dude with an Anglo name. I'm also treated differently than my darker Iraqi-Canadian boyfriend because at least I kind of look white to some people. I'm not offended by people saying they don't see colour but it can be a bit frustrating because it feels like my experiences of racism and anti-semitism are being ignored.

Personally, hearing these statements from other visible minorities just makes me think they're a bit sheltered and naive. I'm not offended, though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm ethnically ambiguous and I'd wait for it to come up or mention your own heritage first. For some reason, people ask ethnically ambiguous people what our ethnicity/race is all the time and it can get kind of exhausting to constantly have to answer those questions, especially when the person asking just ends the conversation once they got their answer. Plus you never know how people will react to your answer, which makes answering a bit nerve-wracking. 

There's one exception to this and that's when someone asks if I'm part of their ethnicity. That avoids a lot of awkwardness and feeling like someone's doubting my citizenship as a Canadian. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Who's considered white isn't set in stone and it really depends on who you talk to and where you're from. White supremacists tend to take a fairly narrow definition of whiteness, sometimes to the point where you have to be ethnically German or ethnically Nordic to be considered white and have to be the right kind of Christian. This is especially true for people who connect whiteness to certain nationalities. At best, white supremacists might consider Jews who identify as white fake white people.

The other part is that Jews seem to move between being white and not being white depending on the situation. It's not uncommon for Jews to be excluded from all-white spaces during segregation but considered white (with some exceptions) for census purposes. 

It becomes even more complicated because Jews aren't uniformly white. Some Jews, such as myself, are much more Middle Eastern looking so a white supremacist could use my existence to deny the whiteness of a Jew with blond hair and blue eyes since we're the same ethnicity. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've never been in a straight relationship but a big thing is that there's no blueprint for how gay relationships work. My boyfriend and I talked about what our division of labour is rather than falling into gender roles. 

Another thing is that you have to navigate family and being in public as a couple. At some point, gay couples have to have a conversation about what their relationship with their family is like. Then you have to sort out how you'll deal with family and that might come with hurt feelings if one partner has an accepting family and the other doesn't. 

Being in public as a gay couple is very different from being a straight couple. I'm afraid of holding my boyfriend's hand in non-queer spaces or even just being obviously a couple because I don't want to get attacked or put him in a situation where he might get attacked. Things like going on dates to a restaurant can kind of suck because you have to deal with people staring or making comments. My boyfriend and I tend to have dates at home so we don't have to deal with that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> YTA. I know you didn't intent to make a racist joke but the joke was still iffy, especially since you're not super close with him and, as far as I can tell, he doesn't make jokes about his own skin colour. When you're not white in a majority white area, people make these types of jokes all the time. Some of them are from people who think they're being clever for pointing out that someone's not white and others are people who use jokes as a way to express genuinely racist beliefs in a more socially acceptable fashion. 

Your joke may have been extra iffy if your country has a history of having African immigrants taking manual labour jobs or if FFA comes from a country where having dark skin is associated with poverty.

Lastly, just because the target of the joke doesn't tell you they're uncomfortable with it, that doesn't mean they're okay with you joking about their skin colour. I've laughed at some pretty racist jokes at the expense of my name, skin colour, and religion because I didn't want to rock the boat or come off as too sensitive or unreasonable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I understand the fear of coming out to your parents is a massive ordeal. But how do you deal with the idea your parents will reject your claim and say its a phase?

I was very scared of the possibility of my parents rejecting me. It's scary to understand that your parents' love for you is conditional and that you're inevitably going to do something that will test just how conditional their love for you is. I dealt with the possible claims that it's a phase by only coming out when I was absolutely sure of myself and armed with the knowledge that I acted pretty gay as a little kid. Luckily, my parents accepted me and never questioned my sexuality.

How did the dynamic change between your extended family and you after you came out?

I have a pretty traditional post-Soviet Jewish family so they weren't exactly thrilled. Some were borderline violent and I haven't voluntarily interacted with them since I came out. Others are just disparaging or ignore me, which hurts but is fine by me. My younger relatives were more okay with me and they're the people I still voluntarily interact with.

Do you think pride month helps or hurts perceptions of LGBTQ+ members?

I think Pride month is so corporatized that it just shows queer people and allies as potential consumers. It's nice that companies feel they can dedicate entire lines of product which are rainbow-themed just to be sold in June but I also feel like it can erase queer history by making it just about pretty displays and fun colours. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm from a conservative part of Canada and there's been lots of change in the last five or so years. When I was a kid, a semi-popular activity for drunk people was to go down to the gay bars and throw beer bottles at people leaving. Now, that almost never happens. There's also a lot less casual homophobia and a lot more openly queer people. As a young teen, I thought I would have to move to another province if I wanted to live openly. I still live in the same province I grew up in. 

I still don't feel 100% safe but I feel so much safer than I did when I was growing up. Since 2016 I don't feel as safe as I did in the prior two or three years but it's a lot better than it was in 2010. 

also if u know someone thats homopobic (family member in my case), what can you do about it. should i just let him believe what he wants to believe?

It really depends on the family member. Generally, though, I'd recommend telling them to knock it off. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When people talk about Jews controlling the media, it's almost never just pointing out there's lots of Jews who work in the media or an interest in the history of Jews in American media but rather part of a larger contingency of anti-Semitic beliefs. 

For one thing, the idea that Jews control the media comes from The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a piece of anti-Semitic propaganda which details a number of conspiracy theories about Jews taking over the world in the form of a shadowy cabal. Jews controlling the media is just one of those various ways Jews are supposedly trying to take over the world.

The idea that Jews control the media is also often linked to other anti-Semitic tropes such as Jews have dual loyalty or are only loyal to other Jews (or Israel) so Jews working in the media aren't working in the best interests of Americans but rather in their own self-interests. There's also people who think Jews in the media are trying to do away with western or family values, which sometimes includes things like believing Jews in the media are causing kids to turn gay or encouraging atheism. Some also think Jews use the media to propagate pro-communist messages. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My parents eventually came around but most of my family hasn't. I got tons of strange justifications but they broadly broke down into a few categories.

For my parents, it was that they had no idea how to talk to feminine gay guys. They knew gay people before me but they had never met a femme gay guy and thus only had outdated movie tropes to deal with. They eventually overcame this awkwardness and things are back to normal.

For my older extended family, there was a weird amount of anti-western sentiment involved in the homophobia. Almost all of my older relatives are immigrants from former Soviet countries (mostly Russia with a few from Central Asia) and some felt that homosexuality is something that only exists in the west. A great uncle said that if they hadn't immigrated, I wouldn't be gay because "being born in Canada turned \[me\] into a faggot".

A smaller contingency believed that it's not okay to be gay because God, with a subsection of those people saying it's only okay for non-Jews to be gay.

But the largest amount of homophobia just came from people having a strict definition of what men should be like. I come from a very working class family that values masculinity for everyone, regardless of gender and male homosexuality completely flies in the face of that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For me, pride is about celebrating LGBT culture and the achievements of LGBT rights and people. On a more personal level, it's about being proud about overcoming homophobia and personal struggles relating to being queer. 

Personally, I use pride to celebrate coming out, which is the hardest thing I've ever done (it literally took me two years to figure out how to come out and I massively restructured my life in anticipation of it going badly) and have never had another time to talk about and pat myself on the back. 

If this idea were to come across an gay persons mind would they think "I am not proud to be gay I simply am" was a negative thought?

It obviously depends on the person but I think this situation is slightly more complicated for gay people. I'm not proud to be gay but I'm proud of things relating to being gay. I've also never had the experience of "simply being" because for femme gay men such as myself, my sexual orientation has always impacted how people interacted with me in a way I don't think it does for straight people. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the argument is against not having them march in the parade, not just having them present for things like crowd control. It's also important to note that this is more dependent on the city. In my city, people are more okay with the police marching in Pride because they've really toned down their homophobic policies and stances in the last decade or so. However, for cities like Toronto, the LGBT community is pretty mad at the police for failing to act on numerous reports of a serial killer within the gay village so they don't want the police to march.

There's also the issue of police departments who are known for being shitty to LGBT officers. The RCMP, Canada's national police service, is seemingly constantly being taken to court for homophobia, sexism, racism, and harassment against its non-straight, white, male members. Some people, myself included, don't want the RCMP to march in Pride because they clearly don't treat their LGBT officers well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's two issues, both stemming from the risk that illegal immigrants won't answer the census for fear of being found out.

The first is areas with lots of illegal immigrants won't get enough funding for things like schools because the government will think there's fewer people in an area than there actually are, and will reduce the funding accordingly.

The second is representation and gerrymandering. Not only will some areas be allotted fewer representatives for more people, there's also a risk that districts will be redrawn based on citizen population, rather than the total number of people who live in the area. If that happens, areas with lots of illegal immigrants risk being included in decisions when gerrymandering districts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's just a description for ideas or concepts we invented (ex. law, economics, how many months there are in a year, etc.) or already existing things we have ascribed meaning to (ex. race, gender, etc.). These things impact our daily lives.

Describing things as a social construct isn't a value judgement; it's just a description of where its meaning comes from, kind of like how describing a shirt as being made out of cotton isn't saying the shirt is better or worse than a shirt that's made out of another material. It also doesn't mean social constructs don't matter or that we shouldn't care about them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It really depends on the context. I don't like it when people use it to describe bad or shitty things because it reinforces the idea that gay = bad. I also find it lazy because it's 2019 and who calls things gay anymore and there's an assload of other ways to describe bad things without calling them gay.

I'm fine when people call things gay that are either typically "gay", like glitters or rainbows or using it to describe nice things, since that usage doesn't reinforce already existing negative ideas about homosexuality. </TEXT>

Personally, I didn't know I'm kind of trashy until I went to university and hung out with middle and upper class people.

I find it invasive, especially when it comes from people I don't or hardly know. It's not that I'm not ashamed about my ethnicity; it's that I don't want to continually justify who I am to randos on the street or feel like I need to satisfy some stranger's curiosity about me. Also, I don't want to put myself in a position where the answer I give ends up with the person who asked making anti-Semitic or Islamophobic comments, or insinuates that I'm not actually a Canadian (despite being born and raised here). </TEXT>

<TEXT> It really depends on the city and if you find parades boring in general. Some parades are just boring and others are more fun. My city happens to have a pretty fun parade and part of that is that it's customary for everyone to join in at the end and walk to the end, where all the food trucks are. It's not also not super long so it's good for people like me who have a short attention span.

Personally, what I find fun about Pride is dressing up in ways I normally wouldn't, holding my boyfriend's hand in public, seeing other people having a great time, and the floats typically aren't a bunch of banks and corporations letting us know they still exist. Plus, there's lots of dogs in the parade. </TEXT>

A big thing was that they believed me being gay wasn't just my own personal failing; it was that my family fucked me up. Those who disowned me felt they were, in a really fucked up way, encouraging me to stop behaviours they think are wrong. According to them, supportive people were basically enablers so disowning me was like refusing to take your alcoholic aunt to the liquor store.

They also disowned people who are supportive because they're part of the problem. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The worst part is it becomes so ingrained and is such a universal experience for women, that when it DOESNT happen a lot of women feel embarrassed/ashamed/distressed too.

My mom likes to tell a story about how she got catcalled a few months after she had my little sister. For her, it was a very affirming experience because she felt she "still got it", even though she had two kids. 

She also talks about missing being catcalled now that she's in her late 40s, because she feels invisible or like she's just a mom.

I don't think she realizes how fucked up those stories are, especially since she looks back on those times with a lot of fondness. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think Pride and total acceptance are mutually exclusive. Pride is as much about celebrating LGBT history and the achievements of early LGBT activists as it is about demonstrating that people can be LGBT without shame (hence the name). If and when LGBT people are totally included in society, it's still important to remember that history and honour the people who got us to that point/will get us to that point. 

Also, Pride wasn't, and for the most part isn't, a PR stunt to get the rest of society on board with LGBT people. We have the rest of our lives to do that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pride celebrates all facets of queer life, including more NSFW aspects. Also, kink communities were some of the first allies so they get to be involved. 

I disagree that they're being sexual for the sake of being sexual. Who gets to be involved in Pride is typically rooted in history (except when companies are involved). It makes sense that people displaying their sexuality more openly since it's something LGB people have in common and sexually charged places used to be some of the new places queer people could congregate. It's also the one thing we all have in common. </TEXT>

I felt like I had to "translate" the lives of straight people to my own life, especially when it came to romance.

Meanwhile, I'm a lot less fussed with not seeing people of my ethnic group in media because I have real life proof that those people exist and can be successful. I've never felt like I was the only person of my ethnic group because I grew up surrounded by them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My family's not super religious but, when I was about 13, they decided to go to synagogue on Purim for some reason. Part of Purim involves reading from the Book of Esther, which has a part about Esther coming to see the king while he's sitting on his throne in the throne room and when he sees her, he stands up and extends the golden sceptre. 

When the rabbi got to that part, my 13 year old brain pictured Esther coming to see the king while he's sitting on the shitter and burst out laughing. No one else laughed. Instead, everyone turned to stare at me and I had to explain myself to an entire room of people.

We now celebrate Purim in the comfort of my parents' home. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really want to get married because I want all the legal shit and connotations that comes along with marriage. Where I'm from, civil unions were put in place as a stepping stone to implementing same sex marriage and don't have the same benefits. I'm gay so getting married means getting to use those fancy new rights people had to go through the courts to get and civil unions just feels like settling for the next best thing.

Also, I suspect getting married would make my relationship seem more serious. I've been with my boyfriend for over a year but most of my family doesn't invite him to family events (even though they invite everyone else's boyfriends and girlfriends, regardless of how short those relationships are) or even call him my boyfriend (they prefer "little friend"). </TEXT>

I'm not entirely sure why I sound that way but I think it comes from spending most of my childhood almost exclusively hanging out with girls so I subconsciously picked up their mannerisms and speech patterns. I also sounded very gay as a young child.

<TEXT> I absolutely disagree, except for maybe religious people who think that same sex attraction is something you have to fight against/is a test from God, which is definitely not my uncle since he's pretty secular. I think it's more people who believe that people are born straight and choose to be gay either because they want to be special or weren't getting any with the opposite sex. Being gay is a pretty foreign concept for some people, especially for people who grew up in areas where being gay is presented as a "western" thing (which is the case for my older relatives). My older relatives are absolutely convinced no Russian is born gay and I'm gay because I was born and grew up in Canada, where I was lead astray. If only closeted gay or bi people think being gay is a choice, than my entire family would be gay.

Also, as someone who was closeted, it becomes pretty clear that being gay is not a choice. I was choosing to present myself as straight but that sure as shit didn't make me straight and I only thought I was straight because I was in denial. Being gay was less of a choice and more of a disease in my self-hating mind. Why would I choose something that I was actively fighting against? And even when I was convincing myself I was straight, there was no choosing going on, just denial. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I came out, my uncle went on a drunken tirade that perfectly explained why he's homophobic. For him, his hatred/unease around gay people came from being raised by people who came from a country where homosexuality was illegal so he saw it as something criminal. According to him, everyone is straight by default and chooses to become gay, just like how everyone is born not having committed any crimes, then chose to commit crimes later on. The AIDS crisis emboldened these views.

He's also pretty sexist and really values traditional gender roles. Being gay goes against traditional gender roles, which is wrong in his mind. He's slightly more okay with masculine gay men and feminine gay women because they "act the way men and women should act" but definitely isn't okay with feminine gay men and masculine gay women. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's probably different for everyone but for me, it was a way for me to explore my self-expression. When I was closeted, I spent a lot of my mental energy doing whatever I could to not appear gay, so when I came out I had to figure out how to act like myself. For some reason, dying my hair blue (which I don't do anymore), piercing my ear, and getting a few tattoos was part of that process.

Meanwhile, my ex-boyfriend's idea was (is?) that he's already outside the norm and people are going to treat him differently no matter how normal he looks so he can basically look as weird as he wants. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In some places, like where I live, the whole gay acceptance thing happened in the last five years which meant that I was in high school when I realized I didn't have to be ashamed of being gay. Coming out was, in a way, overcoming the shame of spending the vast majority of my life being explicitly told being gay was wrong.

There's also partners to think about. I wasn't in a relationship when I came out but being out made it so much easier to introduce boyfriends to my family since they expected it and I didn't have to worry about them losing their shit on me since they already know that I like men. You also don't realize how much people talk about their boyfriends/girlfriends/spouses until you don't get to talk about yours. Part of coming out is you get to freely join in those conversations.

Lastly, for us femme guys (and I assume masculine ladies), part of being in the closet is constantly having to worry about sounding and acting gay, which gets very mentally exhausting very quickly. Coming out means no longer having to constantly monitor your voice, overanalyzing the clothes you wear, the way you move your hands, the way you walk, etc. and that takes a lot of stress out of your life. </TEXT>

I can still "talk straight" but I only do so in situations where I don't feel comfortable being myself or if I need to sound really professional.

As for where I came from, I'm not really sure. My best guess is I spent most of my formative years exclusively hanging out with girls and developed their speech patterns. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've seen a couple criticisms coming from different people.

The first is his use of "postmodern cultural Marxism", which gets hate from people who find it a redundant and contradictory term, since postmodernists and Marxists historically have had some fundamental disagreements (and postmodernism in part grew out of issues with Marxism). It also gets hate from people who've made the connection between it and cultural Bolshevism, which was an anti-Semitic term used by Nazis to refer to Jews, which has made some people think he might be using anti-Semitic dogwhistles. 

He also gets lots of hate in the social sciences for basically spewing complete nonsense and coming across as not knowing anything he's talking about. If he does say something at least correct, it's almost never anything new.

Then there's his complete misunderstanding of the Canadian bill C-16, which warranted a [reply from a prof at the top law school in Canada](http://sds.utoronto.ca/blog/bill-c-16-no-its-not-about-criminalizing-pronoun-misuse/) to point out how that type of legislation works. This may not be big if you're  not Canadian, but his claims that you can be jailed for using the wrong pronoun have been used to fuel transphobia here and completely misrepresents how the Charter of Rights and Freedoms works.

And then there's his books, which come across as not being very substantive or just weird, as [one National Post writer found](https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/i-tried-to-live-life-according-to-jordan-petersons-12-rules-for-life-heres-what-happened). (If you're not Canadian, the National Post is a centre-right newspaper.)

Finally, there's his statements about women (which the National Post covers), which come across as being both weird and sexist.

I don't necessarily agree with all these views but they're just criticisms I've come across. </TEXT>

My family was making cracks about my sexuality far before I knew I was gay because I acted so feminine as a little kid. Once I went to school, I had to suppress it because my parents made it very clear it's not acceptable for a little boy to act like that.

I've been acting more feminine since I came out but I still haven't gone back to being as feminine as I was as a kid. I'm still dealing with the shame related to it, even though I've been out for four years.

This is all well and good but the risk is that people who are "centrist" refuse to stand up when one side is doing something egregious, which sometimes makes these "centrists" come off as not seeing that behaviour as being bad or sometimes being sympathetic towards it.

<TEXT> Schools in poor neighbourhoods really put their students at a disadvantage. For example, I went to the elementary school with the lowest provincial test results in my province (as in not a single person passed the grade 6 math test). Because our math education was so bad, it was much harder for kids to get into the high school math classes that you need to get into university, and especially difficult to get into STEM programs. My school also didn't have computers, even though I started school in 2002 so if you were into computers, your only hope was that the public library's computers were working and available.

Living in poverty also isn't great for your health so many of my classmates suffered from asthma and/or mental health issues that the school couldn't handle. It's hard to concentrate on your already shitty education when half your class is acting out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some departments like the FBI or equivalent do victimization surveys, where they ask a substantial sample of the population whether they were victimized in a certain time period. The thought is that people are more willing to tell a random researcher that they were victimized, especially if the crime is minor enough that they don't think they need to contact the police or if the perpetrator is someone really close to the victim. 

Once the survey is taken, the numbers are checked against police records and the difference between crimes the police are aware of and crimes people mentioned being victims of on the survey is the estimate of the actual number of crimes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For starters, postmodern neo-Marxist makes no sense. Postmodernists hate Marxists and Marxists hate postmodernists. Postmodernism also came about partially as a response to problems they saw in Marxism.

As for whether universities decimating far left ideas, it really depends on the university. I've never had a prof who liked postmodernism but I have had profs who liked Marxist criminology. 

There's also a difference between promoting postmodernism or Marxism and supporting it. It's common for political science, economics, sociology, and history to talk about Marxism and postmodernism because it's shaped a lot of more contemporary thinkers/events. That doesn't mean the profs believe it in; it's just that if you don't discuss it, you'll be incredibly lost. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My grandfather's brother's funeral kicked off the Great Tombstone Debacle of 2009. 

My grandfather's brother, Sergei, was a hoser who never kept a steady job and drank a lot. He was also known for playing the banjo and supporting the Saskatchewan Roughriders. After Sergei died, my grandfather and another of their brothers, Valery, somehow ended up designing his tombstone. It has his name, a little picture of him, his date of birth and death, and a giant banjo with the Saskatchewan Roughriders logo on it. 

Sergei's wife and kids did not approve of the banjo tombstone. No one else in the family liked it either. Once it came out that my grandfather and Valery were responsible for this abomination, the non-tombstone-approving family members ganged up on them and it ended with a fist fight in the cemetery parking lot.

Since then, the rest of the family has tried to remove the banjo tombstone. As far as I'm concerned, it's still there and Sergei's wife is still mad at my grandfather and Valery. Since my grandfather died, she's now taking her beef out on my grandmother, which is now playing out on Facebook. She also refused to attend Valery's wife's funeral. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It doesn't even matter how good your source is. Unless the entire human population is included in the study, the sample size is too small (unless they're citing a source that corresponds with their view, in which case a sample size of 4 seems okay). Also, surveys are always unreliable and it's not a good idea to actually read the source. If you don't like the source, always criticize it on methodological grounds. Bonus points for the source taking into account those criticisms.

I also don't think anyone on this site knows what correlation means. Correlation doesn't mean causation but most studies are looking for correlation (or a relationship between X and Y). I'm really fucking sick of people pulling out the old "correlation does not equal causation" for things that have no correlation, like vaccines and autism. A correlation between vaccines and autism would mean that anti-vaxxers have a point. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The original flag was designed by Gilbert Baker and it flew at San Francisco Pride in 1978. It became popular after Harvey Milk was assassinated a couple months later.

Where Baker got his idea is up for debate. It's possible he got it from the Judy Garland song "Over the Rainbow". It may have also come from a modified rainbow flag that university kids in the 1960s hung to promote world peace. Either way, the idea is to celebrate the diversity of the LGBT community. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Queer basically has three definitions. It can be used as a synonym for not-straight/not-cisgender (which means not transgender). It can also be its own identity that's separate from lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender, which is why it's in the longer LGBT acronym. Lastly, it can be used as an insult towards LGBT people. 

Usage of queer is a bit of a divisive topic within the LGBT community. Some people are totally cool with being called queer, calling themselves queer, and calling other LGBT people queer. Other people only see it as an insult and try to stay away from it as much as possible. Personally, I tend to associate it with as an insult and don't call myself queer but will call other people queer if they're okay with it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's pretty hard to culturally appropriate something that was imposed on you or is a commodity. European (especially British) culture made its way around the world because they colonized a huge chunk of the world. American culture is one of the US's major exports. In some places, there's even protections in place to make sure the local culture isn't completely overshadowed by American culture. In both those cases, the culture ends up somewhere else because they wanted it to, not because someone more powerful took it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not sure what you're working with but I think the idea holds regardless of sex. Personally, I've had really good results with moisturizing right after I get out of the shower after shaving. I use a face moisturizer because it's thinner and having thicker moisturizer down there doesn't feel great. It's also kinder on ball skin since you don't need to use so much force.

Most importantly, moisturize everyday. This applies to any other part of your body. If you have lots of time, moisturize right after you shower and right before you go to bed. Also, don't wait for your downstairs area to get dry before you moisturize every day. I start my daily moisturizing routine right after the first snow, which is typically in early October where I live. 

Also, find a moisturizer that works for you. You'll probably have to try a couple until you find the one. I would steer away from oily moisturizers because that can promote swamp ass and seems to increase balls getting pinched. </TEXT>

The second one is coming out means you get to have access to the LGBT community. You get to surround yourself with like-minded people, potential partners, and resources to deal with whatever problems life throws at you.

The last one is I wasn't 100% confident my parents would be totally accepting so I wanted a big coming out instead of making a little comment.

Teachers (many of whom had a reputation for being pretty racist towards the largely immigrant student body) would stay for about two years at the most and my grade 2 teacher straight up quit midway through the year. On top of that, lots of kids moved around so classmates came and went, making it hard to make friends. Plus lots of those kids had psychological issues that everyone lacked the resources to address. Needless to say we weren't getting the best education. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's a couple reasons. The first is that it's kind of tone deaf since it implies that everyone can code (and I can speak from experience that not everyone has those skills), wants to code, would fit in with that type of professional environment, and that it's a guaranteed pathway to success (whereas the skills you get from being a journalist is useless, especially a journalist who deals with social issues).

The second is that the sheer number of people telling journalists who were laid off "learn to code" seems really weird and bizarrely targeted. Because there's so many people tweeting the same thing to the same people, it doesn't come across as genuine career advice but rather a campaign of harassment. 

The third is who is picking up on this story. When I was looking up this incident, I encountered a lot of articles which are making fun of people who aren't down with being spammed "learn to code", often calling them sensitive or offended. A fair number of these articles came from sources known for their right wing views. This, combined with the people being spammed, has caused some to believe it's a targeted campaign of harassment by alt-right trolls.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> This isn't always true in poor neighbourhoods (and I'm taking ghettos, not areas full of university students), where grocery stores often aren't established. Vegetables and fruits themselves may not be expensive but when you have to take the costs of public transit (and in some really ghetto areas, this means taking at least two buses each way) and the time it takes to get to a neighbourhood that actually has grocery stores, they become a lot more expensive and prohibitive. Meanwhile, a lot of poor neighbourhoods have little corner stores that don't have produce sections and since they're within walking distance, poor people go there instead. For the longest time, the closest produce section to me was a half hour bus ride and involved having to spend $6.30 just to get there and back, which is a lot when you're poor.

And that's not even getting into the fact that finding a place with a functioning kitchen is a seemingly impossible task in these areas. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's a couple reasons and space is not one of them. The first is the way the immigration system is set up (I don't know much about the American one but I can tell you about the Canadian system). Canada has a points system, in which immigrants must meet a certain amount of points in term of education, language ability, job prospects, etc. to get in. The majority of immigrants in Canada are here for jobs and when they bring in their families, they're expected to get jobs within the year (with certain exceptions. No one's forcing grandma to get a job). In places like France, most immigrants are from former colonies and aren't from middle or upper class backgrounds like most immigrants in Canada are. 

The second is the composition of the US and Canada. Both are countries of immigrants and don't have a vast majority of one ethnic group. Native born Americans and Canadians are ethnically fairly diverse already and immigrants come from all over the world. Most European countries only get immigrants (by which I mean people from non-EU countries) from only one or two other countries and one ethnic group tends to be the majority.

The third is the way our citizenship systems are set up. Because the US and Canada are colonies, you get citizenship from being born in the country or applying for citizenship. Most European countries require having a parent or grandparent who is a citizen to gain citizenship, which makes it much harder for non-European immigrants to fully integrate since, depending on the country, neither they nor their kids will get citizenship and thus won't be able to fully participate in society.

The last one is more specific to non-Christian immigrants and it's that the US and Canada (although it's more a Canadian thing than an American thing) don't have prior ties to conflicts between native-born Christians and foreign Muslims/Jews since the Ottoman empire never made it to the Americas.

<TEXT> It's had to be updated because Du Bois's definition is very 1935, so there's lots of discussions of Jim Crow laws and disenfranchisement of black people. Today, white privilege is more about the outcomes of what Du Bois was talking about, which Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack is kind of getting at. Most studies straight up mention Du Bois's definition in the methods section.

The key thing is that Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack is basically a first year textbook in article form. It introduces an already studied concept in a way that's easy for people who don't have an academic background to understand. It rarely gets mentioned outside of first year classes and doesn't form the basis of too many studies. </TEXT>

If you have access to Google Scholar, you'll be able to find some quantitative studies. A good example is one called An Empirical Analysis of White Privilege, Social Position, and Health. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's two reasons. The first is that you get all kinds of shitty responses when you refer to your boyfriend/girlfriend as your boyfriend/girlfriend when you're gay. It's more comfortable to refer to them as your partner since you're not explicitly saying you're gay and thus don't need to deal with random homophobia. I only call my boyfriend my boyfriend in very specific situations with specific people for that very reason.

The second is more of a thing for places where there's no same-sex marriage. If you can't get married but are living with your SO like you're married, boyfriend/girlfriend isn't the right term for them. Partner, on the other hand, implies a more marriage-like relationship. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Statistics for social sciences II. Most of the class was done on computers except the final, which was one of those tests where every question builds on the previous one. The first question involved filling in some output from a fictitious dataset and all subsequent questions were based the answers in the first question. If you fucked up the first one, you couldn't redeem yourself in the rest of the test. 

Also, if you got lower than a C- in that class, you got kicked out of the program.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I work in a warehouse and we get a lot of extra orders coming in around this time. My boss also lets employees who celebrate Christmas have some time off, which means we have about half the number of people working (about half the employees are Jews, Muslims, or Sikhs) but twice the amount of work to do. But do we get time off for whatever family oriented holidays we celebrate? Of course not. 

And don't get me started on how not celebrating Christmas sucks when you're the only kid in your class who doesn't celebrate it. You get to do all kinds of crafts at school that you bring home and are immediately chucked in the garbage because Jews don't need a bunch of macaroni Santa ornaments laying around. Plus your classmates ask you a bunch of insensitive questions (no, Madison, Jews don't have horns) and your teachers get mad at you for not being way into the Christmas spirit and being unable to complete all the Christmas-themed writing assignments. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hasidic Jews wear that style of clothes because they believe them to be modest and follow Talmudic teachings. The big fur hates are worn by married men and the unmarried sons of rabbis. They used to be popular among all Eastern European Jews but as of late, Hasidic Jews seem to be the only people who still wear them.

The scarves are probably tallits. They're worn during prayer and other special occasions, like weddings. Some rabbis wear them all day.

It's only Hasidic Jews who are required to dress like that. Other sects of Judaism have less strict dress codes and some seem to only require you to wear a kippah/yamulke while in synagogue.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> The first little bit of gentrification is okay. Grocery stores might move in and schools improve somewhat but the general character of the neighbourhood is still intact and the original residents can still afford to live there.

The problem comes at the later stages, when the original residents are seen as a burden and have to leave. This includes things like landlords allowing old buildings to become dilapidated so they can sell the land and kick out the people who live there, original businesses going out of business, those grocery stores becoming too expensive for the original residents to afford, and the new residents calling the cops for things that never was a problem before. The lower income residents then have to move to shittier, poorer neighbourhoods with worse schools and no grocery stores.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The first step I take is to write an outline for the points you're going to make further in your essay, then find overarching themes. In your case, examples of an overarching theme include 19th century legal professionals and their views on women. These two themes are the backbone of the thesis. 

The next step is to narrow down your argument (ex. that 19th century legal professionals did not see women as being as truthful as men). 

The third step is to combine your overarching themes with your argument. For example, you may want to say that 19th century legal professionals (theme 1) viewed women (theme 2) as being less truthful (argument). It may come across as being overly simplistic but the goal of a thesis statement is to clearly tell the reader what the paper is going to be about.

The fourth step is putting the sentence in thesis formate. You may want to start it with "in this essay I will argue...", "I will argue that..." or if you have to follow a specific research method, "through the use of \[methodology\], I will show that..."

The last step is testing out your thesis. I find going over your thesis and outline for the paper with your prof/TA, depending on who's marking it, is a good idea. State your thesis when you meeting with them ("I'm writing about how 19th century legal professionals viewed women as being less truthful and I just want to make sure I'm on the right track..."). At this point, you'll find out if it's too broad or doesn't encompass your points well enough.

TL;DR: The thesis is basically an elevator pitch for your essay. </TEXT>

As a kid, it meant I was the only kid who didn't celebrate it so I couldn't do a lot of the assignments immediately post-Christmas break, which usually involved teachers having a meeting with my parents. I also didn't know any of the Christmas carols we had to sing in school.

As an adult, it means that the holidays which are relevant to me almost always takes place over exam break. When I worked with lots of Christians and atheists, Christmas time was when I usually had to work overtime because that's when all my coworkers were with their families. I now work with a bunch of Muslims and Sikhs, which makes the holidays much more tolerable.  </TEXT>

I think it's a combination of both. I'm naturally more feminine, probably because I spent most of my formative years primarily hanging out with girls. But when I first came out, I was a lot more feminine than I am now because I had to hold it in for nearly 2 decades and I finally felt free to express myself. 

Also, when guys are feminine, it's more pronounced because they're guys and it's not expected.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I haven't lost my shit over it but I totally understand why people would be very into LGBT representation. When I was growing up, I knew of almost no gay celebrities and there were almost no gay people on TV. Before I was allowed to watch more "adult" media, I literally thought I was the only boy to have ever existed since the beginning of time to like other boys. Once I grew up a bit, I knew of exactly 4 gay people: me, Ellen, Marge Simpson's sister Patty, and Dale Gribble's dad and two of those are cartoon characters.

When you're young and closeted, seeing other real queer people is a bit like finding out you're not the only person who survived a zombie apocalypse. Seeing those people being successful is a big deal and there's a hope their work might lead to greater acceptance of LGBT people. </TEXT>

There's no telling whether the people you went into the co-op with will be there in 6 months or a year. You don't know if you're going to be there in 6 months. And that assumes that you trust your neighbours, which isn't that common in high crime poor neighbourhoods.

It also doesn't solve the problem of there not being a good source of food to begin with. You might get all the infrastructure ready but the closest Costco might be an hour and a half away and no one owns a car. Your $10 bag of rice might be twice as expensive when you consider transit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The bar for throwing our sexuality in straight people's faces seems to be incredibly low. I mention my boyfriend in passing while telling a completely innocent story and people get all offended but no one gets upset when my coworker talks non-stop about how him and his wife are trying for a kid.

<TEXT> For women, it's generally easier to tell because they travel in packs and hit on gay men. I mostly assume that women in a gay bar are straight and are trying to get away from creepy straight guys or celebrating some event.

It's a bit harder for men, especially when the bar's main clientele are men. I've definitely hit on straight guys before but when they're exclusively talking to women or look a bit offended/standoffish, I assume they're straight and avoid them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was boy obsessed in high school. Whenever I saw a boy who was remotely attractive, I did some serious Facebook stalking to find out if he was gay. I'm talking going three years deep into his pictures and combing his friends list to find any hint that he might like other boys. Once I got definitive proof that he's straight, I mentally dropped his ass like a sack of moldy potatoes and moved on.

I eventually dated the only other openly gay kid at my high school for a year and I haven't been boy obsessed since.  </TEXT>

I've been out for a couple years now and I still get some anxiety whenever someone asks me about my personal life. Do I lie? Do I deflect and say I'm single, then hope the conversation ends?

<TEXT> When you're poor, you divide things you spend money into two categories: one time payments (like tattoos or shoes) and continuous payments (like food or rent). On the off chance you come into a chunk of change that isn't taken up by expenses, that's your chance to splurge on something like a tattoo. Placing that money into long term things like food doesn't change much in the long run because eventually it runs out. Either way, life doesn't get measurably better, except when you get a tattoo you at least get the pleasure of having a tattoo.

Also, they're probably not prioritizing tattoos over food. It's just that posting on Facebook that you have food or paid your rent is pretty boring and not something worth sharing so it looks like they're putting tattoos before food.

As for cigarettes (and I don't smoke so I might be wrong about this), it's an addiction or a way to deal with mental health issues when getting legitimate help with mental health issues isn't an option. Addictions are pretty hard to break, especially when your life is stressful.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Coming out. 

Being closeted was terrible for my mental health. I was constantly vigilant about how I acted, dressed, and sounded because I was so concerned about appearing straight. I was lonely (before I came out, there was only one other openly gay kid in my high school of nearly 2100 kids and spent the vast majority of my childhood and adolescence not knowing a single gay person) and felt that I was unable to reach out to other gay people for fear of outing myself. I was depressed to the point where I briefly thought I wouldn't be able to get into university because I couldn't concentrate and my grades were shit. 

Now that I'm out, I feel a lot more free. I don't give a shit if people think I'm gay because it's not something I need to hide (although there are limitations since I work in a bit of homophobic environment). I can dress and act the way I want. I was able to seek help for my depression. I'm still a bit lonely and I still don't know any other gay people but it's not as crushing. Plus my immediate family was accepting, which certainly helped.  </TEXT>

We had a pretty major HIV/AIDS epidemic within the gay community during '80s and a bit in the '90s, which fuelled a lot homophobia surrounding it. Even though it's been nearly 30 years since the epidemic, we still have this belief that it's something that happens to gay people and drug users so it's not worth educating the broader straight, not drug using population on. It would definitely be nice for it to be more included in sex ed, both to prevent misconceptions like the one my boyfriend had and to get rid of the homophobia surrounding it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Cultural appropriation takes something that's extremely important or sacred to a culture and removes it from its context by another culture. For example, if I, a Canadian, decided to take an American flag and used it as a beach towel because I think it looks cool, then that's cultural appropriation. It involves taking something important (the American flag) out of its context (representing America and American values) and using it in a culturally insensitive way (sitting on it, reducing it to a cool looking piece of fabric). If I wanted to engage in more cultural appropriation, I would then turn around and mock Americans who fly the American flag and celebrate July 4th.

Cultural appreciation, on the other hand, tends to not involve particularly sacred things and are kept within their context. Keeping with the America example, it's not cultural appropriation for someone who's not American to eat hamburgers. Hamburgers aren't sacred and for the most part, and hamburger restaurants abroad are opened by Americans/American corporations with the express purpose of people from other cultures eating hamburgers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's one of those things that if it hasn't happened to you, it's a bit hard to understand but I'll do my best.

For me, one of the things that really made me confused about my sexuality as a kid/teenager was the lack of gay people around. I understood falling in love for straight people but I didn't for gay people because I wasn't exposed to that. I didn't know if my crushes on boys were crushes because I didn't know what that's supposed to look like. For all I knew, I was the first and last person to ever exist who liked the same sex.

Once I got older, any arousal to guys was met with an "oh no, maybe I'm gay" response rather than a "I'm guess I'm gay" response. That lead to lots of denial, which can cloud your judgement. 

It's also a bit harder (heh) to fully deduce if you're attracted to guys/girls by using straight porn because there's one of each. Combine that with teenagers' abilities to get aroused at absolutely everything and you get some confusion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm from Alberta. 

The big thing that I noticed is that doctors just don't trust me that whatever pain I'm in is legitimate. For example, I get migraines and while they're not bad, they can be pretty frequent. It took forever to find a doctor who didn't think I was making it up to get a prescription or who didn't blame it on unhealthy habits that I don't have (like excessive drinking or smoking). 

Sometimes they're pretty condescending. Like, I'm not so stupid that I'm incapable of following simple directions on a bottle of pills.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My province didn't introduce LGBT content into sex ed the year after I graduated. I didn't pay attention in sex ed because everything was framed in terms of a guy and a girl so I figured that information wasn't relevant to me. Clearly my first boyfriend took a similar approach because he thought HIV spontaneously generated when two dudes had sex.

Also, discussing healthy relationships in terms of one guy and one girl really fucked with my developing psyche for some reason and sometimes I still struggle with figuring out what a healthy gay relationship is.  </TEXT>

Basically what happened was someone on Tumblr joked that the Babadook is gay and then someone posted a (probably photoshopped) picture on Tumblr of the Babadook in the LGBT section of Netflix. After that, people started jokingly analyzing the movie to look for queer subtext. Eventually, some people started to not jokingly look for queer subtext and it all culminated in it becoming the symbol of 2017 pride month and a  meme on the gay internet.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My immediate family took it surprisingly well. I might be the only person whose relationship with their parents actually got stronger once they came out.

My more extended family had different reactions. My older relatives grew up in the Soviet Union, where homosexuality was illegal. They're also very working class, blue collar type people and have a fairly narrow scope for what's acceptable for a guy. I still talk to my grandparents, some of my uncles and aunts, and most of my cousins but I've had to cut out some relatives who became pretty toxic and abusive.

My friends generally took it well, too. I lost a few friends but I gained more and some friendships became stronger. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I find that it's not just older gay people who are really good at hiding who they are and have issues with feelings. I'm in my early 20s and even though I came out when I was 17, I still struggle with acknowledging genuine, unpleasant feelings, even if they have nothing to do with being gay. Part of this is why I like dating the "out and proud" type guy because I find they're a lot more genuine and open with their feelings, although there's always going to be some issues that come with spending most of your life closeted. 

Also when you come out to your parents, do you feel the need to tell your parents the liklihood of wanting to have kids? Do you ever feel guilty that you wont carry on the line nor your parenst may not have grandkids?

I came out when I was 17, which is a bit early to think about children so I didn't address this issue with my parents then. I've talked to them about it since, though, and they don't seem too bummed that I might not be able to give them grandchildren.

Personally, I'm not guilty that I might not carry on the line because I already have cousins who've taken up that role. I suspect I would feel more guilty if my cousins didn't start fucking like rabbits when they were in high school. However, I would feel bad if it turns out my sister couldn't or didn't want to have kids because that would probably mean my parents wouldn't have grandkids.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In my experience, there's three ways this could go.

The first is you compromise and take turns topping. After all, you love each other so bottoming once in a while isn't so bad.

The second is you compromise by not having anal sex at all and just stick to hand and mouth stuff.

The third is you find out that being sexually incompatible is ruining the relationship so you break up and hopefully stay friends.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Gay men: How many of you cant stand the flamboyantly gay percentage of your orientation?

I'm definitely in the minority who finds flamboyant and feminine gay men attractive. As a more feminine guy myself, I know that it's not an act and I like that they feel comfortable being their genuine selves.

All gay folk: why does it seem like yall fuck like rabbits all the time, in incredibly small circles of people?

There's obviously limitations to this (like if you live in a rural area and/or are repulsive) but it's generally because it's easier to find someone to fuck than someone to date. For gay guys, there's a whole bunch of apps that's just full of sad, lonely dudes who are down to fuck. Some gay bars and clubs are also conducive to easily hooking up.  Since there's not a whole lot of gay people, the people who are willing to fuck you and who you're willing to fuck is pretty small.

<TEXT> How do you find out what the other person is?

You can always ask. Also, if you meet a guy on an app, they'll often have it in their bio so there's no guesswork. 

Are there any tells aside from just asking?

If you're making out, sometimes you can tell from where they touch you (like if they grab your dick instead of your ass). For other people, like my ex, you can tell by the jokes they make. 

How did you find out what you are?

For me, it didn't involve any soul searching. I just realized that when I fantasized about guys and having sex with them, I mostly imagined fucking them. Then one day, I was like "I guess I'm more into being a top" and moved on with my day.

Yes but ours tends to be a bit more convincing than the accent straight people use to imitate gay people because being able to come across as straight is a survival strategy a lot of gay people use. Also, making fun of straight people doesn't seem to have the same comedic punch that making fun of gay people does.

<TEXT> Food deserts make getting fresh food super expensive, especially if you don't have a car. 

For example, up until a few years ago, there was no grocery store in my neighbourhood with a produce section. You know those random apples 7/11s have lying around? Those were the only fresh fruit you could buy within walking distance. If you wanted to buy something fresh that's not 7/11 apples, you'd have to go to the closest grocery store, which was a good half hour bus ride away. That meant you had to have $3.30 to take the bus to the produce section and $3.30 to take the bus back home. 

An added $6.60 isn't too bad for a grocery shop, right? Except when you don't have a car, you can only buy as much as you can carry and most people can't carry a week's worth of food, especially if you live with other people. So, you have to go back to that grocery store a few times a week and suddenly you find that your transportation costs are really adding up. 

But for the price of the bus ticket to look at lettuce, you can buy a whole meal within walking distance. That meal might clog your arteries and take a few years off your life whenever you eat it but at least you're saving money, which is pretty important when you're living paycheque to paycheque.  It's also probably a lot cheaper than buying canned or dried ingredients from the corner stores, because those places are more expensive than the big grocery stores. Also, they tend to be understocked. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm from a family where most people have kids in their teens or early 20s, as did the families of my childhood friends. My parents had me and my sister when they were in their mid to late 20s and I thought I had old parents until I went to university. Among my more middle class friends, my parents are younger than theirs by at least a decade. Some even have parents who are closer in age to my grandparents. 

 #x200B;

Also, the idea that you should establish yourself in a job then have kids is a relatively recent, middle class idea. My mom, who was the first woman in her family to have a career, firmly believes that it's irresponsible to have children later in life. I think it's because a lot of working class jobs are not kind to mothers needing to take time off whenever their kids get sick or their schools have half days. The logic is it's better to start with a part time job where there's more leniency and as your kids get older (and more expensive), you move up to a full time job. That might not be true of white collar, middle class jobs but you need to know people with those types of jobs to figure that out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm currently a criminology student, which means I can get behind the paywall. These articles aren't as dumb as they seem. It's important to note that methodology often isn't included in the abstract (because reading about how someone picked their sample and used R to do statistical analysis is boring as fuck) and that weird titles are a thing in gender studies. Since I have a midterm tomorrow, I've taken the time to read through the articles behind the paywall to give you a sense of what they're like.

 Feminisms, Fuzzy Sciences, and Interspecies Intersectionalities: The Promises and Perils of Contemporary Dog Training

This article is about how dog training, especially with pit bulls, is used by some guys to uphold their masculinity at the expense of good dog ownership. It also explores how Cesar Millan's dog techniques are used by men to show their dominance over dogs, despite that not being good for dogs and that poorly socialized dogs that are given up have a hard time finding homes. The article uses standard ethnographical methods, which sounds a lot like a blog if you don't know what to look for. 

 Incorporating Intersectionality Into Psychology: An Opportunity to Promote Social Justice and Equity

This is just an article telling psychologists how to deal with minority populations who are sceptical of psychologists, especially those who aren't from the same community. It also says that future psychologists need to learn about how to deal with vulnerable populations and gives some recommendations. 

 The Dildo as a Transformative Political Tool: Feminist and Queer Perspectives

The research here took place in India and it explores how in India, owning a dildo is both a way for women to feel empowered and ashamed. It's not so much about dildos per se (although the word dildo shows up enough that it doesn't seem like a real word to me anymore) but more about how women in India are shamed for enjoying sex, especially when single. Dildos are just used to exemplify that.

 The golden cage of the sperm banking industry

Not having the methods section in the abstract is really not doing this article justice because this is a straight up statistical analysis of who gets to be sperm donors, as well as explores the issues that single or lesbian women face when picking a sperm donor.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think people appreciate just how shitty underfunded schools in poor neighbourhoods can be and how much they can set you up for failure later in life. I went to two really shitty, underfunded elementary schools (one of them had some of the lowest provincial test scores in the province), a shitty junior high, and a really good high school. I was so far behind my classmates when I got to high school that I nearly failed grade 10.

In the underfunded schools, it wasn't uncommon to have textbooks that were up to 30 years out of date and not enough for every kid to have. We also struggled with classes dedicated to silent reading or book reports because our class "library" would have 20 books but there would be 35 kids. You could bring a book from home but in poor areas, not every kid had books/books in English (these schools were in areas with lots of recently arrived immigrants) at home. That's not a situation that's conducive to being good at and enjoying reading and writing. 

I also didn't realize that it was normal for elementary schools to have computers until I talked to some kids who went to much better schools. Some of my teachers had computers but if you were a kid who was really into computers, you were shit out of luck. Mind you, I'm in my early 20s so computers were definitely a thing at the time. 

Most importantly, underfunded schools just aren't able to keep with the needs of kids. They aren't able to deal with kids who have emotional issues (which is pretty common when you're living in uncertain circumstances), need help learning English, are struggling academically, or who don't have enough food at home.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A good way of finding out is by using surveys like the [national crime victimization survey](https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=dcdetail iid=245), in which researchers go around and ask a couple hundred thousand people if they were victims of any crimes in a certain time frame. The anonymity of the data and the fact it's not conducted by the police makes people feel more comfortable sharing being victimized. It also allows for people to report crimes that they didn't feel were worthy of police attention (like if someone stole their broken GPS).

There are also [uniform crime reports](https://ucr.fbi.gov/ucr), in which the FBI or similar body in another country look at crime stats from the cops. Combined with victimization surveys, you can measure discrepancies in reported crimes and unreported crimes (or at least crimes people feel comfortable telling a researcher about).

Neither method is perfect because criminologists are not like Santa and do not know exactly when or if someone has been victimized. But until we come out with mind-reading technology, surveys are the best way to measure rates of victimization.

<TEXT> There's two types of postmodernism. The first is aesthetic and the second is more like an ideology or a method of inquiry, which is the one you're probably thinking of so I'll concentrate on that. Both kinds are critiques or responses to modernism, which includes things like metanarratives, the idea of objective reality, human nature, universal reason (and for some postmodernists, reason itself), and social progress.

Metanarratives (sometimes called grand narratives) are large, somewhat generalizing theories that are used to explain all types of historical events or social phenomenon. An example is when people use human nature to explain all kinds of things, like how society is organized and how individuals people act. As a generality, postmodernists believe that metanarratives don't fully explain the nuances of various social phenomenon. Instead, they tend to focus on how discourses and social hierarchy (sometimes called hegemony) influence specific social phenomenon.

 When someone says something is postmodern, what specific ideas about the world are they trying to express? What thought is supposed to enter my head?

The confusing thing about postmodernism that is they don't believe there is a specific way of seeing the world. The way you see the world is correct for you because it comes from your own unique, personal experiences. At the same time, knowledge is constructed through discourse and might not be necessarily be "right" (a big critique of postmodernism is that this statement and the above statement don't make a whole lot of sense together).

<TEXT> Fascism is a far right ideology that emphasizes extreme amounts of nationalism and the supremacy of some group over everyone else. The government tends to have some control over the economic system to uphold the regime but the specifics depend on the needs and wants of the regime itself

Marxism is both a left wing ideology and a way of analyzing the social world. As an ideology, it's about the critiques of capitalism and how the bourgeoisie (the upper class) exploits the proletariat (the working class). From that general idea, there are several different schools of thought of Marxism, none of which can agree with each other. Some Marxists stick to Karl Marx's idea of a revolution but most have since abandoned that idea. As a way of analyzing the social world, Marxist thought looks at how things like norms and various social institutions (like schools, prisons, housing, etc.) are controlled by the upper classes and imposed upon the working class. It's not uncommon for people to be Marxist with one issue (like prisons) and not Marxist with another.

Socialism is a fairly far left ideology in which there are degrees of social ownership (like co-ops) and workers have some form of control over the means of production. More radical socialists might wish for a classless society, while others are fine with some some elements of capitalism. There's no one definition of socialism that socialists can agree upon.

Neoliberalism is a resurrection of classical liberalism. They're into free market capitalism, free trade, privatization of industries, reducing government spending, etc. They also tend to favour democracy. </TEXT>

My junior kindergarten teacher was racist enough that the school fired her. Most kids were either immigrants or first generation Canadians and/or weren't white. She handled this by getting mad at four year olds who just arrived in Canada six months ago when they couldn't speak English yet. If someone had a non-Anglo name, she would just straight up change it, rather than take the time to learn the correct pronunciation. She said racist shit to the white, Canadian parents about the non-white and immigrant parents. Eventually, enough of the white Canadian parents complained and she was fired. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Being poor is so much more than not having any money. We have very different experiences that aren't necessarily related to money.

Education is a pretty good example of this. I went to one of the worst elementary and junior high schools in my province. If you weren't poor, you definitely didn't go there. Our teachers seemed like they gave up on us and that their job was to make sure we stayed in school for as long as we legally needed to, rather than set us up to go to university and do something with our lives. Lowest test scores on the provincial tests in the province? Who cares! You're a smart kid who likes reading or coding? Tough shit. The library is sparse and there's, like, one computer in the entire school. You're struggling academically? The teachers are so swamped that they can't help you.

<TEXT>  What's something that's commonly misunderstood about the LGBTQ community?

This is more about gay men specifically but that any flamboyant/feminine behaviour is done intentionally to let everyone know they're gay. When I act straight, it's just an act. When I act more feminine, that's my real personality.

 How did you realize you're gay?

I didn't know I was gay until I was about 14 but I definitely had crushes on boys starting from when I was in grade one or two. I just didn't realize those crushes were crushes because I didn't know a boy can have a crush on another boy. Porn mostly helped me realize I like other guys and once I figured that out, all the gay shit I did and thought as a kid made a lot more sense. I also was pretty upset to realize I'm gay.

 What's it like to come out? Is it as dramatic as shown in movies?

It really depends on who you're coming out to. My family is very reserved and very private so when I came out to them, there was no dramatic hugging and crying. Coming out to my friends was more dramatic. I was very relieved when I came out.

 People who've been gay for decades, has there been any progress lately? I mean, is homophoebia still as strong as it was a few decades ago or are people more accepting towards the LGBTQ community now?

I'm in my early 20s but I live in a more conservative part of Canada so I basically get to live in the past. Here, tremendous progress has been made over the last five years or so. When I was a kid in the early 2000s, adults were openly homophobic towards me and my girly ways. Some kids were also openly homophobic. There were no openly gay kids in my high school of nearly 2000 and the sex-ed curriculum forbade any mention of LGBT kids. 

In the last five or years or so, people are becoming much more accepting. Pride parades are much larger and there are less assaults on LGBT people. According to my sister, who's in high school, there are now openly gay kids and sex-ed now includes LGBT content. I see a lot more openly gay teenagers. I also experience a lot less overt homophobia.

 How do you want people to react when you come out to them?

This really depends on the person. I really wanted someone to allow me to talk about my thoughts, feelings, and concerns in regards to being gay. Most of the people I came out to were generally pretty nice and accepting but I've basically never actually discussed being gay with anyone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pride isn't a PR stunt to make LGBT people seem more normal in the eyes of straight people. It's a way to celebrate LGBT culture and allow those who have always had to hide themselves, no matter how freaky, a couple hours a year to be comfortable expressing that. It also grew out of a riot lead by the outcasts of society. If we get rid of drag queens and half naked people, we risk losing the very people who paved the way for LGBT people to live openly.

Also, parades are a lot less debaucherous than people think it is. I've gone to a lot and never once have I seen someone with a dildo. There definitely are some sexily dressed people but there's also a lot of unions and banks. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Why do you identify with your sexuality so heavily when most people don't care about sexuality?

People do care about our sexuality and the idea that people don't is a very new thing. When I was a little kid, my perceived sexuality was the thing that adults focused on. Parents of my classmates told my parents that they fucked up since their son is girly. My grandparents forced me to get a retake of my grade one school picture because I wore a pink polka dot shirt and that made me look "too fruity". I didn't care too much about my sexuality but everyone else seemed obsessed with it. 

As an adult, I still find my sexuality gets in the way of doing normal adult human things. I work in a warehouse and while I generally like my job and my coworkers, it's an environment where openly but innocently talking about my boyfriend is something people might take issue with. Meanwhile, my coworkers are pretty open in graphically describing the women they fuck. I've never held hands or kissed in public because I don't like getting harassed and beat up.

 Why broadcast it so broadly and do you think this one of the reasons there's backlash towards your community?

I don't think that I and other LGBT people are broadcasting our sexuality any more than straight people but it just stands out since we still tend to see straight as the default. I also find that sometimes straight people become overly focused on the sexuality of LGBT people, especially when they don't know them very well, and have an issue seeing the other facets of our personality. Perhaps openly gay people lead to backlash in the short run but I suspect that as there are more and more openly gay people, the backlash will decrease as it becomes more normal.

 Are you misinterpreting people's apathy towards members of the LGBTQ as hatred?

I suspect some people do but I think there's also some frustration when people hide being apathy when being homophobic. My uncle always says he doesn't care about people's sexualities but it's pretty clear from talking to him that he actually just doesn't want to be reminded that there are gay people. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was coming out, it meant a lot to me when people didn't just go "okay cool" and move on. Coming out is an incredibly stressful situation that you build up in your mind for a long time and the slightest instance of accidental homophobia can set it back. You have to place a huge amount of trust in your friends/family. When people said things like "thanks for telling me. Do you want to talk about it?", it was really nice. I also found I had better relationships post coming out with people who reacted like that compared to the "okay cool" people. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maybe it's because I've only ever been to pride parades in smaller, more conservative places but I've found a lot of them disappointingly tame. There are some drag queens and they're really fun but it's mostly just a bunch of people walking around in normal clothes carrying signs. Half of them seem to be from banks or unions. The last parade I went to, there was one float with half-naked dudes on it and it was the float for an actual gay strip club.

I feel like parades are starting to appeal more to straight people, rather than celebrating gay culture and all the freaks who got us to the point where banks and unions are pride parade's biggest participants. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Queer is an umbrella term for anyone who's not cisgender and/or heterosexual. It includes gay people, as well as bisexual, pansexual, transgender, asexual, etc. people.

LGBT people calling themselves queer is a bit of a hot topic. For some people, such as myself, it still very much has negative connotations and thus don't want to be called queer. For other people, it means reclaiming a harmful word so that it loses its negative connotations. It's also a shorter, more inclusive way of talking about people who aren't cisgender and/or heterosexual. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Canada has Quebec, which is predominantly Francophone (most other provinces are either just Anglophone or bilingual) and uses a mix of common law and Napoleonic law, whereas the rest of Canada just uses common law. It's also much more influenced by France and French culture. From time to time, separatist movements become popular in Quebec and they've voted to leave the country twice, although the separatist side has never gotten over 50% of the vote so it's stuck with the rest of the country for the time being.

There are smaller differences within Canada, like how the south tends to be whiter, wealthier, and more populated and the north tends to have more Aboriginal peoples, more rural, and poorer (as well as incredibly cold). </TEXT>

[He's being criticized for unsafe labour practices](http://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-tesla-factory-safety-20180418-story.html) and in April, the California division of OSHA is looking into his factories. Workers complained that they were getting headaches and getting hurt on the job, supposedly at a higher rate than most other plants. He was also criticized for putting his own desires to not have the colour yellow in the factory over the heath and safety of his workers. 

[He was accused by some unions for being anti-union](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/elon-musk-tesla-twitter-union-uaw-organizing-labor-nlrb-fremont-plant-a8368111.html) and suggested that he should take away the stock of employees who want to unionize. This may be a violation of US labour laws. 

[He donated some money to a PAC that's supposed to keep the Republican party in the House](http://fortune.com/2018/07/15/elon-musk-donations-republicans-controversy/). Although he didn't donate a lot and has donated to Democrats, it made some people question his actual commitment to the environment, especially since the then head of the EPA is a climate change denier.

Then there was the whole thing about calling a rescue diver a pedophile.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The context behind the joke is key. When I was younger, it was really common that someone being gay was the punchline of a joke. As a young gay kid, it was painful that the only time I saw other people like me was as the subject of a joke. This was also at a time when homophobia was much more rampant in society, so gay jokes just came off as people expressing genuine homophobia in a joking manner. The point of these jokes was to laugh at gay people, not to laugh alone with gay people. 

Meanwhile, jokes were you laugh alone with the subject aren't offensive. Dave Chapelle does it really well with racial humour. It comes from a place of personal experience. The punchline isn't that he's black and the audience is able to laugh alone with him, rather than laugh at him.

<TEXT> I found it very isolating and lonely, even though I'm a social person with lots of friends. Your sexual orientation is a surprisingly big part of your life and keeping that entirely to yourself takes a lot of effort. I found it hard to get close to people because I was afraid that they'd find out I'm gay. Whenever people would talk about who they liked/were dating, I got very anxious because I had no idea how to respond and was worried people would find out. If I had any relationship problems or problems relating to my homosexuality, I had absolutely no one to talk to.

It also involves a lot of self-policing. I'm a naturally more feminine guy and I found I had to change basically everything about myself to not be pegged as being gay. I was hyperaware of my voice, my mannerisms, what I liked and disliked, how I acted in change rooms, etc. If I did something that may have outed myself, no matter how small, I would get very worried and overanalyze how people reacted. 

You also get to find out who is homophobic, which wears you down after a while. People who aren't outwardly homophobic to openly gay me were very homophobic to closeted me. It was very demoralizing to constantly hear that people don't like you and not be able to defend yourself. 

Overall, it was an experience that lead to a fair amount of depression and anxiety, which I'm still working on, even though I've been living openly for a couple years now. I also feel like I never fully experienced being a teenager, because I didn't come out until I could support myself financially.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Depending on where you live, gay bars are some of the only places where gay people can safely congregate and not have to worry about people not accepting them. They're also the cornerstone of some gay communities. Having a couple straight people in the bars isn't bad, especially if they're being respectful and, preferably, know some of the gay patrons.

What is a problem is when groups of straight women come into gay bars to use it as a human zoo. For them, being around gay people is a form of entertainment. Then, straight guys hear about this and they show up to hit on straight girls, which then removes the certainty that you can safely hit on a guy there without losing a few teeth.

In places where same-sex marriage is illegal, having bachelorette parties show up is pretty disrespectful, since they've come to the bar to celebrate a legal right the intended patrons don't have and may be fighting tirelessly for. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a feminine gay man who's dated other feminine gay men. My sample size is pretty small but I've noticed a few key points over the years.

For the most part, we've always been feminine. 4 year old me was just as feminine and flamboyant, if not more so, than 20 year old me. This also brought pushback and experiencing homophobia from a very young age. Nothing brings down a kid like your classmate's mom calling you a faggot for going to school with nail polish or your grandparents ordering a retake of your grade 1 school picture because you wore a pink polka dot shirt.

As adults, being unabashedly flamboyant and catty is not only a way of kicking that homophobia you experienced as a child in the dick, it also provides a sort of protection. I'd much rather find out someone is homophobic as soon as I meet them than hide who I am and find out once we've gotten to know each other. Maybe I have a smaller group of friends because of it, but at least I know all my friends actually like me for who I am. 

There's probably more variation within flamboyant gay men than you notice but having common experiences certainly makes us more similar. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Being gay has had a pretty large impact in most parts of my life. As a little effeminate boy in Alberta, I was definitely treated differently from my (perceived) straight, more masculine peers. Adults whispered about my sexual orientation and were very concerned with how I acted and dressed. It was pretty clear that who I am was shameful and I got pretty depressed.

By puberty, I knew I was gay and was deeply ashamed and a bit scared. My city hadn't become as liberal as it is now and casual homophobia was still somewhat accepted. I didn't want my classmates to know, so I changed the way I acted. It was a time of great anxiety and depression.

Then there's coming out. I have a huge extended family and most of my older relatives are Russian immigrants. I was scared that they'd ostracize me and I was lucky that only a few great aunts and uncles did. I also had to come out to my friends. As an adult, I have to worry about coming out to people who make small talk by asking about significant others. When I was looking for apartments and work (I work in a warehouse), I was worried about coming off as being too gay. Even now at work, I'm a bit cagey about letting my coworkers know about my sexual orientation. 

Being gay (and being poor) has fundamentally shaped who I am and how I interact with the world. Had I been straight, I would have led a completely different life.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  LGB people who are attracted to the same sex that dress and act like the opposite sex. What's the point?

Your clothes and behaviour doesn't impact your gender. No matter how butch a woman is or how femme a man is, they're still a woman and man respectively. Plus, some women are into butch women and some men are into femme men (myself included).

 The flamboyant "in your face" LGB people. This one is mainly pointed towards the gay men, but I've seen some butch women do it too. Are you looking for affirmation of your sexuality? Why do you feel the need to prove yourself by changing how you act?

I'm lean more towards subdued flamboyance but I think I can answer this. There's two reasons I can think of. One is that they've always been like that, which is my case. 

The second is that they had recently came out and were deeply closeted. When you're closeted, you spend a lot of energy keeping your sexuality and any behaviour related to it deeply repressed and often that means not being able to explore your sexuality as a teenager when straight people do. Coming out allows you to finally explore all those feelings and they all get barfed up at the same time. 

 I've seen a few people pull the "gay card" if something doesn't go their way. Is this normal? For example: I was in McDonalds and this couple had obviously gotten the wrong order, but one of them walked up to the counter and made a scene about how he shouldn't be treated this way just because he was gay. Pretty sure the manager gave them free food on top of what they ordered.

As far as I know, this isn't normal. But just keep in mind, for people who have gotten a lot of shit for their sexuality, it can be hard to separate honest mistakes with subtle bigotry.

 what's up with all of the different genders? People joke about identifying as a non binary foxkin frying pan, but I feel as if it's joked about because people are taking it too far and just making shit up so that they can feel special.

A lot of cultures have a third or fourth gender so new genders are nothing new. I also don't think is is as big as the internet makes it seem. In my experience, people who don't see themselves as being a man or woman just identify as non-binary and don't come up with their own personal gender. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a more feminine gay guy (and have been since I was a small child), I can assure you many people give a shit about my sexuality, even before I was aware of it. For example, when I was in grade 1, I wore a pink polka dot shirt for picture day and my grandparents made me get retakes because they thought I looked too fruity. Some of my classmates' parents got mad at my parents for letting me wear that shirt (we also took a big class picture). I didn't give a shit. I just liked that shirt. I didn't even know I was gay.

Even now that my city has become much more liberal, people still give a shit about my sexuality. I've only brought up my (now) ex-boyfriend once at work in a completely innocent context and people didn't get over it for days. Other coworkers have talked about much more sexual shit and no one bats an eye.

In many places, we're not at the point where being gay/bisexual is something people are able to accept. By showing straight people we are not ashamed of our sexuality, they can get to the point where they won't be ashamed to have a gay coworker or gay relative and eventually no one will give a shit either way. </TEXT>

I moved around a lot as a kid, often at the drop of a hat and so did a lot of my classmates. I never felt like I could settle down and become acquainted with any one place enough to call it home. 

My schools also went through teachers like crazy. It was pretty common for teachers to straight up quit half way through the school year and those who didn't tended to only last a year or two. 

Then there's the issue of food insecurity. It wasn't just not having food, it was also making sure you could get the food you want at the stores. In many poor neighbourhoods, there's no grocery stores but there are little corner stores that have an ever rotating supply of food, often in small quantities and without any produce. When you're poor, you don't have the certainty of knowing you have food and if the stores will have enough/the right food to actually make a meal. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think this trope can be pretty harmful, both for gay and straight people. I'm a somewhat feminine gay guy myself and I find that I sometimes need to act more "straight" around people who don't know any other gay people because that's the only way they are able to look past my sexual orientation. I don't blame them for it. If your only exposure to gay people comes from media and they're all portrayed as flat stereotypes, it's hard to see a gay person who somewhat fits that portrayal as being something other than flat.

I also think this is in part responsible for the recent trend of "straight-acting" gay men being very dismissive of effeminate gay men, citing that they've replaced their personality with their sexual orientation.

<TEXT> Cultural appropriation isn't the same as sharing cultures (which is, arguably, good). A big component of cultural appropriation is to take something of significance of one culture and have it used out of context by another culture, then stigmatize its original usage by the first culture. It's bad because it establishes a double standard and stigmatizes elements of someone's culture. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sometimes, they come across as being smug, like they're above those who fall squarely on the right or the left and don't believe that they are biased. They sometimes also come across as being ignorant of the actual positions of left- and right-wing parties, which sometimes means coming across like they think diametrically opposite positions are essentially the same thing. 

I should mention that these are American-specific criticisms because centrism in America is not the same thing as centrism in other countries. That's not to say centrists in other countries aren't criticized, but typically not for the above reasons. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was in junior high and high school, locker rooms were the worst. I even avoided trying out for the track team because I didn't want to deal with my peers finding out I'm gay and thinking I was hitting on them when we changed. Now that I'm an adult, though, locker rooms aren't something I look forward too but there's not as bad. I make sure I keep my eyes to myself because there's enough straight guys out there who seem to get violent when they think other guys are checking them out but I trust that most adults are mature enough not to cause problems.

Also, the general public is not as attractive as you'd think. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a white person with terrible grammar. A lot of it is poor education. I went to terrible (as in, some of the worst in the province) elementary schools and there really wasn't a focus on correct grammar. The one time I had a teacher try to teach us how to not sound like a bunch of inbred morons, she straight up left and was never replaced. That one grammar lesson was never completed.

And even if it had been completed, I would very rarely use correct grammar. My family is not particularly well educated and my older relatives are non-native English speakers, so correct grammar was never really hammered into me. It would be weird to use correct grammar when talking to people who don't use correct grammar. It wasn't until I went to a wealthier high school and then university when I actually had to use correct grammar and was in the position to learn it.

It also doesn't help that when you grow up with people who don't use correct grammar, you can understand people with shitty grammar just as well as people who use correct grammar. For me, bad grammar has never been a communication barrier so I never felt that I had to make an effort to change it. When I went to high school, I was pretty surprised to find out that people genuinely had a hard time understanding me when I didn't make a conscious effort to use good grammar. 

TL;DR: poor education and hanging out with people who use bad grammar. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For me, it's not something I consciously picked up but I can consciously put it on or off. I think I mostly got it because I spent a lot of time hanging out with girls as a kid (I don't have brothers, most of my cousins are girls, and I was too afraid to talk to boys as a kid). Then I quickly learned to hide it in elementary school because my classmates and older family members made it very clear it was unacceptable for me to talk that way.

I live in a somewhat conservative area and work in a warehouse so I still consciously hide it but when I'm with my non-work friends, I feel comfortable enough to drop the act and "sound gay". Sometimes I also put it on when I'm in more middle class settings because it somewhat masks my redneck Canadian accent. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Communism is an economic system which there is no private property, classes, money, or state. Everyone has common ownership over the means of production. There's no one definition or kind of communism but all types of communism are predicated on the above ideas.

Socialism is related to communism in that it's an economic and social system that emphasizes collective ownership of means of production. Socialism works within the framework of a state and pushes more towards co-ops, unions, regulations which protect workers and reduce exploitation, etc. Some socialists are revolutionary, others are not.

Fascism is an extreme form of nationalism that's characterized by believing one group is superior to all others, the state has a huge amount of control over society, demonization of enemies, including communists and other groups who are believed to be the enemies of the state/the superior group. The state has tight control over the economy but not in a way that makes the economy more fair. 

Marxism is a school of thought where the whole idea is that capitalist society is based off class inequalities, where the upper class (the bourgeoisie) exploit and alienate the lower class (proletariat) from the means of production. Marxism has changed a bit since Karl Marx's original idea and Marxists have different interpretations of Marx's words and how they apply 150+ years later.  </TEXT>

The only time my school ever mentioned gay people was when talking about STIs. In our unit about puberty, the curriculum emphasized that we will all have thoughts about the opposite sex and since then, all relationships were framed as being a guy and a girl who only had vaginal sex. I had a minor essential crisis in grade 5 because I thought I was broken for having a crush on another guy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was little, my parents made a bracelet with a rope tied to the stroller/shopping cart that I wore because I had a habit of running away to put gross shit in my mouth (which often included running into traffic), then not being able to find my parents. My parents didn't need a leash until my sister was born, when they found that looking after a suicidal toddler and a baby was pretty overwhelming. I was strangely cool with being leashed since I was really into dogs when this happened.

I turned out okay. I've never been hit by a car or poisoned and the one time I got lost was in a Blockbuster many years after I was no longer leashed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I inadvertently protested my grade 5 Christmas party. It was my first year in a very white, Christian school after having spent my entire education in a very not white, very not Christian school. We voted on having a Christmas party and I, being Jewish, voted no since I thought that we could just change it to a general holiday party. I thought I was going to be in the majority, or at least in a large minority. Instead, I was the only kid who ever said no and for some reason, that really pissed off my teacher. I tried to explain myself with all the charm and grace an awkward 10 year old could but that didn't cut it and my parents nearly got involved. 

That school also had daily assemblies during December where we sang Christmas carols (some of which were pretty religious). This was at a public school in Canada during the mid-2000s.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A lot of poor neighbourhoods don't. Up until 2015, my neighbourhood didn't have a grocery store with a produce section. If you so much as wanted to look at some broccoli and didn't have a car, you'd have to spend half an hour on the bus (and have $3.15 just to get on the bus and another $3.15 to get home) or walk an hour each way. My neighbourhood has convenience stores but they tend to be pretty expensive and don't sell any fresh food, let alone consistently carry the same things.

This problem is even worse in a lot of rural areas. For example, my mom grew up in a town where the closest grocery store with a good selection was 3 hours away. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Assuming that we're going with your standard communion wafers, I found that if we follow [this](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/241680/unleavened-bread-for-communion/), the whole sheet of wafers weighs about 251g. I converted the units using [this](http://dish.allrecipes.com/cup-to-gram-conversions/) website. Since the recipe makes 6 wafers (assuming them to be standard wafer size), each wafer weighs 41.83g. 

Jesus was probably a bit smaller than the average person today so I'm going to say he would have been about 115 lbs/52.16 kg/52,160g. 52,160g divided by 41.83g is 1246.95 so you'd need to eat about 1247 pretty hefty wafers to eat a thin Jesus.

Granted, wafer size varies based on denomination and we don't know what Jesus's weight was so this is just an estimate. </TEXT>

Meanwhile, the university refuses to fix the actual structural damage to the social sciences building. The department I'm in is on the 9th floor and it's almost a rite of passage to get stuck in the elevators on the way to or from seeing a prof. There was also a time when there wasn't any hot water and water leaks into people's offices when it rains or the snow melts. This is in Canada so this happens all the time.

Also, the university doesn't have a D- grade. You can get an F but you can't get a D-. No one's sure why. Sometimes, this means that what would be a D- is now an F. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My mom's cousin was the getaway driver when his friends held up a 7-11. He had some outstanding tickets at the time. As he was driving his moron friends him home, he sped past a cop, who inevitably pulled him over. He defended his bad driving by telling the cop he was just the getaway driver. Then he got arrested. He has since been arrested for a series of other similarly stupid crimes. 

He also believes that there's a global cabal of Jews who are out to get him. Recently, he got a DUI, which got his license revoked. This was obviously because of the Jews and not because he decided to drive drunk past a police station. When he was denied a gun license, that was the Jews at work. I have no idea why he thinks a global cabal would be focused on some moron from Saskatchewan.

<TEXT> It only really applies directly to jobs in which you negotiate your salary but it's mostly an overall trend or average. There's a few reasons for this.

As someone already mentioned, women take lower paying jobs than men. This is due to things like women, especially older women, not having the opportunity to go into high paying jobs, going to more female-centric jobs like nursing or teaching instead of higher paying male-centric jobs for various reasons, and women who are in high paying male-centric jobs are relatively junior. 

Secondly, women's qualifications are not as valued as men's in male-centric jobs, although this is decreasing. For jobs with sliding pay based on qualifications or where you have to negotiate your salary, women are often given lower pay than their equally qualified male colleagues. This is further exacerbated by women not being socialized into expecting to negotiate a salary.

Third, it's a lot more common for women to spend time off work or work part time, especially if they have young kids or elderly parents. It's still not socially acceptable in many places for men to take paternity leave, so moms are often entirely responsible for taking care of young kids. Once a woman takes some time off, employers tend to be a bit apprehensive about promoting them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My province didn't (doesn't?) include/allow any discussion of homosexuality in sex ed. Out of the 7 fucking years of sex ed I had, it only came up in a short sentence in grade 11 during a discussion of values (not even that sex ed related, too). I maybe paid some attention on the day put condoms on dildos but otherwise, I basically slept through it. I was pretty lucky that the internet was around when I was in high school and my university's LGBT space does a pretty good job at providing resources for these kinds of things. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You spend a lot of your time lying or telling half truths to avoid potential homophobia, even as society has progressed. This may include things like removing or covering up any signifiers that you are gay (like an earring in the right ear, slightly effeminate speech patterns, referring to your partner as your roommate) when interviewing for a job or looking to rent an apartment. I live in a place with anti-discrimination laws but that doesn't stop an employer from suddenly deciding you're not qualified or that someone has just put in an offer on that apartment. 

Often, you have to choose between being your genuine self and a more socially acceptable version just so you'll be treated like a normal human being. And if that genuine self is more stereotypically gay, you may be accused of putting on an act when you act like yourself. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  When people who barely enough resources to sustain themselves choose to reproduce.

There's a couple reasons for this. One is that sex ed at underfunded schools is shit and if they have the education to know you need some kind of contraceptive, resources like condoms and birth control aren't readily available to poor people (even though condoms aren't that expensive, grocery stores in poor areas tend to be out of stock of lots of things). 

Another is what constitutes having enough money to support a kid varies. If you and everyone you know grew up in poverty, the only way you know how to raise a kid is in poverty. I were to have a kid on a middle class income, I would have no idea how to raise them because that's not how I or anyone I know was raised. Now, if I had a kid on my current income (below the poverty line), I would know exactly what to do.

Lastly, having kids just makes sense for some poor women. When you're poor, you probably aren't going to go to university and have a career, let alone graduate from high school. Having a kid is a way to prove that you're a responsible adult and will be treated as such. Plus, you spend a lot of time looking after other people's kids so having a kid isn't outside your skillset.

 People who chose to have debt for non essentials

I'm going to take a guess and say this is referring to poor people with big TVs. Buying things like TVs (and going into debt for them) isn't as dumb as you'd think. When you're poor, you don't have a lot of time to just sit down and relax. You're always working, or going shopping, or looking after kids. TV provides a modicum of time to just sit and do nothing. It also provides a sense of normalcy. For some, it's worth to go into debt just to feel like a normal human being.

When I first joined Reddit an embarrassingly long time ago, I was much more okay with telling people I'm gay or Jewish than I am now. It used to be that every once in a while, someone would make a homophobic/anti-Semitic comment which would be heavily downvoted. Now, I'm glad if I can mention either of those things and have most of the comments not be about butt sex, banks, or some other lame ass quip that's not related to the discussion.

I also noticed a lot of overt racism and transphobia as of late. Previously, only covert racist/transphobic comments or those that were ironically racist/transphobic were upvoted but now I see upvoted shit that would make my bigoted family members blush. Couple that with people calling out bigotry being downvoted and you don't have a particularly welcoming community for women and minorities. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's two schools of thought on this.

The first is that gay men use it to identify themselves as being gay to other gay men. This idea also argues that gay men at least somewhat consciously put on the accent and maybe purposely change their voices when they come out.

The second is that gay men are socialized around girls and women when they're young and thus develop more feminine speech patterns. According to this school of thought, the accent occurs subconsciously and people don't have control over it. In my experience as a gay man, this explanation makes a lot more sense than the first one. </TEXT>

Most people were caught by custodians pretty soon after closing, though.

When it's dark, simply turning off the lights to the section where you think someone is hiding is a surprisingly easily way to get them to come out of hiding and leave. Wondering aloud about coyotes coming out at night was also pretty effective. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Coming from a poor family, I've noticed several factors come into play.

* Poor people have different metrics for what constitutes not being able to afford a kid. My parents planned me but were constantly accused of not being able to afford to have a kid. According to my parents and many other poor people, being able to feed, clothe, and shelter your child fairly reliably means you can afford a kid. Factors like paying for a post-secondary education or playing sports aren't a concern because those most likely aren't seen as viable options anyway.

* Condoms (and for Americans, birth control) are expensive, especially if you don't have access to free or cheap ones. 

* Sex ed sucks for underfunded schools and even for some well funded ones. My cousin got pregnant because she thought that fucking standing up prevented the sperm from reaching the egg and thus was a good form of birth control. Several other girls in her high school also got pregnant thanks to similar beliefs.

* For some poor women, having a kid is a rite of passage. If you're not sure you're going to graduate from high school, let alone university, and get a good job, having a kid signals that you're a capable woman who can contribute to society.

* When you're poor, you spend a lot of time looking after other people's kids, which makes having your own kid seem less scary. As one of the oldest cousins in my family, I've been looking after kids since I was 10. I'm probably way too confident in my ability to be a parent (despite not having kids of my own) because I have a decade's head start on my peers.

* There's a lot of pressure for some to have kids. My sister's been asked about when she's having kids from my relatives since she was 16 and my grandma still can't believe I don't have to pay child support to anyone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's basically a modernized version of cultural bolshevism, which was a conspiracy started by the Nazis that claimed that Jews were communists out to destroy Germany. They were mostly doing so through art and music so a lot of music that was viewed as being degenerate (like jazz) was banned. Much like cultural Marxism, it was irrationally afraid of the Frankfurt School and pegged them as an enemy. 

Cultural Marxism sees Jews having a conspiracy to destroy western (read: white) civilization by allowing marginalized people to enjoy the same rights and opportunities as white men. Jews are still being blamed for things like the supposed "Muslim invasion" of Europe, pride parades, feminism, and any other "degenerate behaviour". Sometimes, it also involves criticizing social constructionists and bringing up the Frankfurt School. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The US's SNAP program kind of lends itself to obesity. Even though it covers fruits and vegetables, it doesn't actually give people enough money to buy those and be able to eat for an entire month. Many on SNAP have to go with the cheapest possible options, which are more often than not junk food. Plus fresh food can be pretty expensive in low income areas or very difficult to come by.

As for iPhone upgrades, some plans allow for free or very cheap upgrades. When you're poor, having a working smartphone is incredibly important, especially if you don't have a computer. Spending a little to get a new phone (which often involves trading in the old one and paying the difference and/or buying a gently used phone someone sold after a new one came out) is a worthwhile investment. </TEXT>

I think there's more people in the first category since it can be a major source of mocking and bullying for gay kids. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Biological race is the physical and genetic characteristics that groups of people have (like skin colour, predisposition to certain diseases, etc.). Biological race, unlike social race, no longer involves value judgements about certain groups of people. Some have argued that humans are so close genetically that biological race might not even exist.

Social race involves all the connotations, histories, cultures, and what have you we have associated with certain groups of people. It's the socially constructed parts of race, like deciding that everyone from sub-Sahara Africa is black, regardless of how genetically, culturally, and linguistically diverse that part of the world is. It also involves ideologies like white supremacy. For modern society, social race is way more influential than biological race because so much is attributed to it. It's also a lot more time and place specific than biological race. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's two kinds of centrists: American centrists and international centrists. International centrists are those who incorporate both right and left wing politics into their ideas. Often, this means having a capitalist economy coupled with environmental regulation, strong worker's rights, and well funded social support systems. American centrists tend to fall to the right of most western countries' political spectrum and thus don't have a lot in common with international centrists. Centrists in most other parts of the world don't get a lot of flack, except from more extreme parties who believe they're not entirely sure what they want or won't commit. 

American centrists, on the other hand, get shit for several reasons. From an outsider's perspective, I've boiled criticisms against them down to 6 main points (note: these aren't my opinions, just things I've noticed):

* They can't decide what they want and don't entirely fit into one of the two parties. In other parts of the world, they tend to have their own parties, which tend to be pretty successful.

* They have a reputation for being smug, especially since the last election. 

* They are not willing to stand up against racist/sexist/classist/homophobic views put forth and instead create an environment where these types of things are passively tolerated.

* Internationally, they've been criticized for just being libertarians.

* Sometimes they come across as being naive.

* Unlike international centrists, they don't have a reputation of taking the best of any and all politics and instead oppose anything that could be attributed to a certain political party.

<TEXT> When people came up with the modern idea of race, white was the default and everyone else was lumped into some race based on a list of characteristics and that was that. However, when deciding who was white, it really came down to which group of pale skinned (mostly) Europeans were "superior" and should hold high positions in society. The (now) white people who weren't considered to be "superior" were shoved into one of the other racial categories.

Once pale skinned people started to become integrated into American society and became part of the "default", they became white. As of right now, American society still doesn't see North Africans, Middle Easterners, Central Asians, and even some Eastern Europeans, South Americans of European decent, and Jews as being in the same position as those of Irish, German, or even Italian decent, even though the above people may have the same skin tone and roughly the same features as those who are considered to be white.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So many people seem to conflate being broke with being poor. Poverty is so much more than just being in university or mismanaging your money. When you're poor, you miss out on a lot of social capital that can help you move out of poverty. 

For example, at my job there's a lot of poor people who are very good at what they do but it's the middle class kids who move up the ranks, even if they're not that good at their job. The difference is, while a middle class kid might, say, completely fuck up a delivery order which then leads to a shitload complaints from angry customers and an emergency meeting getting called in which the entire delivery department gets yelled at for an hour, they have the social capital to ask for a better job or a raise and then get it. When the poor people who consistently get their orders on the right truck at the right time without breaking anything ask for a raise or a better job, the answer is always "we need to think about it". </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think people here know what cultural appropriation is. Cultural appropriation means taking something very special or sacred from a culture, stigmatizing its use in the original culture, and making it totally fine to use out of context in another culture. 

It would be like if the rest of the world decided US military uniforms are trendy and we all went around making them into bikinis and wearing them to shitty festivals. When actual American soldiers would wear them, they would be mocked and ostracized. If the US military released a statement telling the rest of the world to stop wearing their uniforms as bikinis, we'd all laugh at them and tell them to lighten up. Moreover, Americans would never have a say in whether the rest of the world could take their uniforms and use them as bikinis.

It's taking sacred elements from a culture and making them into something novel, then stigmatizing their usage in the first culture that's a problem, not that cultures are sharing.

<TEXT> A lot of it has to do with Southern Strategy, which in general has severely reduced the number of black Americans who vote Republican. Richard Nixon campaigned on the basis that there are a lot of votes from racist white people who opposed the enfranchisement of black people and the civil rights movement. However, they could no longer be openly racist and thus had to pass legislation that targeted black people while making it so that poor white people who were also getting fucked over didn't notice.

Part of Southern Strategy was the concept of the welfare queen. During Reagan's campaign and presidency, he constructed this idea of a black woman who lives off welfare, has tons of nice stuff, and has kids to get more welfare. Then, he passed legislation that harmed black women's ability to support their families (although it also harmed white people). That legislation is still in place.

At the same time, the War on Drugs disproportionately targeted black people and lead to an increase in the incarceration of black men, while white people who used drugs weren't targeted. Black women were thus forced to raise their kids by themselves. As a consequence, black people were and still are targeted by the police to a degree that white people aren't.

And lastly, Republicans aren't very good at reaching out to black people. They haven't renounced Southern Strategy and proposed legislation that would benefit black and white people equally. They don't campaign on issues that are relevant to the black community. 

TL;DR: Southern Strategy made black people not vote Republican  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I went to a really shitty low income elementary school and an upper middle class high school. Two things really stood out to me.

1. Middle and upper class people talk a lot, about different things, and in a different way. Their grammar is really good, even in casual conversation. I grew up with the impression that proper grammar was for formal written documents and academia. They also have a very large vocabulary, especially for things like reasoning and feelings. Working class people are rarely in a position where they must explain their position in a professional setting. Emotions, at least in my family, are not something that is discussed, with the exception of anger and sadness in select situations. Furthermore, some topics are no goes for middle and upper class people. I was under the impression that it was totally okay to talk freely about having relatives in jail or exactly how much money you have. 

2. The quality of elementary schools really sets you up for how you're going to fair for the rest of your life. I went to high school with kids who were learning to code in early elementary school. I went to an elementary school that didn't have computers (this was in the early 2000s). Kids who went to good elementary schools have a much better foundation for things like math and reading, which are very key to getting the skills you need to get into university or polytechnics. Shitty elementary schools also instil this sense that kids aren't going to go anywhere in life, which carries on for the rest of your life. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A book that's going to be released next week by journalist Michael Wolff about what's going on in the White House has some pretty serious quotes from Steve Bannon after he was let go from the Trump administration. Bannon mentioned "treasonous" and "unpatriotic" meetings between Russia and the Trump kids, Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort in which they asked for incriminating information on Hillary Clinton during the campaign. He alleged these meetings happened at Trump Tower. He also said no lawyers were present and that the FBI should have gotten involved immediately. Bannon claimed that Donald Trump knew about these meetings, but Trump had previously claimed that he had no idea they happened.

Donald Trump then responded to Bannon's claims by saying that he's insane, which obviously infuriated Bannon. The worry now is that Bannon will be encouraged to tell Robert Mueller any and all illegal activities that may be going on under the Trump administration. If the claims Bannon made are true, Trump and his kids will be in deep shit and the legitimacy of his presidency will be at stake. What Bannon said also legitimized and, for some, confirmed the allegations that the Trump administration colluded with Russia.

TL;DR: Bannon alleged treasonous behaviour, Trump called him insane, Bannon might now testify in full to Robert Mueller. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Parents are somehow incentivized to assist in the learning process, and disincentivized to not do so

I think this one would be really good in certain areas. However, it might not work in low income or high immigrant areas. I went to a really, really low income elementary school and trying to get parents involved wasn't very effective. Many kids had parents who had just come to Canada and weren't at the point where they could speak fluent enough English to help their kids. Other kids had parents who were native English speakers but weren't or didn't feel they were educated enough to help. The vast majority of kids didn't have parents who were home long enough to attend to and be engaged in their children's learning process. I spent way more time engaged in my younger sister's education than my parents. 

Moreover, in many low income areas, the idea that parents should be part of their kid's education process is not seen as a good thing. Parents (mine included) view education as a tool to help their kids end up better off than themselves. My parents viewed attempts to get them to participate in my and my sister's education as being counterproductive because the goal of education was to not end up like them. </TEXT>

He also thinks that the Jews got him fired from his job (he called his manager a cunt when she confronted him about not showing up for work) and are behind Canadians electing a left wing provincial government.

Just because someone used "ain't" doesn't (or don't) mean that the content of the argument is any less valid.

<TEXT> I think there's definitely been a shift to the far right for a while that was bubbling under the surface but its resurgence was very swift. From an outsider's perspective, it seem to me that Trump's election was the turning point, where people finally felt it was okay to express overtly white nationalist ideas. The whole debacle in Charlottesville signified that it was absolutely not going away. I'm sure that for Americans, the lead up was a bit less shocking. Both of these events also sparked a massive uptick in anti-American sentiment here in Canada.

Nazism is being as accepted as it is has been a really weird experience. I'm a lot more reluctant to be openly gay or Jewish since Trump's election. I somehow went a year or two without ever having anyone call me a faggot or a kike, even on the internet. Now, I'm getting shitty, overtly anti-semitic/homophobic DMs and seeing white nationalist comments with positive scores in places they would have previously been downvoted to shit two years ago. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sexual assault isn't treated like most crimes, which makes it harder to report. It's still a mixed bag if rape is going to be treated seriously by the police, especially if the rapist is someone famous (or even someone not famous the victim knows). There's a very good chance that their claims would be dismissed as trying to destroy the careers of their rapists, which may involve public perception being turned against them. It's hard enough for rape victims to not be taken seriously by their families and friends, let alone millions of people. 

Those who are raped by famous people also have to deal with power imbalances. If the person who determines your career rapes you, reporting them could leave you destitute and your rapist doesn't suffer too many consequences. And because the famous person is in a position of power, people are much more likely to believe them over the person who was raped. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've always wondered how being able to care for kids financially or intellectually would be defined should this actually be legislated. I come from a poor family (and by that I mean I don't think there has ever been someone in my family who would be considered solidly middle class) so to my parents, they were absolutely able to care for me and my sister financially. To middle and upper class people, my parents probably seemed really financially irresponsible. 

I think the problem with legislating this is that it assumes all poor people are bad parents, regardless of how good they might be, while assuming middle and upper class people are good parents, no matter how shitty they might be.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  In a gay relationship, is there a defined giver and taker role in the bedroom (sorry I have no clue the proper terminology) or do the guys do both?

It really depends on the relationship. There's some guys who refuse to bottom and some who refuse to top and other guys are willing to do both. In my experience, I found that guys will have a preference for bottoming or topping but are willing to switch.

 Are gay men generally turned on and cum to both receiving and giving (not oral)?

Again, this really depends on the person. I think a fair number of guys are like that but there's definitely some who only get turned on if they're receiving or giving.

 What is the difference between gay/lesbian and queer?

Gay/lesbian is someone who's attracted to their own gender. Queer is an umbrella term for not-straight/not-cisgender. In the past couple years, queer has become less offensive in the right contexts but that might just be a North American thing. </TEXT>

It's only gay if you and your partner are the same gender. Plus, dating someone of the same (or opposite) gender as you doesn't make you gay (or straight as the case may be).

 how being in a change room with the same sex not like being a kid in a candy store?

I find that for every hot guy in the change room, there's two or three naked old dudes walking around and drying their pendulous nads with the hand drier. They overshadow the hot guys. In junior high and high school, changing rooms are kind of scary. Teenage boys aren't that kind to their gay peers. When I was in junior high and high school, I was really scared I would pop a boner and get beat up whenever we had to change for gym. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Men are still very much the default when it comes to work, even though it's pretty common for women to work. This often means that there's work (that's dominated by men) and women's work (work that's dominated by women). Work that's dominated by men isn't noticeably gendered because men in the workforce is still the default perception. 

 I have never heard anyone in an academic setting discuss work in fields that men typically dominate, but aren't glamorous such as being a sanitation worker or electric linemen. Why does this not get brought up in academia?

This absolutely does get brought up in academia, although often in the context of the intersection of class and gender. I took a sociology of social stratification class and we went over this topic for a week and a half. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's an extension of penal populism, where politicians use the fear of crime, the belief that the current criminal justice system is coddling offenders to keep, and that the other party is soft on offenders to garner support. Calling an opponent weak on crime (or accusing them of wanting to pass legislation that helps offenders/harms victims) is a common dog whistle that the Republican party has been using since the War on Drugs.

Lately, it's been complicated by some Democrats/liberals talking about black people in the criminal justice system and the perception that black people are criminals. It's sometimes also used as a dog whistle to appeal to racist non-black people, although I don't think it's used consciously too much for that anymore. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm actually glad that transgender people (whether they be binary or non-binary) are having their moment in the spotlight. I live in Canada and here there's a pretty big disparity between the way LGB people and transgender people (including gender fluid people) are treated. Unless you live in a small, conservative town, homosexuality and bisexuality are seen as being relatively normal. However, transgender people are facing a lot of the same issues LGB people faced 20 years ago but with added problems with the healthcare system. 

I also think that by normalizing things like gender fluidity and non-binary genders, it will help ease the stigma that cisgender people and binary trans people face when they don't adhere to conventional expressions of male or female. </TEXT>

Sometimes universities will let PhD students teach intro courses because they have the knowledge to do so but they don't have the knowledge or expertise to teach above that level. 

Also, knowing how research is done and what constitutes valid research is important for those who teach, not just those who are doing the research.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Civil unions are less standardized than marriage and often have less legal benefits, especially for same-sex couples. 

People who really want marriage often want to have the same legal benefits that they can't get with civil unions or are harder to get. These include things like adoption rights, next of kin rights should a spouse die, and having an easier time putting a spouse on health insurance in the US. For gay people, being able to marry signifies that gay people are equal under the law.

There's also a view that marriage should only be for certain people and that any deviation from that removes the sanctity of it. Civil unions become a "separate but equal" way for them to give those they don't want to get married to have the same rights but wouldn't remove the "specialness" from their marriage.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the 1970s, there was a pretty major shift in public perception regarding the criminal justice system in the US. Prior to that, people were a lot more into rehabilitation. Since then, there's been this idea that prisons should not be nice places and that when people go into prisons, they will be deterred from committing anymore crimes (although there's not a lot of evidence to support that). There's not a lot of public support for policies that reduce violence in prisons because there's this idea that any policies that could do so would make prison too easy of a stay and people would want to go back.

It is absolutely possible to have a prison that's not as violent as US prisons. It just happens to involve a lot of money and policies that are not very popular in the US, as well as a revamp of the US criminal justice system.  </TEXT>

When they went to Europe, which was largely very intolerant of those different from them, they faced widespread prosecution and never had the chance to fully assimilate into the dominant culture. They were also barred from holding many occupations and when they did have good jobs, they had to hide their religion to keep them and their family and business safe. When prosecution got too great, they moved to another country and the cycle repeated but with additional conspiracy theories. Many Christian countries were also angry with the Jews for killing Jesus. </TEXT>

While the grades 1-3 kids (known as Division 1) were eating at a glacial pace, the grades 4-6 kids (known as Division 2) had to be outside, unless it was below -20C (or -4 Freedom Units). We also weren't allowed to bring food outside or in the classrooms, so we generally only had about 10 minutes to eat lunch.

When my little sister went into Division 2, the school decided to evenly split the 50 minutes allocated to lunch/recess, giving each division 25 minutes to eat and 25 minutes to have recess.  </TEXT>

It's also very expensive the further you get up north so there's not a lot of incentive to live up there.

<TEXT> I'm Canadian and I'd like to think I have a pretty good understanding of our legal system. We still have freedom of speech here. The shit Jordan Peterson said comes from a pretty serious misunderstanding of a bill, which was then picked up by people who don't understand how hate speech/crimes and common law systems work. Basically, the bill adds transgender people as (what I think in the US is equivalent to) a protected class to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms (which, incidentally, [specifically states freedom of speech as a right](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-15.html)). In essence, transgender people can't be fired for their gender identity and it's illegal to incite violence against them. It does not mean that it's illegal to call someone by the wrong pronouns and, after having read Bill C-16, I have no idea how he came to that conclusion.

Hate speech is also not just something that someone doesn't like. It's a serious, legal concept that requires a lot of evidence and is usually attached to other crimes. Simply calling someone by the wrong pronouns is not hate speech. However, promoting genocide or violence against transgender people does constitute hate speech. I actually couldn't find any incidences of hate speech cases from this or the last year because they're so rare and hard to convict.

TL;DR: Jordan Peterson is wrong about hate speech in a pretty significant way </TEXT>

<TEXT> It effectively forces the existing residents out of the neighbourhood and often into worse ones. 

Those who lived there before can no longer afford to shop at the local stores or the stores change to accommodate the needs to upper middle class (more often than not) white people. They then have to find a new, more out of the way store to get the same thing. 

Landlords start pricing the existing residents out of their places in favour of renting to people who can afford a more expensive place. Residents then have to move into cheaper neighbourhoods that might have worse schools and more crime because they can't afford live there anymore.

Those who gentrify neighbourhoods tend to get sick with what made the neighbourhood what it is after a year or two so they try to change things, thus destroying the existing community. For example, my parents live in a gentrifying neighbourhood and recently, some of the people who moved in are unhappy with a guy who rides his bike in his pyjamas at all hours of the day because they see him as being a nuisance. The existing residents embrace his weirdness and generally see him as a staple of the community. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A lot of it has to do with the nature of how homelessness affects men compared to women. Homeless men tend to experience longterm homelessness, are more likely to have felony (or indictable offences for commonwealth countries) convictions, tend to be by themselves or have to be separated from their wives/girlfriends should they have kids, and are more likely to have issues with substance abuse. Homelessness in men is more tied into issues in the criminal justice system than with women. It's also less dangerous for a man to live on the streets.

Homeless women, on the other hand, tend to experience short term homeless, are more likely to be escaping abuse, are more likely to have children with them, and are less likely to have substance abuse issues. They have more resources if they have kids or are escaping abuse. It's also a lot more dangerous for women to live on the street so they tend to couch surf or live in their cars, so they seem less visible than men. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Conservative parties tend to uphold the status quo, which appeals to older people who are more reluctant to change. Conservative parties that put emphasis on tradition also appeal to older people who are nostalgic for times when they were young, especially if they didn't face a lot of hardships. 

Meanwhile, liberal parties tend to be more willing to push change, which appeals to younger people who don't have any nostalgic feelings for the past or are unhappy with the status quo. 

I think that conservatism just changes over time. Conservative parties now are pushing agendas that would be considered radical in the past (for example, Conservatives are no longer railing against women's involvement in politics and, depending on the country, are no longer appealing to religious sentiment). The conservatives of the future may very well be the liberals of the present. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because homosexuality is not yet accepted in many sports (especially those that are considered to be very masculine like hockey, rugby, football of both the American and European variety, etc.), coming out is the first step to normalizing it in those contexts. The belief that masculine sports are for straight guys continues to persist, even when homosexuality becomes more accepted in general society. 

It's also very important for gay kids and teenagers to understand that it's okay to be gay. Having an openly gay athlete tells kids, especially those who are closeted, that being gay is not something to be ashamed of. For example, when I was growing up, I didn't have a lot of exposure to gay people in the media I was consuming and as such, I was very concerned that my feelings were wrong. If there was an openly gay NHLer (even if he played for the Montreal Canadiens) when I was a young teen, I think I would have been a lot more secure in my sexual orientation at a younger age.  </TEXT>

Unfortunately, university and college isn't free in Canada. It's certainly way less expensive than college/university in America but you definitely have to pay. My university tuition is just under $6000 a year (just over $3000 for the first semester and about $2500 for the second semester). I'm on bursaries and taking out student loans but it's still a fair chunk of change for a lot of people.

A lot of people didn't even know they existed before that point. Their games are only on the news when there's not enough NHL, CFL, and NFL games to fill up time. However, people lose their shit over hockey. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it's because it's adjusted for really shitty winter conditions. 100 km/h is slow the three months the roads are snow free. As such, no one actually drives at the speed limit (except in construction zones or when there's cops nearby). However, 100 km/h is about the fastest you'd want to go when it's snowing or there's snow on the highway.   </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think the daily caller is getting how this bill or Canadian law works. It's a lot closer to an amendment to the US constitution than an addition to the criminal code. It's largely symbolic but guarantees that transgender people have the same legal protection as religious minorities or gay people. It does not make it illegal to fuck up someone's pronouns (the bill doesn't actually use the word "pronoun" once) but it does make killing a transgender person because they're transgender a hate crime. If you want a real, Canadian source, you can read the actual bill [here](https://lop.parl.ca/About/Parliament/LegislativeSummaries/bills_ls.asp?Language=E ls=c16 Parl=42 Ses=1 source=library_prb#a12). </TEXT>

<TEXT> White supremacists tend to take a narrow, more traditional understanding of who's white. This tends to divide into four schools: true white people are from Nordic countries, true white people are Germanic, true white people are slavs, or true white people are Caucasians who live in Canada, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Europe, sometimes Western Asia, and sometimes the Middle East. Almost all of these specifically exclude semitic people because they're not originally from Europe (and it doesn't matter that they've been living in Europe for almost 1000 years and look pretty white). 

There's also a long tradition of anti-semitism in Europe. Jews were systematically kicked out of various European countries for millennia so they never had the chance to integrate into a country and fully adopt its culture. Since they've spent so much time as outsiders, they became convenient scapegoats and various conspiracy theories popped up. White supremacists continue to believe all that anti-semitic bullshit. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  Why everyone makes such a big deal over sex.

Probably a combination of a biological want/need for sex and our society places a lot of emphasis on things like how much sex you're having (which can be a good or a bad thing depending on who you are), if you're a virgin, etc.

 Why everyone seems so fixated on getting a degree, and not worried about what they're going to do with it once they have it.

We're taught having a degree or two is crucial for getting a job, especially for those of us who don't know people who can get you one. Simply having a degree is worth so much more than not having a degree unless you know the right people. 17 year olds also aren't the best at knowing what they'll want in 4-8 years.

 Why relationship/crushes occupy so much of peoples' time

We're social animals and relationships are somewhat connected to your social status. In high school, the cool kids have boyfriends/girlfriends. As adults, it becomes advantageous to be married or in a committed relationship. 

 How you can even get into smoking, when smokers tell you not to and it's clearly an expensive and unhealthy habit.

Smoking is a really good anti-depressant if you don't have access to affordable mental health care. It's expensive in the long run but it's way cheaper than going to a therapist and getting medication. The threat of lung cancer isn't typically a decision factor when you want immediate relief from stress.

 Why success is only measured by income.

Capitalist societies value how much money you have.

 Why you would pay 5x more for an item of clothing because it has a certain symbol on it.

I can't answer this for middle and upper class people but I can give you the perspective of a poor person. When you're poor, getting something with a brand logo on it means you can afford to not get some generic clothing item at Walmart. Even if it's used, you can afford to get the $6 shirt at Value Village instead of the $3, brandless shirt. It not only tells your peers you can afford that more expensive item, it also reassures you that you're not the poorest person around. 

 Why straight males enjoy watching lesbian porn.

I'm gay but I think it's because straight guys don't have to look at a guy (and let's be honest, the guys in straight porn are not remotely attractive).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> When my sister was a toddler, she went through a phase where she would strip completely naked if any liquid got on her. One day, my dad took me and my sister to this bulk food store. At some point during our shopping trip, my sister got some drink on her so she stripped down in the middle of a busy store and started running around like a drunken streaker in front of a full stadium, her tiny toddler cheeks exposed for all to see. While my dad was chasing after her and forcing her back into her clothes, I divulged in some sweet, sweet chocolate chips from a bin that was placed at five year old height. My dad paid for the stolen chocolate chips and hasn't been back to that bulk food store since. I plan on telling this story at my sister's wedding.

TL;DR: I ate some chocolate while my sister provided a store with an unexpected full moon. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My mom's moron cousin once said that immigrants are ruining the country. When someone pointed out that neither of his parents are born in Canada, he said it's different because his parents are from a white country (Russia). He also believes that slavs are genetically superior.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Canada's universal healthcare is one of our major points of national pride. We see it as a fundamentally Canadian right and institution. Some have suggested that vision, dental, mental health care, and prescriptions get included but no one's suggested it be privatized. It would be political suicide to even bring it up. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They can lobby the government to prevent publication of CDC data (since the CDC is funded by the government) and journal editors don't want their careers and journal to be tarnished. Reputation is everything when it comes to academic journals. Even the threat of a large, internationally recognized organization that could sue the journal into bankruptcy and tarnish the reputations of both it and those who publish in it (and especially the editors since they're the face of the journal) would keep anyone from publishing such research.

I've had several profs say they won't do research on American gun violence, despite being employed by a university in Canada, because they and the university can't afford a lawsuit from the NRA. For American criminology, the NRA is something you always have to consider when doing research.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I (and the article I linked) never claimed they did. They can, however, lobby for studies to not be published. In the article I linked, it talks about how the NRA bullies and sues those who try to get research on gun violence published, including the CDC. Institutions are not powerful or wealthy enough to repeatedly deal with multimillion dollar lawsuits whenever someone tries to publish a study they don't like. And, on the off chance those studies are published, the NRA just discredits both the research and the researcher. It's better for the wallets and careers of criminologists and their institutions to just not talk about American gun violence. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Probably not much. What makes gun control work in places like Canada and Australia is there's a very different attitude towards guns. They're seen as a tool, which can be used to hunt, defend yourself or your livestock against pests or dangerous animals (bears, deer, coyotes, gophers, etc.), or for sport at a gun range. They are only for using against people if they're going to kill you. Compare that to the attitude in the US where guns are to defend yourself or your property against other people. Perhaps it would somewhat decrease shootings but the opportunity to shoot people will still be there.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My university changed its bookstore so books are arranged by alphabetical order instead of by subject. It takes forever to find your books because the people who put the books away have no idea how to deal with translators, editors, and multiple authors. For example, if you have to read Capital by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, it could be filed under M or E or whatever the translator's name is. Sometimes it's both. I haven't met a single person, student or prof, who approves of the bookstore's organization. </TEXT>
