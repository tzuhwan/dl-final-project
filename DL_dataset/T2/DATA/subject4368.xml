<TEXT> I came back home at 25, to get a master's degree. My parents have their ideas and didn't want me to pay rent, didn't want me to work, didn't want me to do anything. They had planned to be able to support me through 5years of university, I had only used up 3 of those with my bachelor, so in their mind now I got to be a kid again. Not conducive to independence at all :-P

I couldn't fully cook for myself because my father goes bazerk if you take over his kitchen (he won't admit it but he does). I tried to do all the rest (cleaning washing, not letting them do it not even by mistake) and I was out a lot. I always let them know if I would or not be there for dinner, but I did spend quite some time at my girlfriend's house or at the library. I also enjoyed discussing any decisions I had to make with them but I took my own decisions and didn't let them influence me more than when I lived with them previously as a teenager.

I made sure to have my own money at all times, from savings and from occasional jobs I picked up, refusing their offer for full support. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They took me off of it because I wasn't showing signs of insulin resistance anymore and I don't have signs of it to this day (6y later).

However, they put me on birth control instead and even though I did gain the weight back it was tied to it being harder to keep off without metformin but also life changes (though, I felt, minor). Now I've changed bc and losing again.

As others said, you usually have to replace metformin with something. Go back to your gyno. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am pretty content with how I am doing now though not entirely satisfied.

I was diagnosed with PCOS at 21 because I had all of the symptoms on the list. I freaked. I had 3 terrible years, chasing after my period, trying to baby proof my life, with the wrong guy, it turned out. I learned the hard way that you can't force life to do what you want it to do. Some things are the way they are and you have to deal with them.

I had gained a huge amount of weight and was developing diabetes. By working with a nutritionist and my gp and endocrinologist I managed to lose the weight and avoid diabetes. I got back to regular periods and off metformin then later back on hormonal bc. (All this took 3/4y altogether).

Now I'm 29, I'm still baffled by how easily I gain weight, I'm now trying to lose weight again after I gained 11kg following frankly minor life changes. But I like the way I eat, I love yoga which can be a good form of strength training and definitely helps with the stress.

It wasn't easy but it's been so empowering to "beat" diabetes (and it motivates me to try and keep things this way) and I have learned to love my body at all shapes and to be grateful for all the things it still allows me to do: be with friends and family, move freely, think, see the world.

I'm somewhat afraid of not having had kids yet and not having the prospect of having them anytime soon. But I know myself and I know adoption or fostering will also feel fulfilling if that's how I get to be a mom. I'm saving up though, since neither those ways nor fertility treatment are cheap.

When an acquaintance or colleague announces a pregnancy, I'll admit I'm bummed for a second before I'm happy, and I'm sure this will get worse if I'm trying to conceive. But I believe I'm strong and resilient and I can do it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it's fairly common. I have had the same for most of the summer. Other girls on here told me it's because the combined pill you are on is too low on oestrogen but we're not doctors.

Go see your GP and maybe OBGYN. You might need to switch pills.

Just, in my experience, doctors have told me you should give a pill 3 months (3 packs, 3x28 or 3x21 depending on the type) for your body to adapt to it and for you to really see if it works for you or not. But then it also seems you're very unwell. Go see your doctor. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I got out of my third serious relationship feeling disappointed and manipulated. I realised, like other times before, I had let my partner completely disregard my needs and boundaries.

I went to therapy (had other issues too). Things I'm doing are:

- investing time in self care: indulge in my favourite body cream, take alone time to relax and recover, do massive amounts of yoga because that's what I like
- accepting compliments, not brushing them off anymore. It's baffling how much good stuff people say about us, if we just start listening
- journal. Sometimes it's just bullet points sometimes it's diagrams of my feelings and life. This is helping me recenter on myself and become aware of my needs and wants, as I have a very hard time knowing what I want
- really rely and confide on close friends, allow myself to ask for help and to admit when I'm unwell

But most of all taking time to listen to myself and learn to put myself first. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Except I did tell you what I was and what I am doing and you didn't believe me. Or OP if that's who you believed you were replying to, she mentioned what she's doing too. Sorry for replying to your comment to her but positions like yours make me really angry.

And I am fed up with people believing those who don't lose weight are just stuffing their mouths and chilling on the sofa. You can decide not to believe me, but I can't change my life experience to suit your ideas. 

What I did was eating very low cal and low carb diet (I mistyped it is/was 1200kcal) and exercising. I exercised much more than I do now in the past. Still, there were those 3 months of dieting and exercising and every two weeks my nutritionist would weigh me and the scale had not budged. I was honestly desperate and the scale did not budge until I was put on metformin. If you don't want to believe me that's your choice but that is how it went down. 

Now I gained 11kg since switching to a different birth control pill with very little life changes and while still maintaining that eating regimen (I wasn't dieting anymore, but that way of eating just became my way of eating - the rules that I mentioned above). I couldn't lose a thing until I recently changed birth control again.

Many people know the struggle of dieting and exercising with little to no result. I know it's supposed to be simple maths and it drives me crazy to not be able to just do the math and get the result. I have been dealing with this for 8y now, I assure you I have been through all kinds of phases and have no reason to lie.

This all has just been difficult and painful and in many ways life altering. If you are a PCOS patient yourself maybe you know about that.

I have read a longitudinal study of different groups with same calory intake/use people in which they ended up having different weights (it was one of those "all else equal" studies). Also there's studies on the impact of gut bacteria on weight gain.

I am replying to you again because from the short look I gave to your profile and past comments it looks like you might be a medical student. PCOS patients, and many more, are so often told they should just eat less when they are actually already making a big effort. Maybe the wrong kind of effort, but talking about it with us is better than just calling "bullshit". In general women's concerns are more easily ignored (just one source https://youtu.be/TATSAHJKRd8). 

Listen to patients and research women's health, instead of discrediting our experiences. It's hurtful and counterproductive to say the least. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I moved out at 17 then came back home at 25 to get my masters degrees.

I loved moving out young and becoming independent. It also eased things in my relationship with my mother, when I lived at home we were in screaming matches way too often.

Going back at 25 for 2y was such a gift! Not just literally because they let me go back home with no rent (we're Italian, from Italy. My parents will scream if I try to give them money. This has happened.) Being able to relate to my parents adult to adult, seeing them every day, discussing my life choices with them as an equal and just getting to know them in a way I couldn't have otherwise has been beautiful. They had me very late in life, I am already starting to be afraid of when they'll pass, I'm so happy I had that.

Just do what you need to do according to the situation and if your relationship with your parents is good invest time and effort in it. You'll never get that kind of love again. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry I spent time in the dispute with the other commenter before replying to you. 

Not losing weight when trying hard could be a sign of insulin resistance. It's good to check ourselves first though. Sometimes we think we're not eating much but we might be getting sugars through bad habits we don't even notice anymore or be making some "minor" mistakes that still add 200/300kcal a day and stand between ourselves and losing weight. A food journal usually helps you realise those things and can also be used to "prove" to your doctor you're really doing your best and not losing or losing very slowly. You can also look at this journal together to understand if there is any room for improvement and how. </TEXT>

I think maybe you're confusing me and OP. I didn't mention I'm too busy just that I'm not strict with myself, I have found that to be counterproductive for myself. There's many different ways of doing the right thing.

And even if someone thought they were too busy and weren't making this a priority? It's their choice and eating in a way that allows you to control your PCOS is something you learn and relearn and improve your understanding of over time. OP is clearly clueless and starting out. Cut her some slack. And cut me some too because I don't report to you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think intermittent fasting has a negative effect on PCOS. Maybe ask a nurse or a doctor, but I think you are good to continue with that.

People talk a lot about keto but I find that unsustainable because the amount of carbs in it is so low, also carbs are cheap so you might be better off keeping them in your diet.

I tend to:
- limit carbs: none at dinner, no fruit after 4/5pm, try to stick to a max of 100g of carbs per day
- switch to full grain when you can
- avoid ready made meals: sugar is nearly always an additive and you want to stay away from sugar as much as possible 
- eat meat that's a great way to feel full without carbs. Introduce some fish as well if you don't eat it yet, tuna and sardines are both good and fairly cheap alternatives. I mean you might be able to afford either one or the other once a week.
- veg sources of protein tend to contain quite a bit of carbs but I use them for lunch (white and red beans, chickpeas). Lentils don't have a lot of carbs and I think they're good for iron too (and one of the most eco-friendly foods as they need very little to grow)

I try to not be strict with myself but use the above rules. Remember to include a cheat day or cheat meal in your week or you'll feel miserable soon.

Currently I'm using the Lifesum app to count my carbs, it's subscription based but just a few dollars a month and it includes a detailed quiz about your eating habits and needs to recommend a diet and recipes. It won't impose anything on you, no reminders no fixed goals, but can give you recommendations and counts your macros. It also has an extensive list of products listed and you can scan the barcodes of things you eat if that's how you want to roll.

I'm currently "following" the LCHF diet and am seeing some results. 

If you don't see any weight loss after 3 months of consistent dieting, go see a doctor. You might be insulin resistant (common with PCOS) and that makes it close to impossible to lose weight without medication. It might be useful to go to your doctor with a food journal indicating what you ate in the last 2weeks, might use it as a tool to spot small mistakes and give you advice. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My period skipped while I was on the pill. My doctor found that suspicious and took me off of it since I had been on it for 7y (I had crippling periods that would leave me bedridden and chronically anemic without it).

After stopping the pill I gained 18kg in 3 months, started getting huge patches of acne and my hairdresser told me about a bald patch in the back of my head. I was feeling miserable and desperately hungry all the time. I tried to be stoic and not over eat since I was gaining so much weight. I was also getting as hairy as a yeti.

When I finally got my period it was 14 days long and it made me so emotional that my train ride to work felt unbearable and draining. I cried 6 times in a day and broke in nervous laughter multiple times. I felt crazy, I didn't feel like myself.

I saw my doctor right after my period ended and he did an ultrasound. Even I could see the cysts...there were so many. 

I got really scared about fertility, I was 20/21 at the time. I made some altering life choices due to that, which I regret. I was then put on a low carb diet, told to exercise at least 6h/week but I wasn't losing weight. After some more blood work it became apparent I was insulin resistant and I was able to lose weight thanks to metformin. 

The rest of my story is in a comment on r/PCOS. It's not tragic but not satisfactory.

Stay strong and live your life despite this. Don't let it drive your life. </TEXT>

He was a professor in our country, so I would spend summers with him when I was off school in Italy and my mom worked in Belgium then took some holiday and we'd all be together.

It did leave me with some abandonment issues, but after a few years my father was able to join us in Belgium. All things considered this was better than staying all together in Italy, my mom being jobless and unhappy and our budget being tight. I also would not have had my wonderful brother if our economic situation hadn't improved. 

I now speak 5 languages, I love my parents and brother and we all live max 3 blocks away from each other. We know a lot of immigrant families with similar histories and ultimately what matters is the love of parents for their children.

I would just advise you to either marry or have a legal agreement recognised in the country in which your husband and sons are citizens. I know it sounds cynical to think about this, but cross border divorces and child custody battles are a mess. Try to protect your family from it as much as possible. Tell your bf is not by lack of trust in him or you, but due to the inadequacy of the justice system. It's for the wellbeing of all 3 of you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We were both back in our hometown for different circumstances, we were both quite alone, reconnected and decided to watch a movie together. After that we kept in touch and eventually started dating, even though he later left the city.

We dated on and off for 6 months. I discovered he was an affectionate person but also a shouter (never at me but I could see that coming) as well as homophobic. During a weekend break we took together he mentioned he thought same sex couples shouldn't adopt. I was coming to terms with my bisexuality and that made me cry. He couldn't understand why that upset me so much.

Despite that I fell in love with him. He told me he didn't feel the same way so we broke up.

He came back to town a month later, begging me to get back together. I had just started dating my first girlfriend but still felt like I would say yes for a moment. We got back together for 24h, during which he asked me to quit a great training opportunity I was about to start so I could visit him on the weekends since he'd just gotten a new opportunity in London.

I'm so glad he said this, because it made me click and realise he was not the right person for me, at all. He was also horrible to his parents on the phone, especially to his mother. Would he talk to me like that, 10y down the line? I chose not to find out.

After that, every time he came back to town, he would try to get together and once knocked on my door crying begging me to get back together. I felt so bad I tried to cheer him up but really I had no obligation to do that. I was still with my gf at the time. He was in town about once a month and couldn't leave me alone. I told him given he knew I was in a relationship it was quite disrespectful to do what he was doing. I think he didn't see my relationship with my girlfriend as valid.

More than a year later, when I was single again, I made the mistake of hooking up with him and he's been blowing up my phone every time he's in town hoping for sex ever since. It's been 1,5y. He spent the full evening of our 10y high school reunion begging me to go home with him for sex. I now either not answer or answer by saying I'm busy and to stop texting and he stops. He's good looking enough I'm sure he can get sex elsewhere, I don't get what his problem is.

Our classmates were more friends with him than me. One of them is friends with my brother and I know they think I broke his heart for no reason and they say he's never recovering from it. Another friend of my brother told me my brother once stood up to them by saying he was really far from perfect. My brother was there when he knocked at our door crying months after we broke up. And knows how inappropriate he is and also homophobic. 

Me and this guy have known each other since we were 11yo and he was my high school best friend and crush. It's very sad to see this is who he turned into. I'm somewhat afraid of how he could behave towards women. I hope he can become a better person. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No it is definitely a thing in all the countries I've been to and I'm from. But for example we don't do Hamburger cookout, we don't put meat inside bread, we don't put sauces like ketchup and bbq sauce on our meat.

That, to me, is what is perceived as a US thing. The Belgians love BBQ and the Italians will gladly grill sausages and ribs and a whole lot of other meats too. Nothing like a summer BBQ to flaunt your family's best kartoffeln salat in Germany. 

But the bread and the sauces are a bit of a US thing to me. My father squeaks every time he sees us put ketchup on meat, despite being more of a US "fan" than us. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I got on it right after the PCOS diagnosis, starting from a low dose of 250mg at lunch and gradually going up to 500mg at breakfast, lunch and dinner. I was put on it because after 3 months of strict low carb/1200kcal a day diet I was not losing anything.

I was able to lose all of my excess weight, of course I had to keep going with the diet and get serious about exercise. Luckily I was a full time student so I had the flexibility to make that happen. I also had a mostly regular period and insulin resistance had stopped being a problem after 3 months of metformin. 

It took me 1y to loose 18kg. I was also seeing a nutritionist who had a lot of experience with diabetic, insulin resistance and PCOS patients.

The side effects of it were strong in the beginning, especially diarrhoea, but got better within the first month of taking it. Every 3 weeks doctors would increase my dose and the first few days after the dose increases I was in the bathroom quite a bit, but it wasn't too painful or debilitating.

I took it for 3years then happened to stop it somewhat by mistake (forgot to refill my prescription before a long work trip, then moved countries, then didn't have a gp right away). Once I stopped it I didn't gain any weight back for about 8months, during which I was exercising a lot though. As soon as my exercise regimen became unsustainable I started putting on weight and periods became more irregular.

My gynecologist got a full hormonal bloodwork and also insulin and glycemic curve: everything looked good, I had no insulin resistance and she put me back on the pill for periods. The first year on the pill was awesome but after that I started gaining weight again. Still no visible insulin resistance though, so no metformin anymore. Sometimes I regret stopping it so foolishly. I'm now switching pills and seeing if it gets any better, I have lost a bit of weight on this new one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know how the full interaction with the fertility clinic went, word by word. I understand that being told "we can help you lose weight" when you are already doing it is frustrating, but I think they meant well. I am overweight despite eating well and get extremely irritated when someone assumes I'm not trying to lose weight/doing my best.

Many people that get to BMI 37 or 40, especially without a health condition, are often at a loss. Have either tried everything or nothing and likely have a problematic relationship with their body and food. Before fertility treatment is an important moment to try to get that in order and if you were someone who got to that weight due to many other kinds of reasons, maybe hearing they offer support with that might be encouraging.

If I were you I would go to that appointment. As soon as the doctor hears you are on a plan to lose weight and are losing, they might tell you which weight goals they recommend but they will likely let you be on that. If they don't, they don't deserve the great reviews they have.

Go and get all of the information you can. You might already be able to do the genetic testing (info that stays with you forever, even if you change doctors or clinics) and semen testing. Then when you're able to see the gynecologist you want, you can make a plan based on what both fertility info and gyno info you got. </TEXT>

The second season is just coming out now, English subtitles should be available.

It's the story of Anna, a bisexual young woman.

In season 1 she discovers and accepts her sexuality 

In season 2 she meddled more in the LGBT community and I felt this was more representative of bisexuality and related experiences 

Hope you all can enjoy :) the second season also gradually becomes more intersectional in representation which is nice. </TEXT>

It's tiring to have to fight to be who you are even when you're just a "straight passing" bisexual woman. Also being bi is confusing sometimes as there is no frame of reference. Like, my bi-cycle is switching now and it's super irritating: why is my sexuality fluid? UGGGGH.

But if I was really offered a switch I wouldn't switch it. I want to be able to be who I am, not go back to "the norm" so they won't bother me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Self care, love, validation. You are awesome, you matter, no single characteristic defines the entirety of you. Each part of you contributes to make you the special person you are.

Be kind to yourself. Recognise biphobic thoughts you might have, or any thought that is putting you down. Think: would I say this to a friend? How would I feel if a good friend told me they thought this about themselves? 

Slowly teach yourself to put those thoughts aside and replace them with better ones. I'm prone to overthinking and spiraling down quickly and I make lists of good thoughts to reach for when I need them.

And regarding PCOS: it doesn't make you any less of a woman, it's a manageable condition, you can still have a full life. It's big news and takes some getting used to, again: love yourself. You are amazing and life is so full of beautiful things to uncover, PCOS won't change that. </TEXT>

Or maybe this belief could stem from education we receive and internalised compulsory heteronormativity (everyone is assumed to be straight, romantic love is only possible between opposite genders)/biphobia(bi people don't exist, are wrong).

I had contemplated the possibility of liking women more than the average straight chick but I only truly knew when I fell in love with my ex.

I wish I learned how to have safe sex with women before I started having sex with women. Now using protection feels very inconvenient/uncomfortable/unsexy but it really shouldn't.

Find coloured gloves (I now have purple ones but pink is also common) and introduce them as play, try dental dams or latex squares. Some women use lady condoms which also come out a bit and you can stretch them over the vulva.

Make sure you cut AND file your nails, as well as wash them regularly, before (doesn't need to be THE MOMENT before) and after sex. Also pee after sex, that goes for everyone.

I am sorry I don't have online resources about this.

I'm sure you will have a wonderful time, learning about sex with your partner. Best of luck! ;-) </TEXT>

<TEXT> My best friend had her first kiss at 22. She had a very similar discourse to you and it drove me MAD. She is not cover magazine beautiful (who is?) But she's very good looking and a great person. And the reason she wasn't having any flirts or relationships was actually because she was very guarded and afraid and honestly, that's ok too.

As teenagers we try to adhere to what we see as the norm a lot. But the world is so much better for all of our different ways of being beautiful, of being kind, of being funny.

I found out I'm bisexual at 26 and...how liberating to love women! I find 98% of women stunning and you know what makes my heart explode? When a woman's smile, or gate, or posture show her personality, when her voice conveys who she is and her emotions. It's not the size, or the prominence of the nose, or the height. And granted, men are not always as romantic in their way of loving women, especially many young men have not learned to allow themselves to be like that yet. But they too feel it, are attracted, to a person being themselves.

I've loved big women, small women, tits or no tits, nice smiles and somewhat crooked ones. I've had massive crushes on people of all races and genders and I'm by far not the only one. People are so beautiful and likeable and I'm sure you are too!

And if you're here, and you look how you look, it's because through generations someone found your parents, grandparents, great-grandparents attractive and their genes were passed onto you and you look as attractive as they did and someone, sometime soon, will find you attractive too, they surely already do.

When you feel your brain starting this kind of talk you wrote here, breathe for a moment and think: be kind. Be kind to yourself. Would you say any of what you are telling yourself to a friend? Be your first friend and don't belittle the body you have. </TEXT>

I also like my calves, which are super muscular despite me never trying to make them so. And I love my body hair, I always liked it as a teenager (after the first moment of shock) it makes me feel like a grown ass woman, mature and legitimate. I'm so happy I found the courage to stop shaving, I like myself a lot for that.

<TEXT> A young friend of mine is turning 18 in a few weeks. He was supposed to be starting testosterone this year but he won't be able to for quite a few months and he's feeling very insecure about his masculinity as a result.

I want to do the cheesy thing and create some self-affirmation cards (18 ideally or 20) to help him feel empowered about his masculinity and his gender identity.

I have already jolted down many, including stuff I have said to him in conversation and that will feel personal and true, and a few more I have found on the internet.

I wanted to ask to those of you who are, or are close to, trans men: what statements or ideas or concepts were the most reassuring and empowering at times at which you didn't feel confident about your gender identity?

Hope to get some replies (: a good Sunday to all the fabulous people on this sub. </TEXT>

Until end of August I was on Microgynon 20mg, now I'm on Yadere, skipping the white pills to avoid any bleeding at all since iron and other stuff were low when I had pill induced periods. Let's see which one I get next ;-) </TEXT>

<TEXT>  
I think being demiromantic or demisexual is something that has always existed and been known but had no label and was a bit foggy as a concept.

My parents and uncles tell me of those friends who never dated or mingled or flirted but got married, sometimes later in life, to someone they had grown very close to.

It's a relief to have a label because something you can't name "doesn't exist", not fully. And that's why I understand the interest of demi folks to look for or find a place in the LGBT communities. And to me you're welcome, get in all of you, the more the merrier.

But I feel like you shouldn't have to feel that your way of loving and being sexual is such a large variation from the average experience, that you don't have a fully legitimate place outside of the LGBT groups.

Come and be proud of your "different" way of loving, but I don't think society should make you feel so different. </TEXT>

I had a similar problem, my period wasn't really coming at all just some spotting every 32-34 days. The third time I went to get my blood drawn and asked for advice about it to the nurse. She laughed at me and called my period fake (I reported her) but she also called a gyno from the clinic for a quick opinion. We spoke for 3/5min and he confirmed I should do the tests.

Try to confirm this since you're having a hard time being in town on the days you have to take your tests. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I used pads for years because I couldn't insert tampons and I also bled A LOT and felt like it was easier to know when you have to change with pads? Odd but that was my perception as a young person.

I then briefly switched to tampons and then to the cup, as soon as it became available, and which I use now.

Pads are comfy but I found them difficult in the heat, especially if you're a heavy bleeder. 

I am VERY afraid of toxic shock syndrome, which is not a problem with pads. I only "accept" the risk because the waste of disposable period products is even more unnerving than the risk of TSS that I take with the cup.

I prefer the cup, but if that wasn't an option anymore, I would go back to pads. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Klaira/Qlaira, which I took in the past, is apparently good for PCOs, it was good for me for a long time. Re-evaluate with your OBGYN and mention your symptoms. There are loads of different pills and they can definitely find one that won't give you the symptoms you are having issues with. Also discuss getting off the pill and consider metformin and inositol. Ask it all and if your doctor isn't forthcoming go to a different one. You deserve good care. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have an automatic saving plan at my bank. I save 150 as soon as my pay check arrives, increased it to 500 because I'll need to pay for a surgery soon. The plan also rounds up all of my payments of less than 25 to the next unit, and saves the difference. So when I buy a sandwich for 4.20 it saves 80cents for me.

I also calculated what my baseline is (990) and my average expenses for food/entertainment (400) the rest I try to save and only used it for big purchases and medical expenses. I have separate savings accounts, one for the real savings, one for "fun money" like the money I'll spend to go see my friend in London on the spur of the moment or buy my mom a present. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I broke up with her the first time in Aug 2017, saying I didn't love her anymore. I explained that was because she had been very self-centered and inconsiderate towards me even when I had asked for more consideration directly. I had also told her from the get go my boundaries were ignored by previous partners and she did just that, despite me pointing several times to her behaviour as problematic and her committing to doing differently. I saw no difference after a few months so I broke up with her.

I was feeling betrayed and let down, I didn't value her as a partner anymore I was so disappointed. 

She then proceeded to convince me, a month or two after our initial breakup, that she also did not have feelings towards me anymore and we could be fuckbuddies. I stupidly fell for it but of course she was trying to get back together. I proceeded to break up with her and tried to go no contact several times throughout the first 6 months of 2018. Due to the fact that we shared some circles/places/interests she always found a way to force herself back into my life. Her two best friends were going through horrible times for different reason and I was the only close person she could talk to about her stuff. 

I told her this had to stop and we definitively closed the door on things when she left for a summer job of 1 month in another country. She did call back several time after one month and imposed her presence at a community event that was supposed to be about me. I just gave her the cold shower and did not pick up the phone or answer her texts. She eventually stopped bugging me in Nov 2018.

This time I was resentful and angry and got angrier and more resentful with every attempt she made to come back into my life and contact me. I now basically hate the girl, can't stand her. I heard she's in a LDR and drives to her partner every weekend. I'm glad that's the case so I don't have to worry to meet her in town or something.

I hope I never see her again. </TEXT>

Also on some hormonal contraceptives I can't lose weight, it sucks but since for me the alternative is very far away and awfully painful super long periods I prefer chubby me with a predictable and manageable cycle. 

I took inositol in the past, truth be told after diagnosis my doctors threw it all at me: restrictive dieting + tons of exercise, chiroinositol in small then more important doses and metformin. That got my weight back to normal but I don't know why apparently I couldn't be on metformin forever, after stopping that and inositol and going back on the pill I gained a decent amount of weight but yeah my periods are much better. </TEXT>

He needs therapy and you might as well, as a couple or for yourself.

Most bi people experience mental health issues for many many reasons and in greater proportion than lesbian and gay people. Coming out as bi is especially difficult for men. But this doesn't justify all of the lying.

I think it has to do with the fact that as women we are taught to love men and to be a certain way with/for them and I tend to reproduce that with a guy, unconsciously. Whereas with a woman...I'm free! No teachings to box me into a submissive position.

It's part of why I prefer being with women, I feel like I'm free to be myself with them, outside of society's norms. Then again, my attraction to men is still very much there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not freak out. I was 20 and having ALL of the symptoms and was warned about infertility. As a result I: stayed with my boyfriend I was going to break up with (need a dad), stayed in a bachelor that I didn't fully like, accepted a mediocre job out of university...all so that I could have kids before I turned 30. Of course all of this crumbled down and it took quite a while to regain ownership of my life and not let possible infertility ruin it. I'm 29 and single and f**k birthing babies, I'm going to find a way to be a mom when I can. I am a person WITH infertility issues not infertility itself.

Other than that:
- get checked for insulin and glucose resistance
- find a gyno and/or endocrinologist you have a good rapport with, someone you can ask questions to and that will give good and easy explanations, someone who takes you seriously 
- reduce your carbs and sugar intakes
- start including more exercise in your life

<TEXT> I do feel this way sometimes and have felt so in the past too. Sometimes it can last months, other times it will last for a few hours. I have learned to:

1. Think my way out of it. I have many things I like in my life, that are not achievements or goals but that make my life very enjoyable and even happy at times (my parents   brother, the volunteering activities I do, I like the rented place I live in). Of course some of these things I've had to do work in the past to find them and improve them (my relationship with my parents, finding a pass time that really suited me, apartment hunting, decorating and the upkeep that goes into a pleasant living environment).

2. I am old enough and lucky enough to have met people with varied life stories. Those that found their career, got married, bought a home later in life and are now fulfilled and happy. Those that didn't do all of those things and are also happy to have done it their way. 

At 32 my mom had spent 8y in Germany studying part time to become a translator a d working odd or demeaning jobs, she was unmarried, didn't own anything except for an old car and she couldn't find a job. She was stuck giving German classes to spoiled highschool kids. 10y later she had a great well paying job as a translator, a husband, two children and an apartment in a part of town she liked.

I try to take things in my hands as much as I can to make things I want happen and tell myself it doesn't all need to happen or it doesn't need to happen now. </TEXT>

Regarding your gender fluid date, I guess it depends on your perception of them. Do you perceive them as female or gender fluid? Did you know them as female before they affirmed their gender identity as fluid?

<TEXT> Carbs and sugars control can work for weight loss with PCOS, but you also need to have a good hormonal balance (the right hormonal pill for your body, or a balance of metformin and inosotol).

Know which foods might spike your sugars/insulin like potatoes, beans, grapes. Eat them only occasionally or earlier in the day rather than later.

Reduce the amount of carbs you eat throughout the day and eat full grain. Eat 50% of your total carbs in the morning and 30% at lunch, 20% before evening exercise or at dinner. Most PCOS patients keep their carbs at 100g/day or lower, some go as low as 20% but I'm not sure if I would advise that.

Given your health history you could try a dietician or nutritionist. Many endocrinology departments that have diabetes/pcos specialised doctors also have diet professionals or can refer you to one. That person can take all of your needs into account and design a plan that fits you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was lucky to find an amazing nutritionist. She did have to put me on a restrictive diet (I had just started having PCOS and was quickly becoming diabetic) but she made sure I had some freedoms (pizza on Fridays, a bigger Sunday lunch) and we found a bunch of food I liked that fit my diet, or nice recipes for stuff like chicken breasts (make them with orange zest and pink salt!).

She also made sure to get me back to a less restrictive eating regimen as soon as possible. 

I now avoid dieting, more I give myself eating rules and enforce them as loosely as possible. Low carb still means pasta at lunch sometimes, no carbs after 5pm can turn into "I'd still like a small amount of bread with this". I try to eat more vegetables and less refined stuff, find recipes I enjoy. 

I admit that the fact that my doctors have stopped harassing me about my weight helps a lot. They know I know, they know I'm trying, I discuss how I eat with them sometimes, to see if there's some room for improvement I'm not seeing.

Guilt and excessively high standards are your enemy. I'm very healthy by all accounts, my blood work and blood pressure are the desirable values. Yet I'm overweight bordering obese (losing a bit now). But I know I'm doing well by myself, trying to eat well and exercise. I cannot be anyone else but myself, this is good enough. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah my bf was a nice guy. He just hated my best friend and when I visited her. He would give me the silent treatment if I went. Be angry for ages.

All of our spare time HAD to be spent together, me and him or me and him at his family (my family lives abroad, I was allowed to visit them but not too long. He got offended when I stayed 3 weeks over summer break).

This is controlling behaviour. In my bfs case he was afraid to lose me and had to keep me under control to appease his fears.

It took me 7y to leave him, hope it takes you less than that. Ah and rebuilding your sense of boundaries after such a relationship is hard work.

Go see your sister. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I get it. The first year or years and a half after being diagnosed that's where I was too. And I expect I will get there again if I try to conceive. But this was my best friend and she did it alone, practically and emotionally. I would have put my anger aside for the time I needed to help her and support her, and dealt with it separately. We were 21 she had wagons of reasons for not keeping it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This year one of my close friend was the first person close to me to have a child. The weeks before my visit to her and the baby were mood swing of excitement and bitterness.

When colleagues get pregnant or a birth is announced I always feel a moment of sadness.

One if my friends hid it from me that she had an abortion while I was struggling with PCOS. While I appreciate the thought, I would have loved being there for her much more. Moments of sadness pass and she will forever have been alone in that when I could have stood by her. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I always like girl's Tinder profiles that don't have pictures. Most of the time they have flowers or something.

I respect that coming out doesn't come easy and might not even be safe. If I am one of the people they don't want to come out to they will just not like my profile. If we match and we know each other I can be discrete.

We have all, to varying degrees, struggled with our sexuality. How could we blame your for that? </TEXT>

<TEXT> But he might EXPECT to get a girlfriend once he stops being a creep, while it takes more than that. He needs to unpack why he does this, understand it's disrespectful, stop doing it and experience how relating to women as interesting human beings serves him better. 

If he merely resists the urge to send creepy texts for 3 months and doesn't understand the rest, when he doesn't automatically get a girlfriend he might feel like he was entitled to one and didn't get "it" despite stopping the bad behaviour.

<TEXT> Could it be vaginismus? Try gradual penetration and getting her comfortable first but, has she mentioned this word to you? Do you know what it is?

A friend had it and she would be super horny so she would force penetration past the pain (she was very young). She later found out she has vaginismus and they were able to treat it with some kind of exercise. We aren't super close so I don't know the details.

If all else fails, ask her to look it up and to try and understand if this feels like it could be it. She might have to tour a few gynos before she's taken seriously, women's pain and sexual pleasure is still considered as not worth much attention/emotional/the crazies/hormones even among those in the medical profession (bias is in all of us). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not the worst story on here but the most pain I remember feeling in such a short time. (I have never given birth).

I was 11 and this was one of my first times having a period and I was too young for strong pain killers. Me and my 7yo brother walk to get the school bus and my back hurt so much I just let myself fall on the ground because I couldn't bare the pain of standing up. My little brother ran home to get my father who came to the bus stop and carried me home.

I spent the next two days curled in a ball, in my bathroom, throwing up and with diahorrea, terrible pain in my stomach and back, unable to feel anything other than the pain. My mom would call me every hour to remind me to drink a little water. I saw a doctor but they said they couldn't do anything for me. I had a fever at some point. 

On the third day I woke up feeling like a human again but I was so weak I had to take a few more days off school.

Moment I turned 12 they gave me super strong buscopan that they give to kidney stone patients. I also remember we lost my stock of it on a holiday and my mom blowing up at a pharmacist who didn't want to give it to us because he couldn't believe such a small child could be in so much pain. I was surviving, silent from pain, holding my mom's arm not to fall at that moment. I started crying silently and I must have looked desperate because he gave in. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I was very happy with Qlaira/Klaira for more than a year, I had 0 PCOS symptoms and regular periods until it gave me spotting. Moved to Microgynon20 on which I gained a bit of weight (3kg nothing life changing) and no spotting until this summer, which I spent bleeding: blood every day an endless period. Now I changed to Yader and I've lost some weight, my acne is better and I'm skipping the white pills on my doctor's advice so no more blood for me. Feeling quite positive about this one.

In general all pills were efficient in regulating my period for more than 1y each and on most pills my PCOS symptoms were minimal or non existent. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I went through this frustration years ago and I just had to 

1. Meal prep: cook it yourself, in the largest quantity you can (try using discount, I live in Europe and even though vegetables and meat are more expensive than other products it's less expensive that buying ready-made, sorry to hear it's not the case there).

2. Eating more animal based proteins, especially meat. I'm ok with eating some beans at lunch and I eat a small bite of parmesan as a snack, but I also eat carpaccio, chicken breasts, ragu sauce (made by me), ham (lean and light kind) one time a week each + 2 times fish. It's huge compared to the 1/2 times a week I used to eat meat before but, except the chicken breasts, this is stuff I like.

It takes a while to learn to eat/cook in a new way and find satisfaction with it. That's why I always advise you don't do it alone and invest in a few appointments (10 over a tear could be enough) with a nutritionist or dietician who will help you find a way of eating that you can stick to and that you can enjoy. Stay strong, keep trying and don't do it alone (support groups, anything community based, friend/boyfriend can be good too). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Also people who "don't care" (you also say your relatives don't care, which she doesn't know) can still lack tact and even be homophobic to us after coming out in mode "I'm all good with you and your partner L, thank God you're not dating one of those over masculine women/at least you are down to earth not like those fairies that shake their ass at Pride". These opinions/false facts can race out of the mouth of ignorant but even well-intentioned people and LGBT-phobia against any letter of our alphabet can be hurtful. Depending on who your sister is and her past experiences, she might have much greater fears than what you can assume.

Even in an inclusive community/family one or two incidents over a lifetime can be enough to keep a person well into the closet. </TEXT>

<TEXT> First of all, moms always know. Me and my mom are not particularly close but SHE KNOWS. She'll randomly text "how are you, I'm worried about you" and it will happen to be justified (health crisis, work is hard, car accident - she knows).

Secondly, there's a certain complicity that comes from being romantically involved with someone and a few other things (siblings or half siblings, sharing trauma, etc.) and this complicity is highly noticeable. Even if your behaviour is the same as when you were friends, this shift in your relationship can show on your faces or in the kind of concerns you express for one another.

Come hangout on the bi threads and consider if you can come out. Unless your family and surroundings are very homophobic and you legitimately fear becoming homeless and other strong consequences for coming out, the negative reactions usually die out after a few months and you are able to find a balance again after that. Families usually get reassured over time, when they see you might be bi, but you're still the same child/brother/cousin they learned to love. </TEXT>

Then ask about it and reassure him it's not a problem and that I still find him attractive. I might get emotional and we probably would talk about it more than once if we are in a relationship.

If it's just a hookup I would ask why/what then carry on as if nothing had happened and respect who they are.

Everyone has scars from their past, visible or not. Physical ones force you to get vulnerable rather fast/early in a relationship and I would appreciate the guts/courage it can take to do that.

My dad didn't care but didn't do much to help me with my mom (they're married and we all lived together at the time).

My brother didn't believe me and told me "it's not cool to experiment with lesbian girls feelings!!!" but then he realized I was for real and he was like "Ok". My first gf was quite likeable, they were friends to an extent. Now he comes to Pride with me.

Others didn't care much. My best friend just went with me about it and she just started talking about me as bisexual or considering that as a fact as soon as I said the word/got involved with my gf. Friends complimented me on doubling my dating pool (I'm bi). General strangers I happened to mention it to were polite about it. I work at an LGBT friendly company and I've mentioned it to quite a few colleagues, no issue. It's somewhat tiring when conversation HAS TO be about that, when you mention it, but it's usually harmless and genuine curiosity and if it's under 10min, I'm find educating the world about it a bit, can even be fun. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I hope for you your period will come. I'm really sorry you're having to suffer through this anxiety, I don't understand how any government or legislator would want to do what Alabama does to its women. Adults being sexually active is normal but our society creates a lot of expectations and obstacles before we can be independent and raise a child. The "If you're old enough to have sex you're old enough to care for a child" adage is bullshit.

I am 29, I've been sexually active since age 17 and have had at least 4 or 5 pregnancy scares. My period was 2 weeks late once, but I got it. Most of the time I was on birth control but that sneaky thing still managed to be late. Other times I wasn't and one of these times I had not used any protection whatsoever.

It's scary but having a late period happens and I hope it's not an unwanted pregnancy in your case. It never was for me or my friends, I wish you the same luck.

Take a test after 7 days of delay. In the meantime plan for an abortion as much as you can but try to keep calm (do yoga, meditation, breathing exercises). Periods are sensitive to stress too and this can delay them a bit.

Things that can delay a period that aren't pregnancy:
- stress
- seasons changing
- new diet or sports habit even if they are positive
- health conditions that make periods irregular 

Good luck, stay strong, I pray for you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Only do what is safe for you, I read your parents might be a problem in this respect.

It's a common misconception that you need to have strong and crippling dysphoria to be trans. Being trans, as I understood from those who are, is simply not identifying as the gender assigned at birth and having a decise preference for a different gender expression than the one of the assigned gender.

You don't have a strong dysphoria but you have been thinking about this for two years so it's important to you. Find spaces in your life to experiment with feminine expression: a friends slumber party, nights in which your parents are out. You don't need much to try. If you like it go for more, especially when you move out due to work or college you'll have the freedom to really do that.

Good luck and stay safe. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Go to a dietetician/nutritionist and ask for help
You need a realistic diet you can follow long term that can turn into a collection of habits.

I'm now back on my PCOS post diagnosis diet, which is really low on sugars, but even when I'm not doing that some things have become a habit: no sugars after 17h00, always eat full-grain, choose lean proteins (harder as a vegetarian but a I'm sure it's feasible with some advice). Know which foods have particularly high glycemic indexes and only eat them 1/2 a week if you like them or skip them 100%. Similarly, know what contains more sugar. I love figs, but I only eat them when in season and max once a year coz they basically ARE sugar.

I also do one month a year in which I don't eat sugar at all (sugar as in fructose and saccarose, not pasta or bread) and it helps in resetting my taste and it proves to me that I can go entirely without certain foods and be perfectly happy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think aside from non-binary and bi/pan other definitions are pretty clear cut. Also as you say, everyone defines themselves the way they want. A trans man who loves women and prefers to use lesbian instead of straight because that's how they learned to understand and live their sexuality pre-transition, is not wrong, just maybe counter intuitive for those who are not in the know.

I identify as bisexual but find nb and non-cis people attractive, I have been told that I should identify as pansexual. I prefer a more inclusive definition of bisexual, so I don't think I should. I also read a definition of pan that reinforces that, pan as people who are attracted to people regardless of gender, bi as people who love different genders.

There's no right or wrong: there's a multitude of definitions and nuances, like anywhere in the world. So many ways to be a man or a woman, Italian or American, and so many other things.

Everyone is right in the way they define themselves, you just have to fill the gap between your definition and theirs to understand it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am somewhat of a secondary member in a friend group to which I was introduced by one of my closest friends. He is one of the "founders", since the group originated due to him and a very bubbly couple always running into each other on a certain long commute.

I like the group a lot, they are a bit older than me which I enjoy too. I have a good feeling with all of them and I take part in many of their events and invite them to mine, but I'm not as close to them as the core 3/4 people are among themselves.

I see them nearly every weekend, I like this satellite position I have because it allows me to take time off/away from the group without it looking odd, but I also always have access to them and they're really nice people. I love making fruit salads or desserts for the parties and bbq they organise. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a community, made of people, so there are divisions. Those that enforce those divisions think they are right to, the others usually feel disdain towards them.

The vast majority of people I have known that are LGBT are very inclusive and won't stigmatise anyone, though they still might misunderstand and hurt certain groups due to ignorance but that is not done with ill-intent and is usually corrected/reflected on when highlighted to them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm sorry to say this but...you just know. The same way people know they are attracted to different genders than their own.

Before knowing, though, you don't. Like I thought the way I liked girls/women was normal because society hypersexualizes women so sexual observations about them seemed the norm, even as a female. Then a girl hit on me and I liked it and then I knew. But before August 25, 2016 - I really didn't know. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I met my first gf out of a common interest, one girl at a queer love festival and all other partners on Tinder.

The best way to meet other gay women to me is going to LGBT events, not necessarily geared towards women but also that, though I'm too shy to take them home after that because I'm afraid to get into a L-world situation in which everyone has slept with everyone, since the crowd I meet at events is always more or less the same people.

Disclaimer: I just received harassing messages for publicly commenting as a bi woman in this and other threads today. To the haters: I'm going to block you as soon as I get your DMs coz, you no interesting ;) </TEXT>

<TEXT> This girl started hitting on me and I liked it so we started dating. I was 26.

If you go on bisexual threads you'll see confusion is very common. Most things in society are binary, as in "pick one" and us bi people often feel compelled to do that. My thoughts go something like:

"Am I just straight?" 
*kisses girl at a party*
"I'm definitely bi".
*only dates girls for 3y*
"Maybe I am a lesbian"
*office flirt with male hottie for 2 weeks*
"Nah definitely bisexual"

This, on repeat, forever.

Sexuality, and this is more apparent for bisexuality, is nuanced and sometimes fluactuating/fluid. We don't necessarily love men and women the same way or to the same extent, our preference is rarely split 50/50 and there's something called the bi-cycle, for some periods of time you might find men more attractive then women again. It's all good, you just need to get to know yourself, like anybody else does. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am fine with aroma. Discharge usually tastes slightly salty to me, showers or not and in good sexual health. Honestly as a woman who loves women, a woman's aroma is what I live for, sex wise, it arouses me immensely. Men's is less of a thing. 

For me bodies smell and taste, everywhere not just genitals. Try sucking a neck or an arm or a thigh. I don't consider aroma to be dirty, it also has to do with hormones and for example a woman doesn't taste the same the week after her period or the week before, even when she just showered. I like that, I don't want my partner to erase it or tone it down by showering before every sex act. I want them as they are and if that includes a bit sweaty I don't care. 

I think when we talk about a *stink* either their hygiene is seriously lacking or the person has some kind of infection/medical issue. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think body fluids are fine. I want my gf to be aroused and wet before I get down there, that's discharge too. My boyfriend's penis will also likely get a bit lubricated with arousal, that's sexy. Dry sex hurts.

What I'm saying is that it's not inherently dirty. The body fluids of a person with good hygiene/no related health issue don't stink and sex with us/them is totally enjoyable even if you haven't just showered. A bit of dirt never killed anyone and if you like showering as a way to prepare for sex, go for it, but it is not crucial and necessary to me. I hardly ever shower or wash before sex and me and my partners have been having a great time anyway. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, I don't know about Canada but here in Central Europe you would be hired as a SAP Business Consultant in a heartbeat, based on your experience.

It's hard for me to tell how long SAP will remain successful on the market, but I've heard a lot of people say that when you know one complicated ERP/software it's fairly easy to learn a new one. 

I work as a consultant and I like my job better than I would like working in the SAP Team of a company because I see a lot of different implementations and processes. Our company also wants us to always be at the forefront of things so we are offered a lot of SAP and non-SAP training that helps when you want to pivot in your career.

Many of the manager level people that leave consultancy go to big SAP-centric corporations but I've known a few that just took a high placed non-software specific role, I.e. a guy who takes care of how data is used throughout IT in general, not just SAP.

I think it can be a great place to start a career if you like it. Interview for SAP and Cybersecurity positions and pick the best opportunity you find. </TEXT>

<TEXT> None of the girls I ate out ever had hygiene problems. Most girls I know (friends, close friends) are aware of the sweat issue. I don't wash daily, my partners didn't either, but there was never bad taste. Regular showers, changing your underwear daily or more when it gets warm/dirty (excessive discharge and a bit of pee can happen) is enough in my experience and all of the women I have been with did that.

The diet advice makes a lot of sense and the taste of a BOYfriend of mine improved when he changed his diet. Diets that are heavy on sugars and fat can give a taste that is unpleasant to most. Of course asking someone to change their diet is a big step and very invasive.

In my experience most people that didn't smell/taste perfect had either just peed or had some sort of bacterial infection. Washing yourself too much or too thoroughly can also cause that, as you endanger the natural environment of your body which is usually balanced.

Just retract your prepuce/run your fingers through your labia when you shower and that should be enough. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can only come by imagining a MFF threesome or by calling my partner a slut in my mind or out loud. I think of that when I'm with short-term or long-term partners and I come. It took me a while to allow myself to do that and a little bit more for it to work.

You might be bisexual, that's fine. Try thinking of what turns you on while you're with him, just before you climax, then talk about your attraction to women when you feel like it. If you're in for the long haul you should be able to have this conversation even though it might not be straightforward if you're uncertain about how you feel, but you should be able to talk about it. 

It's acceptable to say that you have a sexual attraction to women and that you might not be straight but are not sure what label you could put on it. I actually said more or less that to my ex boyfriend and he was ok with it/didn't fully "care" - we were also heading towards marriage. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I realised the thrill of the job (the adrenaline and consequent satisfaction of achieving my goal) was wearing down and that's because the job was somewhat repetitive and starting to be "too easy". I was an event organiser, organised international congresses. But there were procedures and if you followed them well the greatest hassle was crazy clients/speakers but I had learned to manage that too.

It felt like I could do more, I like to do something I find challenging. Got a master in economics and business and I'm now a business analyst in an IT company. 

I guess I also didn't like my first career enough, I enjoyed the wine tasting and some of the travelling, but ultimately a lot of it was about people's egos and appearances and I could never give a dime about that.

I deal with client's ego and politics in my current job too, but my colleagues, IT people, are pretty concrete and down to earth. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My favourite word is cunning.

Learned it when I was 7 and in the other languages I speak anything that is close has negative connotations, more than cunning does.

We learnt it in relation to a fable of Perrault, The Fox and the Grapes. The exercise said the fox was cunning and it felt like there was admiration of her resourcefulness there.

Malin, malizioso, furbo all have more of a negative undertone too (though there's some admiration in furbo). </TEXT>

Something that would make the difference is whether I know the person saying it is an ally and makes the joke but knows they would not in reality prefer that (probably means I know them quite well too). 

If I didn't know you and you made that joke on our first night out together, I would just...hold off from thinking you're an amazing human right away and maybe take a bit more to warm up to you until I'm sure you're ok.

I'm trying to get something very nuanced through, I hope you get it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had this girlfriend who was really impressed by my academic skills, how I am a fast learner and able to quickly analyse almost every situation. A few months into our relationship she admitted she felt less intelligent than me and she thought I might leave her because of that.

All the while I had been really impressed with her ability to read people and to quickly understand the best way out of trouble or difficult situations, she was a social worker I'm a business major.

We had different kinds of intelligence, and mine might be the most glorified one in academia and society but I never thought of her as less than me she actually taught me so much.

We both were very curious people and that made for some amazing conversation.

If your boyfriend is any kind of intelligent he's likely curious too and he'll value your shared interests, your own interests and your intelligence. You're nothing less than he is, I'm sure. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was diagnosed after my first break from the pill and suddenly gained a lot of weight despite no life changes. Without the pill or medication I couldn't get my period or lose weight, despite a diet and regular exercise. After 3/6m (can't remember) of doctor monitored diet + exercise and no result they put me on metformin and I slowly started losing weight. It took me 2y but it worked. I had semi-regular spontaneous periods too. I've honestly never felt better than while I was on metformin. 


I stopped somewhat by accident (all town was out of it and I had to take a long international trip for work) and I was fine for a few months after that so I just decided, with my doctor, to get back on the pill. I gained weight again despite diet and exercise. I'm not sure why I can't just be on metformin forever but doctors refuse to consider it again for my treatment (gyno + endo specialised in PCOs). </TEXT>

In one short walk to the metro via a park, me and my two 13yo friends were hit on first by 2 50yo men in a car who slow drove next to us for a while making life comments and asking us to go home with them and then by two 19/20yos walking behind us, who of course wouldn't let us turn them down. We had to run from them into the metro and I remember the frantic search for my card in my pocket thinking my life depended on it. It was the middle of a summer day so the city was somewhat empty. They were running after us but quit once we passed the gates.

This wasn't the first time I was being harassed but oh my god was it scary.

I was wearing a yellow skirt that day that I never wore again, deciding the skirt was the reason they had targeted me/us. </TEXT>

<TEXT> TDLR: I'm doing everything I know to do for PCOs and my underchin still wont quit producing acne. How to get it to QUIT the pimples?

Hi dears, I was diagnosed with PCOs at age 21 after gaining 18kg in 3 months when I stopped the pill. I then went through basically all possible types of treatment, lost a lot of weight thanks to diet   metformin.

Now last autumn I gained a lot of that weight after a very stressful period and big changes in my routine (start of  new job).

I've since tried to loose weight a couple of times already but I gave up twice after 6-8 weeks of consistent efforts. I'm now attempting again, I am following the diet that was made for me in 2010 religiously, I'm exercising, sleeping enough, doing yoga and my birth control was changed (but only 3w ago) because I had important intraperiod bleeding.

Now.

ACNE.

Since about June I've been getting rashes of whiteheads under my chin I'm at a bit of a loss as to what more I can do. It won't go away.

I'm not eating processed foods and I've also completely given up alcohol because who needs extra sugar (was drinking max 1/week before).

I'm 29 and it's embarrassing to go to client meetings with this patch of somewhat visible acne or even worse (sorry somewhat graphic content coming next) to scratch it by mistake and to have it pop while I'm in said client meetings.

What can you recommend? </TEXT>

Leaving this here as food for thought, not sure if this is you but worth checking for yourself, IMO.

He handed officers his ID and he did not have a beard on the picture, which is the first thing the officer looked at, but he had a full beard that day. The guard goes "so the prophet does allow you to shave". My father points out he's an atheist and also Italian with no Arab or Muslim history, as all of his paperwork and ours could prove. We crossed within minutes once they realised he was not a Muslim.

<TEXT> I had many coz I moved around a lot. My favourite though was Maureen. She was tall and beautiful and didn't care about school social status, so she still hung out with dorky little me. Her dad lived in the neighbourhood and when she was at his place we would troll the streets convinced we were super badass, eating cola candy and bossing my little brother around. We were 9 or 10, brother 6. Such a cool team.

My favourite memory is when her father asked me to help her learn how to use Word so she could do her homework. It was 1999 I already had a computer and I was a self proclaimed writer. I proceed to spend 2h on the fathers computer teaching Maureen how to use icons and to lay out fake living rooms in Word. She was delighted. I then start panicking because I suddenly can't find my glasses, she starts panicking too because she can't find them either and I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO LOOK AT THE COMPUTER WITHOUT MY GLASSES. We call her father, we were completely desperate.

Turns out I never took them off so they were on my nose. He found it so funny he didn't care we hadn't finished the homework. </TEXT>

I can't count the number of female friends who have horror stories of early body shaming or excessive praising if they were thin (which both create "I must be thin" anxiety). I was put on my first diet at 7, I was barely overweight (I was also asked to get thinner but presented with nothing other than sugary snacks at breakfast and afterschool). Also, I have 9 cousins only 2 of us are girls. I heard my aunts and parents talk about our bodies a lot (not just even fat but also hairy, short, feminine or not, downright to sexy - about my cousin who was 8) never really heard more than "X got really tall!" for any of the boys. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's definitely not every woman's view but I'd say...opening doors for me. I know most men do it out of kindness not only politeness. I even recognise doors at my office are super heavy (WHY) and it is more convenient to have muscular-programmer friend do it. But I move around the office A LOT during the day and the door is opened for me EVERY TIME. Each time I think "I could have done that". And it doesn't make me angry but I feel infantilized, 10-15 times a day. 

I know the feeling is on me and not on them, and I do get over it in matters of secs, but I'd love to open all of my own doors one day and feel the power of my tiny muscles (believe they're tiny, but STRRRRRONGGGGG).

So this is my fantasy. A day when men won't open all the doors for me. </TEXT>

I was depressed age 13, I was sent to a therapist for anxiety. She was shit and never picked up on the depression all the while I was trying to kill myself or find the courage to do it. In the end I couldn't do it, thankfully, and I just grew up in my depression until one day I was still there but the depression was not. It took years and I was not in top mental health after that, but I had regained interest and impulse in life. I now go to therapy, for a bunch of stuff, and do sometimes still have fleeting suicidal thought, but I'm not depressed.

Just HANG IN THERE until you can get help. Try to Google if there could be any form of free help in your area for depression, like a phone line for example or a support group that meets close to where you live. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You do sound like you could seriously be depressed. You can get better. Do you have access to therapy or counselling? Think about it until you manage to call someone, make an appointment and actually go. You might not achieve all of this on the first try but that's ok.

I don't know why it's so hard but I have one tip of my own and one I read on Reddit to share:

1. When you catch yourself thinking too much into the future, take a deep breath and tell yourself you don't actually want to think about that now, you are just spiraling. Keep a backlog of useful thoughts (I have to do the dishes and buy X tonigh) and memories (that time grandma bought a swing for her backyard for us) to replace it with. - from Reddit

2. Find an easy source of positive emotion. When I was depressed I realised I was still, from time to time, noticing beautiful things. It was istinctive for me to do but would get buried under the depression. So I started making a point of underlining and remembering the small beautiful things I noticed and to bring them up in my mind from time to time, to give me a positive thought on a dark day. I.e. "a flower on my way to school", "a kid running", "a glimpse of a fancy raincoat in the window of a shop". I would crystallize them and store them and the really small connected happiness/wonder for other days. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Compulsory heterosexuality can lead homosexual people to persuade themselves into straight crushes. 

Being that sexuality is a spectrum, your friend could prefer men but have had one or very few exceptions/crushes/loves for girls/women.

Moreover, exuality is fluid for some people and his preferences might have genuinely shifted.

Also could your friend be bisexual? If he is, you might be assuming he's gay based on the fact he has a long term male partner or has only had visible male partners in the past, but your assumption could be inaccurate. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Start with PFLAG https://pflag.org and go from there. Research: how to make a trans student welcome, how to avoid conflicts etc. At least in Europe where I live there are guidelines and best practices out there for teachers and educational institutions. I can share one of those resources if you want but they are in French. You might be better off looking for guidelines created by teaching communities or states that are LGBT friendly. They definitely have equivalents in the UK so if you are from there or are struggling finding US material, turn to that.

Just use the correct name and ask for pronouns, say sorry if you ever get those wrong (say sorry to Jim when you see them next, privately. Say sorry, own your mistake. Reassure them you're up to speed now and you respect their choice of pronouns) and educate yourself to avoid unnecessary mistakes. Queer youth who are out are, regardless of their circumstances, exposing themselves a lot and taking quite some risks. Just like any teenager they can easily feel vulnerable and stressed, but maybe more so since they're trying to build their identity (we adults are too) in a world that sends at least mixed messages about how acceptable their identity is, when it doesn't downright condemn and kill people from the group they belong to. Depending on the teens age and perception, these things might weigh on them so learn about them.

If you have an LGBT support group or club at school that involves teachers maybe look for resources there? Or refer to the older students that might lead it.

<TEXT> Mixed. I think mostly in my mother tongue with big chunks of English and some phrases of French. Dutch and German play a smaller role.

I notice I will think of a word in the language that describes the concept more closely or in the language I first learned the word in. 

For example nothing beats the word "cunning" in terms of what I usually want to convey/put my finger on when I think of a ruse or strategic solution and my taxes are "les impots" since as an immigrant I've only ever filed tax returns in French. Some legal concepts I can only think of/express in my mother tongue, in which I learned of them. Some exclamations I always think of in German or Dutch since I learned them in those languages as a kid, but in conversation I will mostly use the English/French equivalent even with a Dutch or German speaking friend.

<TEXT> I guess you have to be objective at some point and consider what their faults are. If their faults are just character flaws you have to decide how to cope with them together or if you can't cope, part ways. If they are worrying behaviour it's good to take some time to reflect why you want to pursue a relationship with someone who is disrespectful/manipulative/abusive: these people rarely change, and they rarely change based on a partner's request.

The groove/feeling is an amazing point to start off but can't sustain the relationship alone. You might also find that, with time, this feeling diminishes if your partner's faults keep getting at you, i.e. if they keep talking over you, whatever feeling of clicking you had will likely fade.

Long distance is hard but can work very well with the right amount of effort. There's no shame in calling it quits if this is too much for you or if you feel like you don't have "enough to go on" (short dating history). </TEXT>

It's impossible to have a mistake-free learning experience in any field, I think school should equip kids with the tools to recover from their mistakes, not on how to avoid making any, at all, entirely.

Bi woman here. Hardcore environmentalist too so I was dead set on NEVER getting my licence. 

(Now we've established we're both LGBT and not car lovers, you can relate to me as I relate to you and I can entice you with some, hopefully, cheerful and motivating speach).

It took me TWO YEARS. TWO ENTIRE YEARS.

I took the test 5 times in total, by the last time I wanted to die.

Apparently very intelligent and very sensitive people have a harder time getting our license (yes, I'm calling you and me highly intelligent and sensitive. you're welcome) because we just perceive so much more information to process and have to think so far ahead coz our brains think more XD 

I don't know but I bought it, I needed too because the amount of time and money spent on that skill was CRAZY.

I also suffered my fair share of bad jokes and abuse from driving instructors and my family. It was horrendous. They joked they spent more on my licence than my masters degree (Europe).

I got it though! I'm now a very careful but good driver. I still try my best to avoid driving but since starting to work as a consultant I've had to do it more often and I'm happy to report I'm getting comfortable with it.

YOU CAN DO IT. YOU WILL BEAT THE HE** OUT OF THIS SKILL. I believe in you. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Before bed I was thinking back to an episode in which me and this friend (+ another girl) were 14 years old and had to fend off grown men's advances twice during the same short walk to public transport in a "safe" neighbourhood. I remember being disgusted and shaken and the third friend laughing it off. This friend "knew what to do" she was very aggressive, defensive, made a lot of noise and reacted harshly which ultimately kept these men away.

While wondering why she was so much more prepared, I couldn't figure out why. I was very physically mature, had had many many many men mistake me for legal age already. She was not but she was fierce and visibly prepared to react this way. She hated men and unwanted attention the most among our friend group.

And that's when something clicked and a memory came back. She was raped and she told me about it and I didn't understand it. I'm so sorry to her and to all of you who have had similar experience I would like to tell you we are with you. We support you. Even if we might not be able to on the spot. I wish I could go back and tell her how much more things make sense now. 

She hated herself all throughout high school, we stayed friends but slowly drifted apart. Many in our class tried to stay in touch with her but she made herself impossible to contact and refused contact to the few close school friends who managed to reach out to her. I know a neighbour who is friends with her sister.

I won't disturb her peace but I really want to tell all survivors who told and weren't understood how sorry I am. 

I'm posting here because I can't tell anyone. All the very close friends/family I could tell this to know her and it would be impossible to tell the story without sharing her identity or elements that would make her identifiable to them.

The episode I remember her relating was of a situation where she had not been asked for consent, had not expressed neither consent nor the lack of it because she didn't think she had to. She was 12 or 13, this was the last day of summer holiday at her family's usual vacation spot, the rapist was a 15yo kid whom she had fancied all summer and finally went on an ice cream date with. She told me about it without using the word rape or abuse, she did mention she did not give consent. The reason she told me was to explain why she had been absent one of the first days of school on which we were starting a new exciting course: she was bleeding heavily from her abortion pill. I was 13 and I guess I focused on the bleeding, on the abortion. I guess I wasn't ready to receive this story and suppressed it until yesterday night. I am going to turn 29 in a few weeks.

Her family went back to the same place for years after that. She told me she still saw him. She would tell me about seeing him and say it was odd, if I asked why she would tell me it was because he was the first boy she ever kissed. It breaks my heart.

This is so very unfair. I wish I could have been there for her. I wonder if she told anyone else or not. She told me that, at the time, the abortion was between her and her mom, nobody else "needed to know".

I share my love and sympathy for her with you, as I cannot share it with her. May karma make it go round until she receives it. Everyone here is worthy of so much love. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm 28, nearly 29, and I just started to acknowledge this and work on it 1y ago.  I realised how much of a problem this was because I was becoming unhappy in each serious relationship I tried to have due to this. Chose manipulative types and couldn't be vocal about my needs with them. 

The transition period is indeed hard/odd. I'm single, at a time where I would like to start a family but I can't bring myself to date, I've made myself completely emotionally unavailable for it.

I like to spend time alone more, because when I'm alone it's easier to put the finger on what *I* want and not just go with the flow or follow other people's wants. I have had periods of total isolation, times at which I would not feel like seeing anyone and I would do my best to work from home or at least lock myself at home Friday 5pm to Monday 8am. Giving myself this much space often felt necessary.

I'm very happy being alone but it's not what I want long term. I'm now dating this girl, sporadically. We are in touch a bit and see each other every 2/3 weeks. It seems to suit her too. This gives me ame time to decide what I want and what I feel like, I need this level of distance at the moment. I'm just trying to listen to myself and I am in therapy which mostly helped me identify the mistakes I make or can avoid in order to make choices I like more. My sense of self is very small and undefined and I'm mainly trying to build that up. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, the advice you already received is concise and complete so start there.

Did you try addressing your history of abuse with a therapist? I apologise if this is mentioned and I'm missing it. If you haven't, it could get some harmful ideas/thoughts out of your head and help you deal through what formed your sexuality. Make sure to find an LGBT friendly one. Even a few sessions can help and therapy money is very well spent with a therapist you click with. I personally made it a priority in my spending at a time when I didn't have much and I advise anyone else who can to do the same. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A great uncle that resented his mother for being short and a redhead (of course she must have built him that way on purpose). He had 3 wives and 6 kids (all short). He tried to get revenge on his mother by going back to the Sicilian village she had escaped from to elope with her lawyer husband and to tell on her to her mafia related family. 

They showed up at her door thousands of kms away and her other sons had to "persuade" them to leave. 

Years later they tracked down my grandfather and scared the shit out of my grandmother (24yo bride at the time). Luckily my grandfather was a high court judge and made credible threats. The mafia part of the family has since died out, though they came back to try and threaten different generations over the years.

Our hero is my mom, who managed to become friends with the last two remaining members of the family. Take this great uncle Vincenzo. </TEXT>

Tell him you wanted to laugh it off when you started dating but now that it's more defined/you're reflecting on it, those laughs make you uncomfortable, you don't like them anymore. Laughing it off is probably his own coping mechanism too, so ask him to explicitly voice his insecurities with you. Now but also on any given day.

You are in this long term, and you are figuring this out, he has the right/duty to figure it out with you as in "what does it mean for/to him" to have you become more aware of your orientation.

Your feelings seem very deeply rooted and exceptionally strong if you've had a "conventional" life experience. If it's not dysphoria it might stem from trauma or for personal traits/characteristics that lead you to live "usual" experiences as extremely marking events?

As previously said short men exist (and many are effing good looking too) and maybe you could envisage a transition without getting a penis? I am not trans myself but have talked to trans men who preferred full sexual pleasure and better look to having a penis, but it depends on each person's idea of themselves and how they want to be. </TEXT>

Just show her you love her and she will come around. Don't try to talk her into accepting her sister, just don't accept any hateful speech when she is with you or disrespectful behaviour. Visit and call her.

You love your children deeply and they both need to know. Your youngest is 13 so the homophobia she expresses is not a reflection of who she is and no reason to cut ties/blame her.

It might do some good for your oldest too, to see you still engaged with her sister. Being at the centre of this with me or against me dynamic, as a teenager and when you didn't ask for it, sounds exhausting and an extremely heavy burden to bear. 

Really make a point to be involved in both of your children lives, they both need to know, see, feel you love them and the rest will follow.

Good luck, you seem to be doing very well so far. You have all the right intentions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You are probably just used to the level of fatigue. The "awake but unresponsive" seems like a sign of that. I worked in the events industry and would work 7am to midnight or later for days or weeks at a time and that's how I would feel. It felt totally normal and I asked myself what the fuss about the 8h/night was, but when I got home and resumed a healthier schedule of 7/8h a night I realised how much more rested I was and that I had really been sleep deprived.

The health consequences you can have from prolonged lack of sleep are more in the long run than immediate. 16yos are mostly sturdy things that adapt and react. But it puts you at a greater risk for heart attacks soon in life, for example (wanted to link the study I had read about it but can't find it). If you asked here it must be because you have some concern/thoughts. You are probably smart enough to think of ways you could stop playing earlier and also how to stick to that. Ask your parents to help you be consistent, or a sibling or even gamer buddies if you play online.

I hear heart attacks are very painful. </TEXT>

There's quite some evidence to show pre-colonial societies in many cultures around the world had a much more fluid view of gender and trans people weren't necessarily considered an oddity or ostracized.

The imposition of western views and religion usually changed that. </TEXT>

I live in Central Europe and even when we speak English among different nationalities NOBODY uses this way of calling people and trans people very rarely describe themselves this way. They just describe themselves as the gender they identify with and state they are trans/not cis.

Some people of Asian or African descent told me it's legit hard/useless to use this figure of speech to explain their identity to their 1st generation families because the concept of gender and identity is different than in the western culture which is very binary, so this doesn't work. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just adding on to this. This journey to better health is GREAT and hats off to  Third_Eye_Kind for pulling it off.

However one of the reasons so many people gain then lose weight often throughout our lives, is because the venerated model of counting calories + the gym might really not fit us. In a longitudinal study of overweight and obese people it was shown that they would periodically engage in diets and exercise but often failed or end up failing after 2/3 years and gaining the weight back because the regimen fit their life schedule, food culture or personality so poorly that it quickly became impossible to keep it going. And every failed diet reduces your basal metabolism and makes it harder to loose weight next time.

Everyone who's had long term weight issues probably has a history of failed attempts at dealing with them and the best shot at finding a solution once and for all is to work with doctors to find a tailored solution. You need to address health issues, bad habits and where they stem from, consider your life and routine to build a lasting solution. And if counting carbs doesn't work for you no reason to go with that.

It can take a long time to allow yourself to acknowledge you have a problem. Your gf might have exercised for upkeep and to attract fit boys while on the market because that is what is expected of her (she thinks/perceives) but she can't handle/fit those expectations long term. Despite the fact that it's dishonest of her to trick you, denial and depression/frustration can definitely be part of this too. If she's able to move past denial, finding the strength to say "ok I'll try AGAIN" when it might be the 4th time and all you got in the last 10y is failure, is not like clicking your fingers. So even becoming willing to try or change takes effort depending on the history. 

Of course you have no obligation to deal with all of this, she did portray herself as someone she was not and you're free to not like who she's showing herself to be and to walk away. But if you stay what might await could be more complex that what you might expect.

I have a nice set of health conditions that create relevant obstacles between me and my preferred weight, I've been put on diets since age 7 and the only time it worked was when, after being diagnosed with one of my beautiful conditions, I found a great nutritionist who really worked with me to tailoring my diet to something that fit me. I still eat based on the principles/schemes she taught me and I have the tools to eat well.

Sadly I gained a lot of the weight back recently due to a big change in schedule to which I was unable to accommodate my exercise routine and an injury that prevents me from doing most sports I like.

Just as an example, I have a problem with binge/compulsive eating. I learned to do this ages 5 to 9. I was lactose intolerant but nobody knew, in my very strict school they would force feed me lunch which often included a lot of vegetables with butter. I would then throw the lunch up, every day, which meant I had no food in me when I got home and ate like crazy to 1. Feed my hunger 2. Console myself. It also meant I had less energy for active play and for sports. Even when I was thinner I was slow and sports made me lightheaded, so I avoided movement.

The taste of milk still makes me vomit and eating compulsively is very hard to stop. I literally eat as much as I can, while I can. That's how my brain goes. I'm working on this in therapy but it's a deep rooted behaviour which is hard to change/resist and easy to fall back into.

This to say it's rarely just laziness, food weight and body image issues are a complicated and intertwined bunch of things, that take a lot to unpack and react to. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a special kind of "mourning", knowing some girls and women you will like and even fall in love with CANNOT love you back because of a "mismatch" in sexualities. It's not pure incompatibility, they lack the ability/possibility to love those that are like you.

It happened to me for the first time this year and as a late 20s person I still had a very shitty evening on the day I had to be true to myself and accept to let go of my heavy crush (and her beautiful curls). At 18 in a small town and with not many queer friends it might take a bit more.

It still isn't on you at all and whatever her feelings may be this is something she will have to deal with without you. No need to console her and protect her from the truth, be honest and she will have to figure out the rest. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm finding it's more important to come out for older people or in conservative contexts.

There's more and more accounts of young teenager never "coming out" and just telling their mom "I need something nice for my date with -same sex kid-".

Indeed coming out feels to me like an explanation you owe to justify your otherness and I'm not an absolute fan but it can be empowering. Like owning up to who you are.

I came out as bi at 26, 2yago, and only officially came out to my parents. I told my best friend I was seeing this girl, same for my brother (who was 22 at the time and told me he hoped I wasn't experimenting and hurting some lesbian girl's feelings :D). I just introduced said girl to the part of the family who I knew would be accepting and the other part still thinks I'm hopelessly single. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Also a bi woman here. I prefer women, so they turn me on more often, but I'm just as turned on by men when I find one I like. For me a lot is indeed built on experience.

With women we're both much more into each other's bodies as a whole as in "wow you're so beautiful you turn me on I want to get/give all the pleasure that can exist on the planet". All body parts are considered equals, more or less. I have a thing for shoulders and thighs, don't ask me why, but a man would likely be put off (at first) by me caressing those areas as much as I like to do with a woman.

Men can be amazing lovers, but it all starts with a strong focus around their penis and it sometimes ends there. The fact that sex only lasts as long as their erection does is also disappointing. Disclaimer: you are free to continue/vary/repeat after you come.

I've had 3h and even 6h pleasing sex sessions with women, whereas one of my boyfriend (mid twenties) liked to show me he could last long which consisted of him pounding me like a crazy man for 3h. He couldn't wrap his head around how that might not be the most pleasurable thing for me/what else we could do.

That said, the best sex is the sex you have with the person you love, when you get to know each other. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your profile and posts seem questionable. Some posts are childish, other confused, some comments are borderline or downright homophobic.

Being straight is not a problem. Being straight is neither gross nor harmful. You don't need to be proud to be straight because straight is the norm and does not entail any added difficulties in your life. LGBT folks need to find Pride for our identity within ourselves because society puts our identity down. So we have Pride DESPITE society's teachings and that's a way to celebrate, console, legitimize ourselves. This is all additional work that a straight person doesn't need to do.

Appropriation of LGBT spaces, talking about straight Pride and acting like "the straights" and LGBT people are mutual enemies, that's gross and harmful. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello, first of all hope this will be clear since English is not my first language and not the language in which I receive medical care so terminology might be a little off.

I am not prone to headaches in general but a few years ago had had a few short but recurring headaches that resolved themselves. They were not impairing and I mentioned them to my doctor when I was seeing him for something else, a few days after they had passed (end of my exam session) and he said it looked like my nerve of Arnold was inflamed and to do physiotherapy if it came back.

Now, I had a very strong bout of that headache, cried it out for most of yesterday night 7/10 pain. Honestly you people are heroes. Anyway I managed to soothe it by taking FANS massaging/warming the area and staying as still as I could and eventually fell asleep.

I'm better this morning but I can still feel some tension. I have an exam on Thursday morning, I had planned to take today off studying but tomorrow to Wed I really need to go at it. Where I am I cannot get any kine/physio/osteo treatment without a GP note which I wont be able to get before Monday evening and I might not be able to find an opening before tue/wed.

Would swimming help ir would it make it worse? I'd like to try but don't want to make it worse. Do you know of other at home remedies?

<TEXT> This is an important aspect of it. I'm LGBT and I have been harassed for it. I tend to expect people to attack me or judge me far more often that it actually happens and do get worked up about it (internally) unnecessarily sometimes. It's defensive and an outlet for my fears.

It's definitely some form of trauma to be harassed on the street for something you can't control and that you already wish was not part of you. Makes you want to scream and rebel and kick. Though I understand how you wife's behaviour is too much, my mom was this angry and unhappy most of her life, we were all professional eggshell walkers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Then only mention the primary points.

I have some mental health issues which I still sometimes take out on food. I'm trying to change that but it's hard and my mental health, tranquility, serenity is more important than downing a bag of chips on a bad day, which sometimes is every other day.

Your wife seems to overeat to compensate something else, therapy will at least partially solve that. Extreme anger sometimes comes from PTSD (you don't need to be a war veteran to have PTSD) you could look into that and maybe into some deescalation techniques or understanding how to appease anger. But you first need to talk to her. </TEXT>

<TEXT> grizzfan said it all 3. I'm going to drop something else here that might explain why you don't understand.

The sense of self. I have been told by psychologists that I have a volatile sense of self, not defined or pinned down. I can barely describe myself if I try, though I can say some things about myself (I'm a feminist, I'm a serious person, I don't care about style). Others have a stronger one and feel more precisely about who they are.

Maybe you are like me and don't feel strongly that you are a male (gender does not matter to my identity as a person AT ALL personally, it only affects me based on the discrimination of others and social constructs) therefore can't understand how others could feel so precisely about their gender identity. But the fact that they can makes that feeling valid.

The way you personally feel should have no bearing in accepting the identity or feelings of others and sometimes there's things we just can't understand. How everybody isn't bisexual/pansexual honestly escapes me, and always will. It's just not my business/concern to understand it and understanding it wouldn't add anything useful to my life or to that of all non-pan people. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had seen a few disturbing pieces and listened to some odd podcasts in the last few months, when it came to trans-issues, but I thought maybe there was some cultural dimension I was not getting or a language barrier. But now that contributors accused The Guardian UK of transphobia I feel like I was right.

https://www.buzzfeed.com/patrickstrudwick/two-transgender-employees-quit-guardian-transphobia 

I would want to publicly boycott them by demanding they issue an official statement on the matter, generalise bias training for their staff and make visible and verifiable efforts to create a culture that does not accept discrimination of any form, including transphobia, and that is safe for all their staff.

Am I delusional or is anybody here interested in doing this with me? Where else could I post this or where on Reddit are people talking about this?

I follow very few subs and whenever I search for new ones there's so many it's hard to pick good from bad.

UPDATE: I'm now using the hashtag #guardianboycott should you care to join </TEXT>

After that I reflected on it quite a bit but an irresistible girl was already flirting hard with me and he made me the favour of coming back into my life and showing me how much of a dick he was. Multiple times. So it was harsh and dirty but it wasn't difficult. Took me about 3 months total, might have taken me more if he had stayed a good guy in my eyes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's an account of rape I heard recently. I think a tv writer who was raped/assaulted by Trump (he is not the important part of this story). She didn't define it as rape for the longest time even though he totally had PIV with her against her will, and in her explanation the lack of violence is what lead to her inability to label it as rape.

He basically manipulated her into doing some flirtatious games with him in an empty location then quickly and swiftly pushed himself into her for a few minutes by lifting her skirt while cornering her. 

She wasn't being held down or violently attacked, he pushed her into a situation where she could not rebel, nor cry for help, that she would have no difficulty believing was benign (and she did she thought he was flirting) and created the opportunity to take advantage of her. That's why they call them predators and not beasts of penis and fury who unleash themselves on the first vagina-carrier. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a very delicate question to answer, not knowing you nor your parents. Also I'm not a trans person, nor a doctor or expert of any sort. This is just what I know from having non cis friends and taking interest in the topic.

Try asking again? Try to make your argument based on the reasons they gave (if any) for saying no last year.

If they don't know, tell them the self is defined in childhood and not 15sec after birth by a doctor, medicine got your gender wrong. Talk about the mental health of young trans people, try explaining what transitioning would mean for you. They probably have a lot of misconceptions about it. Ask them to consider it at least, tell them not to answer immediately but to answer in a week or 2 days and ask them to look for information, or maybe look for it together (find organisations, online resources, doctors).

To buy time, if your medical insurance covers it, you can look for puberty blockers. They are super safe medication that is given to small children, this leaves every door open. If you decide you indeed want to go through a medical transition you can start on the correct hormones for your gender once your parents agree/you are 18. To them it will be reassuring that, if you wake up one day and discover it's a total mistake, you can resume life with the gender assigned at birth more or less just by stopping the puberty blockers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, your girlfriend is right this is her problem. It's a problem that has to do with being bi, that a number of people face. But it's something she needs to feel, address, manage, not a void you (or anyone else) have to fill.

When I feel that way, whether I'm in a relationship or not, there is no void. It's like a disturbance, additional radio waves that get in the way of me listening to the perfectly good show that is on the radio now. It also passes within a few weeks, or months, in my case. She does not necessarily need a guy to be happy, most likely not, I know I don't. But we need to put those additional airwaves under control. It's like any "unwanted" or "unexpected" thought: you think of it, you reflect and address it, but it does not necessarily have to bear any consequences on your actions and choices. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As an Ally it's great to

1. ***Be visible*** - show your support however you feel safe doing, but show it

2. ***Be informed*** - do your own research on topics that are of interest to you within the LGBT umbrella. Know all sources might not be reliable but avoid your only source being your LGBT+ best friend whom you periodically stalk/check with

3. ***Be vocal*** - share what you know and have learned with those who don't know, it lays the ground for a safe and enjoyable social life for us LGBT+ folks. Speak up against any hate, doing it even in the smallest manner might lead the haters to reconsider their behaviour/position. Of course remember to be safe!

4. ***Mingle!*** - many LGBT spaces and events welcome the presence of straight people, we don't bite. Go to that dance with your bi girlfriend, be your friend's wingman at the end of summer gay BBQ, your group of friends could show up to the poetry reading of the women who love women. Some of these events are community meetings meant to separate a bit from the crowd for safety, but some are not and mixing the two group getting contamined by each others ideas and thoughts would be great. It would help you understand a variety of LGBT life experiences. -- I really wish my friends did this for me, it would close the gap in our understanding of the world a bit, but most of all would allow late bloomer me to attend these events and not be alone. I go on my own but it's not as fun, and making Queer friends alone has proved hard. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey, are you in any type of counselling or therapy? We sometimes underestimate how much the damage of past relationships can become a blocker when trying to form new ones.

You can sometimes feel about a new partner that "something is off" or he/she has reactions you can't understand and they might not be able to explain. This is our past creeping back at us.

If you can't do therapy take time for self reflection and journal about it, focusing on you not on the rejection you receive. Why do you want what you want? How do you feel that relationship has left you broken and what is there to fix? How to do that? You talk about self esteem that's a start. There's a ton of mental exercises you can do or motivation talks you can watch.

I feel like I might be in a similar spot to what you describe, and I'm going to therapy and it's really doing me good. Good luck. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm 28 going on 29 and I like getting older. I'm not afraid of losing my beauty, I guess because I've always defied beauty standards and what I really find beautiful about me is my smile, which I expect will stay more or less the same.

What I'm afraid for is aging as in losing my health. Every 4 or 5 years since I've been 15 I get diagnosed with some new chronic illness that requires regular doctor visits, medication and so on. Healthcare is a big part of my spending despite living in Europe and the time I have to dedicate to it is frustrating. As is the need to keep perfect life hygiene that is supposed to make me better but my body still fails me greatly despite that.

But I'm looking forward to the legitimacy of old age, to white hair, to having stories to tell. I hope retirement will still be a thing because I plan to volunteer and write like I never could (or maybe my plans will change). I hope I get to be a mother and a grandmother that would be really cool. Very afraid about losing my parents but they got through it themselves and came back ok on the other side, I hope I can do that too. </TEXT>

She need not be responsible about her food, yet, not in any way. And creating the interior conflict of "fruit is better for me but mommy feeds me sugars" doesn't seem helpful either. 

If I understood/remember correctly I'm sure you meant no harm but I just want people to stop telling children anything about food, in an instructive or prescriptive way. They don't really control what they eat and it really can trigger a lot of anxiety and all sorts of eating disorders that are hard to spot and stop.

But then that's my opinion not a fact set in stone or a rule to abide. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nobody should be telling that kid anything about her weight or diet. The adults in her life should take care of that. Telling a 7yo she needs to eat this or that is putting her in charge of something too big or too complex for her. 

It's one thing to say "here is an apple, it will give your body vitamins to help you play longer". This teaches her apples are good snacks.

It's another to imply she should make different choices about the food her adult family members give her. 

I was that child, at 7 I was on a diet so I couldn't i.e. eat pasta as often as my brother BUT all that was provided to me for snack were chocolate based processed full of sugar options. And I was told I should eat more fruit and ask for it etc. It was so conflicting and difficult and unfair. You give me OREO's I'm going to eat them. Then halfway through my portion I'll remember I'm supposed to eat fruit, look around there's no fruit, mommy's gone in another room by now and can't cut the fruit for me anyway, what do I do?

This every day every snack or meal.

She is too young.

No dieting before 16. Before that age it should be portion and quality of food from her parents and it's just cruel to ask her to take up the burden of making up for their wrong choices.

Plenty of adults, myself included, took it upon ourselves to change bad food habits later in life. It's hard but it's better than an anxiety fuelled/filled childhood that could push her towards eating disorders (that might not even make her loose weight because it doesn't always work like that).

Leave the girl alone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This makes me think of internalised homophobia, which can be a pretty big obstacle for non-straight people. Depending on how harsh the messages about same sex relationships/sex you've internalised, who was expressing them it can take a long time and effort to get through/over those feelings.

Find LGBT groups in which you can express yourself (activities rather than bars, try Meetup or local groups/NGOs that cater to LGBT), or watch LGBT content on YouTube and so forth (you'll need an account coz a lot of LGBT content is not available to minors and YouTube supposes every unsubscribed user to be a minor for safety reasons) to normalise it and reflect on it. Maybe journal about these feelings and don't be afraid to seek therapy if that is available to you.

Accept you feel this way and don't beat yourself up about it. The society most adults grew up in is/was homophobic in many ways, so it's not so odd we picked up on that and now hate ourselves/can't bring ourselves to be who we are as a consequence. </TEXT>

One is willing to go the extra mile and understand why our partner is being unreasonable and insulting (slutty) because we chose them for the long run and they are generally a good person to us. But legitimizing their concern by toning down the style or accepting that he called her slutty (I'd still ask my partner to apologise for that once a more sincere open discussion has happened) seems unfair and excessively submissive to me.

Still. I'd go for this advice before jumping to say he's cheating, OP. </TEXT>

Can you be as masculine and as feminine as you like in your every day life? Can you ask people around you to use neutral pronouns? If so, do that. Or do that with those you can do it with. If that's feels right, try to keep doing this.

By the sound of your post this is not a crisis, just you getting to know and understand yourself as you grow up. Putting up boundaries that are different than what society expects is sometimes tricky, but if your peers or uninformed people misunderstand your need to define yourself correctly as attention seeking, it's their misunderstanding. Just make sure to find/look for support when/if this gets to you. Rely on your friends and on self-care to compensate for any grief people might give you.

If it turns out you're wrong and this is just a phase: cool too. You need phases to get to know yourself and make informed choices about who you are and want to be. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey, not a bullet point/concrete advice but a friend who writes for TV uses this to double check if they're writing something that falls into a harmful stereotypes and how to write or not to write some characters and plots.

The number of gay men with a varied romantic and sex life is probably as high as that of people of other orientations, more or less, so your character does exist per se. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I stopped shaving 1y ago now. I am Mediterranean and have a lot of dark hair but I realised I liked it better this way. So I kind of got used to it before I made the decision to stop shaving.

I did shave the lower half of my leg this summer for fear of bad reactions especially at work (consulting). My armpit hair sometimes shows but nobody ever commented. I trim my pubic hair for ease of access to the parts that need caring.

I mainly date women and that was never a problem  with them not even ONS or FWB. I'm now considering dating men again and I'm a bit more worried about how they could feel entitled to react, but we'll see. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a friend who used to be somewhat like this, minus the abusive part. He just DID NOT express his feelings no matter how clear it was that things were wrong.

He finally went to therapy for it at age 29 and realised he had been neglected in childhood which had lead him to be unable to formulate his feelings at all. We realised, aside from instinctive laughing, he didn't often express positive feelings either, but that went somewhat unnoticed because it was less of a hindrance.

So maybe consider if this could be your current boyfriend's case, if you really want to stay, or add this advice in your goodbye letter. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ciao. In my Red Cross National Society the policy is to pair people up based on personality and interest. You are required to go every 2 weeks but the rules about what you should do/your role are very well defined 

Some people just want to chit chat, others will have a lot on their chest or terrible things to share so it varies vastly. Receiving someone's life story is never easy and there's some serious emotional work that goes into that. We get quite a bit of support, with additional trainings and helplines available.

At least here you are given a 4h training before you start and you talk to a coordinator so you can ask questions and express your fears. 

It can be hard but it's also rewarding, and with the right kind of support everything should be ok. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry this is super long.

1. I work in Technology. I talk to the business and get the requirements of how a program should be built then work with the developers to build it. We work remote a lot.

This winter I took over some work from a male colleague who had been working with a male developer. This developer ***didn't believe me*** when I explained the changes  the client had requested. These changes were not the best for the program but were necessary due to how my client works.

I motivated the changes, shared the documentation. ***He was sure I was making everything up.*** He continued developing as if these changes didn't exist for weeks. Then started saying he would do it "for next time". 

I escalated to our boss, also a woman. His behaviour didn't change. We had to bring back my colleague from whom I had taken over, who confirmed he should make the changes. He was super apologetic to him, but only to him, apologised for a good 20min.

He wrote the code for the changes then left the project. That code was crap, it had to be rewritten, testing took much longer than it should have.

But hey, how can you trust a woman's instructions?

2. Jokes about how the client senior staff would try to pick us up (me and my very senior boss, also a woman) if they were interested in us, we were right there. The "joke" included reference to dirty pick up lines in our respective languages (not the local language but this is central Europe, we mix) and comments about our bodies. The guys were sure it was 100% a compliment because it meant we were fu**able. Yeah right. You talk about my tits in a locker room way, in front of me when we're supposed to discuss software upgrade, total compliment. My boss cut the meeting short and suggested we reschedule to a time at which we could be more focused. They shut up and rescheduled and behaved for the next 6 months.

Sidenote though: These are the only 2 episodes in 1,5+y. My company really empowers us to talk about these things and react, they offer training to our staff AND to client staff every year. Of course you can't force clients or externals into training (though you already signal your values with that) and at some geographies cultural differences weigh on us too. But their commitment to bringing more women into this field and to reducing the bias and fighting harassment is an important part of why I choose them as my employer. </TEXT>

I also remember I was supposed to "be nice" 100% of the time as a child and I was repeatedly told I was being rude for asking my maternal uncle not to disrespect my father (who's an amazing person and never wronged him). My uncle did that a lot, I was called a brat or difficult by my grandmother for reacting. My brother was allowed to be angry at my uncle or to not like him for whatever reasons. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thing as in object, my glasses. I'm blind without them and it can sound like a joke but 2 weeks ago I lost them and had to pat the ground for 2h before I found them despite having red glasses and white tiling. That's how blind I am. I can weirdly somehow cook without them, but I cannot leave the home so they allow me to exist, basically.

Thing as in concept, I would say knowing that I have a purpose and that I am being good and doing right by others, trying to learn to do that without destroying myself in the process but still, that's my answer.

<TEXT> When you point out someone has a privilege over you, they can get angry as a defense mechanism. Anger allows them to not have to renounce to the privilege you highlight, they are allowed to not have to change their behaviour and they can forego a lot of questions that those with more complex identities cannot escape. And deconstructing who you are is hard.

And honestly for my part yes, I am defensive and insecure because I have been attacked because of who I am, of characteristics that are not my choice. I have been told being me is inferior to standard and that respect isn't necessarily due to me. So yes some insecurity and defensiveness might show in some of my attempts of demanding justice or in making sense of the world.

I recently broke up with a trans hating racist lesbian (we had only dated for a few weeks) so I think some people will never get it or be open to get it. But I also know many, mainly those close to me, whose mind and understanding I was able to change or expand. In my experience the haters are more vocal and the "lovers" amplify your truth loudly enough to cancel the haters out.

Take care, and don't listen to them. </TEXT>

If she somehow forced you to go back on your registration as an organ donor you can change it again when you turn 18, which is not too far away in the future.

As someone pointed out our parents are people too but it's a surprising realisation to go through.

As an older teen I was very surprised to learn me and my mother have very different values. 

I'm now older and I understand part of it is linked to her history as a young orphan and immigrant who had to fight for her survival a lot. I have had the luxury and still enjoy it of being generous and selfless much more than she could ever be, this still makes her irrationally scared.

We have had and continue to have similar discussions and sometimes fights about these things, but eventually they blow over and our love for each other prevails. We agree on other things so we don't feel like aliens to each other. </TEXT>

Me and her got along perfectly well, they had been broken up more than 2y and I had been with my boyfriend 1y when we met. I think they were both so totally over each other, despite having been together 3y, that she could have been any other girl. 

How much she knew about him and like family   general surroundings was odd at first but she's such a sweet person.

<TEXT> I'm sorry you had to be subject to this. It's unfair to you and you should tell your coworker how inappropriate this would and that it has made you feel unsafe.

You will have to go back to work and your feeling of safety will build up again because it's likely nobody took your coworker seriously and it's unlikely anybody will approach you in a negative way at work IF they took it seriously. One Pride day is already a positioning of the workplace values and anyone even remotely sensible knows they would get into some sort of trouble if they gave you trouble for being LGBT.

You can go at this alone and share this worry with people close to you, at work or not, to get the reassurance you need to wait it out, see nothing bad happens and then feel safe again.

Or you can use company channels and hold them accountable for the values they are projecting. Tell your colleague that was inappropriate and go talk to HR about not feeling safe in the workplace as an LGBT person after this event. They MUST rise up to the occasion and find answers or solutions or think of them with you if they don't have a plan for this situation already. What would make you feel safer? Who can be of support to you until you feel safe again?

My company is very bold in their LGBT support, there's a lot of training and no prejudice is tolerated ever, not even when the outing and/or joke is made drunk at a company event. These places exist, your company can become that place too and they have made a statement so if that's something you feel like don't hesitate to push them in that direction, they can do it. I hear from colleagues in Lithuania or Poland and it sure isn't easy in wider society, it isn't easy where I live either and I'm further west. Internalised homophobia is a thing and fearing for your safety is legitimate. 

Validate your feelings and take care of them but also know there is hope and potential, a lot of it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The wording and the English of this post is great. Hats off to the writer I'm non native English speaker, this is remarkable.

I'm bisexual, my doctor knows. Used to be really into men, now I'm definitely more into women. But I like casual sex sometimes and got a man in there last year. I had to ask for a pap smear THREE times before I got it. THREE. And I know I was scheduled to get it this year. 

I didn't want to have to expose my whole sexual life but I had to. It's not necessarily a permanent switch! Even 100% lesbians have sex with men sometimes or had in the past.

Also do your research about the illnesses that are more commonly transmitted woman to woman, they are not part of regular STI checks in all countries.

There's also a general prejudice that lesbians don't need to see a gynecologist and some friends have been turned away by doctors with a kind of "I can't do anything for you" speech. Please talk to your colleagues and change that.

Research Women who Love Women protections options and show them to your younger patients. No one in my generation is in the habit of using protections but we might have been if we knew what it was and where to get it, or how to use it.

I have this website in French, maybe you can translate it with Google? They have a section for health professionals

<TEXT> I loved giving blowjobs when I was younger but then it became a symbol of how I was being subservient to my partner, dominated and not in a mutually agreed sexual way. I had this with 2 guys + my neck hurts when I give blowjobs so my ability to enjoy them is VERY limited.

I haven't slept with a man in a while, but I'm thinking if I do I will suggest he fuck my mouth for oral sex. Like your wife, short blowjobs are ok, making a man come through oral, not so much. Again it's been a while but I guess I would still do it SOMETIMES if I was with a man I loved, but it's definitely my least favourite sexual act. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When someone is in any kind of abusive relationship, telling them that they are in one and deserve better is important but the most important thing is to stick around. You can't make the decision about the wedding for her, but you can be there to help her the day she decides to get out of this relationship. It's not easy or fun but as her best friend that is the thing to do.

This decision about whether you want to be in the wedding itself is yours to make, just in general. Stick around if you can.

Someone did it for me, I did it for someone and I was part of her escape plan. She could not have gotten out without me and my boyfriend. If there's no one around to help you, you just stay stuck in that relationship and have no choice. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You cannot be a failure because you still have opportunity ahead of you, so much of it. As others said, it will get better.

I'm 28F bisexual, I prefer women. I attempted suicide age 13 (very sloppy, survived with no scratches) and have various medical conditions among which at least 2 that will make it very hard for me to be fertile.

In my opinion you don't move past the things that didn't go well for you in life, you move forward with them. Your mental health is going to affect your life and that's the only way it can be. Take care of that mental health and learn how to live with it. It will take a while but you will learn how. Don't try to leave it behind. We're like an infinite puzzle, the pieces that were added in the past make you broken if you try to leave them behind.  Keep them and try to add new ones you like.

It takes a ton of time and it's never ending work but you have to accept the limitations in your life, the conditions, mourn what you can't have or might not have, before you can take advantage of the opportunities that are left and start building your happiness.

Take care of yourself, practice self love A LOT. Positive affirmations even if they sound silly, doing small things JUST FOR YOU. Eat. It's one of the "easy" pleasures of life, don't give up on what you don't have to.

In a practical sense, regarding starvation. The least nutrients your body gets the more likely it is to hold on to the reserves it has and yes, use them, but as little as possible. You are creating a situation in which your body tries to reduce your basal metabolism to the minimum to use your fat for as long as possible since it's not getting food. This will make losing weight in the future really hard. 

Try to stop starvation like you stopped self harm (WELL DONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!YOU'REA HERO ) and focus your control and discipline on eating right for your body, that's a kind of self love too. 

Remember we're all on a journey to grow and find the balance that allows us to afford happiness. Go on r/relationship, go on r/actuallesbians and other threads. People of all kinds find love and have families in a multitude of different ways. The world is full of possibilities and you can pick and choose what you want your life to be like to make it suit you.

Please have faith in yourself and take care/love yourself because no one else can do it for you. You are valid, you are worthy, you are just effing fine and myself and many others try to keep this world alive, to make it better, so that you can keep existing and thrive. So know we all have your back. The army of invisible wlw, past suicidal teenagers, body positive fatties, illness struck people: we love you and want you to be well and we are all fighting for your chance to be happy. We are LITERALLY standing behind you in support of your amazing opportunity at life. And whatever you do you cannot fail, just try.

REALLY TRYING TO SEND ALL OF MY LOVE AND SOLIDARITY. We truly stand with you. </TEXT>

Being LGBT myself, that wording "biological sex" is used by TERFS and other trans hating groups to deny trans people the right to define themselves so I didn't feel good about that.

<TEXT> The story as you write it here does not seem to be impacted by their sexual orientation or gender identity. Moreover, unless they are attracted to him and he is not and you want to write that in, they would interact with him like any other straight guy would.

LGBT people are people, and we are very different within the group just as different as any group of people. I'm not trying to lecture you but based on what you describe/ask I don't really know what you would be looking for.

Try reading portraits of LGBT artists, youtubers, vloggers. Watch some videos. Names that pop up in my mind atm are the Fab 5 from Queer Eye, Indya Moore, Chella Man. Try and see if any of the experiences they relate that are specific of their LGBT identity could in some way be part of your characters story. There's plenty of subreddit for all of the letters of the acronym and more, people post about coming out, about their marriage, dating. Read a bunch up there too.

Once you've written this story have it read by LGBT people, the honest thing especially if you plan to publish is hiring sensitivity readers, but if you don't have budget for that ask around your friends groups, just to check you are not completely misrepresenting something and possibly making harm via that distorted representation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am currently very happy BUT when people ask about happiness I always think back to this day in the summer when I was 23. 

I was coming back from work and navigating a touristic city's thick crowd while on the phone with my grandma. She was telling me she thought my mom was ready to be a grandmother and I was ready to be a mom. And while I did agree with her, and that had been a plan I had been working towards, I remember I had just decided on that day that it was NOT what I was going to do and that felt so empowering. I was nodding at grandma on the phone and walking like a badass to my train. On the ride home I asked my friend who lived in the States when I could visit her. I booked the trip, I went, came back, left my boyfriend, flat and job and moved (back) to a different country to resume my education, get a better job, a better flat and a girlfriend. Currently single but living the life. And that's the day my happiness started. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some online size guides start by suggesting you measure in cm/inches to pick a size, you can start from there. Just Google "size guide women" loads of different brands will come up.

Women are many and different, some definitely share your physical characteristics. My morphology is slightly uncommon but there's still style advice out there ready to be found. Try "best looks for short women" or "skirts for narrow hips" and such. Stuff will come up. 

That's a starting point but the way we feel about ourselves and our style is always evolving, it will take time before you find and settle on what you like. And then you will grow and age and your style will change again ;-) 

Hood luck on this new quest friend! </TEXT>

<TEXT> The age for losing your virginity has statistically been 17 and 7 months or something like that since forever.

I'm a girl and the only reason why I did anything before 17 was because I was horny as hell, my parents didn't get the internet and I attracted paedophiles (c.ca 2000s - 2 occasions, I was 14, didn't go all the way thankfully - some of you will worry but I'm good on that front now, thanks 3). I had my first boyfriend age 16 and we kissed and made out and had sex when I was nearly 17, but he was older. His first time had been when he was 18.

As others have said, the sexual life of teenagers is inflated in TV shows, I guess because that's what teenagers want/dream off so shows want to give them that to make them watch.

You are fine, sex will come and it will be super cool. Also, tighs are amazing so you're off to a good start. The inner tighs of a woman are the sexiest thing on earth. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Do you value yourself? What is valued in your environment? If you value yourself and your environment is very narrow in what they repute as interesting (I.e. high schoolers who are establishing social norms and are afraid to be any different than the norm; very manly/womanly place of work or leisure at which only typically manly/womanly subjects are deemed interesting) then just know this is not your crowd and that you have to find your crowd somewhere else or in someone else.

If you don't value yourself try working on legitimacy. Your feelings and opinion are worthy, writing them up is a great place to start. Once you recognize and value what you feel and think you can start sharing it with whomever you feel like it, or not, but you will have gained confidence and a sense of deserving your place in the world.

If none of the above feels quite right consider you might be different and that's ok. And you might be in many different ways. I've recently been told by my therapist she thinks I am hyper empathic and high functioning. That explained SO MUCH. There's many other similar things/attitudes/personalities that could qualify you as different than most but that only means you can understand why you are different and how you and others can bridge the gap, or with which kind of others you would find it most fulfilling to interact. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is not the only way we orgasm ;) fingering (but you need cut and filed nails for that to be 100% safe or a glove) and grinding (totally safe unless you do it against genitalia or abrasions/skin lesions) are also good ways to orgasm. True less girls who like grinding will engage in it the first time because people consider it weird apparently. And you can suggest the use of a dental dam and refuse oral if you don't want to put yourself at risk. Without being confrontational, it's perfectly reasonable to say "you wouldn't do it without a condom, I don't do it without a dam". You can make a dental dam of a cut condom by cutting the top to make a cylinder and then the side to make a square. </TEXT>

https://www.thetrevorproject.org/about/programs-services/

I don't fully understand how the US works but where I live you could go open a file for yourself with a social worker. Any aid they would be able to get you might take 1 or 2 months to kick in but they could also provide immediate emergency housing in an appropriate women shelter. I have worked with the homeless and, at least here, there are some that give you a lot of privacy to reduce the likelihood of conflict and violence with other boarders, that's especially the case for women. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Internalised homophobia was an interesting one. Understanding which terms the community you join find offensive and which ones are considered reclaimed since it's not the same everywhere and in all age groups (queer, dyke).

More than the terms the "conventions" were interesting. Where I am a lot of LGBT people are also vegans and vegetarians, the two overlap A LOT, body positivity is the norm as well as intersectionality (a lesbian TERF or a racist gay man will likely not be welcome at most events).

Also my local community likes movies A LOT. So many screenings are organised! 

It's an interesting section of broader society. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey :) I cared for a premie baby in my bfs family and then for 5y. I was with him a lot because his father was abusive and his mom not mentally stable (understandably so, she got much better when she managed to divorce). I was with him about 20h/week since I was very flexible in my schedule, that was for 5y as I said.

It took me 1y to realise I wanted to leave my boyfriend, then 1y to find the courage to leave him but most of all the kid. I knew he relied on me a lot.

Just make sure you say meaningful goodbyes and stress that it's not their fault, children are always afraid of that so you should say it explicitly. Leave them letters if you can't talk to them and ask your ex if you can leave your contacts (in case they ever need anything or miss you).

They will be fine and you will be too, in time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Trimmed and filed nails! Get her into manicure (sans nail polish). If you cut but don't file you can still create small lesions, exchange blood and therefore STDs.

Gloves are cool too! There's pink and purple ones around, just saying.

In general washing your hands before and after is key.

You can make a barrier from a condom, you can show her that (though realistically it's a bit too crafty for bedroom lust - but I might have done it if I had been taught to!). You extend it then cut the top and then cut it to open to make sort of a square. To use for oral but also grinding against one anothers genitals. 

You can buy latex squares on the internet and sometimes in pharmacies too (I'm having a hard time with that...).

Let her know that you will provide what she needs to be safe as soon as she starts being sexually active. And that asking for it doesn't mean she needs to inform you about the details of her sexual life. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know if the definition matters much (unless she's an athlete... :( ). 

Does the diagnosis bring new elements to their gender identity that make them question, reconsider, legitimize preexisting feelings that they might not have considered? 

Or do they still very much feel female like they did before?

At what age are they getting this diagnosis? Is their identity already formed? What did/will their puberty look like?

It's very personal and case by case, in terms of feelings and gender identity. 

Maybe for a general reply on labels find an organisation of intersex people website and read up there?

Also consider reading testimonials by intersex people to document yourself and get a sensitivity reader before publishing if that will be the case. One inaccurate representation can do a lot of harm. </TEXT>

It's sunny today
Someone is cooking in my building it smells nice
There's a flower in my neighbours garden
The bus driver smiled

It was my survival technique. I just realised, while depressed, that noticing very small beautiful things sometimes happened and felt nice. I made a point of noticing them on purpose.

Find a small thing that generally feels good and requires minimal effort and try to dig up the willpower to bring it into your life on bad days too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've always disliked having been labelled female because of the limitations that go with it. I never understood why it was so important to define my gender. I had some girly times but nowadays I don't particularly enjoy anything feminine. 

I like face cream but not because I'm a woman. I like cooking but again nothing to do with my gender. I am just me.

However I never felt like that needed to mean that I was not female, that I am gender fluid or not cis. 

When they say gender is a social construct, I feel like one of the witnesses able to say that yes, it is, because being female has never brought anything to my identity. However, it is bearable to me that others feel that way about me and I don't feel the need to change that. I just wish gender wasn't as important in our society, because it isn't to me. </TEXT>

My grandmother went through this in the 50s. She was a 22yo scared little mom of my mom, who couldn't keep her milk down at all and barely survived to 6mo. They later found out she was lactose intolerant (and surprisingly my grandmother turned out to be too later in life). Malnourished infants weren't too much of an attention point in post war Europe.

This has been happening forever and many women go through this. My grandmother is still very shaken by it. Her first baby, so young, being unable to keep them alive and having no alternative.

<TEXT> First of all, you are losing sleep in a way that is affecting your ability to perform your daily activities: go see your doctor. You can discuss short or long term solutions and their effects. You don't have to do anything they suggest, but they are the best placed to find you a way to sleep full nights again, at least until your exams.

If it isn't PTSD it could be the weight of the pressure of having to study, having to pass your exams. You probably have not taken a lot of rest/holiday between failing and retaking? Just making assumptions for you to consider.

18 is also an age at which you start to be able to measure the impact of things on your life and how they affect your opportunities or you might be afraid that they do. Just something I've seen in myself, younger cousins and my brother, a young friend I have.

So if it's "just" a lot of stress in your life try to take 10-30 min a day to just relax. Do deep breathing exercises, or yoga, or a walk in a very quiet area/park, guided meditation. The internet can teach you about all of that.

If it is PTSD and you don't know what from, you probably need the help of a professional in looking into this via therapy or hypnosis. Your doctor can suggest the best course of action here.

Take care :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think money is power when a sex worker is doing that because it is their only choice and pussy is power when the worker/client relationship is a female/male one and when the sex worker has a relative power of choice of her clients (I will work with X because he pays well/offers safe-good conditions, not with Y who's a drunk violent bastard and owes money to people in the neighbourhood).

The only problem I see with sex work, as a feminist, is when the worker enters the line of work because they don't have any other choice. That has been the case for the people I know that have made/considered that choice: the only way they could make the money they needed (not big fortunes just enough money to live decently mostly while studying and/or settling in a new country) was sex work. Their being forced to make this choice, naive or uninformed, seems to have contributed to some of the trauma. However they appear to have recovered so I don't know if you can compare it with the trauma of other professions? It's just that a nurse losing a patient does not demean the nurse, while a client becoming violent and disrespecting the sex worker as a person can get to you in terms your value as a human being, not a sex worker (he disrespected me because he sees me as less than him, not because I am not good at my job).

Aside from that, anyone making the somewhat informed decision (you never know 100% of what you're getting into with any job) to become a sex worker, is a perfectly ok to me. And ultimately, no matter how you came to the profession, it's a job and yes men are more often than not the clients and women the service provider, but not always, not only and this opposition only matters because of patriarchy. If patriarchy didn't exist we would only see it as sexually needy/sexually liberated people looking for sex as a service from those they are attracted to. The man/woman dichotomy only matters because of patriarchy, when the choice is free on both parts. </TEXT>

I understand this is not an easy truth to face and learn about but she is still the same person. Take your time to understand how it can settle within you, talk about it with her at length as soon as you feel able to and consider couple's therapy.

But ultimately you need to respect a person to love them. So either step away or deconstruct what makes you think of her as damaged, work on it and get past it.

<TEXT> I knew bisexuality existed (first person to ever hit of me was M. a self-proclaimed bisexual 14yo female at my school, I'm also female) but I didn't feel like it could concern me.

I blame it on heteronormativity and female oversexualization.

1. HETERONORMATIVITY 

I knew I was "normal" = heterosexual, while "normal" =/= bisexual, so I could not be bisexual. 

I just didn't see it as a possibility just like I never saw myself becoming a nun or a pilot, since those things are pretty uncommon (also I don't have faith and am really short sighted).

2. FEMALE OVERSEXUALISATION

Everybody always talked about the female body, straight girls remarked on how hot they were or a friend/cousin/passer by was. It was very hard to make the difference between appreciation and attraction, until my attraction for a girl was so strong I couldn't deny it was more than just digging her style.

BUT NOW AGAIN?

You've got to stop this. What do I take you to all of these doctors for? What for ha buddy?

I thought we were in a good place, why you gotta betray me like that. Why. I'm sure you're gonna blame the ovaries again. You're going to want to switch pill AGAIN.

I can't really I can't. At this point you're just being mean. DEFINITELY not reproducing, not going to risk creating another one of you. Not that you'll necessarily let me do that.

Anyone who is not accepting of your orientation is not worth dating.

<TEXT> I had been on the pill since I was 14 because my periods were unbearable. Before going on the pill I had an ultrasound to check I didn't have fibroids or endometriosis that would have explained the excessive bleeding and the doctor was so cheerful "There's so many ovocites ready to get out of your ovaries, you'll get pregnant in no time when you're older!"

Stopped the pill age 20 to see how my body was doing and if everything was ok/better. Didn't get my period for 4 months + the 6 it got to get it with medication diet sleep yoga and exercise. Gained 18kg, became living acne and furry animal, lost a patch of hair on my head. After the four months I'd had another ultrasound and yeah those "beautiful ovocites" were actually cysts all around my ovaries.

My prolactin and progesterone levels were nowhere near where they needed to be and I was developing diabetes.

Beat that shit (diabetes) but the mourning process was hard and I had to fight like a lioness. I still have to fight to not gain all of the weight back as soon as there's a minor life change. I'm back on the pill again since 3y though my doctor has mentioned I should take another break soon. NOT OVER MY DEAD BODY. I'm gonna change gynos for as long as I can so I can trick them into NOT stopping. No not serious about that but scared shitless? Yes. </TEXT>

The gender of the person I like factors in, though it is not a reason for exclusion (AT ALL). So the suggested vocabulary does not fit my preferences, I feel.

<TEXT> You recognise she's a woman. You are straight : attracted to women.

This is just a different kind of woman to you, like if your type is tall and you fall for a petite girl.

Our society's obsession with genitalia seems to be the point of confusion here. You liked her as a woman so you liked/accepted her penis too! Cool.

Also sexuality is a spectrum so if you think a typical straight man won't like a penis, first of all think again, but also consider you might fall somewhere on the spectrum that makes you straight with an interest in penis.

I don't know what you mean by things you can try in the future, I'm just going to leave this here:

<TEXT> I broke up with my last ex 1y ago and went to therapy, not for the breakup I was just feeling distraught for a while.

I realised I tend to be too agreeable and stick around in manipulative relationships, that I create emotional support obligations within myself that justify my partners behaviours and that don't allow me to leave. 

All of my past serious partners ignored my boundaries to an extent, were overly protective/controlling and always asking for attention or trying to get it out of me when I said no. I failed an exam 3 times because my girlfriend at the time NEEDED me to put her needs first.

Me being distraught and emotionally consumed was in big part due to having put up with this for about 10y in my romantic life and having given too little time, space, consideration to myself.

Manipulative and narcissistic people are quick to understand who will "let" them do/be what/who they are and who wouldn't. What I'm now focusing on is deciding what my boundaries are and learning to pick up on signs that the new person I'm dating might potentially not respect them (I.e. insisting with no particular reason that we make plans to go see a play if I said I'd like to be outdoors, being fairly inflexible about it and trying to "convince" me instead of finding an alternative that suits us both). </TEXT>

<TEXT> About your mom's reaction, it's legitimate to feel frustrated about it. I don't know who she is and how she said it, older generations are in general less alert to these kind of things (and that can be ok), but if you have a chance in the future read up about bi erasure and bi invisibility.

Bisexuality is not black or white, it's "confusing" for some people and they tend to dismiss it with statements like your mom's. Especially a teenage girl saying she's bi is a scenario in which as a parent you want to not think of that shade of your kid you hadn't anticipated (might not be because it's bad, just because you don't know what to do/say about it, how to be a parent to a non-straight child) and society's teachings + your kids age make it easy to give them low credibility. She might have said it because she saw you worried about it? Who knows, but it's ok if it doesn't sit well with you.

Maybe once you know a few things about it/in the future, you can try to calmly bring it up and talk about it with her. It's very possible she doesn't realise why what she says is wrong, which doesn't make it right, but means there's room for growth and improvement. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a variable wake up time, since my job often requires me to start at slightly different times and to be at different locations on a daily basis.

I wake up 6.30 to 7.30 (mostly 7 to 7.30) and go to bed around 11pm or a bit before that. I've tried changing this up but my alarm inevitably falls in my REM sleep. I like to remember my dreams (just woke up from living in a hostel in Germany and Germany was in front of Morocco so we swam there), but waking up during REM sleep makes me groggy and sleepy for up to 3h after my alarm.

How can I effectively avoid this? It's been like this fro more than a year (the whole time I've been using a sleep tracker). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey hey hey. That tumblr thread sounds toxic, but really that is not what the whole LGBT community thinks.

I'm bi and in touch with my local LGBT community and also with the most advocating/militant pockets of it and I've never heard that position (all straights are homophobes) expressed or given any credit.

Now, our society is inherently misogynistic, homophobic and transphobic in some ways (i.e. the attachment to genitals for which vagina MUST mean woman and trans men are being refused legitimacy as men based on that), we grow up in this society and pick up on the good AND the bad of it. If you are not aware of the ways in which that is the case (and this is the situation most cishet people are in, just because you cannot be deep into every topic, I know ZERO about some relevant social issues) you might act out some homophobic, transphobic, misogynistic behaviours without necessarily realising it. And this is sometimes pointed out and it's underlined as a reason why we need to be visible, get more queer and women stories out there, present situations that help those who are not living them understand the oppression they cause, when they think their comment/behaviour/positions are harmless. But we're not by any means hating on anyone while we do this, at least not the community I know, as you point out it wouldn't serve us well to do so and also...why hate? </TEXT>

You can ask your sister if there is any way that would fit her, that you could arrange the sleeping situation differently because your wife has this concern. Tell your sister you had to ask but totally understand if she says no and that you still very much appreciate her hosting you while you visit.

Not wanting to get ill isn't stupid and the flu (as your BIL proves) can be pretty bad and debilitating even for a healthy individual.

But then you know your culture, you know your sister and know if this can be acceptable or not.

If it really isn't something that you do there/can do with your sister, explain why you can't do that with your wife and I hope she's reasonable and is just grumpy for a while (not mean to you just mildly unhappy) and nothing more.

If you can choose a different accommodation do so and let your BIL get better. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey, I knew I was attracted to girls but didn't allow myself to call it bisexuality until I was single and flirting with a girl. For some reason bisexuality felt like it could not apply to me before then.

When I was in a 7y long relationship with my first boyfriend (age 17 to 25) I did tell him about my attraction and he was cool with it which mattered a lot to me. Being authentically myself, even just only to him, made the difference. I didn't see it at the time but that was the first tiny step in accepting who I was.

Don't push your feelings back, anything you push back jumps back at you at one point or another and it's nearly never pretty. Let yourself think bisexual thoughts, look at all the gorgeous girls out there, and find one friend to tell it to, or tell your boyfriend. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can answer but it will be useless to you. Side effects are different based on who you are, when you take it, phases of life.

I live in Europe so I'm sure most of the pills I've been on are called something different in your country.

I've switched pills over the years to cope with new hormonal issues (yay!) and just with the normal changes of growth/aging. I took

Lowette (14yo to 17yo)
Yasminelle (17yo to 19yo)
Yaz (19yo to 21yo)
Had to take a break (21yo to 25yo)
Qlaira (25yo to 27yo)
Microgynon 20mg (27yo to prenset - 28yo).

I have never had any side effects, I usually switched because the dosage was not appropriate for my age/hormonal situation anymore and I would start to get some spotting.

If you are prone to headaches, there's pills designed with that in mind, if your family has a history of cardiovascular problems, there's pills for that too. 

Just have a good chat with your Obgyn, mention everything you can think of, make sure they take the time to listen to you and run blood tests before prescribing a pill and if they don't go to a different one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi. I don't know what step of the journey you are at. I'll tell you about my experience.

The first few years after my diagnosis were tough. I don't know how I survived them. I was getting ALL of the PCOs symptoms and was told more symptoms = worse PCOs, my hormone levels were really bad. They told me I should prepare for the idea of not being able to get pregnant after age 30 and know that maintaining a pregnancy would be harder than for the average woman.

I was 21-24. I had to follow a strict diet and exercise regimen, take loads of hormones and medicine, I was developing diabetes.

I made life changing decisions based on the urge to have a child. I had to make my peace with the fact that I have to be who I am and go on my journey and that I can't force life into the shape I want it to be.

I'm 28/29, not in a stable relationship anymore and I've more or less accepted I might not be able to have a child the usual way. I have envisaged all of the possible scenarios and tried to weigh pros and cons, but ofc I'll see how I decide to approach this when I'm actually able to be a mother.

It's tough every day and sometimes it kind of flares back up. My direct superior just had a baby and the weeks after I learned she was pregnant were a mix of joy/excitement for her but also sadness, mourning and resentment.

It takes time to accept these emotions and feelings are part of your life and you have to feel them and go through them to get better.

I am in apprehension about the moment I'll start trying, whatever way I choose to go.

I know many women who became mothers late in life and lost babies and had a really hard time. My brother was conceived with IVF. I knew women and couples who couldn't take it and did not have children. This doesn't make me feel better about it, it just includes these examples as possibilities, as versions of life that are ok, and seeing that these people were still happy or had happy times/moments makes me feel that I will find a way to be happy too, regardless of what life throws at me.

I did not think that when I was looking at one of the many negative pregnancy tests I had to take, I'm not sure I'll be able to be this philosophical about it if/when I miscarry or can't get pregnant, or while I'm fighting through adoption/foster paperwork, but this is what keeps me going on a daily basis. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had a boyfriend who liked to be inside more than he liked to come. He wanted to stretch our sessions up to 3h. I had to explain it's not that fun to be pounded for that long. Moreover we were useless levels of tired afterwards and he made his knee bleed on a duvet for the amount of pressure/movement/weight he was putting his body through. Totally part of why we broke up, not an amazing match in that department. </TEXT>

My two ex boyfriends and a number of the girls I dated had stretch marks in different parts of their bodies and I loved all of their bodies stretch marks included. When you like someone, you just like them, and natural tattoos aren't going to turn you off. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My doctor recommended 2-3y after my first menstruation. I started the pill at 14.

But as others said check with your daughter's doctor.

My periods were crippling right away so I was taken to a gynecologist at age 12, 3 months after my period started. She was recommended by my pediatrician. She explained everything wonderfully to me, why my periods were so painful, what we could do to make it better, things I should pay attention to and told me when I could start the pill.

I then went back at 14, went through a visit again (consultation no internal poking) and got the pill. I've mostly been on it since, with one dreadful interruption. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ugh. The objectification of the gay best friend. It will pass. I hope at least a few girls give you a chance, but you're seriously building amazing emotional intelligence and social skills that most other young men lack. 

I'm in my late 20s and I'm a bi woman. One of the reasons why I tend to date vastly more women and I find myself preferring bi/pan men is because straight cisgender men usually haven't had to deconstruct their identity nearly as much as me or noncis/nonstraight men and amazing guys are just still at such a loss emotionally and in terms of empathy and expression. It's tiring to do all of that work with/for them over and over, every time I try I end up giving up. Let's raise men to have the same emotional depth/ability/legitimacy as women from the get go. You be you, you'll be awesome. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not sure it is and the behaviour of a racist and of a cautious woman are different in my opinion and experience.

Racists rarely experienced being belittled by the people of colour they despise and think of these people as inferior to them.

I just won't go home with a guy on a first date, and will text my friend a location when I end up going, or let her know kind of who he is if he comes to mine, in case I turn up dead the next day or in case he rapes me. I do this based on stats and based on the fact that men who seemed perfectly nice have groped me, insulted me, tried to corner me to sexually take advantage of me, talked about me as if I wasn't there and in a demeaning manner and showed me they thought less of me because I was a girl/woman and that's been happening since I was 11yo. Despite this I do not think of men as inferior to me, on the contrary I strive for us all to be equal.

But my trust issues remain and society straight out tells me I should be cautious, otherwise it will "be my fault" when I'm assaulted, raped etc. </TEXT>

It passed, I still loved her and we were together for two years.

As a bi woman I've found I'll have these short moments of intense craving for one gender from time to time, unrelated to my partner's gender.

But their maturity, compassion, flexibility, understanding nature was such a treasure.

Being embarrassed by your dad as a teenager is hardly that bad, and I was never more embarrassed of my dad than other kids were about their younger dads.

Can you give your future child love? Can your husband do that? Then you're all set.

Also older parents have longer telomeres (a structure inside the cell) and this means children of older parents have significantly lower risks of many types of cancer. There, you got a fun fact too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have fertility issues. I never actively tried getting pregnant but I was diagnosed at a time in which I was in a stable relationship and would have welcomed a child.

It took me 3y after the diagnosis to get back on regular period and every time it didn't come I had to take a pregnancy test before I took the medicine to provoke the bleeding. I then had to go to the doc repeat tests and change my treatment until it worked.

I must have looked at 50/60 negative tests. Every 45/60 days. Knowing this whole thing was about not being able to conceive it broke me. At that time I felt like I would never get my body to work again, like I was garbage, useless malfunctioning woman.

I was not sane, also because I was taking tons of hormones and was on so many different drugs. I went through it like a mad woman I don't know how I managed to function, graduate college, get and work in a stable job. My life was pure drama.

I made some life changing decisions based on the urge to try and have a child. Then my relationship ended and I'm now nowhere near being able to become a mother.

It is hard when acquaintances and colleagues get pregnant or welcome a child. I tell myself I will become a parent in the way that is available to be, in truth I'm really scared of trying to conceive as the odds don't seem to be in my favour neither for initiating nor for keeping the pregnancy going. I would love to adopt but that's no walk in the park either. Thinking of fostering as well, as I think I have the compassion for it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Girl don't listen to those who are trying to pin it on you. Your boyfriend exploited his position of power, he took over, without letting you freely weigh your options and make a decision in a neutral situation. I don't know what state/place you're in but you probably had some time, at least a few days, to think it over and he insisted from the start you do one and only thing.

Call it what you want but he made a mistake.

Then of course, grief this abortion/pregnancy (I'm sorry I'm unsure what your preferred terminology is) and don't rush to decisions in the immediate aftermath of this.

I don't know your boyfriend, but this can be a red flag and you are allowed not to want to pardon him this mistake he made, or this mistake can be something you are unable to overcome. 

You did not feel free in your relationship with a matter that had to do with your body and your life. People who dismiss this don't understand how scary that is.

As a feminist this all sounds very bad, he tried to avoid you taking agency over your body (sorry unsure if it's clear, non native English speaker) by taking the choice off the table and only considering and talking about abortion.

Controlling fertility decisions is a form of controlling behaviour and part of abuse patterns.

Just to further insist that YOU ARE IN THE CLEAR this is on him. Don't let anyone convince you of the fact that you are wrong, and bottom line, what matters is how you feel about it not the internet banter Reddit might throw at you.

Be strong, know many women have faced similar situations for centuries, our solidarity is yours. My great grandmother was forced to get 8 illegal abortions by my great grandfather who couldn't be bothered to wear a condom. We believe in you, you will get through this, you are the best person to make decisions about yourself.

<TEXT> We entertain many contradictions in our lives. Your choice to be his friend despite this difference can be one of those.

I can't judge you in your quality of ally. You stand by us, but are friends with someone who does not, quite the contrary. I don't think your friend is a good person, based on the opinions he has expressed and that you share with us but you are a better judge of that and are entitled to think differently.

Maybe, in respect to this friend who came out to him, suggest he rectifies his advice to say that survival is still our right and instinct as humans and that it is possible to repent in faith, if one chooses to do so, or to change our relationship to faith by finding more welcoming churches. He can tell his friend he wouldn't agree but he would understand. It's only human to understand one might come to prefer choosing a more open church or community of faith that allows our existence, rather than an absolute version of truth that condemns us mercilessly.

If your friend doesn't accept this version of advice/support for the man that came out to him, his humanity is only as small as his insecurities allow and he is being blinded by his faith. He is not as compassionate as he displays himself to be. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi Padauan. This is my upteenth time giving this advice. Many people like you come to this subreddit or to the bisexual one(s) with similar questions (have you thought of joining OUR tribe? We have lemon bars).

You don't have to label yourself right this second and labels, including straight, don't have to be definitive. Also a label doesn't change who you are.

There's ample reports of straight men engaging in same sex activities and reporting same sex attraction. Sexuality is a spectrum and you can be mainly straight but like some men very exceptionally. Or you could be bisexual with an attraction more to women than men (bi doesn't mean 50/50). Also know a lot of those that are attracted and love more than one gender feel our attraction and love express and develop differently based on the gender we are engaging with (social constructs come into play etc).

Allow yourself to feel your feelings, follow your attractions. Take as much or as little time you need. If you want to break Grindr this summer, go for it, if you want to slowly explore things with your rugby dude, go for that route. You can also join LGBT societies and groups, it can be as an ally to start with (we need those too) then you'll see. Uni is a great place and time to explore. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A thought called humanity. A human is everything we are, all at the same time. (Source: Henry Dunant, the Red Cross and Red Crescent movement).

I'm European, I like ice cream, I love my brother, I'm an atheist. These parts of me can't be detached from one another. It's take it or leave it all of it. There is no "core" of me that excludes some characteristics. I cannot be me without loving music and singing, I cannot be me without my cultural baggage. There is no person version of me who isn't bisexual. And even though I'm mainly bothered by the fact that society calls me woman and all that means (I'm cis, just referring to social standards and sexism), there's no version of me that isn't a woman.

Every part of us influences how we feel, the place and consideration that is given to us in the public space, how others relate to us. I can't sing around my best friend she hates it. It's minor but still has impacts. I can't tell part of my family I'm bi without it affecting a whole other part of my family. 

Each of us is a whole, not a collection of layers you can take off. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We were together 2y. I knew after 3/4 months something was "wrong". I broke up with her a first time after 1y, she begged to get back together and then to stay together. I stayed because I was fond of her and company and familiarity were sweet. She knew what to make me when I was sad, understood my family, loved to share her new music discoveries with me. It was beautiful.

I miss these kind of things sometimes, I miss someone caring for and about me like she did, but I don't miss her.

I questioned my choice for most of the 2nd year of our relationship, and for about 3 months after the break up. I never regretted it but asked myself if I could have made it work.

Truth is I have compromised a lot on my partners in the past. It's normal to have "what" compromises in a long relationship/marriage (we can't have 4 dogs AND 4 kids, you need alone time on Saturdays though I'd like to go shopping together) but I now believe there should be no compromises on the who. That person should feel right, not 100% of the time but certainly for longer than 4 months or one year. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Made exactly the same decision a year ago. My girlfriend was nice, we got along very well, had similar values and lifestyle. We wanted the same things going forward. 

But I didn't feel like I would marry her.

I'm 28 going on 29 and I don't want to be in a relationship that I don't feel can evolve into that key relationship (possibly the forever one) that might involve marriage and dogs and kids. If I don't feel like that is a possibility, I'm moving on. If it's not an enthusiastic yes, it's no (this is the consent rule but works for everything in life, in my experience).

I now love being single and it's reassuring to me to know that I don't need a partner and that when I do choose to stay with someone/pursue a relationship, it will be because I really believe in us.

That gut feeling is some kind of protection, safeguard, survival instinct. Listen to it always. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Do you know love is addictive? It acts on the brain a bit like cocaine. And heartbreak is like a small withdrawal.

It's normal to still want him even though you know he's no good for you. Listen to your rational self, it will pass. 

Also be patient and compassionate to yourself, accept and live through your feelings and don't force them down. Living through feelings consumes them faster and helps move on, in my experience.

As others pointed out you are not and cannot make yourself responsible for her mental health and reactions. If in the future you get worried about her ask other colleagues to check on her or so. But you cannot avoid any of her reactions nor cure her from them.

I have received propositions from colleagues/acquaintances of very distant cultures and in those instances it felt like they had blurted out things that were bigger than what they thought/wanted because they were not used to talk about romantic stuff at all.

A girl I tried to reject with a lot of tact both F2F and via text told me a few months later she did not really "love me", she just couldn't dwell into it and explain she was interested because she "doesn't talk about those things". That might be a very isolated case and certainly your colleague is very fragile but I wanted to offer this piece of info. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. Duty of care, girls are taught it is their job to keep others happy, take care of them practically and emotionally. That's part of why we invest/feel legitimate investing such a different amount of time/energy in romantic relationships especially early in our romantic lives. As in "It's ok if I'm the one always driving to his house, he has loads to do I'm just better organised" is a behaviour supported by the deep rooted and taught belief that we are the carers of men but also of love and relationships.

2. Focus on appearance. Men and boys are told to look a certain way too, but for women this starts earlier and in a more perverse way, as an effort of society to make them the perfect object of sexual desire a d satisfaction for men. Anything other than perfection is disgusting and unlovable, and those of us that don't love men and refuse them the right to use us for sexual gratification are shunned for it (lesbians and bi women but also assertive females that don't let the mass/society reduce them to objects and insist on always showing personality). 

3. In line with the above is also the request that girls always be quiet. Avoid being loud but also outspoken, physical, emotional (which they are repeatedly accused for being or badmouthed/not taken seriously because of). The underlying message is: please don't take up too much space so the boys/men/adults/dominant group (this teaching is enforced also against other minorities like racial/cultural groups or lgbt) can use the space you leave open/free and do their business without your disturbance. We'll let you know when you are needed/if we want to hear from you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pasta all'Amatriciana (from central Italy)

Recipe for 4-6 people

1. Warm some olive oil in a large pan
2. Fry cook the finely cut (prosciutto thin) diced pork cheek (300g)
3. Pour half a glass of white dry wine in, let it evaporate 
4. Remove the pork cheek (not the oil!) with a spatula and keep on the side
5. Pour in tomato puree or sauce (not seasoned, just pressed tomatoes) up to 2 cm inside the pan
6. Let it simmer for a bit, mix with the oil that was remaining, add pepper, add pork cheek again

7. (But you can start doing this in parallel with point 1) Put a big pot, more than 1L, on the stove and wait for it to boil. Put a generous spoon of salt in the water.
8. Put about 500g of pasta in the water (possibly spaghetti or other long pasta) and cook it for the time advised on the package.
9. Dry (or however you say it in English) and then put the pasta in the sauce pan
10. Mix in the pan and serve. Sprinkle some Pecorino Romano cheese on top, or Parmesan. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let him leave you it won't feel like it straight away but it's a HUGE win.

Had exactly the same situation. My long term boyfriend found 2y old sexting messages I had sent to an acquaintance when we were just starting to see each other, weren't exclusive and I was 17. He also went through my Facebook just like that.

He made me feel so guilty and ashamed that I never brought up the issue of him invading my privacy. Let me tell you that was not the only controlling behaviour he displayed. I stayed with him 7 more years. Years I could have been travelling, getting more education, getting to know who I am. Instead of standing by him being the woman he wanted me to be, only doing the things he wanted me to do. I'm lucky he never got violent but there was definitely emotional abuse.

Even if your husband is insecure that might explain but doesn't justify his actions (invading your privacy, slut shaming you for being a hormonal teenager like we all are, waking you up at 4am about this and letting you worry about it all day).

If you really want to stay in this marriage go to therapy or counselling, but be clear HE is the one who did something wrong here. You're good. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I haven't been out for a lot (2y but still feel like a baby queer, despite being in my late 20s). I'm generally outspoken about not being straight especially in some environments including professional and feel safe in those environments.

A few months ago a colleague said "that's gay" and it felt sad and not right, a reminder that a part of me is inherently viewed as "wrong". 

Of course I fully well know he's the one who's wrong for saying that. Regardless, it stayed with me for days as I was already in a downward spiral of internalised homophobia.

It's really not cool to use gay that way and unnecessary

When I relate these episodes people tend to say I'm too sensitive, but try rebuilding part of your identity (who you love) while the world around you keeps trashing it... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good news is you're soon going to be an adult and likely able to move away for college or work and become legally independent (not sure how difficult it is to change your gender marker where you live, unfortunately this stuff can cause issues in work and higher education too, or you can be forced to start working/studying with F identification).

For more immediate stuff.

You can navigate anonymously with incognito tabs (sorry not English native, not sure how you say this) so your parents can't see these youtubers in your history.

About the youth groups, you can say it's just a youth group without characterising it too much. If they ask what kind, say it differently or talk about what you do in the group not who you are.

I went to "feminist events" and to "writing workshops" for a few years before I was able to be honest with my parents and say those were QUEER and INTERSECTIONAL feminist events, that those were WLW Writing Workshops. </TEXT>

<TEXT> How old are you? The above advice is top notch. 

Share numbers about trans youth suicide and self harm with your family (there'sloads of sources from trans kids and trans family groups on Facebookand internet). 

Isn't it better to try this out (accepting your M identity) and go back if it doesn't feel right than to risk your wellbeing?

Transitioning doesn't mean immediate surgery.

Also things to look into: trans support groups or youth help groups in your area, might offer counselling or even family mediation, but if not just being around other queer youth does a lot for moral and self esteem.

Representation matters too, if you have Netflix or can share access with a friend I suggest Pose and Tales of the city. There are also many youtubers (I know Chellaman mainly, for some reason I don't like him but he's a FtM youtuber). Contrapoints is more political/mature but could be interesting if you're that kind of person yourself. </TEXT>

You guys clearly care for each other a lot. Indeed have a few chats about it but if your wants aren't aligned just separate amicably. Each of you needs to respect themselves, you want monogamy, he wants to explore who he is.

Maybe you can stay friends after some time apart, maybe your paths will cross again in a few years and things will be different. Maybe this is it.

But each of us needs to put themselves first, in my opinion. Well done for being reasonable, open and understanding about it, men who are attracted to men don't have it easy. </TEXT>

I left home at 18 when my brother was 13. He didn't tell me for years but he felt abandoned. It's also just generally true that teenagers are self involved (rightly so) and don't think about reaching out.

Send memes, send pictures. "Coca cola ice cream, should I have it?" Or "Look the crazy shoes that everyone is wearing here".

Or if the above is not possible, call her. Call home and say you want to talk to her.

I did it with my grandmas coz I wanted to grow closer to them again and they are far away not chatty women. First few calls were awkward and only lasted a few minutes. Now I'm sad to report there's a big scandal going on about whether Aurora, 87, is still fit enough to lead the Social Society my grandma is in. Aurora is our best friend but there are some reasonable doubts.

Just want to say we're not all used to the same means of communication. Having you on the phone might have to grow on her. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, here is the Wikipedia link https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Tunisia it refers to 5 LGBT organisations there.

The best situation would be for you to come out, have your parents support and rethink your move to Tunisia based on this piece of news. Your safety should always come first.

If you think you will not have your parents support, I suggest:

1. Take contact with a LGBT youth organisation or simply a youth rights organisation to talk this out, understand if your parents can forcibly take you to Tunisia given your identity. They can also probably help discuss coming out and offer family mediation or send you to an org that can do that, in case things go south with your parents after coming out.

2. Take contact with the Tunisian LGBT organisations to understand if and how much of your fears for your safety there are justified. 

3. Don't do this alone. Find a friend, an older sibling, a teacher, a volunteer of any organisation or church or group to help you find the organisations, the information, to support you, to be a sounding board for your thoughts and feelings.

Being queer can be hard on us. Take time for self care, to perform some small acts of love toward yourself every day. Rely on online communities for times of crises. Celebrate who you are whenever you can. Ask for help when you need to (like now, keep doing that).

Good luck! We are all with you </TEXT>

So with the cream you put it on. Let it sit for 3 to 5 to 10 minutes (depends which one you buy), then take it off with a fake bladeless razor they provide.

You better have good water pressure though coz shoving it down the drain ain't super easy and taking it off with paper towels or something is not 100% effective and most of all the cream is somewhat acid and stinks a bit if you just leave it there. Sorry for the disgusting side of this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Different voice here.

Make it clear to your parents their opinion of your SO is not something you want to discuss but KEEP A STRONG RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR PARENTS.

My mom hated my first boyfriend for classist, vaguely racist reasons (we're both white but his nationality is "not as good as" mine - she never flat out said it but hinted).

We fought like hell, it drove a wedge between us, lead me to leave the house at 17 when I could have stayed. We kept in touch but it was rocky for years.

When things got hard in my life it was so hard to reach back for as much help as I needed. But I had to and did and she even learned to like my SO over time, so much as to "regret" (her) I ever left him.

You only have those parents, we all have to deal with how humanly imperfect they are as we grow up. Live your life despite them, don't accept their BS, but keep them around and enjoy what you can get out of the relationship with these different human beings that, nonetheless, can and will be there for you more than anyone else will be able to be.

My mom is homophobic and problematic and sexist and hard to deal with, but underneath all that the way she loves me is something I'm not willing to give up.

And my dad is golden, so yeah.

Take all of this into account. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Look at women who love women's sexual positions. There's many that allow finger penetration and don't include you supporting the full weight of your partner. You can use them for mutual masturbation.

When having sex with a much heavier girl, we particularly enjoyed her sitting on my face. She could hold herself up to avoid weighing too much on me and I had awesome access to her. (She'd be on her knees and I'll lay on my back with some pillows).

Don't talk about her weight, talk about your knees, and encourage her to try other things than penis in vagina. You love her so much, live her body so much, why restrict yourself to this small part of sex, moreover if it's painful/difficult for you?

Do you know how she comes? Find alternative forms of sex that stimulate her like that.

If she comes through penetration the key when you use your fingers is to move the upper falange as if you were gently scratching her inside. Show her non PIV penetration can be just as good. </TEXT>

My pubic hair gets fairly long and curly so I cut it shorter.

Remember you don't just need to put your face there, you can also open up her labia a bit with your fingers to reach better. Slightly pulling up on her mount of venus (pubis, just above where the clit is) is easy and will give you more space in an area where there's less hair.

For the first point, watch Derry girls. It's sweet, poetic and feels accurate to me (though I was not a teenager nor out in the 90s. A bi girl in early 2000s was extensively bad mouthed for "changing sides" when she got a boyfriend but that's different) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the most useful thing would be to disentangle your identity from your labels a bit. You are you no matter how you call yourself. If people used rose instead of trans, you wouldn't become a flower, you would still be you.

I am bi and, as many fellow bis, I go through moments, days, months of impostor syndrome and ask myself "am I lying to myself? am I lying to the world? who am I really?" until something small happens that confirms in my eyes that yes, I'm bi, or until I'm able to detach myself from the label and say: hey, you're just you, we'll make it work (me, myself and I- we're a great team).

It's not easy or straightforward, labels give security, but being able to abstract from them gives us legitimacy to be ourselves as people and not to have to fit in the gay or bi boxes (or other boxes).

You think of dating girls? Ok. That could mean a ton of different things. Desire, sure. Wish for a more common life. Societal pressure. Being bi.

Breathe this one out and give yourself the time to figure it out, leave out the pressure/urge to label yourself for now, you can do that later. You also don't have to advertise your new label the day you find it, if you're not comfortable with that.

Coming out, doesn't have to be the same way you came out as a trans man or as a gay man. It can be more like "yeah I date girls too now". You don't owe anybody any more explanation than that. Even close friends and family can be asked to wait and reassured they'll get an explanation if and when you are ready to give one, but for now this will have to do. It's not like you would be hurting anyone.

Being confused sucks, but the only way to get out of it is through figuring it out, so be brave and SLOWLY do that, when you feel like it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A death threat is enough to ask for police intervention. Cops aren't my best friends either but you seem to need them. Or some higher authority that can restore a feeling of security for you and keep S out of your lives.

Google "LGBT helpline" and call them, call one from an organisation that is close to you. They can help you figure out your best option. 

Start by saving, archiving, screenshotting all of the conversations that are abusive towards you and/or your GF. Keep a diary or reconstruct a timeline of when and who was abusive and discriminatory to you due to your sexuality. I'm afraid we can't make your GFM count.

In terms of psychological wellbeing, being LGBT isn't a walk in the park for most people, your life already seems very challenging. Most of us rely on self-care to partially heal the wounds the world might inflict on us. Do one very small thing a day that is only for you. Apply the teeny tiniest bit of face cream, or do your hair a certain way when you wash them. Stretch in the morning or do a 5min yoga video. Make sure you eat your favourite fruit when it's in season. Build small habits that mean that you love yourself, no matter what.

Other than police or authority figures intervention there might be support groups, free counselling and such you can access as a young LGBT person, to help you get through things. If you go once a month, or once every three months, it's all better than nothing.

If it is unsafe to be out in your country, hide and try to find underground LGBT groups and organisations to rely on for support. You can also follow r/ainbow here on Reddit or r/actuallesbians or r/bisexual and many other rainbow reddits for a feeling of community. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Where is he from? In some countries/cultures in which women can't be independent and have a hard time making a full income and being respected in society as their own person, it is indeed common that some girls will try to get pregnant with their boyfriend's baby to get support and legitimacy and some kind of monetary guarantee. This story/possibility is also blown out of proportion in the respective cultures/societies with mothers warning/scaremongering about it to their sons.

If he is not from a place where that is a thing (that place could be part of the western world too, no need to think too far away here), his anxiety sounds like it might stem from previous bad/terrifying experiences and it might be the right time for him to share that with you.

It could also be anxiety as others said, but...only on this? Tekophobia then which was mentioned.

Definitely time for an open conversation about the why.

If all of the above isn't the case, it could be a way of controlling you that is excessive. Controlling fertility/the decision to have or not a child is a form of abuse. He does not seem to be doing that (not administering the pill covertly or forcing you into medical procedures, or on the opposite withholding birth control or access to it) but if he has this attitude and it isn't justified by the above scenarios (or others that I can't imagine), it makes me think it could be an excessive wish to control you, which could be a red flag that he could become an abusive or generally controlling partner. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello All, I have a beautiful pair of Levis jeans that has served me well for a little over 3y. They're now ripped in a place (inside of the thigh) that does not allow me to donate them or to turn them into shorts/skirt.  I also do not wish to have more things and to create items I don't need like apron, pouf, toolbelt or crafty stuff that the internet seems to be recommending.  


I want to know if jeans are a good material to use in house cleaning?

I feel like that is the only possible ways I would need them. Or do you have other ideas that don't include creating new items I don't need? </TEXT>

<TEXT> You could be biromantic or heteroromantic and homosexual (with a low libido maybe).

If I understand correctly you would want to tell him the full truth so he can decide how important sex is to him and how to move forward? You don't seem to want to leave him.

You say he is insecure. Do these insecurities stem from your lack of desire for him? If it's the case and you want to consider coming out as a lesbian to relieve him of these insecurities, I urge to take care of yourself first and make sure you are ok with it and prepared for whatever reaction he may have. You should feel emotionally and economically ready to cope with those reactions before you take the step.

I don't know how long you two have been married or what is your age bracket, but maybe you could consider opening up your marriage so he can look for sex elsewhere? To do that you would need both parties to agree and also a deep and good communication. It would be an arrival point after a journey of mutual understanding and communication, not what I would start with.

You could probably use some counselling/therapy (I would go for therapy with a licensed psychologist but you can consider what's available to you) for you first, so you can understand what you want and how you feel about yourself and maybe later with your husband, if you decide to come out as a lesbian to him and to try and assess the options available to the two of you as a couple. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Indeed I've heard him talk about this guessing game and I get it must sometimes just be safer to exclude those you've doubts about for self-preservation. Even maybe to only keep around the 2/3 people you really trust and let go of the rest. I won't blame him if he chooses to cut contact entirely.

I apologised 2/3 days ago, he took 1 day to respond and his response was "You're just transphobic. I've explained this already" (we frankly had never talked about how to refer to the past and I had not thought too much about it on my own, but I guess he meant misgendering?). Anyways I felt a bit taken aback and panicked and considered catholic style flagellation. Went up and down the rollercoaster of "Oh my God wtf did I do!!! Why am I like this?", now I'm slightly calmer about it.

I'll try apologising again in a short time, if he doesn't accept that we'll just have to move on our separate ways. We might meet again further along the way, I don't know (: </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you for your reply, it is extremely helpful in terms of how you describe what it feels like for you, thank you for being willing to share that. I'm very sorry that you have to stand through that particular relative.

Of course there's more nuance, inevitably. I didn't apologise on the spot, it was a group situation and I was a coward about apologising there and then. This is my first ever slip (we've had discussions/clarifications because he's my first experience of someone in my life not being cis, but I google stuff and so on I don't let it fall all on him). I just hoped the person would forgive me  because there is a lot of trust between us and we  cherish each other as friends. I was afraid of having hurt him but since life went on I didn't know how to bring it up. 

It came up and I apologised but I'm now apparently labelled as hopelessly transphobic by my friend. I wasn't perfect in the situation and he's still very insecure about his identity so I think he should first and foremost keep himself safe and label me as whatever is more convenient for him but it does hurt to have hurt him, to be now labelled this way and to potentially have lost a friend based on this.

It will teach me I guess? 

But that's why I went into panic about it. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Trans/Non-Cis people : is referring to you before transition as the wrongly assigned gender at birth equal to misgendering you? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2019-07-02 16:30:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I feel bad for asking but remaining in ignorance feels worse.  


Some of the people who don't identify as cis that I have met, talk about their past as "when I was a boy" (now they are a woman or non-binary) or "as a teenage girl" (now they are a man or non-binary). At one particular workshop that included binary and non-binary folks, among people that knew each other quite well, an acquaintance of mine received with no apparent issue a question about when she was a boy.  


Others find it extremely offensive if you refer to their pre-transition/childhood identity of the assigned gender when talking about them, i.e. a person who now identifies as male but was not assigned male at birth recounts childhood episode, someone says "oh that's common for little girls" and he feels hurt and misgendered.  


I understand the big lines of both reasonings/situation but want to ask:  


What are the arguments for both these different positions? What do you personally lean towards? How to avoid really hurting someone with stupid sentences and comments that are sometimes idioms or way of talking and that just - are easy to slip on?  


I admit I ask this as a person guilty of one of one said slip. I generally talk a lot and talk fast and this happened. I apologised. Should I just avoid any reference to gender when talking to non-cis people? Or I guess unlearn to use these phrases altogether? (but they sometimes apply, as a girl you are educated in a gendered way and that affects you - even if you identify as a man once you're able to do so). </TEXT>

Will you say we get asked "how being bi works" all the time?

Or will you just do a washed down glittered up version humans of new york kind of story that lets people peep into our lives and encourages morbid types of curiosity?

<TEXT> Whether you decide to be public about your orientation or not, if you decide to share this with you child, just be honest about it and open to answer questions. 

You will learn how to speak in an age appropriate way to your child, conversations about love relationships and sexuality will come up naturally, though you might have to initiate and keep it up from time to time.

Children can understand everything if it's explained. I think it will be beautiful for your child to learn that your choice, your identity (a non romantic male gay identity) is legitimate and can lead to love and family as much as any other. 

Then of course they will also feel your shame if there is any, but they won't be confused. </TEXT>

Other than therapy (which is awesome I love therapy) what worked for them was frequent reassurance and having a consistent and caring partner, whom they could share this with and be soothed from.

<TEXT> I will reply on something that hasn't be touched upon, the corporate aspect.

Many big corporations are taking big steps to allow LGBTQIA people to be out at work, because when you can fully be yourself, your work us better too. 

If you don't have to invest energy in being discreet about who you are, in avoiding mannerisms, clothes, topics of conversation that will tell you out as non-straight, you can use your energy to do a better job. Feeling safe at work, where LGBT+ identities are advertised as accepted and bigoted jokes and attitudes are not tolerated, makes life so much easier and lighter.

As a militant, feminist and queer, I talk about sometimes touchy topics a lot, in polite and appropriate ways, and the conversations I have are so interesting. I learn about my colleagues perspective, they share experiences, I can sometimes teach them something or inform them about a phenomenon they didn't know and we build empathy towards one another, towards other "people like us". It makes us all more human and fosters solidarity, it makes the world a better place.

Being public about who you are does not mean shouting and stomping your feet, or dancing covered in rainbow feathers. Polite and cordial conversation works very well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey! Come have a look on r/bisexuals or r/bisexualadults!

Being bi is not a 50/50 even attraction thing. You can like men and women at the same time but differently and call yourself bi.

Also, as the previous commentator said, labels only matter that much. A label won't define who you are and if you realise you picked the "wrong" one you can start calling yourself something different if you feel like it.

Just live life, experience the things you want to experience and along the journey you will find out who you are (in sexuality but not limited to).

No pressure, and if you're bi: welcome to the bi side, we have lemon bars! </TEXT>

I like being with women more, bordering lesbian in terms of preferences, because when I date men I instinctively fall into some of the cliches and stereotypes of women that I don't like. 

I feel differently about the genders and I do realise that when I date men I feel like "now I'm doing it right" but I think that's just society. I feel freer and happier when I'm with women and like you I feel like I understand them and know what they want more easily. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been seeing her for a year now, twice a month. I vent a lot, now I'm giving her more space to ask questions too XD 

Already twice she's asked, insistently:
- do you always think this much?
- do you analyse things a lot?
- are you influenced and triggered by smells, sounds?
- does your amount of thinking fatigue you?

What is this lady phishing for? I think I should not ask but I'm bursting with curiosity. I keep thinking of this.

We talk a lot about how deep in my thoughts I get, how I go from "I won't reply in full to this question, the person won't understand" to "I might as well commit suicide".

My emotional reactions escalate quickly and often. One upsetting scene in a happy ending 20min show episode can send me into a crying rage that stops me from doing anything else for hours.

I am however able to rationalise and distract myself from this after a while/if I try hard enough or have to.

<TEXT> Not as heavy as when I was a teenager but more than 1 night pad heavy. I also bought a slightly larger cup "to be safe" did not end up using it because it's less comfortable and I found I didn't need it.

Decent toilets are nearly always available so if I'm stressing about how heavy my flow is I'll just empty it more often, though I've seen that if I forget to do so it's still ok. I've had some leaks but very limited (and due to positioning not fullness), comparable to the small stains you might get if you picked the wrong tampon/pad.

Admittedly I'm on a different pill since 1y more or less and my flow is not as heavy, but I used the cup before that and it was ok.

I had worried the cup wouldn't work for me so I didn't buy a super expensive one, just supermarket version which was 17, in case the investment was not worth it. The bigger one I later bought was then 22 because they were out of the brand I had bought before. Just make sure the silicon is medical grade safe. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Penetration is cool but there's so much more to sex than that.

Try mutual masturbation, that you can do lying on your sides in bed. Also if he's ok with it try stimulating his anus, men can get female level orgasms that way. Engage in oral sex and also heavy petting. Try dirty talk and role play. Everything that allows you to get sexy without only dealing with PIV.

Read about different sex practices, watch related porn together and find what you both like. 

Hard to suggest this? 

"I love you taking me/PIV but I want to try other practices that allow us to give and get pleasure, allow me to show you how sexy you are and how much I want you, but are less challenging given our respective body sizes/frames".

I've had relevant difficulties with guys who weren't that overweight but were much taller/stronger than me. Or women who are bigger than me. The available positions might not be satisfying and you have to explore.

Good luck! Enjoy </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey! A friend recently asked her gyno about the IUD thing and was told it's extremely unlikely and that she would not choose her period coping tools based on that tale.

Shape though is a true issue. I have one that fits comfortably but sometimes leaks (just a teensy bit so I can cope) and a larger one I bought when my period decided to go Niagara style for a few months, that doesn't leak but is slightly less comfortable (despite me following the brand instructions when choosing the size).

Mine are fairly well priced supermarket options but if you spend or have spent relevant money on it it's frustrating to go looking for the right shape... </TEXT>

I had them also because of low hydration in the summer.

To make them go away pinch the spot behind your ankle, between the end of your calf and the start of your foot. It's the most lean point of our leg for most of us. I don't know why but it goes away after 15/20 sec. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well done for being in recovery and for being so self-aware! You are awesome.

My advice is to tell her everything she needs to know to help you recover and get better sleep. Both being a recovering alcoholic and needing a lot of sleep are important factors she needs to consider. Anxiety is relevant too.

If she is as professional as she should be she won't judge you for any of it. Even if she does judge you, it is more important for your health and to get the right medication that she has a full picture.

Your best chances at wellbeing and recovery include obtaining medication that is efficient and adapted to your body and your needs. Do your best to do your part in creating that chance for yourself. </TEXT>

36DD here. Each of my bras is 50 or more. Expensive. 

I buy them on sale and have built a collection of 7/8 over time. I wear each for 2 days max (less in the summer). 

I then wash them with all of my other clothes in a normal cycle. Used to dry them in the drier but I don't have one anymore, so I air dry them.

They are all doing fine, I replace about 1 each year. The washing machine does not hurt them one bit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had a similar situation feeling but was very scared to come out because my relationship with my mom had been rocky in the past for other reasons and I was afraid of anything that could make me lose her.

Just rehearse it in your head often enough that you normalise the chat/topic. After a while you will start picking up on moments at which you would feel comfortable telling her. Then one day soon the stars will align, you'll get a comfortable moment and you'll feel good about the topic and you can do it then.

It's normal to be afraid or anxious in anticipation, don't blame yourself for that and don't resent those feelings. You will be ok. And we're always here. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you for your sympathy.

I hope you are able to report or call-out any harassment you might be a victim of.

I also hope you don't consider our demand for visibility as harassment. If corporations are blasting rainbow gadgets in your face from all corners, know most of the movements hates them as much as you do for that (easy to stick a rainbow on everything, but then they don't follow suit and fail to protect LGBT employees from harassment or act in support of the community in any way that does not create profit for them).

Pride means being proud that we manage to be happy/survive being ourselves despite the hateful experience that it is to be LGBT almost anywhere in the world. And yes for some it might mean being boastful about who they are. Just like some people like to show their love for Japanese culture, revolver guns and precision shooting, or how proud they are to be a parent of four. Boastful people will boast, eccentric people will be eccentric.

We are not asking you be proud of us, we are trying to be visible and get the debate going so that our lives become less and less filled with hate over time. We are trying to support one another in resisting through the daily reminders that this world doesn't cater to our existence and on the contrary tries to erase and oppress us into invisibility.

Just high five us for surviving and move on. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was poiting you there not because I think you hate us as LGBT people, or because I think you want to organise a straight Pride, but because it's a thread I read today and that mentioned some points that are relevant to your discourse.

The subject is unfortunately not best kept private. Many people would love nothing more than that.

It is a very political one since our rights are limited because of our orientation. We wouldn't have to react to oppression with Pride if there was no oppression.

I am harassed on the street for looking like I am with a girl, just because you can see my eyes glow when I look at her and that our chat isn't just a chat, we are flirting. I already polish my behaviour and limit my self-expression and despite that I am continuously harassed and have been threatened with violence for loving who I love.

I feel the need to make my resistance to this very public, given the multiple attempts to erase my experience (I was harassed by police, my mom is a vocal homophobe that thinks all bisexuals like me are cheaters). </TEXT>

<TEXT> It offends the idea behind Pride and its origins.

The Pride was a riot against police oppression faced by trans women of all ethnicities (lead by Marsha P. Johnson a black trans bisexual woman and her friend Sylvia) and LGBT communities in general. We still face a lot of that oppression and negativity and we are proud to be ourselves despite that, we celebrate our identity despite the fact that society at large is intolerant of us or disregards our reality/life/rights in ways big and small.

The Straight Pride has nothing to do with anything similar/parallel to our, very much needed, Pride parades/month. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I came out as bi at 26, I just thought all straight girls liked women as much as I did and I didn't realise being Bi was an option. Like others who replied I was in a m/f committed relationship 17 to 25 so missed put on the typical exploration window.

However girls I've dated knew at 12 and 14 respectively they were lesbians and the first person that hit on me was M, a girl a year younger than me, who identified as bi. She was 13.

I guess just be there for her and validate her. If she feels different about herself later in life and moves towards identifying as lesbian or straight, that's fine too. Bi is not a phase, but we welcome those for whom that is too, in our community.

Regarding your ex-wife I guess you alone cannot change her mind. Just be there for your girl and stand up for her right to define herself however she wants to, if the occasion arises. </TEXT>

<TEXT> All shades if blue and greens. Intense red and black.

I don't think of it but always end up picking clothes in those colours.

There's no colour I really avoid though yellow and beige really don't flatter my skin tone. I'm not a fan of pink but I look at the items altogether not at the colour.

It's:
- do I like it
- would it look good on me
- how much of it is synthetic fabric
- price

If it passes this assessment I try it on and then buy it if it can work well with the clothes I already have, or for the purpose I'm trying to use it for (work, wedding, etc). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dreamt of the two cousins of my ex boyfriend. They were 7 and 12 in my dream, an age at which I didn't know them anymore, that is not their current age and I never saw pictures of them at that age.

I saw them and after playing with them for s while I started crying like a crazy woman and saying "I've missed you so much" over and over.
I woke up crying just as much as in the dream. Tossed and turned for a bit, went back to some light sleep but eventually woke up sad and distraught as fuck.

Context: me and my bf split up 4y ago, but were together for 7, I sometimes took care of his youngest cousin who was born when we were together. I liked the kid, liked his older brother much less (treated him well but we just didn't click as people). Of all of the people in the family I certainly don't feel that I miss them.

How do I get over this dream/feeling?

I have had this a few weeks ago too. Can't remember the story but I cried a lot in and out of the dream (woke up finding that I was crying).

Didn't drink and most of all take anything before dreaming, not even new medicine.

Feels really awful. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was a lot like this, now am less so. 

The reason I was doing it was

1. I am the type of person who finds EVERYTHING interesting. Please do tell me about you dead dog surgeries from 4y ago in detail. An afternoon couldn't be spent better. I'll trade you a story about how young children in my family don't eat next.

2. I lacked attention and the desired intimacy. Once I found a couple of friends with whom I could really talk about anything and that wanted  to talk to me as much as I wanted to talk to them it got better. Romantic relationships also helped, they gave me the intimacy and to an extent the attention too (apparently young guys don't like to just talk for hours...BUT THEN I FOUND GIRLS! #bisexual #pride).

My advice is trying to understand why you do it and go from there. Oversharing on Reddit is indeed great, I don't know about the diary advice for me it didn't work because I wanted interaction with others. I found that sometimes "talking about it with myself" literally having a chat about things out loud with the mirror, got off some of the pressure of discussing certain things. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mom naked all the time, my dad was slightly more private but underwear walks were common in the house. So nudity = cool, comfortable 

I started asking about reproduction once my mom got pregnant with my brother. Got a talk explaining it all. From mom, then dad. Like many 4yo I kept asking about it again so they bought me a cartoon about it. Which ironically became my little brother's favourite cartoon. It said it all: body puberty love sex babies. Cultural differences too, genetics. No LGBT but it was 1994.

Went to the gyno at 12 with my mom coz of pain, pill at 14. My mom told me I could still get pregnant if I didn't take it right and talked about abortion. Also talked about protection from STDs, came up with my dad though.

Just open honest conversations throughout my life. I could see they were sometimes uneasy about it but they had somehow taught me I shouldn't be.

I admit being shy to talk about my period with my dad at first but it got better. 

We still talk about sexual health but not sex itself.

I guess it made me consider it as just another subject, one of the things you do and I was left to make my mind up about it.

I wish there had been a bit more talk about consent, power dynamics, pleasure but overall very happy. I like sex and feel free to enjoy it, I'm fairly responsible with it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My ex bf sister was this kind of woman. Everyone cut her off, we couldn't and also I couldn't let myself cut her off coz she got pregnant and sickly so, and the baby wasn't super healthy either.

Her husband went from toxic to extremely abusive. We were just...there. Not approving, not supporting, not confronting. Just there doing what we felt we could. Babysitting grocery shopping hearing her ask for advice she wouldn't use.

I'm glad we stayed in her life coz I got to hold and babysit her 3yo boy while my bf drove her to the station to report her husband.

None of us can do more than a tiny bit, we already have our lives. But people who are in abusive or toxic relationships stay in them not because they are stupid or blind but because they can't do better for themselves at that point in their life. You can just keep being part of her life without giving your whole heart, time, energy to her. Just be within reach, for the day on which she's ready to get out of it.

ALSO I was in a relationship with a manipulative guy for years. My bff stayed despite me never using her advice, going back to relationship patterns I knew wouldn't serve me. I look back at it, the relationship, her advice. And I've still learned so much from her words, not just from my mistakes. </TEXT>

Pause, live, explore the world and learn about yourself. In time you'll find out if there's a label that feels good on you, or not! and you can forever be "the girl who likes guys but crushes on girls".

Being bisexual isn't a 50/50 situation, most of us like one kind of people more, or we like different genders differently (more romantic towards men, more sexual towards women or the opposite). 

Look at r/bisexual to get an inkling of what being bisexual can look and feel like.

When I was diagnosed at 21 I had a stable boyfriend which I was starting to have doubts about and no job I....stuck with the boyfriend, cut my studies short, got a job I didn't like much...! All in Hope's of being able to have kids easier earlier. 2 years of my life obsessing on that, then 2y trying to make sense of it.

They told me we don't know how difficult it will be for you to conceive but usually more symptoms = more difficulty and you have all the symptoms. They advised me to do it asap, and by all means before 30.

Guess what? Broke up, moved to a different country, got a master's degree, I'm single and have a good job I like.

I am afraid of when the having kids part of my life will come. I have not found a person whom I'd like to have them with. I also realized I don't really want them yet.

My life is about me. And I want to be a mom but I want so many other things too. I am not going to let one thing dictate how I lead my whole life, all of my choices. I tried and it didn't work! 

So please don't try it. Let my mistake teach you. Just be you, be 20, have the funny crazy relationships, enjoy life, look for a partner that feels right for you. And yes take care of yourself and know your condition. But don't build your life around it. </TEXT>

I am sorry your coming out to her happened this way.

If I were you I would cut this friendship, you can try explaining why her reaction was hurtful to you if you feel like it.

This could be worked out under different circumstances, but it seems to be causing you a lot of suffering (panic) that you could spare yourself. Friendship and compassion are both great things, but self love and self preservation come first. She is not being respectful of you.

Do you think going to the counselor yourself to get the help you seem to crave is an option?

Maybe research organisations that offer support for LGBTQI teens, you might be able to receive help on the phone too, if there are no organisations in your area.

<TEXT> I am a woman, 28. I'm really emotional and used to cry a lot as a teenager and also early 20s. In recent years I hadn't really had any reason to do so, except a break up for which I might have cried for a few minutes.

This fall I started feeling really sad but couldn't cry. It just would not happen, no matter how much I tried. I realised I was actively "calming myself down" before I felt bad enough to cry.

With introspection I realised I was trying to accept my mom's lack of acceptance of my orientation (I'm bi, my last relationship was with a woman) and since she was also the person who was the most bothered, who called me "too emotional" every time I cried, I couldn't bring myself to do it.

What helped was noticing and thinking about what brought me to nearly cry, and what did I do after that in order to "not cry". I started being able to anticipate "this is a tear-worthy situation!". I then slowly unlearned the coping mechanisms that I had put in place to keep myself from crying and after a few months found myself crying violently after a minor sad moment on a show I was watching. I guess I was catching up.

Doing better on that front now ;) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Art Hotel in Barcelona. I was the hostess on a 2 day city trip some pharma sales people had won. I was so stressed I didn't fully enjoy it (these were high profile people of a very important client, I also adored them they were really good people and I wanted things to be perfect for them) but: the pool was amazing, the breakfast buffet was delicious, the bed is the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in. They have candies and chocolates all over the place for free.

One day, I will go back. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Through a quick google search I verified what I rememberes. Teenagers seem to do better when they sleep 9h or slightly more and tend to start feeling tired at 11pm.

Still, I would advise trying to go to bed earlier than you currently do to try getting those 9h. I remember resisting it a lot as a teen, but I also remember I had to admit I had much better days when I went to bed early (10pm to 7am sleep).

Since you need to wake up at 6 and have issues being tired enough to go to bed at 10, I guess even more so if you went to bed at 9, maybe try a bit of meditation or relaxing yoga videos if you want to go to bed earlier?

I am 28 but have a friend who is 17. He often takes a 30min nap when he comes home from school to cope with how tired he feels. That allows him to find the energy to do his homework and study. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey :) my mom was disgusted too, I feel ya. Luckily she has those friends that might help her understand.

Things are still not that good with my mom, but over time we had a few conversations (not that it's easy) and I found out she had a long term cheating bisexual boyfriend who was her only reference in term of bisexual people.

I'm still hurt and unhappy about what she thinks and how she perceives my identity, but it did help a bit to get an inkling of what her opinion was built on.

Keep your hopes up but more than anything remember you're valid and perfect and not disgusting at all ;) </TEXT>

<TEXT> We were in a similar situation with my grandfather in Europe. He was violent. It started after heart surgery, he already had dementia but woke up from that thinking he had been kidnapped, had to be restrained and was violent (and adamant that we were kidnapping him) after that.

It took my aunt and grandma to show the blue and purple marks on their wrists for the doctors to give my grandpa some relaxant pills. It made him a bit dull and very sleepy, which was sad, but also more agreeable to be with when he was awake. He started telling my grandma he loved her and thanking my aunt for cooking his favourite recipes. It allowed us to spend a few sweet years with him before he passed away.

Show the facilities papers to his doctors, have your mom and aunt and father go to the doctor with him. You need to really make a case, and just ask for him to be somewhat medicated. My grandpa was seeing a geriatric specialist who knew very well that many patients with dementia become violent (it's apparently due to having less filters to your emotions, but also because the patient can't make sense of the world around them as much as they used to). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good luck! Stay strong! PCOs patient too ;) it's hard to keep eating well and exercising when something like this affects your ability of keeping your desired weight so much. And my family has been obsessing about my weight since I was 7 and looking back at pictures it barely makes sense, so I feel you.

Hope you're feeling better now.

Sharing my experience maybe it can give you some tips.

I had a brush with diabetes too, due to PCOs (managed to kick it in the ass with A LOT of discipline, 3 very tough years) and that motivated me quite a bit.

I gained, lost, then gained again. At all times, regardless of my weight, I tell myself that if I'm eating reasonably (not depriving myself but paying attention to sugars) and if I'm making an effort to be active whenever I can, then that's what matters. The number on the scale is just a number, I know I'm doing my best at most times and that is going to have to be enough.

I also learned to love my body, won't lie it's harder some times, but we can get there.

You don't need to be slim to be healthy and being healthy is the most important part. Get a nutritionist if you can, even just 2/3 appointments to set a good diet and adjust it will help, there are specificities to losing weight when you have PCOs. 

If you can't do that, my advice is: low sugar meals in the evening, less fruit than the average person, lean meats and fish in the evening to feel full faster, full grain cereal at all times, as little alcohol as possible. In terms of exercise: strength training, helps your methabolism pick up a notch, can fuel your weight loss. Keep in mind it might take you a while (for me it's about 5/6 weeks) to start losing weight. Don't underestimate the importance of sleep and of keeping cortisol levels down, if you're stressed add some short 5/10 min relaxing yoga or meditation routines to your day. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am in a similar situation. I don't like it, it's uncomfortable for me and time/money consuming so I don't do it. My philosophy is it shouldn't "be useful" because there should not be this expectation of us. I don't wear make up ever, not at weddings, not in formal work functions. I just don't. And everyone is ok with that, I like how I look.

The 1 or 2 times I've really felt like I wanted to put on makeup I asked for help to 2 friends who love it and know about it and they helped me pick and do what I felt was right. When I was away a very nice sales assistant helped me pick 2 products and showed me how to apply them :) but honestly that was years ago. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Unless your nightmares are the symptoms of a particular illness that I don't know of, if they are "just" a symptom of anxiety, what worked for me was a dream journal.

I started by writing the first thing I thought of when waking up, going on to the full dream/nightmare when I learned to remember.

It's scary, but finding a pattern and acknowledging/dealing with whatever is causing the nightmares is the only way out of it, as far as I know.

I did it while seeing a psychiatrist once a month, who helped me and supported me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well none of us can tell you how to define yourself. You could be bi (bi does not mean 50/50) you could be straight.

I came out as bi at 26, because I took a step further than my usual appreciation: I fell in love with a gorgeous amazing girl.

Before her, I mostly, rarely, fantasised about non existent women (not even celebrities) and only in threesomes. Now, after my 2y relationship with her, I rarely fantasize about men, if not in threesomes........

I still have male crushes every day, but I'm so much more interested in women atm.

It is quite typical/common for preferences to fluctuate through life. Vanilla sex people get into BDSM at 50, some men start exploring same sex relations at 30. My passion for tall partners, so prominent in my teenage years, is nowhere to be seen now.

Stay confused for a while, feel, think, and don't think you have to rush to any conclusion. Be yourself every day and you'll slowly find out if there's a label you're more comfortable with than straight, or it's just that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A bisexual person is someone who has any degree of attraction, sexual or romantic, for more than one gender. No need to be an even 50/50.

According to your description you seem bisexual to me, but you decide, no one else does.

Also, labels are useful but not necessary. If a label feels like you're being boxed in, limited, abandon the label and just live life.

Defining your orientation is a journey, give yourself time to refine the idea of who you are. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm sorry to say but this reads like a fake post. 

If she's a lesbian and you're not a girl, you need to break up. She is clearly not the woman of your dreams and life if she cannot love you back the way you love her.

You can be fond of each other, attached, but it won't be the same as reciprocal romantic love.

You should never do anything to yourself, not even die your hair or get a tattoo, FOR someone else. It is bound to make you unhappy and every big sacrifice you make early on in a relationship will come back to haunt you and hit you like a boomerang the first time you face a big challenge. It can make you hate your partner and yourself, even when it is going to a different college "for" them, I can't imagine how big of a backlash the change you are suggesting would bring.

Transitioning can be expensive emotionally and economically. You should only do it if it is what you want. Google the term "gender dysphoria": are you ready to live with that forever, a man trapped in the body of a woman? 

Talk your emotions out with a friend or close one outside of your relationship. Write a journal about them. Digest your feelings before jumping to the conclusion you need to transition. Take time.

Maybe take a break from your relationship and observe: do you miss the companionship in it or is it really her? Could you survive without the companionship and without her?

You need to give yourself a chance of being loved for who you are. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am not a trans person, so my answer might be somewhat inaccurate.

My view on this is: the patriarchy. I think it's just a matter of visibility.

1. ATTRACTION - Men (cis white straught) are the ones who decide what goes and what doesn't. 

Cisgender hetero men are often attracted to trans women, it is a common attraction. So they get attention. Trans men are not regarded as interesting as trans women because (straight) men are not turned on by them (but there are many on YouTube who share their stories and lives!!!).

2. GENERAL KNOWLEDGE Trans women, previously confused and mixed up with cross dressers and performers, have been a concept "known" to pop culture for a long time. 

Gender identity as such has only been discussed seriously and publicly in the last few years. That's the discourse within which trans men and trans women get the same amount of attention and it's still pretty new.

3. EDUCATION I have heard people in the trans community say that trans women, who were raised as boys/men, are more used to speaking up and occupying the public space or public debate, which helps them opbtain greater visibility. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I should have gone for something more social or maybe theater or literature. Unfortunately for my family that was not an option, my mom was convinced I should study something scientific.

I loved biology so I chose that, but there was a lot of chemistry too and that was not my strong suit. I changed to some technical tourism degree that I found quite uninteresting but it was an amazing refuge from my fear of failure. I had two classes of law and a few of economics which I loved, but I was too afraid to change studies again. Still that planted a seed in me, as well as a programming class we were given because the IT lab was down and programming could be done with our own laptops.

I went on to a sales job in tourism, then went for a master in business. Still wish I had done something more solid like pure economics or law, but I was 26 by then and needed to start getting real pay checks fairly fast.

I'm now an IT systems consultant, which suits my skills and personality: there's logic, intellectual reasoning, client management and team management. It is satisfying and challenging enough.

Still I am a humanitarian at heart, I feel for minorities and social causes. I'm a militant and a volunteer after work, I write. I can't help but think that if I'd fought harder to do what I really liked, I might not be working for big money making corporations with the perspective of doing this most of my life.

Someone my age in my family plays the cello. No one would have thought she'd ever make a lot of money out of this passion: she's basically a pop star in our country now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just a thought here, not sure at all if it's the OPs case.

Considered how much we hear moral condemnation of abortion growing up, I understand how it can feel easier/safer to not tell a partner, so you won't be questioned morally and you won't be stopped/prevented from getting an abortion.

I have, in some relationships, even committed ones, felt like he might not be as "on the same page" as he claimed to be, and when I had pregnancy scares I really had to talk myself into telling him, because I thought it was the right thing to do. However, I feared having to justify myself in choosing an abortion, his disagreement and condemnation and I even feared he might get in the way of me having one. This had nothing to do with him as a person, more to do with society and how much you have to do as a woman to be "the right/true kind of woman" that deserves freedom and agency over her body. </TEXT>

My ideal sexual relation is one in which I have sex with a woman while being penetrated by a penis. Also ZERO interest in the man who owns it.

<TEXT> It was crucial to my upbringing because my father is all around G-R-E-A-T! 

But it was 100% due to him as a person/parent, nothing to do with his gender (just in case you're a fellow wlw doubting children with wife).

He was supportive, nice, got to know me as I grew up, he knows what I like, who I am, what my relationship dynamics are. He was always kind and attentive. He worked a lot and abroad for long stretches of time, but he was always present when he was home. I could see he wanted to teach me things, all useful things, he tried to introduce me to every skill (cooking, cleaning, sowing - let it be known he just sowed my new place's curtains, bricolage, electricity, carpentry, any kind of wood work, mechanics).

I just know he's there for me, and he's a good person who wanted me to know he loves me.

Despite this my relationships with men are still pretty shitty at times, and I have issues due to him and who he is (he's an anxious superman care taker, guess what: I am one too!). I also have dear friends with shitty dads or no dads who are amazing well balanced people.

It's important to be loved by the ones you've got, feeling support and trust around you. Fathers are cool, but people have been growing up without them, or wishing they didn't have them, forever and humanity has, so far, survived. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There was a meme going around r/bisexual a few weeks ago. A pie-chart with different amounts of attraction towards the "two" genders and calling all of them bi.  


I think you can call yourself bi if that feels good to you, without needing to fall head over heels if a girl kisses you, or even if you don't want to kiss girls at all.   


The "problem" is with society and by extension your friends (though probably by no fault of their own) to think that bisexual means equally liking women and men. It just means being attracted to both (or more) options. 

  
Maybe you can consider heteroflexible too? But that implies, as I understand it, that you would "sometimes" do the same things you do with men, with women, which is not the case.  


I would stick with bi and just explain to those close to you that there are different ways of being bisexual, just like there are different ways of being heterosexual, gay, different ways of being a cook or a carpenter or a teacher or a great philosopher. The world is made of shades.

 #x200B;

Also, you might not need a label at all. Anyone that pushes you to label yourself when you don't feel like it deserves to be firmly told to back off: I love guys, romantically and sexually, and find women attractive but don't enjoy acting on that desire at this time in my life. </TEXT>

It didn't work while I was depressed, I was just stubborn enough to keep doing it until I was able to feel less depressed. And I focused obsessively on that instead that on ending my life. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love women more often than men but I'm open, so trying to date both. And I'm desperate to find a man with a bit more of a conscious identity. Every straight dude I meet/date barely knows who he is. Bi guys? They've done the work. But I can't find them: ALL OF THOSE AT MY LOCAL LGBT GROUP ARE...TAKEN!!!! Mostly by girls (often straight coz...there's more of those).

Go through the drama of breakup and fear of rejection and biphobia, process all of that, we all have to come to terms with this stuff. But after you've done that, I bet you my friend you'll come out of the tunnel to find HOPE!

Big hugs and lots of support. I recognise it's tough to be a bi guy(hell a bi girl too, I was crying until 2am about it 2days ago), try to find groups, friends and therapy if necessary. You are an amazing human being and we want you to keep being just that. Bi siblinghood!!!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, this is what I always tell people: don't rush it.

You are very young and even though you've talked about everything serious in life (marriage and kids) you are probably going to be able to hold off from actually doing it for another 1 to 3/4/5/6 years. 

Take time to understand who you are attracted to, talk about it with trusted friends and eventually with your girlfriend. 

When I was younger I thought that if I had committed to something I had to stick with it for life (scientific studies, a boyfriend and his family, having insisted to move to a certain town). You don't have to, it's ok to change your mind about everything.

Think about yourself first, it seems like you still can. Think and don't stress, no rush to define yourself. 

Do what feels right, do the things you like or that inspire you only and step by step you'll find yourself, including your sexuality. The only way out is through (cit. Shrek). </TEXT>

<TITLE> I feel hurt by a friend who just wished me happy Lesbian visibility day </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This very close friend of mine whom I see regularly enough just wished me that. I pointed out I'm not a lesbian, he said I still get 50% of the well wishes, I asked to get 100% of them on Bi visibility day next Sep 23. 

He meant well but this was clumsy, I just got served with a free portion of bierasure in the process.

I'm just disappointed with the fact that we always get identified with the people we date rather than as ourselves. 

On top of that I'm single, if I at least had a lady (joking).

Just felt like sharing this.

EDIT: I shared my frustration/sadness about it with my best friend, who has always been very supportive of me, she was the only person not to doubt me when I came out. She goes and asks "but what is Lesbian visibility day?". I've shared on Facebook and in our private conversations about Bi-visibility day and Trans visibility day. I don't feel like picking a fight, stating a discussion so I just told her what it is and that I had shared stuff about it already. She didn't pick up/respond on that. I just feel that I am doing this fully alone, that nobody is here with me in living this part of my identity. None of my friends tried to get informed, ever, it seems, about the LGBT world and being queer/bi, they don't come to LGBT events or parties with me and I have had the HARDEST time finding IRL bi/queer friends (have posted about this in the past).
Thank God for Reddit, really. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I work at a multinational and had to do something similar for overseas colleagues. Their English is really good but we decided to stick to "simple" concepts. We covered:

- letters of the LGBT acronym 
- the idea that all we want is to be legitimate/allowed to live our lives (that's how/why we need Pride - there's plenty of videos about Marsha on YouTube)
- general laws in my country, saying marriage is allowed etc. and family types it can lead to
- treatment: the fact that despite "good" laws discrimination still exists (this was also because some people transfer then start kissing every guy they fancy at a club/the street and didn't expect some of the backlash they got :'( )

It's not really about Pride, but we needed to cover the very basics to allow our colleagues to understand our clients and our teams sometimes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Many people find sexual things/acts arousing without really being attracted to the people involved. This is more common for women than for men (straight women finding lesbian sex scenes arousing) but I don't see why you couldn't be a small exception.

Also, confronting penises is super common. Of this was the criteria all of my cousins are bisexual. They used to have "secret" penis measuring/teasing parties in the corner of the backyard (age 7 to 11).

Don't stress. Contrary to the general attitude, I think there is always time to come out. Coming put as bisexual when you are married doesn't need to mean divorce, open marriage, cheating.

Does it happen to you that you are randomly attracted to a guy? Have you had male crushes? The most important part of this is knowing who you are, when you'll have that you can decide if, how, when you want to act on it.

Know that most bi people struggle with this question over and over in our lives, I guess because society is so binary. </TEXT>

I researched as I wrote and made notes of things I really need to check. I'm ok having to study and rewrite a lot to make it believable.

I guess one way or another this was my story, since it was born in my head. I hope I can keep going and make it a good one. I'll send you all a (translated) copy if it ever gets published.

<TEXT> My ex gf was part of a complicated family which essentially brought together kids from 3 different marriages.

They all hit puberty at the same time and STUFF. HAPPENED. Some of it was found out by the parents which paused it for a bit, but then they started being sexual in different ways with each other again. For some it was a one time thing, others went on for months or years.

So I think this is a fairly common thing, that happens. And that part of it might take you a bit to wrap your head around, but it's not as uncommon as one might think.

The flirting part. Your gf doesn't seem to perceive it as flirting.

Great complicity that comes from prolonged shared history can resemble flirting a lot, without there really being any romantic intentions/thought behind it. 

I have this with my high school best friend, whom I also dated, in high school but also later in life.

Another ex gf of mine had this with her first girlfriend: they had been together age 14 to 17, went through coming out, harassment, bullying together. My ex gf helped her through the death of a sibling and depression. They are and always will be incredibly close, they have large wagons of inside jokes and tease each other constantly.

They toyed with the idea of getting back together aged 19 but didn't. They're now 25 and in separate relationships, but if you see them at a party you might think they're dating. I know them very well, they never cheated on their partners with one another.

We tend to apply our codes and experiences to other's people lives, but that's usually pretty ineffective. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I started identifying as bi around the time I moved back with my parents. I knew my father to be fairly open and accepting, on my mother I, wasn't clear.

I started dating someone who was of my same gender and fell hard in love. I spent a lot of time with her, at her place and simply informing my family of whether or not I'd join for dinner tonight lead me to tell lies about my whereabouts multiple times. It didn't feel like it was sustainable.

I ended up telling them, sure that my father wouldn't let my mother throw me out. My brother was fairly supportive.

My mom was shocked and hard to be around for a long time, she became more tolerant after about 10 months. We never discussed telling her family.

I told my father's part of the family about a year later and on my mother's side nobody knows: they're homophobic and conservative, this might ruin my relationship with my grandma who is 90 and wouldn't understand. She thinks I've been "single" for four years because my previous boyfriend was such a mess I don't want a relationship anymore, that works for now.

You don't have to tell everyone all at once. If you tell your mother and she asks you not to tell her family, don't hold the hurt you feel against her, it's an adjustment for them too. Just don't put yourself in danger, but if you feel it's important for at least some people to know, do that. To me being fully in the closet was psychologically draining. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Feeling legitimate in writing </TITLE>
<DATE> 2019-04-21 17:15:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have always loved writing but started thinking very early in life (age 8 approximately) that I couldn't write about everything because I haven't experienced everything, that I could only write about what I had experienced.  


I have never been consistent in my writing, I was strongly discouraged from pursuing it as a skill and as a career, and only now that I'm older and that I have "made it" I can envisage giving myself the freedom of coming back to writing (I have a good job, can pay rent in a good part of town, I am older, therefore, I get credit for what I do more easily, I feel).

 #x200B;

I am an immigrant to a French-speaking country, I work for a multinational and mostly speak and write in English in my day to day. I am trying to write mostly in my native language when I try to write stories, it is the language in which I am the most nuanced and eloquent so I think it's the safest bet to writing higher quality stories.

 #x200B;

However, I still hit the same legitimacy problem every time I try to write a story. There is inevitably a part, a side of the story that I cannot personally relate to, that I only know because it was told to me (I have tried to start writing from personal experience to overcome this legitimacy obstacle, but even recounting a secondary characters reactions or experiences seems hard). I don't feel like I am allowed to tell someone else's story, especially when this person is part of a group I am not part of: a black queer girl, a refugee, a professor, my grandma who grew up in the thirties.

 #x200B;

This really keeps me from developing a full story, I often abandon projects because I tell myself I am not legitimate enough to tell this story. I spend a lot of time advocating and learning about minority rights and this often sparks my imagination, creating plots and ideas of lives far from my own, that I am then unable to fully tell.

 #x200B;

Has anyone else had this issue? How do you overcome it? 

 #x200B;

I write poetry, slams, stand-up texts pretty easily, but I cannot tell any of the stories that I have in my head because of this and short stories are the form of writing I have always liked the most.  


TLDR: I don't feel legitimate telling stories other than my own and that is preventing me from finishing any piece of writing. How to overcome it? </TEXT>

I cared for a baby 9 months to 5yo, that tornado definitely had a personality and totally gave 0 fucks about rules. I didn't always find the time but when I was able to talk to him about the things he did, calmly, understand why he did it and make him reflect about the consequences afterwards he seemed to get it. He started coming home from school to say "I wanted to bite Jamey, but I didn't, because I remembered it would hurt him.".

He might not need to come to this conclusion in an evening, but I would be hurt, as his wife, if he didn't get it. Maybe talk to your SIL about this if she's still around? Do you know if she confronted him about it?

Once he gets to this conclusion I hope he can find a moment to talk to your daughter about it and to explain how he was wrong to choose that punishment.

<TEXT> It didn't ruin our friendship but I honestly don't know how. My best friend managed to help me build it up from there.

In the first years of my first relationship I prioritised my boyfriend and his family over my best friend all the time. 

Including leaving her stranded at a nearby town with nowhere to sleep at 10pm (she was from another part of the country, I happened to live along the train line she was using to get somewhere), because my boyfriend didn't want to go pick her up (I couldn't drive at the time, got my driving licence at 23) as we had said we'd go for pizza after his shift. He didn't even want to drive me to take the last train to her as he "had waited to see me all day". So I was his, I was his property and he should be the one to use me as entertainment.

I had the key to student housing, that was a small touristic town the only hostel was all booked and my friend couldn't afford more. She (thank God she wasn't travelling alone) spent the night in a train station.

Things like that happened repeatedly over a few years, though I didn't put her safety at risk like that again. 

Thank God I broke up with that guy. He had grown up a d did change for the best, in part, but he still had that horrific mindset.

She stayed, throughout all the bullshit this guy gave me, until I felt empowered enough not to take any, until I realised that he just was never going to be the partner I deserved in life. If I was able to do anything with myself after that, I owe it to her. </TEXT>

I tried being "more fun" for a long time, but since I was 7 I've been invested, actively but also in the way I talk about things, in many causes. Sometimes I get emotional about my views too.

I've decided that this is me, and people can take it or leave it. Of course every conversation doesn't need to be about the change we want to see in the world, but I like those a lot, I like listening to people's views and see how they change, how nuanced we can be, understand.

If this means you think I "care too much" and I am "taking it too seriously" think that, I won't, and as a matter if fact can't, change. </TEXT>

Ofc you are not responsible of her wellbeing but you are the people she identifies as her friends.

Bailing on her doesn't sound right. She must be going or have gone through something.

Suggestion: why not try to learn that touch too, as a man. 

I'm bisexual but really NOT considering male partners as an option right now, because, even though I like penises, I know everything will revolve around their erection and the parts of me that can interact with it, instead of living taking appreciating all of my body, it's presence and place during intercourse. And that has been the case with caring men that loved me and that I loved, to whom I expressed this. (Ofc not the only reason I'm not looking to date men, but a big one).

You can do that for her too, without you really needing to "let" her look for F on F pleasure. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Two different bests.

My ex girlfriend, the way we loved each other permeated our sex life, it was incredibly beautiful. I could feel she cared for me in the way she held me and cuddled me. We had found the close to perfect angle at which our clitorises touched and that was amazing. 

A girl I dated shortly who was just passionate about sex, perpetually horny and loved mine and her body. It was amazing. I couldn't stopped telling her how beautiful she was (unconventional beauty, I was crazy for her).

Women win over men for me because of how much more of a full body experience sex is with female partners. </TEXT>

Luckily I was still 3/4 days away from my holiday and I had the time to go to the doctor and get a cream with antibiotics. All went well.

I did it again a few times and I didn't get the same reaction, though my skin always had some kind of issue with the treatment. But it soon started feeling unnecessary (I love dating girls 3 ) and now I don't wax anything anymore. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was thinking about it the other day. I could go with tradition and just name them after my husband if I feel like it at the time, but I'm bisexual so it might be a wife and then there's no rulebook.

I lean towards talking about it with my partner and deciding based on factors like how much do we like our names, who has the name already, is there a possibility if we don't give the name a branch of the family will "die out", do we care?

The only thing I want is that all my children should have the same name. And I don't really like giving both, sounds like a lot.

I'd just like my partner to understand it's not a given for me that the children should have one name or the other, I'd like both options to be considered. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was the girl who could only think of kisses and cuddles for a time after my peers. My best friend didn't enjoy thinking about anything else until she was 22. For us this changed once we had a relationship and sex became interesting based on the person we loved. 

Another friend has a similar story to you, she now considers herself as a bisexual demisexual.

As the previous response said, there's a wide range of identities that could fit your feelings and interests. Just let yourself explore what you like, don't force yourself to try things you feel are not for you, respect your boundaries and you'll find out who you are.

It takes quite some time for all of us, don't stress of you can't find a label that fits you.

<TEXT> Internalised biphobia. That's how I call it.

I don't feel legitimate to like both, I feel like I HAVE TO focus on one gender at a time, to reduce the accusation of being greedy.

I also don't feel legitimate to celebrate my identity, because I can "hide" into a "straight life" ( I can't, because I don't choose whom I fall in love with and if it's a  woman...well, you get it).

We bash ourselves a lot because others did. We tell ourselves we can't be, since that's what we've heard. 

I can't get rid of it, I try to live "despite" it.

We're in this together. Let's all go to the Pride with our different sex partners and dress in full purple. Let's make a movement out of this. Let's make the B shine.

Ok end of my utopia, but I hope you understand me, like I understand you. </TEXT>

I'm 28 and on my third career. 

Each start is hella difficult. I started this current career 8 months ago, and 3/4 months in I felt like a failure, like expectations were unattainable, like I hated this job and this was just money making nonsense.

I now start to feel like there is ground under my feet again, that I can do this, that I like this.

But it took a bit of time. And I'm open to changing my mind (a bit of a habit by now...).

Give yourself time and space to breathe and think. Maybe give yourself a deadline - 3/6 months? 

You have a family business waiting for you, great backup plan! So don't stress, and remember most problems don't get solved in 1h. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was taken back. Me and my bf were in a long distance relationship. Me 17 him 20 but very committed, been together 9months. 

This guy in school pursued me relentlessly, kissed me. We then had an assignment together and ended up having sex (to further complicate the matter I didn't fully consent, but I didn't realise that at the time).

I knew I loved my bf, this never happened again and I never told him. He then found out months later (by breaching my privacy and accessing my FB account without my consent), when I was about to move to his town and we broke up.

I ended up moving to his town anyway, 2 weeks later. We got back together, talked things through and stayed together for another 6 years, 4 of which were truly happy ones.

I loved him, he saw that.

However I think it really depends on your circumstances, how cheating happened, why, if you have any plans together.

You can try to talk things through, but cheating is a very valid reason to break up, so take the decision that sits with you best.

Confused? Hate them for cheating but still love them?

Ask yourself a few times if you want to be with them. If the answer isn't an enthusiastic yes, then it's no. That's my policy, maybe it can help you too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Do you feel shame, oddness or like you should repress your attraction for men? That looks like the only bit of oppression I can think of as affecting you. Did you feel like society's expectations of heterosexuality made you uncomfortable or torn after you same sex encounters?

You don't have to be affected by oppression to be part of a category that generally faces it.

However, it is true that if you don't identify as anything but straight, have lived privately and socially only as a straight man, you should probably just listen to people who are targets of homophobia and try to understand how they are/feel oppressed and what you can do to be their ally/accomplice in your every day life. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hullo  Italian expat in a Non-English speaking country, working at an English company.

I'm pretty fluent in all my languages, but I still have a hard time finding words like butcher, hair drier, cutlery is impossible for me in my country's of residence language. Some days are confusing.

I'm constantly asking people to correct me, because I want to learn the language well, not speak a half botched version of it. 

All the advice you got above is really good.

Just one more thing: try to learn something in Italian too. Use Duolingo or Google translate. It will be cute for her to see you trying too, shows empathy. And in general the best different language relationships I've witnessed were the ones in which both partners tried to learn each others native language. I saw an English man master Swahili, nothing is impossible.

Considering your date plans I suggest:

"Vuoi dei Pop Corn?" Do you want pop corn

"Dolci o salati?" Sweet or salty

"Che fame!" I'm hungry

"Buon Appetito!" Enjoy your meal

"Molto buono" Really good

"Molto bello" Really beautiful 

Ask Google or Siri to pronounce it for you if you want to prepare.

You can also joke around and fake speak Italian "Pizza vino margherita! Buonasera!". I went to international school and a Dutch guy who spoke English as a second language managed to seduce an Italian friend who spoke German as a second  language with this. She seduced him by learning the word "apartment" in Dutch. It lasted 4 months.

Or when she doesn't know a word in English and you teach her, ask her how you say it in Italian. No issue with you forgetting. She'll forget too and you will get a chance to learn it again later. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can't speak for the OG poster, but when I am mislabeled as lesbian or straight, based on who I am with, it is bothering because it took time to own my identity and I want it to be recognised. If it was more common to think of people's orientation as not just straight or gay, but also bisexual, pansexual and other labels, I would encounter this problem less often.

I usually try to correct and move on, but when I do that, you can usually feel a little anymosity in my comment, coming from the frustration I have because my identity isn't fully recognised in this binary world. Sometimes it turns into a whole discussion, and that is rarely what I want. Sometimes I say nothing because I don't want to interrupt an otherwise nice conversation, especially if I'm in a group. I know people can only see what I show, that might be my relationship/couple, and I can't wear a bisexual/pansexual headband to all occasions, but I'd like the general populations horizons to widen.

And definitely let's stick to same-sex relationships instead of lesbian or gay relationship. Would much prefer that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1 - Most LGBT people I know don't express disgust at bodyparts they are not attracted to, or affection they wouldn't display themselves (i.e. straight couple kissing)  


2 - I think deciding you are the one to say what orientation is normal or not normal is problematic, and homophobic. Like Scrottie brilliantly explained, you can do that because you are part of the privileged category that dominates the power dynamics in the society you live in. Doing that is an active way of oppressing the non-straight people that surround you. Being told "we are not normal" is close to hearing "we shouldn't exist" and it's pretty harmful psychologically, I often don't feel legitimate in my everyday life because of statements like this.   


I hope you can reconsider your position, and not because you should be politcally correct, but because more tolerance would open for more opportunities of happiness for all :) and happy people are more productive people, more socially agreeable people, who can put their energy in making some positive changes for society instead of in having to recover from the hate/discrimination they receive. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, cis-non het woman here. Just wanted to let you know I have felt and feel what you feel, even though I'm 28 now, been out only 2 years as non het. I have defined myself as bisexual until now, even though I could think of non-cis people as attractive.   


Being with a girl for 2 years, I felt like I needed some LGBT sense of belonging and I have tried to meddle in the LGBT-events/community of my area mainly to find friends (not a huge success so far).  This could be an option for you too, if your area has such a scene. Go to some non-confronting events, at which attempts to flirt or date will be minimal, for example a round table or a discussion group, maybe a screening of a movie. Then see if you want to graduate to drinking and partying nights. 

 #x200B;

In the process of doing what I advise above, I found myself attracted and flirting with gender-fluid people, and I've recently been chatting with a number of women who are trans on Tinder. One of them suggested I should call myself pansexual, since I like trans-women too. She is early on in her transition and still very much wants to own the fact that she is a trans person and not a cis-woman. I am actually afraid I am fetichising them, since this interested that was very undefined has just become concrete now, altogether. Other friends say I should just be open and experience what the world gives me. I'm giving myself a bit of time to see how I feel. I must say being urged to label myself differently put me on the spot a bit.

 #x200B;

Everyone who doesn't have a very binary orientation goes through phases of doubt like you do. I do after the end of every relationship. If you go on the bisexual thread half our posts are about that. Western society is very binary, and we are not always equipped to handle everything that isn't. 

 #x200B;

Another bit of advice: go on YouTube, look for YouTubers that talk about their life as gay, bi, trans and try to understand what speaks to you. Don't expect to get to any conclusions too fast, just feed yourself info, quietly, and give yourself time and opportunity to explore. You're young.

 #x200B;

Also some general statement that I find to be true: they make us believe that at some point you are something and it's done (doctor, firefighter, good or bad person, straight or not) but people change throughout their whole life. Know any definition or choice you make can be reconsidered in the future. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for sharing your expertise, this really helps, also for the future! We already have a small committee and I've shared my concerns with them, waiting for a reply.

The possibility to lie to this org if my concerns are verified is a concrete one, luckily I got another response.

I was able to ask a social worker of our main local LGBT organisation for discrete insight in this entity we were looking to fund, waiting for a reply there too. She told me the team was just entirely changed, I hope it's a good sign.

It also helps a lot to read bad choices happen and are unavoidable to an extent. Trying to avoid this one, but, not being in non-profit at all (I'm just one employee volunteering in the LGBT group), I think I was holding myself to maybe an impossibly high level of morals.

Thank you again, I'll try to use your advice to do my best here. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Kudos to you for doing your own research and being so open. It's sometimes hard for trans people to date straight people, because it's a group that often doesn't have the vocabulary or the knowledge to understand them and where they come from.

You are only 1 month into this, I would say to first have this talk with your partner and also tell him about your family, tell him it's your main concern and something you think of.

I don't think he should have to hide himself and his identity to make life easier for your family, but he probably doesn't need to meet them for the next 3/6 months. In that time maybe you can come up with a plan on how to talk to them about it.

Coming out, for the first or 100th time, is always stressful. You'll get to experience this too. But it often is like ripping a band aid. Once it's done, it's done, and the wound can heal out in the open.

Having to stay in the closet can be really stressful, and asking him to do that could be felt as a refusal of a part of himself. It's difficult to rebuild your identity, as an LGBT person and as a trans person specifically. Asking him to stay in the closet indefinitely with your family might push him a big step back in his journey of self-acceptance.

My family is conservative (more than I thought) and the first 6 to 9 months after I came out as bisexual were really tough on me. My mom would hardly talk to me, and we lived together, had dinner as a family every day. I was 26. But it got better. She's not my biggest fan, but she even became open to meeting my gf and was quite sad when we broke up, though I know she hopes I'll date a man next.

Take your time to think about it, talk about it, with him, on your own, with friends. Maybe go on r/askLGBT to ask how others might have handled similar situations. You're not alone. Maybe your partner has past experiences of similar instances himself.

Don't make any rushed decisions and don't let this scare you away from a person who feels right for you. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> On behalf of my employer, I was looking for a small/new organisation to support in our area, in the frame of various initiatives we have to support all gender and sexual identities in the workplace.  


I knew of one new housing project, for LGBT youth who had been excluded from their family home, and suggested that. They liked it.

 #x200B;

Wrote, emailed, phoned the org and got no answer for two weeks, so I started looking for alternatives. Being LGBT myself, I have a few (not many) contacts in the LGBT  scene of my town and I started messaging emailing them to see if they knew of other orgs, saying this one wasn't replying.   


Word on the street is, apparently, that the organisation I had picked is transphobic. Tales of trans youth being turned away with excuses that weren't deemend sufficient from the youths themselves and my contacts, but also of transphobia from a different branch of the organisation in another town. 

 #x200B;

They also decided to screen "Girl" for a fundraising event, despite LGBT and Trans organisations asking to switch to a different movie, with a less gruesome representation of Trans people ( the movie was very badly received in our country, especially in the trans and LGBT community).

 #x200B;

Of course, as I started looking for alternatives, hoping they would never reply, the organisation replied late this evening that they would be glad to receive our contribution, and would love to send us some print-outs and get their volunteers involved.

 #x200B;

Thing is, the above are all unsubstantiated claims to me. Even for the fundraising situation, I do not have proof that a different movie was suggested to them and they refused. They are a new and young chapter of the organisation, they could have made an uninformed mistake. So I don't know if my company would consider excluding them based on this. I also currently don't have other alternatives and we need to confirm our choice by the 12th of April.

 #x200B;

A friend suggested I confront the organisation, by asking about these accusations I've heard of. I am afraid they might respond negatively, and that this will turn our relationship with them sour, my company's image is at stake, we are a very active company for the LGBT community and this housing project has been big in the papers lately, they have a lot of media attention. 

 #x200B;

It doesn't seem fair to exclude them based on suspicions, or unsubstantiated claims, but as the friend of trans people, as someone who tries to be a trans ally, this doesn't sit well with me. It could also backfire differently, since my company advertises itself as an LGBT-friendly employer, if the transphobia of this organisation becomes public it could hurt us.

 #x200B;

I am in a pickle and I feel like I don't have a good choice in front of me. I regret not having asked around earlier. 

 #x200B;

TDLR: I suggested my company fund an LGBT organisation, that now acquaintances and friends tell me is transphobic. What should I do? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Agree about the bad timing, hence my apology to him. He left me in the corner and I tried to go talk to other people, but they were there with their own known friends and didn't really give me a chance to talk. He is young and pursuing his objectives and he forgot about me (I went looking for him to give him his coat, when people were trying to go back to sit down for the movie, he had completely forgot about it and about me - which I'm not happy about but is beautiful in a way for him, he met so many inspiring people that he forgot about the rest). It was just a very unfortunate night for me to be left there like this which lead to my lack of consideration for him and his feelings. 

Just trying to digest the emotions involved. 

I 100% agree that I need more friends, I just feel like I've tried all of it and failed every time. Desperation is what feels more appropriate. Oh well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Italian in Belgium here. I recently listened to a French podcast (good but not the best, "Les couilles sur la table" should any French speakers be around). It's about masculinities.

In one episode a woman who made a documentary about young fathers (18 to 25) reported that one guy who had had a kid as a teenager with his just-out-of-highschool girlfriend, was surprised she was pregnant, said he'd never thought of sex "like that". The producer was shocked because girl's are educated to NOT GET PREGNANT from an early age, and this guy was not thinking about pregnancy at all when having unprotected sex. He went on to be a lovely and engaged father, according to the documentary.

I think men learn to prepare and take responsibility for avoiding pregnancy with time, but we girls are expected to "be born ready" to avoid unwanted/unplanned pregnancies. Been a mantra in my life since I first got my period. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I found this out about my MOM. She's assertive and growing up she'd often talk about how she deserved things in life (respect, a promotion, a raise, not yo be the sole carer for my ageing grandma) despite being a woman or an immigrant. 

I thought of her as a feminist, as someone who would defend minorities rights. 

Then she started identifying me with my relationship, not talking about me as a person anymore when I was with a guy. Encouraging me to date a rich man so he would "take care" of me. Made a scene when I cut my hair from long to mid-length.

 She has since publicly declared her disgust for feminist ideology and she's pretty vocal about her distress at LGBTQI+ people demanding for more rights/acceptance (I'm bisexual and dated a girl for two years...did not go down well).

Turns out she wanted all of those rights and opportunities, but only for herself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Men and their active role in supporting the patriarchy.

How many don't realise that, even when they think they are on their best behaviour, they are often still being condescending or considering us as lesser than them. How each generation of parents still teaches their kids that, in one way or another.

How they don't even realise they are being the bad guys sometimes, and find some behaviours that are oppressive to us natural/normal (insisting after we've said no already to whatever it is they want from us; foreseeing big plans or romantic gestures "for us" that they know we don't want but they think can "get us back"; grabbing our arm as we walk away from them, again because they want the "thing" woman, so we're not 100% free to walk away).

How even many of them that consider themselves allies are afraid of admitting and facing their male privilege (and of course this is even more of a thing if they carry multiple privileges), retrieving to a state of guilt and refusal, often to a "Not all men" state.

How ultimately they oppress themselves, because very few men express the type of masculinity patriarchy thinks to be appropriate. So if you all learned to reduce the levels of oppression, we could all be more artsy, bossy, cry when we need to, live life as the person we actually are! :D  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think about sex an awful lot too, and there are some people whom I know are not up for it anymore, that I wish would change their mind coz sex between us was so good. Still, I don't see how bothering them about it every few weeks/months would get me anything else but blocked, since they have been clear about the fact they don't wish to jump into bed with me anymore. 

I ended up telling him I wouldn't see him, because I know he wants sex and he'd try to turn a coffee into something more, while I am definitely not interested in sleeping with him and he should remember that.

He didn't really see it this way, did not take offence but said that of course he would be able to "just catch up as friends" if I wanted to. He then sent a few messages about life and a few other things, to which I replied wishing him good luck for a new job and happy new year and that was that.

I hope he does remember not to ask for sex next time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> FRUSTRATED WOMAN HERE. High-school-sweetheart, turned boyfriend (long after high school) turned ex, writes/texts/calls for a booty call whenever he's in town. I have turned him down for the last three times. I have just proceeded to turn him down YET AGAIN, tonight. He ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS has to ask again, in case I'm dumb and did not catch him on the first/second/third time he said he wanted to have sex with me. How does he think there is any chance I could misunderstand this basic question?   


Moreover, why does he have to pretend he wants to meet up to chat, have coffee or something else, when I turn down sex? I even fell for it in the past, had a coffee, that I managed to keep platonic despite him walking me all the way back home (35 minutes walk in the cold weather of our hometown: I love to walk, he hates it; I'm good in the cold, he hates it) and trying to get a hold of my hand, then my ASS, then GRABBING MY ARM - though not too forcefully.   


Second time was at our high school reunion, he stuck by my side nearly the whole night and pressured me first to "stay and have fun with the old crew" then, after I stayed, mentioned going back to his house for sex LITERALLY EVERY 2 MINUTES. And I went, basically so he would shut up and not call me about it the next day. He did call me the next day to see if we could do it again.   


I'm not going those lengths anymore, he needs to understand the basic concept of "no". But guys, why is it so hard, please, dear god almighty of the male gender, EXPLAIN. I JUST WANT TO RELAX DURING MY VERY FEW DAYS OFF FROM A STRESSFUL JOB WHY ON EARTH DOES HE HAVE TO BOTHER ME WITH THIS?   


REPEATEDLY?  


Do I need to block him? I used to think he was an intelligent, quite nice, human being but maybe he's not?   


I would like other men to truly reflect on this behaviour.  


I am in utter despair. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello All, This morning I went to pick up my rental company car - should have been a basic one: Mini, Citron or Renault, but they only had...A BMW series 1 left...so I'm stuck with it for at least the next ten days. AND YES, STUCK - I AM NOT A FAN.  


I recognise the car is great, I'm basically gliding on the highway of my consultant life, BUT, IT STOPS. If I have to stop or slow down significantly because of traffic or even a red light, upon trying to drive again, the car just STOPS.   


I have disabled the Start Stop functionality, in hopes of this solving the issue: not the case. I thought I might be mistakenly using the third gear instead of the first, because the BMW has a first gear which is further left than I'm used to: no.   


I don't know what to think, I think I'm driving it "wrong", there's little chance it's the car's problem. But what could it be? How could I drive it better? Maybe I'm a bit hesitant, not going fast enough from the clutch+brake to accelerator?   


I have a very long ride ahead of me tomorrow, and I'm slighltly panicking... </TEXT>

I've kind of learned not to do it in work environments, I won't do it if I am relaxed, but it comes out very strongly if I am with new people/trying to get to know someone and that really DOES NOT play to my advantage. Work in progress!!! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I go to bed at around 22.30/23 on work nights and a bit later 24/1 on weekends (rarely later than that). Around 6.30/7 I have dreams, not scary but often very vivid, for example this morning a teenage person I don't know punched someone in my dream and this caused them to loose a job opportunity (my company had a recruiting event yesterday). I woke up just after the punch, then drifted in and out of sleep for a few seconds/minutes and fully woke up, earlier than usual at 5.56. Then it took me until 7.30 or so to fall back asleep again.

It's not a big issue on work days since my alarm goes off at 7 anyway, so I'm not loosing a lot of sleep, but having broken nights like this really makes me feel cranky the next day on weekends, since I then either sleep again from 7 to 9, or feel like I need a nap/can't enjoy a night out in the afternoon and evening.

I use a sleep app and my deep/light sleep ratio seems healthy, I do not snore. I am slightly overweight but sporty, I nearly always eat well and rarely drink. Also low on caffeine. 

This has been happening everyday for the last 7/10 days, the only change I can think of is the weather, as it has gotten colder. Nothing in my personal life has changed really. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know if this is the right reddit, saw this one isn't that popular so I likely won't get a huge amount of replies, but I guess that's not why I'm here.

 #x200B;

I feel abandoned by my only friends in town. I've lived here two years, but this is a town where people come and go a lot, for part of my time here I was in a relationship which restricted my interest for friendship and the result is I only really have 2 friends here, a couple that I met through a common friend (who has now moved to Dublin). 

 #x200B;

I have made numerous attempts, in the last few months, to make new friends. Going to events alone, joining meetups and trying to actually go the the MeetUp activity. Just yesterday I went to a meeting to volunteer in a festival next week. In general I volunteer a lot for the Red Cross, I like it, and I meet a lot of people through that but nobody has really been good friend's material so far. We rarely see each other outside of the activities, it actually seems to be like that for everybody. People may find a partner there, but they don't easily make friends in the environment.  


I have been a student for these past two years, but this is mainland Europe, there's no campus here. My two best friends from uni did not live in the town where we had classes, now one has started working and moved to my town with her boyfriend, but we rarely see each other because she often spends weekends away. 

 #x200B;

My best friend lives on a different continent altogether, and this couple I'm friends with ends up being the only real option of social interaction I have a lot of times. They also don't have many friends, they have many acquaintances that we sometimes join for a barbeque or pic nic, but we are pretty much in agreement that they are my closest friends in town and I am theirs.

 #x200B;

In July we all went on separate holidays and when I came back we met once. She is currently facing depression, so does not want to see people a lot. She was supposed to come along, then wasn't, he still came, after letting me wait approximately 45 minutes, and we had a nice evening, we even managed to lure her out for pizza. After that, they were both busy, I was too, my aunt was visiting town so I spent a lot of my free time with her or at my parent's house.

 #x200B;

When we last saw each other, with my friends, they announced a close friends of theirs was coming to visit this week and that we should really do something all together. This guy is really nice and apparently likes me a lot, it's recirpocal, so we were all looking forward to doing something together, I thought.

 #x200B;

We were supposed to go for a beer on Thursday, but they came back late from some kind of day trip, so it didn't happen. On Friday we had plans at 8, which were postponed and changes to a chill drink at 9.30. A bit earlier than that I was a victim of a bad episode of racism and online harassment, took me ages to find the right ways to report and stop all of it through Facebook, this involved some pictures of me so I was pretty upset. I told them I would be late because of that, they said that they wouldn't stay out too long though, and then I ended up not being able to go. They were in a part of town far enough from where I live, I would have gotten there around 11pm, and I suppose they wanted to be home by midnight. They told me they'd keep me updated about their plans for the following days, but did not inquire at all about the racist and harassment, even though I mentioned it as the reason of my absence.

 #x200B;

The next day, the training I was at was close to their house. They have a habit of making last minute invitations and plans, and as said we live far away enough, so before leaving their nieghbourhood I asked what they were up to. Neither of them was at home, the guy was biking in a different town with his visiting friend, and so I just went home, assuming to hear from them later in the night.  


I didn't so I went to the movies on my own, wearing an outfit I had originally picked out for seeing them, going into town. Heels and a skirt and all, WHATEVS. I just didn't want to put anymore thought in how I dressed. I ate pop corn aggressively for the first hour of the movie, then tried to enjoy it and started crying as soon as I got off my bus home.

 #x200B;

They are not responsible for the fact of being my only friends, but they know they are. I am always there for them, when they have needed anything practical or support, inidividually or as a couple, I have been there. 

 #x200B;

I don't know I just feel really sad about this all. A lot of changes are coming up in my life, I'm starting a new job and moving apartments, my first unfurnished place that I will redecorate. I have some slight health issues that have a big impact on my life, I am having to make a big change to my diet and eat in a way that's not only strict but a bit unnatural for me too (LOTS of proteins). Next week I'll go and get tested for HIV because there is a real chance I might test positive. I could really use a friend, and my friends know all of that. Why aren't they being there for me? At all? They have their own issue, I am not a teenager, I don't ask for full time availability, just a drink with people whom you can 100% be  yourself around.

 #x200B;

This week my parents are leaving for holiday, my brother is leaving for work for 2 weeks. If they don't get in touch (I'm sorry but I don't, I'm done trying) I'm going to be on my own until my family members come back. And I will be starting my new job and moving during this time.

 #x200B;

I tend to have a life story very different from everyone I meet. I am a child of privileged immigrants who moved countries a lot and I don't belong to any specific place, my culture and identity are quite mixed. Everyone in this town is either a local or an immigrant, or if they're like me, they like to stay in their closed off circles of privileged highly educated rich and trying to stay rich people, which I don't fancy. I had a serious relationship of many years when I was very young and came out as bisexual after 25, quite late so to say.

 #x200B;

I constantly try new things and also stick with them. I'm going to a singing meetup on Monday, I'm going to a Yoga in the Park activity today. But I never seem to click or be able to become close to the people I meet.

 #x200B;

I will confront my friends about not getting in touch and not really caring on Friday, just not yet, not today. Really just saddened and lonely. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It endend because we just realised we weren't in love anymore. She had strained my love for her, but not out of bad intentions, she was just not able to be better than that, at that moment in her life, and that demanded too much effort for me, and to put myself aside a lot.   


She outgrew that behaviour, but we ended up realising, both, that we were not in love anymore and parted ways.

We tried being friends, but I guess too soon, so we ended up being FWB and then in an open relationship for nearly 1 year, just because we couldn't fully detach.

Now we've cut all communications, we just occasionally cross ways at a volunteering group we're both part of, and we decided if we ever get back in touch, it will have to be after we've both become "our own person" again.

I would still run to her if she called me in an emergency. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1) I apreciate my body, for the opportunity it gives me to live life. Thanks to this body (fat, big, not big enough, whatever body you have) I am able to move, swim, talk, be with other people, write - do things I like. And that's beautiful on its own.  


2) Self care. I love lotions and soaps. So I choose them accurately and invest some time every day in applying them, just to tell my body it is worth taking care of, because even though I'd sometimes like it to be a bit different (be it only for practical reasons, not necessarily beauty standards), it still has some amazing bits and parts and as said above, it serves the purpose of allowing me to live. So thanks bod, luv ya, take this face milk in!  


3) I have a list of compliments people have paid me that I can really get behind. Like the fact that I have a beautiful smile, that I have a hourglass figure and my waist looks nice. That the haircut I have at the moment suits me. I pay myself those compliments too, on the days on which I don't feel as beautiful as I'd want to be.  


But it's been a process, of growing up and accepting I'm not going to be able to change my body's shape that much, despite strong will and determination (struggled a lot with my health being an obstacle to that), and focusing more on trying to be healthy and living the life I want to live through the body I have. As they say, looks fade. Experiences and memories stay (longer, at least). </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Me and my best friend have lived on different continents for most of our friendship. We got really close after high school and I stayed in Europe for my studies and career, while she went all over the globe. 

She visits our home town 1/2 times a year, I have visited her a few times, but I cannot always afford it/plan it so it's quite sporadic. We see each other every few months, sometimes as much as 9 months pass without us seeing each other and the most frustrating part is  that, since we're in our mid twenties and our lives change a lot and quickly, we usually have no clue of when we'll meet again when we say goodbye.

My family can't cope with how close we are. They have suggested multiple times that it's like we're a couple, because we text a lot (with work now we have less time, but as students we were in constant WhatsApp contact). They always comment on how long our Skype calls are and of the fact that I only really travel to see her.   


When she's in town we tend to spend all of our free time together, and they question that too, they say it's too much and that it's ridiculous we have to live in symbiosis like this (but we don't, I go to work, she spends time with her mom, I still have dinner with my parents and see other friends if I happen to have other engagements when she's here).

Many other people have also made  comments, on how we're always in touch, and some people, even ones I've just gotten to know, flat out ask me if she was my first love, when they learn I'm bisexual. Or ask me if she's bisexual as well. Like...no, and no, but also : why do you think you can ask that during our second not-one-on-one chat?

Other, also mostly strangers, have told me that "we can't possibly still be friend after all these years apart". STFU!

My first two boyfriends also had a hard time accepting how close we were, my last girlfriend was totally ok with it though. 

She is the only person who has always been part of my life. When I moved, I broke up with people, when I quit jobs, when I burnt out because of jobs I was not ready to quit, when I turned my life around or had big health scares. I lived far away from my parents (though on the same continent) for a long while, and she was the only one I was alway in touch with. She's like a treasure and she works in high risk countries sometimes, goes to conflict zones. She's not military but she's found herself in her fair share of revolutions and internet lockdowns. 

I have the right to text her, talk to her, spend time with her, as much as I want! It's not disrupting my  life, it's not like I don't have other friends or partners, like I don't enjoy other activities that don't involve her. I make my  own decisions and of course I ask her advice but, she's not the only person I ask. Like I bought a table and a buffet for my living room yesterday, sent her the pictures before buying she didn't like it, my mom did, I liked it too. Bought it. Whatevs.

I don't understand why people can't give me a break, why does this need to be questioned so much? She's a friend like no other, if you don't have one of those you might not get it, but PLEASE LEAVE ME ALONE AND LET ME ENJOY HER COMPANY WHILE I CAN!!!

Had my mom ask me if "Your friend is ok with you harassing her like this" this morning, as I told her I'd be spending the day with her. Like, people, give me a break. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I thought men could have sex for a long time when they were young (lasting 20/30 minutes or more - once had an exhausting 3h encounter with a guy when I was a teenager, I did not have the guts to ask him to stop at the time but boy was I fed up with it...) and then tended to ejaculated a bit more quickly as they got older.

As said, I have always felt my partners orgasms, so I found this weird. But I guess it's not then :) thanks for the input! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just wondering.

I had sex with a man 13 years my senior this summer, we did it about three times. He was a non-circumcised African man. 

Preliminaries were really great, he quickly understood what I liked and could please me in every way. The penetration part was not as good, I did get some pleasure from it but it lasted only about 5/7min and, most surprising of all, I didn't feel him coming at all.

I know men last less and less with age, and of course, this was just a fling so I didn't have interest or time to "work" on our lovemaking to make him last longer, but the fact that I did not feel him come at all surprised me a lot. We finished in different positions each time. Have you ever experienced that before? Is it correlated with age or not at all?

I could always feel my younger/same age male partners come, regardless of penis size.

Despite this, I was still happy to have slept with him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would like both partners to do the same thing: both wear a ring, or both don't. I would especially dislike being proposed to with the expectation of me wearing a ring while the other party does not think they should wear one.

I was engaged in Italy before, to a man, and he wore a band too, that was the custom in our region.

I think the best way to introduce it would be to just say that you think/would like both persons of the engaged couple to bear a sign of the engagement :) that's why you are not only offering a ring but putting one on yourself. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Me [27F] with my somewhat-girlfriend[24F] of 2y, are going to break up but I'm afraid to be passing a great opportunity for happiness </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm not a native English speaker so please be kind if this isn't perfectly written.


I started dating my GF 2y ago, we were together for 10months then I broke it off because I wasn't sure I loved her anymore. 

We had had some serious fights, mainly about her not being able to listen to me, about constantly asking for attention and space in my life, even going over what she knew to be my needs (I was completing a master and she wouldn't leave me alone/stop calling/stop asking for help for her bachelor thesis and I ended up having to retake an exam twice also because of this. This was just the final result of such behaviour which had been going on for the better part of our relationship).

After we broke up we decided to stay in touch, became friends a bit too early and ended up sleeping together again about 2months after our breakup. We became Friends With Benefits which quickly started to look and feel more like an open relationship, since we were seeing each other 3/4 days/nights a week, sleeping together at least 1/week while at the same time both being on Tinder and flirting with or seeing other people.

Over this time, when I sensed or knew she was seeing someone else I started to panic, I couldn't bear the thought of not being the center of her life anymore. I was afraud she's leave me if the other dating situation became more interesting. She also didn't feel good when she knew I was seeing other people, and none of our respective attempts to date other people was successful, we only saw each person 1/2 times.

I slept with my ex boyfriend a few times over the months me and my gf were in an open relationship (as a freshly declared bisexual, as soon as my first same-sex relationship was over I felt the urge to test whether I still found the other sex attractive - pretty common it seems) and I also kind of forced myself to sleep with another girl. When I saw this other girl naked I thought I liked my girlfriend a lot better and doubted whether I should sleep with this girl or not, ended up doing it and it was not interesting, good or fun at all. Overall wished I hadn't.

I haven't dated anyone else in months, but I keep feeling unsure about my feelings. I have had moments over the last year in which I've felt that I might actually be in love with my girlfriend and I briefly considered going back to a monogamous relationship and planning my future with her.

Sometimes, when we're out together with friends, or at events, I feel like she's blocking me from experiencing more, or if I meet someone interesting I feel the interest of wanting to flirt with them, get to know them more, but it never leads me to anything serious or real. 

Now we're both leaving for a month in July, for separate work/projects, and we've decided we'll call it a day and break up for good. I was the one to make this plan and this decision, based on the fact that I do not feel like I can be sure that I love her, whereas she told me she's in love with me not so long ago (until then we were both in agreement that we liked each other a lot but that this wasn't love). 

When discussing the fact that we'll end this and things are better this way, she mentioned that since declaring her feelings for me she has doubted them again. That she would like to stay with me more than she'd like to break up, but it's true that this isn't going nowhere.

A podcast I listend to recently sent me into jeopardy (do you say that in English? no clue, I hope you get me) - an old woman and writer was saying that we should avoid questioning ourselves about love and the extent of our feelings all the time, because in marriage/LT relationships those things are only clear for the first few months, years for a few lucky ones, and then everything loses clarity and what stays and grows are friendship, mutual appreciation and support, shared interest in having new experiences together, happiness of sharing memories and moments, and love can feel stronger or weaker or you can doubt it more often than not.

I am very much afraid to be wasting a perfectly good opportunity at a happy life, with a woman I love(d) - that I also appreciate, with whom I share values and interests and with whom I can see myself taking big steps like buying a house together, getting pets and adopting children - out of the romantic pop-culture idea that love needs to hit you in the heart and in the face all the time.

I am not sure to have ever been in love. I just felt like I HAD TO BE with my first boyfriend (I was 16, 8y together) and my second one too (I was 25, 7mo together). I also felt like that towards her, when I first got to know her and for the first few months all I could think of was that I wanted to be with her, to have her in my life and everything else didn't count.

We don't live together and even now I feel like I want to be with her more days than I don't want to. That I want to have her in my bed at night. Then often in the morning I will wake up and question why she's in my bed, think that I'd rather not have her around and feel uneasy about it.

I don't know what to do, I don't want to build a life with someone I don't love, but I don't want to miss out on what life together would be just because books and tv shows have taught me, maybe wrongly, that love must make your heart pump faster all the time.

I feel that trying to have a complete no-contact old style classic break-up is the last option left and I can't figure out anything better than this.

tldr: can't decide if I'm in love or not, if I should break off our relatonship "as planned" or if I'm missing out on a great opportunity at love and happiness. </TEXT>

<TEXT> so he basically asked to open the relationship on his side. would you be ok with that? if  yes, you can consider it but it needs to happen through a mature discussion with him and only once you are done discussing it can he start sleeping with people outside the marriage.

if that is absolutely not what you want, he should not do it, since it would be cheating on you, or he should find the courage to break up with you and pursue the exploration of sex with men. 

Try to talk about it with him in a calm and serious manner, go to couples counseling or to counseling on your own to discuss the issue. 

You need to be comfortable and fulfilled in your relationship or be with someone that is really there for you and with you (too). </TEXT>

<TEXT> The issue seems to be he his not committing to your relationship fully. 

What he's doing is flirting with other men, not having gay friends, and you have told him explicitly these are not the terms you are comfortable with.

If he is not able to commit to the relationship with you on terms you both agree on, then this relationship is not going to last.

Maybe you could try to go to counseling on your side to understand what you are willing to compromise with? 

If you find terms that are agreeable for both, you will have to rebuild your trust in him, since he has been deceiving you for years.

I'm sorry you have to go through this. He does not seem to be open to fully discuss what he thinks and feels, he seems to be handling this quite badly and anxiously. Mostly wanting you to just let him do his thing without accepting any questioning or his duties to you that come with a marriage. </TEXT>

<TEXT> After reading your message and quite a number of comments, I must say the importance you (as a couple) give to appearance and body is much higher than average. This is not a bad thing at all, everyone should live their body as they please. However, women who are not "beautiful" (as per society standards) feel the pressure to become that way, women who ARE "beautiful" (like your girlfriend) and hear it said to them a lot, can become anxious about maintaining that appearance. Add to that that her reference has now shifted to media-like women in your new town and more towards porn, this, along with the laughing incident, could have triggered self-doubt and insecurities she might previously have been able to manage. As someone said before, if she was doing beauty pageants she probably relies on outside validation quite a lot.

Try to point out that she has been somewhat different in the last two weeks, and you don't know if the laughing incident is what caused it, but you'd generally like to understand how she feels if she has anything she'd like to share (and try avoiding to load this with more stuff i.e. "tell me everything even if it will hurt" - even though I get why you'd say that).

Or, if she keeps the porn talk up next time you have sex, make a "nice" comment about it, as in saying that she's really keeping it up, that it's becoming part of your sex routine and you'd like to know why exactly. 

She might be evolving in terms of sex preferences, in terms of how she sees herself and her appearance, she might be very insecure and unable to discuss it. One chat isn't going to "fix" this, you're growing together and that's a neverending process. You seem to have made very valid attempts at starting communication on this, hope you can get through it as smoothly and rapidly as possible. </TEXT>

Usually works. 

I also say I'm going to one event (Jazz Jam at Bar X, happening today at 9) when I'm actually going somewhere else (Queer poetry slam at Bar Y, happening today at 9). Both events exist, I am interested in both, and heck I might visit one after I've been to the other, but one option doesn't need me to mention the event I'm going to is queer women oriented. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The thing is that pain gets worse with age. So what you are doing now is an investment and this is the only time you have to invest in the best possible cure for your scoliosis and cifosis. 

I know it's not easy but maybe try to not ONLY do the swimming or kinetotherapy, and add yoga/pilates (yoga for the core, or yoga for the back, a good yoga studio can tell you which type will fit your condition best) and try to adopt a warrior mindset (and pose, look it up, I find the warrior poses really empowering): I AM GOING TO FU***NG TAKE CARE OF MY SPINE DESPITE YOU PROVIDING ME WITH THIS SHI**Y DEPRESSING POOL, PEOPLE. You are Spinerman against the town's depressing pool :D And maybe you can get active in local politics, a council about how the funds for the pool are spent, maybe you can create a local volunteer program to repaint it/retile part of it or a "keeping our pool clean" volunteer program in your community to make things better?

Really try the yoga/pilates option, but don't quit on all the possible ways that are available to you to cure your spine. I know it's horrible to have to go to a depressing place every week (for the record, I did my physical therapy and the therapist's house. he basically had his practice in a closet and that's literally where he lived. his wife was constantly screaming at him, sometimes even during the sessions. they divorced shortly after I stopped going there) but it's even worse to end up with chronic back pain you can't really do much about at age 35/40. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had scoliosis and cifosis, it was really strong after the puberty growth spurt (age 12/13) and I went to a physical therapist 2/3 times a week to mainly do abs and stretching and that's how it got nearly totally fixed. Where I live my basic health insurance covers this kind of things. I also swam every week. By age 15 the problem was mostly solved.

You're older, if you're male there's still a chance you'll grow up "straighter" if you keep swimming, and it will definitely help with the pain, but your window to really make this better, as far as I know, is short.

If you really hate swimming and your swimming pool is such a depressing place, talk to your doctor about other options to improve your conditions, both in terms of sports and of physical therapy. Depending on how severe the condition is, he/she will know what's best for you.

I am doing really well now, but my brother, now in his mid-twenties, suffers from constant back pain, and that is really not fun. He now takes a lot more care of his spine, compared to when he skipped physical therapy as a young teenager and does the appropriate physical activity (abs and yoga) to get relief from his pain.

I also do yoga regularly.

Really don't underestimate the impact it can have on your life LT, depending on the severity of your condition, and do try to find an alternative to swimming and stick to it religiously. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had not thought about that.

As a young woman (27), I look at older women as an inspiration and as mentors, both in my work and personal life. When I change jobs/teams I have a tendency to pick a female role model to push me forward, I tend to think "I will pick [X] as my next objective, so I can be as awesome/professional/interesting as her".

Other major role models for me are my 70yo neighbour who's redefining her own spirituality and mixing animism and Christianity without ever apologising to anyone about it (we, however, had to apologise to a tree of hers whose branches we cut without asking permission to the tree), she also has a flamboyant and unapologetic style, and my best friends mom, late 50s been single forever has a ton of friends and extremely good taste in EVERYTHING. 

My grandmothers were both an inspiration to me, my mom is too (even though all 3 women are deeply flawed and have/had a ton of faults), so I guess I'm carrying this way of looking at women forward with me in my life.

I am a woman, and I will get old, so I listen to older women and I look at them, to try and learn how to do it best. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's true you won't be able to help him if he does not want help. He seems to be looking for social interaction though, the compliments and so forth :) you can talk to him and provide that. Maybe you'll become a candidate in his eyes to ask for help or information to in the future.

I volunteer with the homeless and many are also addicts. You might not be able to solve his problems, but if you are up for reducing his suffering, having a chat while you wait for the train can already mean a lot.

Edit: keep it to casual conversation, share what you feel like sharing about your life, but be aware that asking for personal details about him might push him away. if he becomes comfortable with you, he will share. Still, this is a lot to take on, and playing social assistant is never a good idea. But as I said, a kind word, a chat, will give him a connection the "real" world and that's already a good pavement for his way out of addiction. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you have ever liked reading or stories, I recommend writing! Start by making lists on a certain topic, if you are trying to discover yourself and have doubts about something, try to make a list related to that topic. You'll find that in time the lists become more elaborate and in the end you'll be able to throw words on paper easily enough, and if you life this you can make your texts more beautiful and artistic and fun. 

I find it very cathartic, self-exploratory, and sometimes now I just jolt them a few rhimy lines to spend my time, because it's fun.

In general, just make a list of thing you like or have liked in the past and if those are not satisfactory activities to you anymore, go for those that are similar and explore those ;) keep doing what you like, don't insist on the things you don't enjoy :D </TEXT>

<TEXT> I sadly know of many non straight people who have faced stories similar to yours. I myself face some (light) rejection from my mother every day.

One thing that universally helps is living outside the family home. I hope it's something you can work towards. I came out to my parents just after I had to move back home due to work/study issues and it wasn't fun, even if their reaction was not as tough as the one you're facing. All this time, it helped me to know I would be moving out after I graduate and I'm now counting down the days to September, which will be the first time in two years I have a full salary again and will allow me to move out.

People find all kinds of ways to cope with it. A friend has cut her family out completely and it is great to find people that you can talk to IRL and that have gone through similar things. I'm sure your support group will help you in that regard too, even if the stories won't necessarily be LGBT.

I struggle with the homophobia I face, at home and outside, and I found that coming here and sharing thoughts with other bi and queer people is already quite soothing. So keep posting here on the bad days, we'll be there to catch you ;) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Gah! Sorry about your friends :/ are you really sure they would stop being your friends if you told them you're bi? that might cause a few discussions and maybe even heated arguments, but if they are your *closest humans* (love this expression) I think they will find a way to at least agree to disagree with you but let you be yourself.

They are obliterating your orientation, that's part of bi-phobia I think (still a bit confused, new to this too). I wish they weren't or that you could turn to other friends about this.

You don't have to come out until you're comfortable doing so though, and you don't have to act on your bisexuality to consider yourself bisexual.

Doubting your orientation is, I am told, also a lifelong part of bisexuality. I also came out as bisexual at 26, when, having met the most beautiful and interesting girl on the planet (no I won't give you her address) I had to act on my orientation. When we broke up (yes I let her go I know I'm stupid sometimes :P) the first thing I did was reconnect with a male ex and sleep with him, just to check if I still liked that. I did.

I spent a lot of time after my coming out thinking about how I should feel, I still do but less insistently. I find that things are best when I don't dwell on it too much and I just let myself feel what I feel. 

If you need to feel like your orientation is accepted, look for bi-groups on and offline or for queer inclusive environments. Start helping out with any kind of activities, you can say to your friends you are for everyone's rights and that you're curious. You also don't have to report to them about everything you do. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My mom and my grandmother have the same kind of relationship, my mom and I do too. They are both mothers that self-pity before anything else.

I have never been in the difficult situation that you are in right now, but what I sometimes found to be helpful was to listen to my grandmother rant about how one of my mom's life decisions (moving to a different city, gaining or losing weight, marrying my father -she's still hung up on that...) had made it so much harder on her. I would say I understood (not that I agreed) and that her feelings were valid, but that maybe she should talk about it to my mom a bit later, when the rough moment had passed (when she had moved, once her diet was well on its way, once she was done with the operation my grandmother thought was a mistake). 

By doing this often enough, I have become someone my grandmother trusts, because I let her be herself with me, but at the same time this tactic allows me to shield my mom, at least for the first few days or weeks after she makes a decision or goes through the thing my grandma doesn't agree with. It's not much but it's something. Also, when my grandmother can't hold it anymore and ends up telling my mother how badly her diet hurt her (because she cannot cook everything in bacon anymore and how are we supposed to enjoy family gatherings this way) I know what she's going to say, and I can be there for my mom in a more supportive way if she needs me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I cheated early on in my LDR of 8y for which I later left everything, moved countries, lost friends family and opportunities. And then left him and went back and am having a really good life.

The early cheating itself could have been something to solve and move forward from: it was a different version of your bf, a long time ago.

Given your edit though, this man does not seem to be fully considering you and your needs/feelings in this relationship.

I stayed for a longer time than I should have because I had invested so much, but you say you're young. You'll be surprised how much and how fast you can rebuild if you want to :) it doesn't come free or easy, but it's 100% worth it and not as hard as you think when you're still "in" it </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the key here is that the OP does not want to get back with this guy, she just didn't get closure and still feels hurt.

Romatically this is not a menace to her current partner, it's a menace to her overall health and tranquility, but everyone who has lived for more than a day on earth has issues that impact them and those that are in a relationship with them :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Had a 8y long relationship that scarred me, about the same time in life as you did (teenage and early adulthood). I blamed myself a lot for staying in it and missing out on life opportunities because of it.

I honestly wouldn't have wanted a partner that was not able to understand the pain that stayed with me after this relationship ended. My first bf and then my following gf were both able to talk about it (M26, together for 6months; F22, together for 2years).

You are hurt by how your ex behaved and have a hard time mourning this love, but this doesn't impact your reasons to love your current boyfriend or your ability to love him. I don't know your exact age but you are at least in your mid-twenties. Your bf is probably mature enough to understand where you're coming from when you explain. Of course, he might be taken aback when you first bring it up.

I agree with other commentators that you should consider addressing this in solo therapy, but I also personally think your partner can take this part of your truth/life and if he can't, that's also fine because he's a human being and entitled to insecurities and so forth, but if he ultimately is not able to understand that a past relationship can leave a big scar, you should both move on to single life and then a different partner :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry sorry sorry. But you're wrong :D

A parent needs to speak to their child in their native language, you can convey so much more emotion with your mother tongue than you can with a second or third language!

I went to an English/French school and I have Italian parents. Met loads of international kids there. Some were learning/speaking 5 languages at a time. They all master at least one language to its fullest now and they did well in school and after :) 

Many were the children of parents with different native languages and it was all "can you pass me the bakuli" when you went to their place. And the English father had learned that bakuli was Swahili for bowl. And he also knew "spezzatino" was Italian for stew. 

Learn with your daughter! You'll end up having your own family's language and that will forever be so special :D There are words I can only thing of in English (like cunning or overwhelming) and others that come to my mind only in Italian. Sometimes, I am speaking in French with my gf (she's French) and I really can't remember how the fudge you say BAKER so I go for the definition. Being bilingual like your wife can be hard :D

Maybe, while you're learning, you could have the rule that conversations you need to understand too should be in English (your daughter is small now, but it's still relevant to you to understand why your wife scholds her, for example). 

The only way to a lasting bilingual relationship is that each partner learns the other one's language. Anyone who tells you otherwise is lying or has no experience in it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No military experience but a lot of leadership experience :) BUT I AM SUCH A PEOPLE PLEASER!!! So I also have a hard time giving orders and directions and also corrections.

I sometime do as you do with children, reprimand and explain why it's important than the broken rule be respected. If you are serious in your discussion, it works and for me it helps me to avoid the niceness, since I'm trying to explain something.

I was also greatly helped by experiences that forced me to be demanding or reprimand. I helped to accept the fact that giving orders sharply is not a problem the first time me and my team had to work pretty fast/faced an emergency. I started feeling comfortable about reprimanding a team member (much older than me) when he put the whole team in danger (started a fight with a GROUP OF ANGRY HUNGRY HOMELESS PEOPLE....INAPPROPRIATE! We nearly faced an uprising...).

After these experiences, I tried to reconnect with the 'mood' or feeling I'd had when they happened, and use it to do the same thing in a different situation.

And if you're a people pleaser like me: make an effort to shine with your bosses! Showcase your results, if you do so you'll feel the pressure to be able to show you're keeping up the good work :D and you'll do more of the right things </TEXT>

<TEXT> I might be wrong, but your differences in lifestyle seem to take up most of your worries. It's 100% legitimate to think that someone much more sheltered than you, with a different living and earning situation might not be the right partner to apprehend. Maybe go on 1 or 2 more dates, since you had such a good impression of her and then weigh the pros and cons? 

Also, about the money, I've been the richest and the poorest in a relationship :) let her decide. She wants to go 50/50, do that. She wants to take turns and make the effort of taking you to good restaurants, do that. When you get more comfortable and are able to talk about money more extensively you can suggest different arrangements, discuss them at length and land on a compromise that considers your better endowment of cash.

She's been extremely straightforward about her mental health issues, so I'm sure she has a pretty good grip on them and how to handle them/fit them into her life. As other commentators said you can only see how it goes as you move forward. Same goes for the sex pain.

It's good that you're thinking about all of this, don't worry about it excessively, just keep it in mind as you move forward. If you can't take it, no big deal, you are allowed to be unable to have a fulfilling relationship with anyone, including people who are mentally ill. It means you weren't the right fit for her, and she wasn't the right fit for you :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> The advice you get before posting here says to be respectful and constructive in your reply/comment.

I stood at the side of a woman in an abusive relationship. She had been in it for 12 years when she started to question it and only left after 3 more years and a baby. 

Every one of us has their own journey.

Yes, it's highly likely that the OP is in an abusive relationship and of course she should get out of it, but criticising her for not doing so or saying she doesn't deserve advice because she hasn't left yet aren't respectful or constructive comments to make.

You don't need to agree with her, support her, or give her advice if you don't feel she deserves your time, but writing accusatory comments or telling her how she should do better are really low things to do.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> F27 here, I tell anyone I date quite upfront. I bring it up through an anecdote or something like that, around the 2nd/3rd date usually.

If I share it, it's because I feel safe doing so, so usually, the person in front of me is someone who's friendly/polite enough to not have a bad reaction, otherwise, I wouldn't date them.

I have been rejected or questioned in a way I didn't appreciate because of this. I mainly date women so they are the ones I got the most rejections from.

Despite this, I'm much more anxious to tell a man - even with men I trust the potential of a violent outburst or of rudeness/obliteration (so many men think it's fun to say stuff like "hey as long as you only cheat on me with girls/as long as we can have a threesome, I'm ok!") seems much greater than with an angry anti-bi lesbian.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've never been a big fan of dairy products and stuff I recently read about the dairy industry has put me even more off milk. 

But every nice breakfast option I can think of includes milk and/or chocolate!

It my culture breakfast is sweet so what I currently do is the following:
- work days: tasty (berries/chocolate) biscuits to go that I eat on my commute, then coffee when I get at the office
- weekends or working from home: coffee with milk and plain biscuits

Other things I ate in the past included chocolate pudding with sweet/honey spelt, toast with jam, banana and oatmeal pancakes. I moved on from these options because I can't find honey spelt where I live now and the other two were really too sweet after a while.

I'm not a fan of using pans and such in the morning, I must admit I don't love breakfast :( I only eat it because I have to - I would have brunch (with eggs) every day if I could and then go for a snack and dinner.

I will keep dairy in the game for special weekend breakfast menus, like pancakes or french toast, but I'd like to drastically reduce my consumption of it (also looking for better cow treating sources of milk for occasional consumption...).

Yes, this is a tough one I know, but that's why I'm looking for advice. Let me know :/ </TEXT>

<TEXT> Other commentators might be right that this is nothing serious, you should give him the benefit of the doubt and I definitely side with the person who suggests you address this with him.

I, however, would feel deeply hurt and bothered by this attitude. I guess it depends from who you are :) I am egalitarian to a manic level, I feel menaced if people don't recognise my full identity. I would consider leaving this guy, after such remark, not before having talked this through of course.

Still, being the boyfriend of an openly bi girl is probably not something that has happened to your boyfriend before. So talk about it, explain why it makes you feel uncomfortable and see where it goes. I guess it's probably going to be a long-term discussion, not a one-off conversation :) if he's open to understand and discuss this, it's already a good sign! </TEXT>

<TEXT> thumbs up for talking about dark thoughts! also had them in the past and I have to admit not so long ago, and everyone who thinks of those things should know: you are not alone!

I'm a pretty positive person, I just told myself ok the world hates me sometimes, but at least it stopped raining, so I manage to be ok. But sometimes I'm so overwhelmed.

This comes after a conversation with my mom, who is a tad homophobic, though she tolerates my bisexuality and was ok and even friendly with my ex gfs. We were talking about politics and police brutality, she asked why do I think police is so bad, do I have any direct experience of it and I said I do, the first people to harass me for not being straight were policemen (I live in Belgium, just for reference). And she said she's afraid of how all of "this" could affect us as a family, I asked what did she mean by this? me being harassed or beaten up because of discrimination. And she said no,  she meant all of this "LGBT" talk, which she wishes we'd stop and just let her live her life quietly. 

It hurt she'd worry more about tuning the background LGBT noise down than about her daughter's wellbeing and safety. </TEXT>

<TEXT> have you checked if the 6 others have friends? they might not and might be supposing that you have friends too, that's why they're not asking you to hang out and so forth. 

Find someone that seems similar to you in any of your classes and ask them for help figuring out homework, if you have any issues with that, or ask what do people do for fun here, since you're new and don't entirely know. See if they invite you to something, but even if they don't, now you have a piece of information you can use.

Try to find people you'd like to talk to and try to talk to them. If you manage to do that, over time (you don't need to go through your whole list of interesting people today!) you will end up having some conversations and that will at some point turn into spending time together, which could turn into a friendship.

<TEXT> I've dealt with my fair share of anxiety, I deal with it still. I have realised a lot of it comes from thinking of the tasks ahead of me or of the issues that I'm facing as something big and unapproachable.

I try to cope by splitting everything up into very small steps and I take one step at a time, it usually makes things a little bit better.

Don't think a life of solitude, reclusion, exclusion and doom awaits you and that you'll never make new friends. Think of today: today you have maybe 0 new friends at this new school but you talked to someone, OVERCOMING, the fear of them feeling annoyed or uninterested. So that's already an achievement, you scored!

Work on this one day at a time and achieve small goals one after the other, make them smaller if the challenges you had set for yourself seem too big, just keep going. It will lead you somewhere :) things will get better. Don't hesitate to reach out for help if you feel like you can take it. No man is an island, nobody makes it alone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The second time me and my first GF had sex. We had been courting for a long time, we had already had sex once so I had at least a bit of a clue of how things worked with a woman, finally, and she's very explicit so I was able to quickly understand what she wanted. 

We had sex for over 5 hours, of course we weren't having vagina action for the full time, also kissed and caressed a lot over that time, but it was mesmerizing, it was so sensual and such a deep feeling. I felt so connected to her.

I have to admit, as a bi woman, that's why I have felt more attracted to sex with women than to sex with men, since that experience. Sex with men is great and if I love a man that's all I want, but there's so much more opportunity for connection and touch and it's more of a full-body experience with a woman. 

When I'm single that's what I crave the most. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I guess there should never be a situation in which one expects the other to give sex as a duty. I also find, and other comments attest to that too, that the idea that women don't crave sex as much as men is quite untrue. People have different sex drives.

All in all, agreement and openness are the most important parts of this issue. If the couple is able to agree that it's acceptable for one or both to refuse sex when they don't feel like it, or that on the contrary they're ok "giving in" on their partner's needs, then everything is good.

Nobody should suffer during sex and both should be able to say if they are going going along with it or not. As long as people are on the same page, no harm is done and some pleasure could come out of it. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pick one thing you feel like you would be able to improve and start from that. I had to improve my life/diet because of medical conditions (more than one at once! yay!) and I really like a lot of the changes I made, kept most of them.

want to get out of the house more? start with 1h more a week: volunteering, walking around your neighbourhood.

want to get fit? start moving, again 20/30 min a day: try it all: yoga videos, walks, running and fitness apps.

want to eat better? Find 1 attractive health(ier)y recipe a week and make it for yourself and your mom on Sundays or Saturday nights. (though I would leave food last, it's such a big part of life it's really hard to change eating habits, especially when you're not feeling super well - just a suggestion: try beans! they're extra tasty and an awesome alternative to meat and burgers)

You are 30 and unemployed, which means you have time on your hands and a lot of life ahead of you. Try everything good you can think of and keep doing what you like. Hate yoga? drop it. Love walks in nature? Take more than one a week, then maybe join a local walking group, then maybe move on to hiking? 

I know it takes willpower to make changes, but willpower is something you build. So try this, take one step at a time, do what you like again and move towards a happier you. Happier you will have an easier time looking for/getting a job and making the big changes too.

Don't hesitate to look for support groups, counseling or to go to therapy if you can, even if you're not sure you need it. If you find out you do, it's great to start getting better by doing that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey! Remember each time you fail at a diet your body starts trying a bit harder to keep any weight you might have or gain, so be wary of trying regimens that are really hard on you or that require radical changes, since those are the ones that are the most likely to fail 2/3/5 years down the road and bring you back to square 1 if not above your initial weight.

This being said, what you're doing seems to be working and seems ok. I would add small portions of other carbs (pasta and bread), especially whole grains, even more so considering that you run every day.

When I was following a strict diet I loved baked vegetables: carrots, eggplant, zucchini. Just bake them in the oven (easy to find temperatures and times online) on a sheet of paper and then season with a small amount of oil, salt and the spices you like the most. I personally don't like spices so I stuck to oil and salt.

Fruit is amazing, I ate it every morning and in the early afternoon. Try turkey instead of chicken sometimes, if you like fish give it a go too, look for baked or steamed recipes that add spices to the dish later, I found them the easiest to approach fish with, as someone who does not like it a lot.

Shrimp is also extra cool, good to add a bit of protein to a salad or to eat something that isn't meat with your carbs. 

Some things people have lost the habit of eating but I rediscovered and LOVED were spelt and all kinds of beans. Spelt can be used instead of rice/pasta and beans, red and white, are really good just steamed, with oil and laurel, or pepper, or a bit of tomato sauce (not ketchup).

Yeah I guess that's all. A lot of people eat yogurt and fresh cheeses, but I am not a fan of dairy. Also, full eggs are good too, at least once a week :)

The key is cooking lightly (oven, steamed and adding condiment upon serving), managing your portions well, following your body and eating when you're hungry as opposed to when you fancy a snack. And you're exercising so that's great too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Had this issue in a previous relationship, she was calling me way too often, far more than I was calling her. The solution we found was that we would both ask each other if we were free to video/call before we did, as not to interrupt work meeting, training sessions, chats with friends. I also committed to trying to call her more often, as she said she felt I was not reaching out to be in touch enough and this was making her insecure/needy (to which I replied I was suffocated by her constantly being in touch at the time). We found our balance, she stopped calling me every hour and would only call 1/2 times a day on days where she was freer, I'd try to call shortly when I could, and sometime I replied to her "can we chat" messages, by saying I preferred to text than to voice/video. It worked :) It all evened out even better when she also got busier and the staying in touch regimen she had initially adopted became unsustainable. 

It takes a bit to adjust, it takes a while to grow up. Just stand your ground, make him understand you won't have anything interesting to say or that you'll only be bothered by his calls if they are at a 20/30 min frequency... </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry your wife told them before you could, definitely not ideal. Hope things are sorted between you two now.

Unfortunately people find all kinds of excuses to justify their lack of acceptance for things they don't understand. 

Most of them will come to terms with it eventually, just remember you're not alone. Reddit here, gay friends there for you too, helplines and so forth in your community. Just listened to a fantastic podcast today on Spotify about a very religious girl embracing being a lesbian. When Eve meets Eve. Don't hesitate to reach out again if needed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel it's much easier for me to talk to girls, as a girl. When I am in a relationship with men I always feel like they are enduring conversation with me, especially if it's when we're explaining each other after a fight or argument, or if we're talking about feelings/emotional stuff. They're maybe not socialised to have that kind of conversations.

Girls and women are easier to talk to about these things, in these instances, they seem to have the same emotional depth as me more often than not and are open to most topics of conversation.

It's also so much easier to talk about anything feminine, like body hair, menstruation, harassment, sexism. I often don't have to convince them these are worthy topics, while I had to convince some men (fully grown ones over 25YO, not teenagers), and most of all it's so liberating not to have to teach them all about vulvas and monthly cycles and ovaries from 0. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey. This is downright rape. So yes, talk to her about it, but most importantly take some time to understand how you feel about it. Before and after you talk to her. 

I did something not as strong but similar to this to someone, that was partly due to miscommunication (we were playing a game and I had not understood she wanted out of it so I kept going) but there were red flags that should have alerted me to the fact that I should stop.

I took it very seriously, was extremely worried about it for a long while, felt very guilty for not realising what was going on. Regardless of my initial understanding of events, what mattered was still that she felt like she had clearly stated her refusal to continue sexual acts and endured it as something I was forcing her to do. We later continued our relationship and this kind of incident didn't happen again in the year that we stayed together after that and I have not done anything similar since.

Just trying to make the argument about why it might be worth to talk to her about it and just shouting rape and leaving is not the only course of action (though a 100% valid one, given events). 

On another note, a big relationship obstacle are libido differences. As Dan Savage (google him!) says, staying with someone who has a stronger/weaker libido than you is often not a good thing, unless you can find a way to "even" that out by performing alternative sexual acts or if the thirstier one can get satisfaction on their own/outside the relationship. </TEXT>

<TEXT> hi, sorry to hear you find yourself in such a difficult situation. it's always so inconvenient when we realise things so late after making fundamental choices. 

First of all, if I understand correctly what the want the most right now is to be with a woman romantically. Do you envision this being while staying with your husband (him knowingly accepting, or not?) or do you think the two relationships couldn't happen at the same time? Once you have decided what the ideal scenario would be for you (staying with him or leaving him, while  you go on to look for a relationship with a woman), think of how likely he is to accept this or how he will react.

I am not sure you are being fair to him by staying, but that depends from who he is and who you are, how your relationship works or could work. And you can't be fair to anybody until you fully acknowledge and decide what you need and get an idea of how it could play out.

What could you do to handle his reaction to the news you want a romantical involvement with a woman? How painful would it be for him and for you? How could it work practically? How would you handle an opening of your relationship or divorce? 

Gather resources to weigh your options and make your decisions. Try to talk to someone in the poly community or to friends who were recently divorced.

Don't feel pressured to talk to him until you feel ready. We are always told we should be respectful and good to other, but the only person you live with forever is yourself, so make sure you come first. This is not a decision you are taking lightly, so you are already being considerate enough.

Then take it from there, once you have a thought about how you would like to live your romantic involvement with a woman talk to your husband and take a step in that direction. It might not be a walk in the park and life is a trial and error experiment, but you seem to have a clear destination ahead and you sound like you want this badly enough. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Breathe deeply and tell yourself you are a lovable person because I am sure you are. 

Why do you want to get a girlfriend so badly if you connect more easily to men? I know it's not something rational, as bisexual people we sometimes can feel pushed and pulled in many different directions and it's frustrating. Do I want a guy more than a girl? (I just wrote about persecutory dreams and societal expectations for me to find a man, so...). Who should I date now? 

Just try to be open, pursue the girls you like and the boys you like. Maybe go to queer community events in your area if there are any, people will be more welcoming there. 

One of my closest friends is a totally gay looking straight guy who has been in a very good relationship with a bisexual girl (who looks 100% straight) for 4 years now. So keep your hopes alive and just browse those around you. Remember the important thing is to find a good fit with who you are. </TEXT>
