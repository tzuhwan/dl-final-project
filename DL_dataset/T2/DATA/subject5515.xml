<TEXT> I believe Dooku told Greivous to never fight *any* Jedi 1 on 1, because the chances  we top great that he would lose and he was too important to the confederacy compared to any one knight or master was to the republic. This is why he runs all the time and why Kenobi and Mace Windu are always referring to him as a coward. Think about it- he never squares up for a fair fight and is always running every time you see someone confront him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes the number of us who use nothing more than basic physics in our work, much less the number of us who dont use any scientific principles *at all* is the vast majority. Lighting guys dont even use the word engineer, they say director, those who mix and make beats usually prefer producer even though it also is sorta technically inaccurate. Most of us are making what are essentially artistic decisions rather than technical ones. No other roles like ours call themselves engineers. </TEXT>

I dont know what grades she did, but in our parts you most certainly could not split up home school and public school like that. I dont even understand what the diploma process for home school is like. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hell yeah man. Day 1 is the hardest. It bears repeating. Before I stopped, I cant remember the last time I had just 1 beer in a day. That really is an accomplishment.  And for a lot of people, stepping down is the best way to go (sometimes even medically necessary). You made most of the day today with nothing. You now know firsthand what you are facing. When you are ready, your only goal that day is hit the pillow with 0% booze that day. You will say I choose not to drink today, and you will. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hell yeah. You did it. Thats all you have to do, make it to bed without a drink. Thats how I thought about it for the first few months- no matter what happens today, no matter what I might miss out on, I need to make it to bed with 0 drinks. That made for some early bedtimes, but it was the only way for me to do it and Im glad I did. I really did not miss out on much and waking up early started to be fun. I dont have to tell myself this now, as I all of a sudden didnt need to one day and I turned into a sober version of myself- like riding a bicycle. 

Today- the only thing I am going to do is not drink. Anything else comes second. Enjoy your second day sober. Before you realize it will be the second hundredth day. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This was the one hurdle that made it impossible for me to quit up until I finally did. Here is what I recommend-

Go ahead and drink as much coffee or whatever as you want. Just stay hydrated. I would drink about 2 pots of coffee a day, well into the night. Im talking like 9, 10 PM. I had no problem falling asleep, as Im sure youve found. 

Remind yourself that every day the most important thing you need to do is go to bed having not smoked. If that means going to bed early, so be it. You will only be missing out on things for a few months. Compared to the rest of your life thats nothing. 

I got put on zyban/Wellbutrin and one of he things that drug does is stimulate you a little bit. I now take a small stimulant in the afternoon as well. Dont be afraid to tell your doctor that you have this problem; since you are experiencing it for a good reason I would think they would want to help you by offering a treatment. 

The good news is that this should pass or get much less intense after a couple months or so. Keep in mind the most important thing for you to do every day is not smoke. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You probably have moments like I dont feel any better, why am I doing this? These eventually stop too. I didnt know how much better I was actually feeling until later. Thats why Id say 80% around this point. You might be taking longer than me for many different reasons. The good will sneak up on you, that I can guarantee. Before you know it, you will have morphed into this new thing. It will still feel new and weird and alien but you will know youre there or something close. Kinda like building muscles. One day you notice them and they are weird. If I had to do it over again, with zero hesitation I would choose sobriety. Today we both make that choice and its the right one to make today. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But why does it matter if Superman, Luke Skywalker, Harry Potter, or Jesus is Asian? You only think of them as white because that is how they are portrayed and its what youre used to. It doesnt disrespect their characters any unless you think being Asian is less than respectable that being white. </TEXT>

Totally not my bag, but I think they are so cool and for players who do like them, there couldnt be anything more ideal. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To piggyback here- I have actually curly hair, so take my advice with that in mind, but it is the thickest that any barber or hairdresser I've ever seen has cut, if they are all to be believed. What I would do is turn the shower off, and apply the conditioner starting from front to back, running my hands through my hair. Rub it up in your hands like you were going to make a lather so its all over your hands. I'll let it sit for a minute or two, then rinse it out by bending over forward like a bow and doing the same motion with my hands through my hair, but bringing them away from my head at the end of the hairs, all the while the shower is spraying water on it. Don't need to do this too much, you want some of the conditioner to stay in. Then the other things I would say are the most important-

Pat dry and try and let it air dry as much as possible. Don't do any other drying method unless you know what you are doing or experimenting. 

I wash my hair every 2-3 days, and even then maybe will only put product in it once or twice a week. Depending on what you have and what you want, less is often more I find. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I recently discovered deva curl one condition, it has turned me back in to conditioner. Previously I have used Kevin Murphy easy rider but thats more because I have truly curly hair and I wasnt looking for this particular look. If youre wavy I do recommend the Kevin Murphy Killer Waves.

If you have thick hair, using a modest amount of nice conditioner can work. It can't be too curly or too thin. Also, it will rarely *stay* like this- these are modeling shots after all. </TEXT>

Ten years ago, my home state of Florida was one of the cheapest to live in. Now it is one of the most expensive. I pay less in rent than people in my hometown do now and I get reliable public transportation, bicycle-friendly streets, and some semblance of arts and culture. Philadelphia is still cheaper and I like it plenty but it's a hole and it's dangerous. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're not going to damage it no matter what you do. The only thing could be string tension so tight that you can't pull the neck down flat.

You will want some sort of setup change each time you change tunings or string gauges. A lot of the time the difference is negligible. For me it is usually string heights because I like mine super low these days.

And for what it's worth- 60 is probably too big. 56 I find is more than big enough all the way down to C. Anything lower than that 60 might be called for but I found the string to be too cumbersome (have to file the nut a lot, can't be very low on fretboard). I recommend DDR DDT which are designed for lower tunings and for changing around tunings. I have yet to meet a string I like more and I've played on nothing else unless they were out of stock for 7+ years. Bass strings are supposedly garbage though.

OH! And a set with a wound G is probably a good idea as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a bag for a Peavey Mini Max that I've been using but the knobs keep getting somehow bent or pushed in and I have to carefully push them back out. I know at least one pot or the shaft has come unseated or slightly skewed and it sucks. What I'm going to do is make what is essentially a stuffed animal type thing the size of the faceplate, and put it face down in the mini max bag. 

Darkglass also sell a bag. I think it is a bit too large for my tastes. Quilter make way better bags and include them with their amps. I also put it in my gig bag a lot but you can't really fit anything else in there once it's in there. At a bare minimum I'd want two instrument cables and the one button footswitch. Let me know what you end up going with. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Cool. Does it have any drive to it at all? I imagine the Blues Jr used to be a bit overdriven when you ran into it. How usable is the EQ? Have you used it with different cabs? I bet it might not be powerful enough for a 4x12, especially at 16 ohms. Speaking of which, have you played around with impedance? I haven't noticed a big difference with my solid state amps but they are all big and loud. I'm into the idea of a pedalboard amp, but I they are mostly underpowered for my current purposes. Oh, and does the headphone or line out have a cabinet sim/impulse response? My quilter does not and I find it makes these outputs rather unusable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I always thought that when we heard "English" in ST it was some kind of Federation "basic" universal language, just translated to English for viewers. When we hear "English" out of the mouth of a brand new alien species it is the UT on the comm system or comm badges. 

So in A Matter of Honor the Klingons have been speaking this "basic" language to each other and Riker since they are allies and have signed an agreement to use this language around Federation types to support this alliance. But later on the Klingon ship they lapse back into their real language and then are surprised when they find out Riker can speak it. This type of thing (speaking "basic" then using Klingon/native language in the same scene) happens a lot in ST like you say; I'm willing to bet my explanation can cover those instances. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I always wanted to have an electronic drum kit designed by a drummer. If the snare, kick, toms, and cymbals all had to be their own instances of midi instrument, fine... It's 2019 and we have needed a real edrum set for about twenty years. I know for a fact there would be a market for standalone electronic snare with its own module if you could get all of that nuance out of it and tweak it. At $2k you still wouldn't be able to keep it in stock. </TEXT>

<TEXT> How come when I put them in my amps they break up super early and noticably and when I use 6L6, 6550, and KT88 they don't? I stand behind saying this amplifier will sound cleaner with 6550 or KT88 (if it will fit). The people all the time want to switch out the 6550s that came with US Marshall amps to EL34 bceause they break up differently. </TEXT>

I think this is where the bias of my personal experience comes in. I was raised by educators, and was taught how to think rather than what to think before I could talk.

<TEXT>  does he look like he's on a diet at all

Yes. I'm 15 years younger than him and I don't look as nearly as good.

I don't mean to be condescending, but this is all a work you know. Dude has a lot of money but he's still small time compared to anyone in pro sports, an actor, or celebrity chef even. And thanks to his podcast and tons of interviews and books, we know that this is a pretty normal guy who is into pretty regular shit. Even in kayfabe dude is very far from Flair, Ted DiBiase, or even like MJF trying to sell us on how they ball. I have to say again, those restaurants are fancy to me, but the joint I legitimately try to hit up every time I'm in Tallahassee is Whataburger so I might be skewed a little low.

The other things you mention are pretty easy to explain. Top pros that have been around for a while often rent private planes (fucking Brock owns one) because it is cheaper than flying commercial, and when you fly as much as they do going in a 737 everywhere with 100 "friends" gets on really quick. Same with the airport VIP room. It's not terrifically expensive for them and when you travel almost all year round and shit like this takes a serious edge off. I live a somewhat similar lifestyle (travel-wise, not paycheck wise) and I'll tell you the things that I miss the absolute most are four fucking walls around me with a closed door to myself for even one god damn hour and a halfway decent cup of coffee that I will want to drink all of. So it's easy for me to turn that into a quiet place to de-plane from a private jet and the steak that is the same no matter what part of the country I am in.

On the real though- this whole situation is funny and the Longhorn steakhouse part of it certainly adds greatly to the humor. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I doubt anyone recognized him or realize he came from a black car. When you're on the road for a long time, sometimes you want to go somewhere that you know what you're gonna get. Those other restaurants also seem like they would take a lot of time compared to Longhorn. Also, he might be on some weird diet (he is a 47 year old athlete after all) where he knows that there is a dish at Longhorn he can order that will be a good fit for it. Plus, I don't like eating fancy people food and if I were a millionaire I still wouldn't. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It seemed to work out just fine back then- in fact it was a period of unprecedented prosperity that has yet to be matched since. The simple fact is that as your income goes up, so does your total taxes. To be perfectly honest, It's not income tax I'm that worried about. I'd rather we go after people using tax shelters/havens/breaking the law to hide their income and avoid taxes.

<TEXT> Hello fellow traveler. What I did most recently is borrow a short scale bass and remove the neck.  The neck just barely fit in the largest suitcase size and the body just fine. In that suitcase I also had a soft case and a bunch of my bands t shirts. It worked out fine. 

This next time is a longer journey so I am going to try gate checking it which is what the guitar player in my band did on the previous journey. Its free and a porter puts it under the plane right where you can see him do it, and they give it to you as you leave the gate. These flights will be international so Im not sure how it will go but Im bringing a beater so losses will be minimal. Worst case I will have to ditch it and buy one in the country Im flying to. 

People here are gonna tell you to check your bass, but it will be considered oversize and cost $200 extra each way. So think about that before you buy a $150 flight case. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  That's not what being totalitarian means. Totalitarianism is about seeking total control over society as a whole.

It means both of those things. All totalitarian states are one party states.

 turning america into a one party state wouldn't make it fascist

What would it be then? It would no longer be a democracy, wouldn't it? And as for defining fascism, [this wikipedia page](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Definitions_of_fascism) does a pretty comprehensive job. A lot of people point to the Umberto Eco list as a good basic reference. Mussolini is not the be-all, end-all authority on what fascism is.

Still not anywhere close to fascism.

*"Disagreement Is Treason"  Fascism devalues intellectual discourse and critical reasoning as barriers to action, as well as out of fear that such analysis will expose the contradictions embodied in a syncretistic faith.*

*"Pacifism is Trafficking with the Enemy" because "Life is Permanent Warfare"  there must always be an enemy to fight. Both fascist Germany under Hitler and Italy under Mussolini worked first to organize and clean up their respective countries and then build the war machines that they later intended to and did use, despite Germany being under restrictions of the Versailles treaty to NOT build a military force. This principle leads to a fundamental contradiction within fascism: the incompatibility of ultimate triumph with perpetual war.*

While not fascist in and of itself, casting your political enemies in the same light as those that are more universally considered a national threat is a fascist tactic. You don't see American democrats doing the same to their enemies.

hitler is similar to republicans because hitler ate food and drank water, just like republicans! Every political faction in history has sought to otherwise their domestic political rivals.

With this I get now that you are arguing in bad faith. Calling your political enemies traitors and in league with true existential threats to the nation (terrorist fist-jab, anyone?) is a classic tactic among fascists and totalitarians. If you can show my anyone in a liberal democracy doing something like this I will yield the point. They must be actual political leaders, not some yahoo on the internet or a fringe member of the political movement. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The first sentence in this article reads

I've lived in the US for my entire life and I'm honestly not sure if I've ever even seen an American centered map in real life before. As far as I can tell, it basically only exists on the internet for people to rightfully mock.

I was in a US public school from 1990-2003, and I saw many cold war era holdovers in our materials, but never something like this. Now, there is a person responding to that article who attended *private* schools that says she saw this, but does not see it in the public school she now works in. 

I'm not saying that this kind of map doesn't exist, but I have seen zero evidence of it being used in a US public school, much less it having widespread use among American schools. Did all the schools just "switch back" recently? Up through my senior year of high school we were still playing around with maps that had the Soviet Union, Zaire, east and west Pakistan, etc. I find it hard to beleive this would come and go so quickly, given how expensive classroom materials are. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Are you saying that if you played a pitch that was C5 in A=440 equal temperament, I (or someone with good pitch memory or whatever) would be able to identify it as such? Because I agree with that. I've had to do that as part of an exam before.

Here is a hopefully more clear statement of my argument, or maybe I am replying to two different people and I am too stupid to figure out who I am talking to.

1. Every note in the equal tempered system we use today is the same distance from the one above it and below it- one semitone.
2. The distance between any A and the C right above it is two and a half steps- 150 cents- no matter what octave.
3. The distance between any C and Eis then also two and a half steps, 150 cents
4. This follows for all modes and indeed any set in ET.
5. Therefore the ratio of frequencies between the A and the C and the C and the Eare the same.
6. No matter what key you are in the harmony comes out the same way- same ratios between pitches relative to a key (and indeed all keys).

Now let's compare this to a different tuning system like a just intonation system.

1. The notes in this system are not the same distance apart. A home key or starting point is picked (let's call it C) and the other pitches are described by adding pure fifths to the starting C.
2. The farther you get from the home key, the more out of tune things are going to get (by which I mean the ratio in Hz between two given notes of the same interval in different classes). Especially when compared to the "perfect" sounding starting key.
3. The distance between an A an a C in octave 4 are different than the A and the C in octave 5 (if you let the octave drift).
4. The distance between any C and E is different from any of the the A and Cs and also different from the other Cs and Es in different octaves.
5. All modes and all scales in a given key for this temperament are compose of sets that have different distances between the pitches.
6. These differences between keys give them a quality, like a major or minor chord. The C major home key is full of nice small ratios while a key like C# does not have many pure intervals.

If I have perfect pitch, I can tell you that a recording is playing back at the wrong pitch or speed or something. Yes different frequencies literally sound different from one another. I could prove to you that keys are indistinguishable by recording a piece on piano in the key of C then recording in in C# and pitch shifting it down to C. Unless the recording is of very high quality and you know what to listen for, I bet you couldn't pick one over the other correctly more than half the time. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  if we were to take the visual spectrum of color, and move all our color names one to the left, such that violet wrapped around to refer to red, red is yellow, yellow is green, etc. If we go through all our paintings and swap those colors accordingly, nothing will change right?

I reject your comparison. If we went through all our music and shifted it up a half step, there is nothing inherently different about it other than that it is in a different key. The only differences lie in perception at the lower and and higher end of the freq spectrum. It can't be too low otherwise we can't discern the harmony, same for it being too high. The name assignments are arbitrary, other than all classes are multiples. In strict ET their relationship to other named pitches are the same. *That* is what *I'm* saying. You can't make the well tempered clavier out of this because in that temperament the relationships of the pitches to their given tonic is different for every key. That is where the OP is nonsense. They can play pretend all they want about it and that's fine but it is not reality. I read my horoscope but I know it is bullshit. 

your scale will sound different depending on your starting point because of your ability to perceive absolute frequency 

Sure, but the only thing that is different is the fact that it started somewhere different than whatever we are comparing it to. Without that context there is nothing inherent about one starting point or another. Within an octave, it is truly meaningless. I hope you can see that.

If I pitch shifted Beethoven's Choral symphony up or down one step, none of these key centers has any impression or inherent quality that makes it different from the other. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You recall D because you've heard and played it tons of times and called that. It really is that simple. Someone from India, southeast Asia, Georgia, Malawi, or Renaissance Europe might not have had the same musical upbringing, so they may think of pitch relationships differently than you do. There is no essential quality to the D other than the frequency it vibrates at. In the time of Bach he would have not thought of it as a D when he heard it, because pitch definitions varied from town to town. If you sang a note that was the same as a D on his organ, he might recognize it that way but there was no "D"-ness to it that made him think that.

Higher is usually always brighter to people. It's one of the reason we tune to A 440- orchestras kept tuning higher and higher to get a brighter sound. Some orchestras tune higher than 440. My college tuned all its pianos to 441. This frustrated me to no end. All you are doing is making everyone have to re-tune for the sake of this "brightness." A measly four cents. It only sounds brighter because it is sharper than everything else! It is kind of like the loudness war in audio mastering. It is certainly a singer or pianist who is thinking to tune them like this, not someone who has a nice old instrument that has been played in tune for decades and does not like small adjustments to make it out of tune at the whims of a power-drunk piano tuner or assistant department head.

I think you have a fundamental misunderstanding of what we're talking about. I'll put it another way- if we wrote, read, and spoke english, but every letter was pushed down one in the alphabet, that is to say instead of typing an A we would type B, instead of B we would type C, etc. back round to instead of Z we type A, the words in our language would not lose their meaning or essential nature. It's the same with pitch classes in equal temperament. The relationship between each pitch class is the same, so all function is the same.

When I say an orchestra is using equal temperament, I mean the tonic for each key is the one defined by the A 440 system. We may vary the related pitches in whatever harmony/mode we are using (higher leading tones, your just thirds, etc) but those home pitches are from ET. In something like meantone or Pythagorean temperaments the key of C and key of F# are wildly different sounding, because the intervals themselves within the keys are different. Your high leading tone in C major is now way way too high for the fourth scale degree of F# major. But in ET, we can adjust based on what we have defined as tonic. That B can slide back down to perfect compared to the F# we are using, and our E# can come up when we are using it as a leading tone. These alterations are done *to taste* are all based on the ET system as a reference.

On your guitar, what would you consider the "proper" major third to be? I bet it changes depending on what chord you are playing or what key you are in. Playing an open E chord you probably want it higher, an open G chord you probably want it lower (a Pythagorean 4th and nice wide 6th respectively). I tune the G and D strings of my violin a little sharp and the E string a little flat so I have pure fifths all the way around. However, I usually can't get my G up high enough to where it sounds right  to me in an ensemble because I will need the open G to be in tune with others and it's the only pitch I can't play stopped. Thus, any double stops of a fifth between the G and that D are a little skewed, while between the other strings it's straight across.

I hope this makes a little more sense. i don't think you are quite understanding what my criticism is. Basically, it boils down to all keys having identical relationships between their tonic and the other pitches in their set when using ET. Everyone uses a form of ET except for ensembles including period keyboard and fretted instruments. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah it's a shame because there is *some* validity to this depending on your instrument. What's more interesting to me is how certain ensembles (like choir or string quartet) tune individual harmonies within one piece of music. Musicians of some skill will do this unknowingly a lot of the time, and truly great masters can decide just how they are going to tune each pitch. Then you can get into what keys sound better in what rooms and all that. But this horoscope stuff is just as cool I guess *shrug emoji* </TEXT>

<TEXT>  How do we distinguish pitch classes in the mind

Years and years of listening and playing in pitch collections associated with our culture. I knew what a "D" was when i was 8 years old, but an 8 year old Hmong child might not have the proper context for something like that.

Edit: What instrument(s) do you play?

Why did Shostakovich want to write a Prelude and Fugue for each of the 24 major and minor keys? Just shits and giggles? 

Pretty much.

Equal temp works in orchestra on almost every note. Any time you do a key change from C to C# you are going to use the equal tempered pitches. I do understand what you and the OP are saying, and I have had feelings like that before, but by and large since the non-equal tuning systems you and I use are mutable and still defined by equal temp, they are essentially invalid. </TEXT>

Why couldnt they just not lower the taxes on the wealthiest 1% the littlest tiniest bit to offset this tax increase for those at a this moderate income level? I cant think of one good reason other than they serve the interests of those wealthy 1%. 

If your healthcare premiums or costs have gone down you are in the extreme minority in this country. For most of us, the costs are obscenely unaffordable, and they really shouldnt be for citizens of the wealthiest country in recorded history, especially when the people who live comparable nations never have this worry. I dont know who you get your insurance from but I have never heard of increasing coverage for anyone in the past five years, let alone increasing coverage at a lower premium. Be thankful for the unicorn that your insurance policy is. 

As a business owner, you have a different economic arena than us wage earners. Real wages have been flat in this country since before I was born. My parents were professionals with masters degrees and other accreditations and they still didnt pop 100k combined when they retired less than ten years ago. They were able to afford those degrees and a house in the 70s and 80s, but most people can no longer afford an education like this and remain wage earners rather than become professionals. The economy might look good right  to you or an analyst but for those of us making less than 100k a year things are very far from the way they used to be 20 years ago. For those of us under 50k we pretty much have to have two jobs in order to save money or pay on any kind of debt. 

Im sorry if this isnt the type of response youre looking for; Im not the best at the point-by-point debate thing people like to do on Reddit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I hate to take this route as its kind of unfair to answer a question with a question, but what policies, aside from immigration-related issues, has the Republican Party or the president enacted or endorsed that benefit you, your family, or this country? It seems to me that a lot of people make up their political minds with what *seems* true to them, or because they *feel* a certain way. Im not saying there is necessarily anything wrong with that but it isnt a reasoned stance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some would sound not good probably. A proper bass fuzz would have some kind of dry blend or dry output. A lot of the time, they'll try and take the DI before your pedals if they can. A lot of people have a DI on their pedalboards, right after their tuner output. I personally try to take things post eq and forgo using a mic at all. A lot of "heavy" bands prefer a mic but if they have a head with a decent sounding line out I'll use that and a DI box right before the input and they can pretend the foh mix is getting that sweet mic'd cab sound and never know otherwise. For most of the music I mix, the DI sound is only there to reinforce sub frequencies and/or presence, and the overall sound is very dependent on amp tone. </TEXT>

The problem with Apu is that he is voiced by a white guy doing caricatured voice. It's Al Jolson territory. No one ever complained about the character itself, including who they are talking about in that thread (Kumail Nanjiani I think?). Part of his bit on Apu was that it was a white guy stealing an Indian role from a brown guy and inspiring him to continue this punjab-face caricature that marginalized people that looked and sounded like him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They have a pitch I assure you. All you gotta do is take a powerful eq and move a real thin bandpass around in that region (40-120) and you'll probably find it. Now, is it a diatonic pitch? Maybe not. But there is a fundamental that has harmonics. The better the tuning job, the easier it will be to find. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Did he tell you why he was giving them to you? Usually doctors tell you why they are giving you a treatment. It should also say on the script itself, and the paperwork they give you with the drug at the pharmacy. PTSD and depression often bring anxiety with them. I know that propranolol is also used as an adjunct for PTSD and depression meds. That's why I was taking it. It worked fine for what I needed it to do and I moved on to something else after a few months. It is a little troubling you don't know why you are getting this drug. They should make you consult with the pharmacist when you fill the script for the first time. They will ask/tell you why you are taking them. I imagine you are going to do a 10/20/40 dose. When is your followup? </TEXT>

It's the bass that's out of tune on this next one. However, the people making this music are heavily influenced by traditions that use tuning systems and modes outside equal tempered, diatonic western music.

<TEXT> I would love to see an episode of DS9 set in Deadwood a la "Far Beyond the Stars" and a Star Trek setting of a Deadwood episode. What race would everyone be? Al is far too aggressive to be a Ferengi in my opinion. Probably a Cardassian. The Doc, a Denobulan like the doc on Enterprise? Or maybe a Tallaxian... I think Wild BillCharlie Utter would be a good Trill. The Jem Hadar would be the Pinkertons (I always wanted Sisko to say "I *hate* fucking Jem Hadar). Cy and Joanie always struck me as Romulans. Natives could be Klingons or Kazon... I think I would pick Kazon because they come off a little less one-dimensional than Klingons do. Bullock would *totally* be a Vulcan. Same with Sol probably. Maybe Sol's an android. All I can think of for Alma is Betazoid, it's probably the hair. Jane always struck me as having a sort of Odo-like role in the camp, but from another extreme. Maybe she could be a drunken Betazoid. Or Klingon?? </TEXT>

I don't think you're going to find many democrats who are against a border fence. However, a big scary wall is a waste of money, not very effective, and will take decades to complete. Why not nationalize our healthcare system instead with that money? It will take way less time.

Entering the country illegally or overstaying a visa used to not be a crime up until very very recently It was a civil offence and had a civil penalty (deportation and banishment for a period of time).

FYI, the majority of the people being held at the border in the current crisis are here legally, or at least would be here legally if CBP would process them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Janeway is kinda my favorite by default since none of the others really my bag personally. Janeway's thing is that she earnestly tries to make something out of nothing and gives a lot of second chances. The others do this on occasion as well, but those traits are pretty strongly hers. Her treatment of Neelix is a good example of these two things. I also like that once you cross the line with her, expect nothing but wrath.  Sisko is like this as well, but they both execute differently. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I always felt bad for him when you learn his backstory in half blood prince. I thought that's what Jo was trying to do with that book- subvert our assumptions about some of the key characters (Tom, Snape, Dumbledore, maybe Harry) and that things like good and evil are more a "point of view" to quote another legendary dark wizard. Any sympathy generated for Tom Riddle in that book eventually turned into pity for me, and I assume that's what the King's Cross scene in DH is supposed to engender. </TEXT>

Where are they coming undone? Has this happened for the entire past 18 years? 

Most importantly I would say to wipe them down every time you are done playing, and I'm talking bone dry- get up under them with a microfiber or something. There are also cleaners- spray some on there and ensure any dirt is getting removed and will keep corrosion from starting.

Second most important is to keep your axe closed in its case, every second it isn't being played. In my experience what ruins strings is oxidation and not so much dirt or physical wear.

~~Lastly, I would recommend getting more expensive strings, especially any kind that purport to last longer or be made by master German craftsmen or something like that. Cheap strings fall apart. And by "more expensive" I mean maybe spend like $50 for a set. Dominant is what almost everyone used in my childhood and adolescence. They are expensive these days but people considered them a good value because they would put up with sweaty kids sawing on them all the time.~~ I don't know if there is a specific material that is more hardy, but if the actual wind is coming undone I would say is probably poor manufacturing and not the wind material itself. **Sorry, I assumed you were a more novice player and I didn't see you've been playing for 18 years**. I assume you are using something halfway decent. Maybe switch up brands? Good luck. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Word. Well you should check out the darkglass amps for sure. I got the 900 watt microtubes one and it rips- I don't miss having a tube amp and distortion pedals at all. The clean channel will be perfect for jazz, it's very warm and sounds like your bass, kinda like an eden. the distortion channel is unbelievable. And I only use one "flavor" of the two distortion profiles it has. It will doom with the best of them (I play through a 2x15). There is a 500 watt version which might be more affordable, or you can probably score a version 1 of the 900 watt one for about the same price. It was the most money I ever spent on an amp but man did it cure the "not loud enough" problem and sounds as good or better than my traynor. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a lot to say about this, and I feel particularly well suited to answer your question (my hardcore band just put out an LP that is almost entirely written in the octatonic scale so I think I know some of the stuffy academic theory behind punk music) but in the spirit of my comment, I will not say too much. What makes something punk is utilizing simplicity and embracing form (or lack therof). Musically, I liken it to haiku or abstract expressionism or something like that. 

A large part of perceived "punkness" will be the delivery- as passionately, violently, and heavily as possible (or the exact opposite of this). It has been over 40 years since the Ramones' first record came out. If the performer says it is punk music and/or the audience says it is, it is.

Finally, like it's cousin hip hop, punk is necessarily derivative. The music can be new, fresh, etc, but it is always a reimagining of something else. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ive been playing for a long time, with many amps, with many crazy eqs. My style of playing I just want to know what mids I want to cut (muddy low mids usually) and what mids I want to boost (upper mids usually for a more guitar amp like tone. Exactly where the good spots are depends on the room and the cab. A lot of simpler bass amps have one or two static mid knobs. Ill try each one boost/cut and see it works or not. Most of the time Im not moving knobs around that much. The low and high are just general adjustments that usually my band mates ask for- more impact or less boom? Move the low knob. Not enough note definition/too much presence? Move the high knob. Certain styles have certain specific tones (dub/reggae come to mind) but even then there isnt much to getting that kind of sound.  

Now, when it comes to dirt pedals, weve got even more decisions than guitar players. That is for another thread though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Im going to make an alternative comment and tell you that amps are designed to sound about their best for most people with all the knobs at noon, 50% whatever. Ask yourself, what am I NOT getting out of this tone? Then adjust accordingly. I know thats simple but I think a lot of people, especially beginners, over think their tone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It looks like a common rat mod, an octave fuzz, and a boost all in one pedal. If you got a rat with that mod (fuzzrocious cat tail is the one I think most people are copying) an octave fuzz like the shin-ei or superfuzz I think you've got it. I'm pretty sure fuzzrocious sells a cat tail with a boost. Fuzzrat seems like a classic combo. I am not a fuzz guy and I've never been able to make a rat work for me so I don't know too much more. I bet the fuzzrocious dude already has a combo box that has those two circuits like that already OR he would make you one. Probably would come out around the same price as this thing AND he would come up with some funny sunn o)) pun to name it and custom paint it.

The trick with that rat/cat mod is the different clipping diodes available. I liked LED and "no diode" the best out of the usual choices. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What if the person transitioned before puberty, during puberty, or soon after? There are transwomen out there right now you would not be able to tell from ciswomen in some kind of athletic competition. There are also ciswomen who have taken male hormones to improve their performance. If they can test for that kind of doping, they can test for it in a transwoman I would think.

However, your alarmist attitude with "under threat" and all that is really off-putting. There is definitely room for discussion but if you're trying to look **not** transphobic that sort of alarmist language and attitude will do you no favors. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Holy shit 96 is so late. I feel like I have little in common with anyone born after 92 or so. That may be more due to a general age difference, though since the difference between 33 and 23 is so stark in US society. In ten years I might not feel that way. I'm also curious as to where 94, 95, 96 put themselves in *five* years, since I think it's hard for those folks to identify with the newest generation who have not had much time to define themselves (or be defined) yet.

In the past three years or so I started to NOT get every joke I saw on the internet, or understand some things culturally. For example, I don't know what Drake   Josh even is. There are these jokes about this show and I don't get them. I imagine the show is quite different from the adventures of Pete and Pete. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My personal rubric is if on September 11, 2001 you were 

1. in school or school-aged(undergrad college I count as school) and
1. able to understand what was going on on that day, in reference to the terror attacks. What was happening, who (vaguely) was doing it, and why (also vaguely).

I would call the undergrad cutoff to be 21-22 years, maybe a touch more, and the age I would say most kids would be able to understand something like that is 10 or so.

My reasoning is that the generation would need to know what life was like before 9/11, but not experience that life as adults. Some people will say

Millenial born 1980-2000

Gen X born 1960-1980

Boomer 1945-1960

Silent/Lucky 1925-1945

Greatest 1900-1925

or thereabouts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I always found this to be similar to the whole "Vulcans have no emotions" thing. Meanwhile we see from their behavior that they among some of the most emotional beings on the show- pride, arrogance, sarcasm, curiosity, mistrust, xenophobia, and even a sense of humor. McCoy vocalizes his contempt for this paradox on more than one occasion. By being told this being can't do these human things, we look that much harder for their humanity. I always interpreted this concept to be very Roddenbery-esque. </TEXT>

Many afternoons I wonder why my battery is less than 50% and it's because bluetooth has been on all day doing nothing besides draining my battery.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been listening to every version of this piece on Spotify and I'm starting to hear the differences. In my conductor's fantasy imagination I would put together all the parts that I like from each version and edit it for an orchestra to play. I'm just curious where all the true differences are. This is a piece where a lot of artistic license is taken and I think a lot of the recordings are not representative of any one version. So far I have found:

1913

This has to be pieced together by scholars and there is no published version.

1921

The "Soviet" edition that is not bound by copyright in the west, and thus is the source for many performances and recordings.

1947

This version seems to be the basis for a majority of the recordings (on Spotify at least)

1967

The final "definitive" version of Stravinsky's autograph. 

Orchestrations and articulations seem to be all over the place based on the dozen or so recordings I've heard. In some places chords are spelled totally different, and in others it seems like whole beats are missing. My study score is a Dover Miniature which if I had to guess would be a copy of the 1921 based on the notes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have an old fashioned 3 way Gibson style toggle switch. I used to own a guitar that had 2 hb, 1v, 1t and the middle position was just one coil of each humbucker. From what I can tell, you need a dp switch to do this, and not the old fashioned 5 terminal toggle switch. Another 2hb guitar the middle position was also one coil of each pickup. Up until recently that's how I thought *all* Gibsons were wired. Is there a way to wire my guitar like that with this switch? I have 2hb, 2v, 2t Thanks. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [QUESTION] How do I wire this guitar with Lace Dually humbuckers so I can tap both pickups? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2018-07-23 19:25:15 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi,

I have a project guitar that is going to have two Lace dually pickups in them. They are basically humbuckers that combine two of their famous sensor pickups (the ones with the colors). The neck will be two hot golds, and the bridge will be a red and a blue. Lace has a wiring diagram on how to do *one* of their pickups like this: http://www.lacemusic.com/pdf/9.pdf

I imagine it's possible to have a single switch that does this to both pickups simultaneously. Is it as simple as wiring that other pickup to the on/off/on switch? It's a strat-style, with three knobs and a 3 position lever switch on it. I'm down to leave the knobs as vol/tone/tone like a regular strat and drill a hole for the on/off/on switch. 

What I'd *really* like is to replace the 3 position switch with a 5 position, and have it do both bridge/red/blue/hb neck/single neck, but I am not sure if that is possible without extra switches.

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Who approved of Obi-Wan taking Anakin as his Padawan? The two most powerful Jedi seem to be very against it from the start. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2018-06-19 05:53:52 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> At the end of Episode I Yoda is saying quite emphatically to Obi Wan that he does not approve of training the boy, but that the council agrees to let Obi Wan take him. It would seem to me that the council would need a unanimous vote for something as serious as this. Not only was he too old, Yoda (and probably others) can sense much fear in him and grave danger in continuing his training as a Jedi. 

I'm sure there was much discussion, but with Yoda and Mace Windu against training him, who could be for it? What arguments did they give to justify taking him into the order? I imagine it would have to be a 10-2 vote, because anything closer than that you'd think they'd either take more time or take the cautious route and forbid him from the order. Obi Wan says that he will train the boy either way, so I suppose it would mean expelling him from the order.

The only argument I can think of is that under the watchful eye of the Jedi, he would be less likely to turn. The fact that Obi Wan turns a blind eye to Anakin forming attachments is an interesting development in this context. Obi Wan committed a grave sin as well- he was attached to Anakin. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Why does Motti call Gen.Tagge commander and refer to his starfleet? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2018-01-02 23:11:46 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I feel like this question has to have been asked before, but I found nothing here or on AskScienceFiction.

I haven't found a canon answer, and only weak fanon answers. My guess is that one of Tagge's titles is "Commander of..." or some such. He's never referred to as General in the films, but the Tarkin book pretty much solidifies the fact that he is a general. It would make more sense if Tagge and Motti's titles were reversed- if you imagine Tagge as the admiral and Motti as the general, their discussion is easier to understand. The general sees no more use for the navy now that the Death Star is around- he does not have to rely on air support to help his troops pacify worlds- fear of the station itself will do so. For this reason, I don't understand why EU writers, legends and canon, would call him a general again.

As for the starfleet explanation, the other thing I've seen is that a General may be in charge of ships that deploy his troops. I think it's possible Motti is referring to the imperial military in general when he says starfleet. 

Does anyone have an alternative explanation? This is one of the biggest holes in SW in my opinion. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Are there *complete* soundtracks to any movies other than Episodes IV and V? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-10-02 16:28:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Last time I looked was like 15 years ago. There were *complete* soundtracks to IV and V, but VI was like a "greatest hits" and out of order, so was I. I've owned IV since it came out in the 90s, and it's a proper presentation, like a classical release. It has a substantial bit of documentation, 100% of the music, in order, and a few bonus takes and an alternate cue that was never used. It may have also been re-mastered. Plus it's bound like a book and is not in a shitty plastic CD case. I was listening on Spotify and noticed only the greatest hits editions existed, and a search of this sub says that Sony retained the rights to the proper ones, so only the crappy ones are available. Seems pretty silly Lucasfilm doesn't have rights to the music that's in its own films. Are there complete editions of anything other than IV and V? If not it's a real shame. The music for these films, (along with Howard Shore's *The Lord of the Rings*) is the greatest achievement in film music in the last 60-ish years (maybe ever), and I think it's absolutely criminal there are not complete editions for serious listeners.


Does anyone know if there are real soundtracks for the rest of the films? Do they exist digitally? I'd be very down to drop a 150 bucks or whatever right this second to complete my collection in CDs, and I would be even more stoked if I could just put them on my phone without having to hunt down a CD drive to rip them </TEXT>

<TITLE> My "Grand Unifying Theory" of the paranormal and monsters among us </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-10-07 03:30:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This episode made me think of this idea I've had, so I drafted an email to send to the show, but I can't find an email address for the show so I figured I would post it here and maybe it would get to the guys or not. Either way, I would like to hear other people's thoughts about it.

Hi Scott and Forrest,
I was listening to your latest episode and it made me think about my own Grand Unifying Theory of the paranormal that I have had for the past several years.

My theory is that all paranormal events are some sort of special type of hallucination that we human beings are all capable of. I think this is the most robust explanation for the majority of these sorts of phenomena. It would explain why paranormal reports have odd features like creatures/portals being 2 dimensional, UFOs making no sound, bigfoot floating and making no sound, etc. I think it is also telling that the types of phenomena that people report conform to their own personal beliefs or cultures- People who are more spiritual are the ones who report ghosts, skin walkers show up for people with native american heritages or interest in those cultures, UFOs show up for more skeptical people (UFOs seem to have the most non-spiritual justifications for existing). Something along the lines of if you go looking for something you will find it. This would also explain why you cant catch this stuff on video.

The only weak part of my theory are events with multiple witnesses. My explanation here is a little woo woo but it goes something like this: These sorts of hallucination events can be shared by people nearby each other; and I think the more familiar the two people are with each other (like friends or family members) the more likely they are to see the same thing. Think about any of the reports for paranormal happenings that have multiple witnesses. How often are those witnesses complete strangers? More than likely they are family members. I think it works the same way mass hysteria does. There is some animal form of seemingly telepathic communication we as human beings share. I believe its some sort of warning system from our ancestors to alert the family group of danger, just gone haywire; what with eons of language and toolmaking and all that. This would be why the more part of the tribe two or more people are, the more likely they are to have experiences like this that are shared.

Another feature I should mention is that many of these reports lack direct engagement with the phenomenon. The sighting is either brief, peripheral, and lacking of any serious action other than simple movement. I think this further confirms my theory. Reports that go beyond this are often hard to believe (like being captured by bigfoots) and most certainly lack co-oberation. 

I have loved the paranormal since I was a child, but I have been an extreme skeptic my entire life as well. Your podcast this week had many features that made me think of my theory and I thought I would share it with you. I will say that I definitely saw a UFO before I formed my theory, and that my sighting was brief, but not so brief that I wasnt 100% sure that what I was looking at wasnt a flying saucer and not something else. I think it is a fun exercise to think of this theory any time you hear a paranormal report. I know I usually do. 

Thanks for the great show; its the only podcast I listen to every episode of.

<TITLE> Should I sell the ~$500 I have in stocks and throw it at my ~$7k in debt </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-08-29 16:54:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've had a few shares of Disney stock since I was a little boy (1990) and it has done really really well since then. At this point though, should I just cash out and use it to pay down my debt? I owe $2k on 20% APR credit card, another $900 on a zero interest card (I'll be able to pay it off before the introductory period expires), and $4800 on a loan with a 13% interest rate and 18% APR. At first I thought cashing out was a good idea, but I don't think paying $500 now will save me that much in the long run. I also have around $3500 in a 401k, but I have been putting my max employer match into it every paycheck, so I think I should leave that the way it is since it's free money. I expect to clear all of that debt within the next three years. Should I just hold on to the stock? Should I put it in with my 401k? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Trek has always had great music. Even the dated-sounding music from TOS and the first few seasons of TNG have true artistry and craft applied to them (and I happen to like those specific styles). All that "audition" video told us was this series is going to have the same uninspired, cookie-cutter, hollywood action movie tripe that is everywhere and in everything (and especially every trailer) for the past decade or so.

<TITLE> Which powered speakers for basement shows? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-07-16 22:32:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi.

I do a lot of DIY shows, and the PA I've been using for that is near the end of its life. I want an active system that will be at home in super loud, small basements, living rooms, and cramped practice spaces. It's exclusively for vocals to be heard over bands that are too loud. My budget is $800 MAP (I'll try and get used if I can).

The obvious choice is the ZLX12P, but I'm also considering the SRM350v3. They spec out about the same, but the SRM is lighter. I've had experience with the ZLX series, but I've only heard the larger SRMs, and even then only as a DJ speaker (most likely was the v2 series).

I feel like I should go with the Mackie, but I'm hesitant because comparing the two brands side by side isn't fair- all the Mackie gear I've ever come across is clearly budget gear, wheras EV stuff seems like it's built a lot better. ZLXs seem to compress and limit sooner than a lot of other speakers, and kinda turn to mush at loud volumes. The Mackies will probably not sound as "good" but with a 10" woofer I feel like they are better suited for the task. The Mackies have a built in 4 band feedback killer as well, which is really nice considering the environment they're going to go in. What do you guys think? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Should I keep up with DE shaving? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been shaving with a DE for six months now, and I'm almost out of soap and blades. I'm wondering if it's worth it for me to keep it up- I don't really see any advantages over using disposable razors and regular shaving cream, other than the price. Even then, it's not that much more expensive to use the cheap bic two blade razors, which work just fine. 

Am I missing something? Do I need to stick it out and keep trying? DE shaving has only made it more difficult for me to get a good shave, made me more prone to cuts, done nothing positive for my skin, and makes my shower/shave time take four times longer. I can imagine that DE shaving isn't for everyone, but I *want* it to be for me, and I don't know what I am doing wrong. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Why Should I vote for Donald Trump? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-02-26 22:52:31 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I think this should be on your guys' sidebar. It looks like Trump has only taken an official position on 5 issues. The issues that concern me the most are the economy, addressing climate change, and instituting a single payer universal health care system in our country. I am also against the increasing grip that corporations and the very rich have on this country.

I saw a quote somewhere that said Trump supports single payer, which honestly shocked me. It would seem that most people on reddit are anti-Trump, so I wanted to see why you guys support him and why you think others should as well. 

As for his policies-


* Immigration- I don't care. I do not think we need any reforms here and I certainly think the "Mexico wall" is a waste of money and resources that could be better spent elsewhere

* VA- I agree here; I think we should have a healthcare system like this for every citizen.

* China- I'm half way on this one. I'm for most of this except for lowering the corporate tax rate, and deploying our military.

* Taxes- I am against this sort of "flat" taxing. I believe in a steeper, more regressive income tax, with no way for the wealthy or corporations to get out of paying. I am pro-"death tax". I would gladly pay more in taxes for a "medicare for all" system.

* Guns- I couldn't care any less. I think if you want guns get guns. I would rather see a national free mental health program for all residents than any kind of firearms reform.

I don't see Trump directly addressing our economic issues, climate change, healthcare, or money in politics; at least not officially. Why should I vote Trump? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would have saved this for the Sober Saturday thread, but I have been kinda freaking out at work today.

I WON'T do that because that sucks, it's unhealthy, and I want to break the cycle of abuse. I think that's a good enough reason, even though I just want to turn my brain off. </TEXT>

* Next string change, wrapping the top three strings the other way around the tailpiece.

<TEXT> I'm having a bit of an issue with what to do with the city connection they give you in this game. It would seem to make sense that you should have one-way roads connecting the entrance/exit to your city, but since the two roads are 2 tiles apart, this leads to many needless intersections and traffic problems. This has been impacting my enjoyment of this game a bit. In fact, all the connections to highways seem difficult for me to make.  There are a few pieces people have made in the steam workshop that I use for these connections, and those seem to work well, but the "open" is a thing I'm having a serious difficulty with. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [Original Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/applehelp/comments/2bmklb/liquid_damaged_macbook_pro_apple_said_they_cant/)

Strange situation at the Apple store when I went to pick it up. I asked the genius who handed my computer over for more details, long story short the only note on my ticket was "foul smell of urine coming from machine." I asked the genius if this might be a reason for them not working on it, he said it was a possibility, and I understood. I was frustrated because when I dropped the computer off I noted to the genius writing my ticket that it was beer that I spilled on the keyboard, but she just wrote "liquid." I can understand why someone might think that spilled beer smells like urine, and refuse to work on such a machine.

I took it to a place called U BREAK I FIX and they did a cleaning for free, but they said their diagnostic was inconclusive and it just boot-looped (I told them that's what it does, I don't know why they couldn't run a diagnostic to find the problem, but whatever). Gazelle will only give me $100 for it. What do you guys think it's worth on eBay in an "as-is" sale? It's a 2013 MBP 2.9 i7 750GB HD with 8 GB ram. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I recently spilled a little bit of liquid on my Macbook pro. I took it to the Apple store for service, and now they're telling me according to their diagnostic that they can not repair it and are going to send it back to me. I guess the motherboard is fried. Do I have any options as far as third-party repairs or refurbishment? I feel like some minor liquid damage would be repairable in most instances. It's such a huge bummer because the computer is less than a year old. They quoted me $755 to fix it, I sure hope they don't want that amount from me just to tell me they can't fix it. Has anyone else ever dealt with a situation like this? Any help is appreciated. </TEXT>

It sounds tons better but now position 4 (bridge and middle) is complete garbage. I really like the classic "quack" sound of the 2 and 4 positions and the areas excelled in producing this. I think the solution would be to wire the bridge pickup in such a way that only one blade of the L45 is active in the 4 position. Is there a way to do this or am I still cursed with only having 4 of my 5 pickup positions useable? Bill lawrence also sells a "q-filter" and i'm curious as to what it does. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have an old sim city 4 for mac cd and I was looking into playing it again, because sc5 has become pretty boring for me. I have a few questions:

Is there a way to play this game straight off of my laptop without having to have the cd in the computer? From what I remember I always had to insert the disc to play.

What mod kits should I apply? Is there a basic "pack" that everyone starts with, or will I have to do more research into what works for mac and what I need? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just got the game last month, and in the last week I have been playing 1v1 vs the AI. I can beat the AI on hard almost every time, but lose vs harder.

I played a few 1v1 matches unranked and got shredded every time. I have watched tons of videos and read every article there is for beginner players. I have been practicing [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExjpGpyDNwI) build, mostly because he has an audio guide that I can practice in custom games to.

What I need help with is multitasking and apm. It's very hard for me to manage even a basic early base or two at the speed required in 1v1 play. I practice the above build all the time but usually falter sometime after I build my third barracks. I was practicing at a slower speed with the build order written down but I found it to be counterproductive. I don't seem to be making much progress in the above build- I complete it all the way through about 1 out of 5 times. Needless to say this is very frustrating.

Are there any resources like mp3 files or other videos to play while I practice? I have a feeling that 15 gas might not be the best build for a newb. What I would really like is a custom map that has cues at what time to do what thing. Does anything like that exist? My goal isn't even to win against a human opponent, just put up a decent fight. I don't think I'm ever going to get there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Device: mid 2012 Macbook Pro. 2.9 ghz i7 8gb ram

I just came back into town after being gone for a couple of months, and I'm noticing a strange behavior with my wifi. I'll be browsing and after about a minute everything refuses to load or loads very slowly. If I click on the wifi icon in the menu bar the menu that pops up says "Looking for networks" for a few seconds then finds my network and confirms I'm connected. As soon as this happens, pages and images start loading at their normal speed again. 
What gives? 
I don't know if anyone else knows about this trick, but I used to do it every so often with my old 2008 mac book from time to time as well, but I never had to do it this often.

Note: I am the only device connected to the network currently, all of my roomates are out today. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Long-term psychoses </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-12-18 17:38:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> "Cravings" are discussed on here quite a bit, and it seems that there is a lot of literature devoted to overcoming this sort of feeling. As a person who is on their 15th quit attempt, I find these brief "cravings" quite easy to overcome. What my concern is (and where I always fail) are the paranoid, depressed, nervous, psychoses that occur a week or two after cessation and continue for who knows how long. These sorts of feelings last all day or for multiple days.

At more than a week and less than a month (usually) I run into these paranoid episodes; where I am basically having an anxiety attack all day. All of my "craving" suppression activities (exercise, gum, fruit juice, deep breathing) do not affect this feeling. The only thing that seems to cure these is a night's sleep. 

The other issue I have usually occurs after the one month point, and may be unique to me because I used to take medication for it. I feel depressed. All day, every day, forever. I don't wan't to do anything at all. Get out of bed, anything. I haven't gotten this far in a while, but I know it's coming. The last time I quit for more than a week, I ran into this depression, and found it incurable.

Until this year I had given up on quitting for about four years. I am giving my fourth quit attempt this year an earnest try, but confident is certainly not a word I would use to describe how I feel. Is there anyone who can provide some useful insight or counsel about these issues? If I don't get through this time I am going to attempt with drug therapy.

<TITLE> Strat bridge pickup too bright- looking for something a little warmer </TITLE>
<DATE> 2013-01-09 00:26:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi, I have a 1998 mexican 50s stratocaster that I have replaced the pickups on a few years ago. I am very happy with the sound, other than the bridge pickup being much brighter than the neck and middle (sucks that this is the only pickup that the tone control does not affect.) I installed dimarzio area pickups in their recommended configuration: 58 in the neck, 67 in the middle, and 61 in the bridge. Like i said, the bridge is waaay to bright compared to the others; often i have to re-eq my amp or gain pedals to compensate for this, and it's kind of a pain. I am looking at the new paul gilbert injector pickup as a replacement, because i do want a slightly thicker sound out of my bridge as well as a bit less treble. I have also considered the cruiser bridge pickup and the heavy blues 2. I am leaning towards the paul gilbert however because of it's recommendation by dimarzio as a pair for the area pickups. I very much value the distinct sound of the 2 and 4 positions, and i'd like to preserve that sound.

So, If anyone has used any of these pickups or has a recommendation for a replacement, I appreciate any help.

Thanks!  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm going to be taking over at a venue that has graphics on its mains and two of its monitor channels. I'm planning on ringing out both, but I'm also open to the idea of a program that sends frequencies and detects what sort of levels graphics should be set at to avoid feedback. I was mostly going to set the mains eq to taste, but it'd be great if there was something that spat out the different SI frequencies so I could tune from a more scientific standpoint. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Can someone explain the difference between "line" "mic" and "instrument" levels? Hi-Z/Lo-Z? Balanced/Unbalanced? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2012-07-02 18:02:11 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have a basic understanding of this concept, but I need a few things clarified- here's what I know (please correct me where I'm wrong):

The difference between these signals is impedance. "Line" is the strongest signal, i.e. the signal with the lowest impedance. This is "mixer" level. A line level signal going into a mixer should have the input gain trim all the way down. Line is what comes out of your ipod or whatever to drive headphones. "Instrument" is the next highest impedance, and it's what comes out of an electric guitar or electric piano (like a rhodes) and it needs a preamp of some sort to get up to "line" level before being sent to a poweramp and speakers. "Mic" is next and needs even more pregain to be at unity on a mixer.

My main questions:

1. What is "balanced" and what is "unbalanced"? i've heard that you need a "balanced" 1/4 in cable to run a balanced signal using this sort of connector.

2. What is Hi-Z and Low-Z? I know most 1/4 instrument cables are called "Hi-Z" and XLR cables are "Lo-Z." What about "speaker" 1/4 in cables and Neutrik/Speakon cables?

3. What exactly are the impedance levels in ohms for "Mic" "Instrument" and "Line?" Can I plug an Ipod straight into a poweramp and run speakers without a mixer?

Thanks for your expertise r/audioengineering. I hope this isn't a stupid question. </TEXT>
