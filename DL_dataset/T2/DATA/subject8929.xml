<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi everybody, I watched this short video a long time ago, and I was dumb enough not to save it. Anyway, in the video, the guy simply has a white sheet over his head, and he walks in his garden in front of his night cam. That's basically the video. I think he thought it looked real enough for people to believe there was a ghost in his garden, when in fact the video is hilarious and looks obviously fake. It would really make my day if I could see this video again. Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

It's in french, and it's a way to remember how to spell Nietzsche's name. I wasn't good at understanding philosophy, but at least I was able to spell "Nietzsche" right... </TEXT>

<TEXT> **French**

Je suis arriv  Paris pour la premire fois il y a un an. Nous tions en 1899, l't de l'amour. J'ignorai tout du Moulin Rouge... Le monde avait t balay par la Rvolution Bohme et j'avais voyag depuis Londres afin d'y participer. Sur une colline non loin de Paris, il y avait le village de Montmartres. Ce n'tait pas ce que mon pre avait dit -un village peccamineux- mais le centre du monde Bohme. Musiciens, peintres, crivains. On les connaissait sous le nom des "Enfants de la Rvolution". Oui, j'en tais arriv  vivre sans le sous. J'en tais arriv  crire sur la vrit, la beaut, la libert et ce en quoi je croyais le plus, l'amour.

Toujours cette ridicule obsession avec l'amour ! Mais il n'y avait qu'un problme : je n'ai jamais t amoureux.

<TEXT> I thought it would be a "so bad it's good" movie, but no, it was more of a bad movie. Except for the CGI. The CGI seems to have been made by a three-year-old, the characters are not interesting, the plot is full of incoherences (for instance, at the beginning, there's a girl saying she would never, ever use a gun, because she doesn't know how to use one... But who do we see a couple minutes later, using a gun almost PERFECTLY? The same girl). I watched this movie for a good laugh, which didn't really happen, but at least I ended up having good material to write a review of the movie. So, yeah. Here's the link of the trailer (the only full movie I found on YouTube was in french, though): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v90XL4PP6aE </TEXT>

<TEXT> On the last day of Junior High, in 2015, I handed a letter I had written to a teacher who had changed my life, and whom I had known since 2011. It was the last day, so she allowed the pupils in the class to talk together and play. She read the letter. Later, when it was time to say goodbye forever, and as I was about to leave the class for the very last time, she put her hand on my shoulder and told me:

"You're gonna go far..."

This quote stuck with me ever since. I miss this teacher... I'm so grateful to have met her. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The year was 2011, if I remember well. At the time, I was 11. I had known a guy for a couple years, and ever since we'd met, I'd fallen in love with him. On the last day of school, as we were together sitting on the lawn, I decided I would tell him about my love for him. I said: "Loc, I love someone..." I was FINALLY ready to tell him. He stayed silent for ten seconds or so, and asked: "Really? Who?" And the only thing I said was: "No... I mean, you probably don't know him..." I still regret it to this day. I keep wondering what my life would've been if I'd told him "I love you", instead of telling him a lie because I was a shy coward. I know he probably would've said he wasn't interested or something, but dammit, I should've tried. I missed my opportunity to tell him I loved him, and the opportunity to live a cute love story. And, most importantly, the opportunity to have another life. I was only 11, so I didn't know much about love, but still. I made a promise to myself: if I'm ever in this situation ever again, I won't try to hide my feelings. One regret is enough. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. I'd buy a house, I'd offer some money to my best friend, and I'd travel around the World.
2. I don't really watch tv shows, but I like Brooklyn nine-nine and SNL (does it count as a tv show?) because it's funny.
3. The 2000's. I was just a kid back then, and I didn't have to worry about anything. Ah, the good old days...
4. I don't think it has changed that much, unfortunately.
5. A rapper named Diam's. She gave me the desire to sing and to write my own songs, and it's a pity she left. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm 19 and I'm at least 75% sure to have seen Geedis before. The first thing I thought when I saw the stickers was "Well... I know him..." Made me think about three characters: one from Fraggle Rocks (the big hairy creature), Maurice Sandak's characters and maybe Claude Ponti's, but the style isn't that similar. I must have been 7-8 when I first saw Geedis (or something similar). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Has anyone seen Jimmy V. lately? He just had won the title of "greatest employee" of our bookstore, and now he's missing. His wife (Anita V.) told me he was sick, but I went to his home and there was a piece of paper with some sort of "code" on it. All the doors and windows were locked, one was even locked with a padlock. I think there's something weird going on. Remember when Terrence L. went missing, a couple months ago? He lived down the streets, near Jimmy's house. Still hasn't been found.

<TEXT> This is the strangest dream I've ever had. Normally, I don't write my dreams down, but this one was so weird I just needed to.

 #x200B;

There was kind some sort of wake with dead people in furry suits. One of them was on an hospital bed, and the other ones were on chairs (and one was still alive). There was a stage and a door. Behind the door, there were people I didn't know (except my mother and the actor Michael Keaton. I saw interview of him lately, that might be why he was in my dream). A young woman told me she was a "leaver" and asked me to "help her" (I assumed it was about the wake). This girl looked very sad. I felt like crying. The first thing I thought was that this girl was about to kill herself. The woman said I probably wouldn't help, but I said : "Well, I must pay tribute to them, so..." After that, I went back to the other room (the one with dead people in it) and the stage was smaller and I thought I was about to fall. So I decided to go back to the other room, where there also was a stage. Now, chairs were in circle on it, and everybody was sitting, not saying anything. I couldn't see the other people's faces, as if it wasn't important. The only people I could clearly see were my mother and the unknown girl, whom I had never seen before in my life. As I was about to join the group, I woke up. When I woke up, I felt the urge to cry. I don't even know why.

I rarely dream, but when I dream, boy is it strange... </TEXT>

<TEXT> A really good friend I had started bullying me and tried to physically and mentally hurt me, and I decided I didn't need this kind of negativity in my life. I haven't talked to him since. But on the last day of high-school, I wrote him a letter to get things off my chest and move on for good, and a friend of mine handed it to him. I needed to let him know what I'd never said. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, I'm not a professional, but I can try. In my video, I re-adjusted the light (which was a "normal" light) with a software. On Adobe Premiere I used the Green Matrix effect and I changed the color to a grey-ish color. I don't know if that helps, I don't know anything about cinema and lights, but my teacher helped me. About the shots: don't make them too long. If they're too long, the suspense is gone. I had to remove at least 3 minutes of what I had previously filmed. Also, there's a way to download Adobe Premiere on phones, if I remember well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I ask myself how I want to be remembered. And the answer is always the same : I want to be remembered as a girl whose passion was to write and create worlds and characters. Life is way too short to hesitate. We only have one life, but we have millions of dreams. Which is unfair, I must admit. But if I had to choose only one dream to fulfil, it would be this one :  I want my name on the cover of a book, and nobody will be able to achieve this dream for me, but me, myself and I. I want my name and my writing to outlive me.
This is what I tell myself when I'm about to give up. And, believe me... It helps. :-) </TEXT>

r/lostmedia IS NOT about finding things you do not recall the title of, but for media that don't exist anymore. It is not that hard to read the sidebar, is it it ? Moreover, the first rule is:   
"1) THIS IS NOT TIP OF MY TONGUE. We are not here to find something you don't remember. This is an archive to find for known pieces of media that are otherwise completely lost. All posts related to finding something you don't remember will be removed immediately on sight."

How come about 97% of posts in this subreddit are about "I don't remember..."? This is so annoying. </TEXT>

Edit : There is a name, but I can't read it. Waron ? Warton ? Worton ? Also, wasn't there rumors about a man hiding a strange movie reel in an old house ? My house was built in 1900. Does anybody in this town knows about these rumors and the name Waron/Warton ? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Snoop Dogg's Hood of Horror (2006?) : Before watching it, I thought I wouldn't enjoy this movie, but surprisingly, I did (my favorite segment is the last one). A little too gory, though.
Beetlejuice (1988) : A really good and funny movie. Tim Burton has always been my favorite director. Good actors, good story. The scene where the non-deceased people are possessed and end up dancing around the table is my favorite scene. 
I'd recommand these movies. But between the two, I believe I liked Beetlejuice better. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A couple years ago I remember watching a Doctor House episode, and I've been trying to find it again, to no aveil. All I remember is the end : at the end, we learn that the previously hospitalized person that the doctors had just freed was a cannibal searched by the police, and that was why he was sick or something. Does it ring a bell to you? Thanks in advance. I don't remember the year, but I believe it was one of the last seasons, but I'm not even sure about that. I'd love to see it again. If you know where I could watch it for free, it would be amazing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Opration Bugs Bunny, by director Michel Hassan. It was a TV special that was shown on the France 2 Channel in 1997. The reason why I want to find it is because I think I saw it. But thing is, I was born in 2000. It might certainly be a "false memory". But still, I really want it found. Michel Hassan is on Facebook, but I can't send him a message, because I don't have Facebook. Anyway, I think that the director of Opration Bugs Bunny, just like the director of The Wire, has no clue it's lost, and still has a copy. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [TOMT] Movie based on a Stephen King's story (or book?) [Movie] [Unknown release date] </TITLE>
<DATE> 2019-05-14 17:40:14 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello. A couple years ago, I read about a movie that had been made based on a story written by Stephen King (might have been a whole book, but I doubt it). A few weeks ago, I remembered the said movie and wanted to see it. But I don't know the title and when I search on Wikipdia, nothing shows up. 
The movie is about a man who drinks a rotten beer and is turned into a monster (I saw a trailer once, a long time ago, and if I remember well, the monstre looked like a viscous fly of some sort, but I'm not sure). Now, I know Stephen King has sometimes used the pen name Richard Bachman, but searching for this name online wasn't helpful. I really want to see this movie. Does anybody know what movie I'm talking about? </TEXT>

How are you going to send me the mp3 copy of the finished song? On Reddit? It'd be a way for me to put the final song on my YouTube channel. I'll credit you anyway, so don't worry.

<TEXT> This didn't really happen to me, but to my family, while we were on a vacation (but I nearly got scammed too). It happened in Camargue. We were visiting and suddenly we realized our grandmother was "missing". We turned around and saw her with an old woman (a "Gitane"). As we were trying to reach for my Grandma, several Gitanes arrived and took us to the doors of the Cathedral. I was 14 or 15 at the time, and I was terrified. The woman took a needle out and told me she was going to perform fortune-telling. She said she needed a banknote to do it. I gave her a banknote. I couldn't escape her, because she was preventing me to do so with her arms. She began to tell me Barnum-like things ("Some days you feel sad, some days you feel great" or this kind of bullsh\*t). After the "fortune-telling", she told me she had the right to keep the banknote, for she had predicted my future and my past (she hadn't). Suddenly, my father arrived behind her and told me: "If you don't want to give it to her, do not give it to her". The Gitane, surprised, gave him a dark gaze and gave me my banknote back (probably because she didn't want my father to punch her in the face) but not before whispering "Your life is gonna suck and you'll never achieve anything" into my ear. So, I wasn't the most "scammed" person of the family. My mother, aunt, and grandmother, have all been raised with the thought that Gitanes were witches that could bring unhappiness and sadness in your life by performing some kind of witchcraft. They all ended up giving about 65 Euros EACH, which is a lot. One of the worst things concerning this scam is that, in order for people not to go and tell the police, these Gitanes avoid being seen through security cameras, and bring people to the doors of the Cathedral, because it's the only way for them to avoid cameras. Please, be careful if you visit Camargue one day, mainly if you visit this place. You might lose a lot of money (these women are truly vicious and could do anything to get what they want). </TEXT>

<TEXT> One day, as I was in my mother's car, there was a really bad driver before us. He didn't care about the other people on the road. Suddenly, the guy who was behind our car began to drive, and stopped next to the bad driver's car. We thought he was another bad driver. Or wanted to fight with the other guy.  Suddenly, he went to the bad driver's window, took off his black jacket, sticked out his chest, and showed what was written on it: "police".

It was really surprising. When the bad driver drove off, he was driving slower. I believe he understood the lesson... I know it doesn't sound badass, but when I witnessed it, it truly was. </TEXT>

Alors que les annes passent, je commence  comprendre de plus en plus que ce sont les bndictions les plus communes de notre quotidien qui devraient nous rendre les plus reconnaissants. Ce sont les choses qui remplissent nos vies de confort et nos curs de joie - le simple air pur  respirer et la force de le respirer; la simple chaleur et l'abri d'une maison; la simple nourriture qui nous donne de la force; le soleil brillant lors d'un jour froid; et une brise frache lors d'un jour chaud.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Abandoning ideas </TITLE>
<DATE> 2019-03-14 13:57:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello,

Everytime  I begin the writing of a novel, I never finish it. I always have ideas  for another novel, and each time, I believe my second idea is better  than the initial one, and I abandon the first idea altogether. Do you  have any advice? My dream is to write a book. I don't lack ideas, no, but there's something preventing me from writing a whole novel. I don't want to waste my  life searching the "better idea", like I do everytime, because I know I  probably came across it once, and just decided to abandon it. By "better  idea", I mean a story I would've written easily and would've carried in  my heart. Any opinion and advice?

Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

Silly: Juice that accompanies roast or chicken
Better: Butter

Enough: Parmesan

Great: Breadcrumbs

Lion: Coca-Cola
Lunch: Ham and cheese (croque-monsieur, maybe)
Topple: Apple.
Lexical-Gustatory synesthesia is super rare. I think it's, like, 1% of the World Population who has it. For me, it began when I first learnt how to read and write. Until a few months ago, I was not aware I had synesthesia. I didn't even know it was a thing. I thought it was normal to taste words while writing and reading them.
What about you? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Write a song that truly touches you emotionally. You'll probably sing more intensively and beautifully, if you can *feel* the words. If you choose a song that doesn't really touch you emotionally, you'll be less eager to deliver the words, if you catch my drift. Everytime I participate to one of these shows, I rehearse a lot too, and I do the thing I mentionned to you earlier. 

I hope it'll help. </TEXT>

O mes parents sont enterrs

Puis, toute la journe, j'imagine mon pre se relever

"Essayes d'imaginer une vie sans souci du temps. C'est probablement impossible. Tu connais le mois, l'anne, le jour de la semaine. Il y a une horloge sur ton mur ou sur le tableau de bord de ta voiture. Tu as un emploi du temps, un calendrier, une heure pour le dner ou pour un film. Cependant, tout autour de toi, le temps n'est pas un souci. Les oiseaux ne sont pas en retard. Un chien ne consulte pas sa montre. Les cerfs ne sont pas tracasss par les anniversaires passs. Il n'y a que l'homme qui mesure le temps. Il n'y a que l'homme qui sonne l'heure. Et, pour cette raison, il n'y a que l'homme qui souffre de cette peur paralysante qu'aucune autre crature n'endure. Une peur du temps qui passe." </TEXT>

I can taste sounds/songs/words, color words and numbers, and to me, every day of the week and every month have their own colors. When I talked about it to my mother, she told me it was kindda weird. But I don't recall how I learnt I was a synesthete.  </TEXT>

I'm currently writing a four-episode series. In episode 2, there will be scene in which a torture occurs. I don't want to show everything, I want the audience to "imagine" what happens, from time to time. I don't know how to make this torture scene sound and look awfully painful. I'm not very experienced for it's only my second short. If anyone could help a little, it would mean a lot to me. Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

Des ampoules sur un gteau d'anniversaire. 

La diffrence que cela ferait! 

Branchez-les et faites un voeu;

Puis dtendez-vous et allumez! (?)

Plus de fume

Ni de salissures de cire

Pour embter les invits.

Mais Grand-Pre dit: "Ce n'est pas pareil! 

O est la magie?

O est la flamme?

Pour que tes vux se ralisent

Il faut souffler des bougies!"

<TEXT> Maybe the book One Day would do. It was written by David Nicholls. It's about two friends living their lives; they meet, they leave, the reunite, etc. It's about time passing by. I love this book.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I dunno if it counts as a mystery book, but maybe you should read Filth, by Irvine Welsh. It's a good book, I think. It's about a policeman who tries to solve a murder. I can't really say what it's about, for I would give out all of the story. It has suspense in it, though. A movie was made after the novel. It's a good film too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, I dunno if this will help, but I found a website on which they talked about the show. I could not test if the links work, however, because apparently, it's "not available in my region", so I don't know, maybe the links don't work anymore. This is the only thing I found. But I don't really think this will help.

<TEXT> Hi, do you remember any line of dialogue? That would help. I tried to find the commercial, but to no avail. All I found was really old commercials (one was from 1988).  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh my God, I've seen so many bad movies that I don't really know which was the worst of them. Philippe Clair's movies are "so bad they're good", and I think one of my favorite worst movies of his is *Le Fhrer en folie*, a "comedy" released in 1974, in France. If you're french-speaking, and if you're interested, this movie is on YouTube.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> [Lost] Opration Bugs Bunny </TITLE>

<TEXT> Hi everyone, 

Yesterday, as I was on the Lost Media Wiki website, I read something that reminded me of something I had seen when I was a little girl. I live in France, by the way. And the movie I'm talking about was made in France. It was a Christmas Special. I'm sure I saw it, but it's barely possible, for it was only seen once on TV, in 1997, and I was born in 2000. When I asked my mother about the movie, she told me it reminded her of something too. It was about Santa Claus being sad, and the Looney Tunes had to cheer him up. Here's the link to the Lost Media Wiki page:  [https://lostmediawiki.com/Op%C3%A9ration\_Bugs\_Bunny\_(lost\_French\_live-action/animated\_Christmas\_TV\_special;\_1997)](https://lostmediawiki.com/Op%C3%A9ration_Bugs_Bunny_(lost_French_live-action/animated_Christmas_TV_special;_1997)) 

I searched on the Internet, but I didn't find any other information about the movie. There's an [Allocin.com](https://Allocin.com) page about it, but it only tells which actors played in it (Michel Galabru, Lio; Etc...). Only two screenshots are available. There's an article too, but it's in French (Here it is:  [https://www.liberation.fr/medias/1997/12/24/notre-selection-operation-bugs-bunny-france-2-20h45-special-noel-tf1-france-2-france-3-m6\_223110](https://www.liberation.fr/medias/1997/12/24/notre-selection-operation-bugs-bunny-france-2-20h45-special-noel-tf1-france-2-france-3-m6_223110)). It had a Roger Rabit's vibe to it. I might have never seen this movie, and maybe it was another live-action Bugs Bunny Christmas Special I saw when I was little, but when I described it to my mother, she said she remembered it a little bit, just like I did. I'd really like to see this movie again (or to see it for the first time, for I don't even know if I actually saw it at all). Can someone help me, please?... Unfortunately, it seems to be gone forever. Maybe I should send a letter to TF1? I don't know what to do.

I'm sorry for the long post. Thanks for reading it. Have a nice day!  </TEXT>
